   "comments": [
    "I became much more conscious of my bad sleep habits, and the empirical knowledge I gained helped me to change my lifestyle. I have a much better understanding of the connections between mental health and sleep.",
    "Almost nothing",
    "Learned about the science of sleep, psychology of sleep disorders, and about dreams! I didn't know anything about the science of sleep before, and feel like I definitely have a baseline understanding of the science - but it's not too science-y at all.",
    "I learned about the different stages of sleep, sleep disorders, and possible treatments. This class gave a great overview into many different facets of sleep.",
    "I learned a lot about sleep from a lot of different perspectives. I have no taught others and been able to diagnose them with sleep disorders which is really cool.",
    "I learned a lot about the processes behind sleep in terms of biology and neurology, I learned about circadian rhythms, how to better improve my sleep, about sleep in art\/literature\/media, the effects of sleep deprivation, different sleep disorders, and the history of sleep-related things (achievements, disorders, discoveries, in writing).",
    "I learned about why sleep is important on a more molecular level, and I gained skills to explain to myself and others practical ways to implement better sleeping habits in my daily life.",
    "Learned a lot about what happens to our bodies when we sleep and the social views of sleep throughout history",
    "The science behind sleep, sleep health, and how to improve your sleep.",
    "A broad overview on sleep, from the art and history of it, to the science behind it.",
    "Basic knowledge about sleep, both biologically and in public health contexts",
    "A good overview of sleep as a scientific concept, but also some good knowledge to improve my own sleep.",
    "I know a LOT about sleep hygiene and the biology of sleep! I also feel more knowledgeable about sleep deprivation. This course really changed the way I think about sleep and its importance to personal wellbeing.",
    "Pure chaos, very disorganized, and definitely not a gut. Only take this if you absolutely need to.",
    "I, like many people in this course I think, did not have a big science background before this course, and certainly not a cognitive science background. Thankfully, the lessons dealt out lots of easy to grasp but still revelatory information that the professors helped us study. So, I learned about how sleep varies among different organisms, the characteristics of healthy versus unhealthy sleep, the sleep academic literature landscape, sleep's influence on culture, and so forth. In short, I learned a lot and might just study sleep some more now.",
    "Overall understanding of the neuroscience and social science themes related to sleep.",
    "I learned about the psychobiology of sleep and its systems.",
    "I learned about the ways that not sleeping can affect your health, and I learned in an interdisciplinary manner about the intersections of cognitive science and art.",
    "I received an introduction to the science behind sleep need. We also discussed the following at an elementary level: how sleep is represented in art\/literature, how to have better sleep habits, the effects of sleep deprivation on public health.",
    "This class has changed my life. One month after this class started, I went from sleeping 5hrs per night to at least 7hrs. I learned more than just the well-known fact that sleep is bad for you. I now understand in more detail how sleep affects the brain and body and how sleep deprivation is disastrous for health and safety. I also learned practical habits on how to improve the quality of my sleep in order to help fight the effects of certain sleep disorders such as insomnia.",
    "Knowledge: A lot of information about how the brain processes memory during sleep, how several parts of the brain relate to sleep and memory.\r\n\r\nSkills: I can understand scientific papers about sleep. \r\n\r\nInsights: All-nighters literally aren't useful, you're actually just taking time off your life.",
    "I learned a lot about the need for sleep in humans, animals, and plants. A lot of biological information about how circadian rhythms, etc. work while also learning about how sleep is depicted in various areas of the humanities.",
    "I learned a lot about the phases of sleep and what goes on within them. I also learned about sleep across species and time periods, and the effects of sleep deprivation.",
    "Overview of the neurobiological mechanisms involved in sleep and major sleep disorders. Skillwise, refined my ability to read and interpret scientific papers.",
    "All aspects of sleep and how it affects life",
    "Learned about how important sleep is. this class has changed my nights!",
    "A really deep understanding of human and animal sleep cycles and the problems that can arise from not getting enough sleep. The course in many ways runs against the Yale culture of studying all night and encourages students to think more critically about personal health and habits.",
    "I learned about the science of sleep, but also the ways in which it relates to art and history. I learned about functions of my mind and body that I'd never been aware of before.",
    "I learned about the importance of sleep and how it affects our health and well-being.",
    "I learned about sleep processes, the role sleep plays in health and the importance of sleep both on a biological and more global level."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is very practical and can really make a difference in students' lives. One weakness is the over-emphasis on sleep in art and the history of sleep medicine in examinations and lectures. Though that was interesting and perhaps made the class feel more familiar and accessible to humanities students, it was ultimately less interesting than the science of sleep.",
    "Strengths: extremely flexible - the essay and project can be as creative as you like\r\nweaknesses: very little structure, don't feel like I learned much",
    "Strengths: an interdisciplinary approach to learning about sleep. For example, we learned about some historical thinkers on sleep, and art that features sleep. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were sometimes really unclear - we didn't know what we had to know for the tests.",
    "The main strength of the course was that the material was very accessible to people with all levels of science backgrounds. I think one weakness was that sometimes we were given two conflicting statistics and did not know which was correct.",
    "I thought that sections felt very pointless. Class members recapped the readings, which people could read on their own. I think you could replace section with more speakers which I really enjoyed. I also thought that some information presented was inconsistent sometimes we would be taught two things at once. i think the questions on the exam were often random and had little to do with what we learned. There was a question on the first exam that we learned the information on during the second half of the course and there was a question which had a wrong answer that we did not get points back for. I think the exams should be redone since it seems like they reuse them to actually reflect what has been taught from year to year.",
    "Strengths are that this course was greatly facilitated for understanding for non-science individuals. The professors were also very accessible. Weakness is maybe not having a final exam, presentation\/project, and a final research paper all due. Although they were manageable, it was difficult to balance all of the requirements during the last week of class and reading period with other courses.",
    "Strengths: Interesting, accessible & relevant science class! The professors also tried to make sure that students could combine their interests with the curriculum, which was great.\r\nWeaknesses: The pacing of the class felt off at times, and there was definitely a lot of repetition, especially at the end. I also think that assignments should be better spread out throughout the semester, since having three assignments due in the last week\/during finals was too much (especially since the only real assignment we had before then was a midterm!) It would also be nice to think more about the social factors of sleep -- I would have appreciated spending more time on how we can structurally change society to make it possible to sleep more, since I think choice alone isn't the biggest factor behind the sleep deprivation epidemic. (I.e. Does socioeconomic status affect sleep levels? How do single parents compare to the average population? etc.)",
    "This course is very strong in its engagement with material and discussion sections. It is also very accessible to students of different academic backgrounds because of the class discussions made to clarify information we read in the scientific literature.",
    "Very interesting class. It was very straightforward and organized",
    "Strengths: low workload, fairly interesting material, take if you need a science credit\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some lectures were dry and repetitive",
    "I wish we could've focused a little bit more on the science behind sleep, but overall, really great class that felt accessible to anyone.",
    "I would not have been accepted into this course had it remained a seminar, and I'm grateful I had the opportunity to take it. That said, I think that the material is much better suited to a seminar than lecture, and I think it should return to being a seminar.",
    "Great depth of knowledge covered. Also really great guest lectures and content that made sleep interesting. In terms of improvement, perhaps more guidance and information on the structure of the papers and final project.",
    "This course would function much better as a larger lecture class--the discussion sections did not work particularly well.",
    "It was not always clear what level of scientific depth we should know for the tests. Sometimes it was very broad and the test would have more specific concepts. Otherwise, sharing  the readings in section was a great setup and the guest speakers kept things interesting.",
    "Strengths: The instructors! Dr. Kryger and Dr. Baddam are devoted to their students' learning. They incorporated a variety of materials and assignments to make the class engaging, and made lecture fun. I looked forward to every lecture, because they did a great job of making the content accessible to students. The guest lectures were also amazing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought that having an exam, a creative project, AND a final paper at the end of the semester was overkill. It would have been much more helpful to have spaced out the assignments a bit more evenly throughout the semester. Also, the quiz content was kind of wack. Some of the multiple choice questions went into an unnecessary level of detail. A few of them asked about the years that certain discoveries in sleep research were made, which seemed...unnecessary and relatively irrelevant? Other questions covered content that we had covered for maybe a minute in lecture. Lastly, the discussion sections were basically pointless.",
    "Strengths: Science credit.\r\nWeaknesses: Pretty much everything else. Class was extremely disorganized. We had one section with a faculty member who literally had never even seen the syllabus before and we never saw him again. Exams were all multiple choice based on random, irrelevant minutia from the lecture. The grading structure also makes no sense. More than 70% of your grade is determined after the last class based on the final exam, final project, and final paper. The problem sets listed on the syllabus dont even exist, and the presentations in section do not count towards the grade. I would be shocked if this class is allowed to be taught again.",
    "Strengths: A real diversity of assignments that build your knowledge up about sleep in many different ways. Wonderful, kind and knowledgeable professors + TAs. And in general I think there was a nice sense of community in the class. And the guest speakers were great!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: nothing that really comes to mind, I think? Maybe spend more time explaining why we start with art and culture because I think that threw off some students.",
    "The course is well-organized and very informative. The papers required for reading can perhaps use some more contextual introduction during the lectures.",
    "This course about every other week breaks into a smaller section for the class time. This section was extremely helpful. The lectures were much less helpful. However, some of the guest lectures were very interesting. I think some of the \"teaching\" could have been done in sections for harding concepts rather than sections being merely about analyzing studies.",
    "The majority of the class was good. There should not have been three finals. Additionally, when doing presentations of final projects, it's not reasonable to expect people to stay 45 minutes after class.",
    "The science-based lectures in class could perhaps be better connected to our readings and our field trips related to art.",
    "The main weakness of this course is ambiguity regarding grading and lack of preparation materials for the two main quizzes.",
    "The course was relatively stressful in the sense that the material covered wasn't overwhelmingly challenging. I liked that the course allowed students to explore their interests in humanities and the social sciences in combination with the study of sleep--for example, many students' group projects and final paper showcased the arts somehow. The instructors (Dr. Baddam and Dr. Kryger) were also very kind, flexible people.\r\n\r\nHowever, the course wasn't always well-organized. In my opinion, we did not receive clear guidelines on what the group projects and final papers should look like. Many of the class' assignments were also stacked near the end of the course: at midterm, we had a sit-down exam; then right before finals, we had a sit-down exam and a group-project due in the same week; and during finals period, we had a 10-page paper due. I wish that the course provided better guidance on the expectations of our assignments and spreaded out the assignment due dates.",
    "Strengths: really relevant for college students who need to sleep more!! Perfect amount of science for non-science majors; final project was really fun to create something that each student found particularly interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: assignments should be more spread out (too much to have a final paper, project, and cumulative exam); science papers were challenging to read (yet their purpose was more to expose us to the material than assign very hard readings)",
    "Strengths: Really interesting content, lots of flexibility with papers and projects to let us be creative, the professors definitely cared about helping us learn the material, the TF's were kickass. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was not as much guidance on assignments so we were lost most of the time. Classmates were very quick to judge the professors so it wasn't exactly a collaborative class environment.",
    "Overall the course was enjoyable and well-organized. The only suggestions I would recommend would to be to make the final project due earlier in the semester so that students dont get overwhelmed with the number of assignments at the very end of the course, and to make it clearer what material is going to be tested on the midterm (such as by releasing a topic guide).",
    "Could be improved with slightly slower or more in-depth explanations of the science behind major concepts, because there was more science on the exams than we focused on in lectures",
    "The lecture content was very engaging and I really enjoyed the incorporation of guest lecturers. The weekly group discussions helped break up the lecture format and allowed for students to engage with the week's material in a more personal and meaningful way. The instructors did a good job of addressing sleep in a multi-disciplinary style that was accessible to students from many different fields. At times, lectures were given too fast for me to take thorough notes on, but the slides were very helpful and I was able to review any information that I missed in class later on. I really enjoyed the amount of freedom associated with the group project which allowed every student to demonstrate skill in their own field of expertise, but think that the final class meeting dedicated to project presentations could have been better structured. There was not a specific order that students were asked to present in or time limit posed on presentations, which was very overwhelming for me and caused the class period to extend for about an hour past the normal class end time. However, the class was a great experience overall and I am very glad to have had the opportunity to take it!",
    "Not much instruction on what is required for assignments. Should be much clearer",
    "Strengths: passionate and knowledgeable instructor; you can tailor assignments to your own interests; beginning is very accessible to humanities students \r\nWeaknesses: got very technical near the end of the course, which might not be a drawback for everyone but was for me",
    "Strengths include interesting subject matter, mixed lecture\/discussion format, positive classroom environment, and low, low workload. Weaknesses include tricky tests, often poor organization re: assignments and exams, and LOTS of work (exam, project, and paper) at the end of the semester.",
    "Fascinating, interdisciplinary, perfect",
    "Strengths were that the class was super engaging and the content was very interesting. \r\nIt could be improved by going to the sleep lab and learning what it takes to be a sleep doctor. I want to learn more current studies in the field",
    "The course was really well-organized and provided students with a great deal of information about sleep. Some of the content was repetitive, such as discussions about the consequences of sleep deprivation. The guest speakers were fantastic and provided fresh perspective on the topic.",
    "strengths: incredibly interdisciplinary, welcoming and nurturing of non-STEM students, huge effort made by professors to make the course material and assignments as engaging as possible for each individual student \r\n\r\nweaknesses: the discussion sections felt aimless and poorly organized  I never really learned anything there, and felt the time could have been better structured or used for something more productive. also, it would be much easier on students in terms of stress levels to space out the final project\/paper\/exam, because it was a lot to be working on for one class during finals.",
    "The material was very interesting, and I learned a lot about sleep, the science of sleep, and the importance of sleep. However, it felt like the second half of the course (after midterm quiz 1) was basically a repeat of things we learned in the first half of the course, which made it difficult to stay engaged with the material. Additionally, discussion sections were not very useful or engaging. Rather than discussing the readings, assigned discussion leaders just summarized the readings for the other students, which ended up being very unidirectional and didactic. Lastly, I felt this course suffered greatly from having so many assignments. A lecture course should not have two midterms, a final paper, a final project, AND a mandatory discussion section. Out of all these assignments, the most beneficial one was probably the creative final project, which provided students with the opportunity to engage creatively with the material. However, the final paper was completely unnecessary because the class never really focused on how to write a scientific research paper and just felt like busy work.",
    "The course was great and I really enjoyed it! I liked the lectures but I wish the seminars were more structured.",
    "This course is well structured to give students who are not strong in the sciences an introduction to sleep and the issues surrounding it."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely would, especially if you want to improve your health. It really changed the way I thought about my health and the impact of sleep on my life. I am sleeping much better and longer now, and feeling much better for it.",
    "If you're looking for a science gut, then sure. I was actually hoping to learn something while receiving my SC credit, and I'm not sure that I did. There might be other SC credits that are a better balance between gut\/learning.",
    "I would recommend to a humanities major looking for a science credit",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone (especially if you are not a STEM person). It is very accessible and you learn a lot of tips about how to sleep better.",
    "I definitely would because it improved my sleep and the teachers truly cared about us and our well being. They were always willing to meet and stayed after to answer questions. Doing the projects were fun and informative and so was seeing the projects of others. I learned a lot about science without panicking about scientific terms I did not know. At times, the presentations went too fast but usually they took time to make sure everyone was learning.",
    "I would recommend this course to any individual wishing to obtain a science credit that is not majoring in stem\/science. It is very interesting and teaches how to approach sleep from a different perspective.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It's a great way to be constantly reminded why treating your sleep schedule well in college and life in general is important. Also, this course is a good introduction into certain psycho-pathologies associated with sleep for those interested in that area of study.",
    "Yes! Especially if you need a science credit or are interested in how sleep works. I thought the class was pretty easy and fun",
    "If you are a humanities person and need a science credit, take this class. Fairly interesting material.",
    "Yes!! Such a great science credit. It's really actually changed my perspective towards sleep, I now actually prioritize sleeping in my life. So grateful I took this class; I know that it'll really benefit me in the long-term because I'm now sold on the importance of sleeping. Professors Baddam and Kryger are great and clearly care about the students. The only thing is I wish we could have gone a little bit deeper into the science aspect of things, but overall, it was a great class that feels super accessible to anyone at Yale.",
    "Yes, it's a great course. I hope it's a seminar again though.",
    "Definitely if you want an easy science!",
    "Yes! Especially great for non-STEM people looking for a SC credit.",
    "Yes if you need a science credit.",
    "Yes. For sure one of the most widely applicable science courses you can take, and the content was both interesting and helpful. Meir is the sweetest and just really has a passion for sleep science.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to study for the quizzes! They cover a LOT of content.",
    "No",
    "If you're at all interested in the science of sleep and its other ramifications on society: yes! If not, then probably look elsewhere.",
    "For any student concerned with health and sleep health, even if he or she is not involved in scientific studies in their own majors, this course is both an enjoyable and instructive experience.",
    "This class is an interesting and fairly easy science credit. If you need one, take it!",
    "Excellent course to take to fulfill a science requirement",
    "I think this is a good science credit for people who lean towards the arts\/humanities. I liked that there were opportunities to do artistic projects for the class.",
    "The course might not have a large workload, but I struggle to recommend it strongly for two reasons. Firstly, there's a high degree of ambiguity regarding the grading of this class. The quizzes test material discussed in class but in very obscure ways that aren't actually practiced in class. The instructors spend almost no time actually helping students prepare for the quizzes in a way that is meaningful or helpful. Secondly, there aren't a lot of great opportunities for feedback. You basically just submit assignments and receive grades without actually hearing back about how you could improve.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are looking for a relatively easy science credit and are interested in the arts\/social sciences. (However, beware that there are large assignments for this class near the end of the term).",
    "Absolutely. This class has changed my perspective on health habits and daily routine, beyond just sleep. I believe there should be a compulsory course or training on sleep, health, and nutrition at Yale to encourage students to develop better habits in their daily life.",
    "I would, but it depends on what type of student you are\/what type of class experience you want. I'm a pretty hardcore humanities person so I had a little trouble studying for the first test, but I kept up with the class material and when I bunkered down to study I really understood everything. For my friends who were more STEM-inclined they felt like the science was too easy, and was not commensurate with a college-level science course. If you're willing to learn more watered-down science and want to be creative with your projects and paper, then this is a good class for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if youre a non-STEM major looking for an enjoyable science credit! I feel like I learned a lot without being overwhelmed, and I can honestly say it changed how I look at my own health regarding getting enough sleep. If you dont like rote memorization, however, you probably wont like this class, as memorizing the facts presented in lecture is crucial to doing well on the exams.",
    "Yes, definitely. I took it for a science credit and actually loved my experience and have found myself using what I learned in my every day life - relevant and interesting!",
    "Not really",
    "Yes, if theyre a humanities student looking for a science credit. The opening lectures on art and mythologyand the accompanying field tripare super fun! There are also many opportunities for creative projects. It does get way more technical as time goes on, however.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student looking to fulfill their science credit in a reasonably interesting, low workload capacity. The subject matter is mostly compelling and VERY relevant for Yale students, even though things begin to trail off towards the end and lectures become repetitive. Classroom environment is fun, but not particularly rigorous and I found myself often zoning out of this course while in class and during the rest of the week (it's definitely a fifth class). The professors work somewhat strangely together, but seem to enjoy teaching the class and try to be kind, even though poor organization can undermine this. Overall, a fine to good low-workload science credit (especially compared to other large, impersonal lectures), but definitely a requirement-filler rather than a greater standalone course.",
    "Strongly! One of my favorite classes at Yale so far",
    "Yes! the final projects are so fun!",
    "Yes! If you want to take a Science Credit that seeks to accommodate non-STEM majors, this is the perfect class for you. The issue is relevant to every person on a daily basis, and the professors are extremely kind and approachable.",
    "Yes! The other intro yale science\/math courses that my friends and I have taken often feel like they don't actually consider the interests and strengths of students in the humanities. This is the first one I've found that felt like it was designed with a student like me in mind!",
    "I honestly don't know if I'd recommend this course to someone else. While the lectures were typically engaging, especially the guest speakers, it did feel like the second half of the course was just a repeat of the first half and was thus kind of boring. I also think the sheer amount of assignments makes this less of an easy-going science credit than it appears on paper. I would say shop the class but be mindful of the workload (which is heavily staggered towards the end of the semester) and really consider whether you want to be talking about sleep for a whole semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because it stresses the importance of sleep and everyone should learn about it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking for a science credit that is interesting and has practical benefits."
