                "My essay writing improved dramatically under Professor Vogel's guidance and I gained a greater appreciation for and understanding of classic literature.",
                "I developed close reading skills and a better ability to write papers well.",
                "This course helped me develop as a critical reader through our group discussions of the texts. I also think I've developed as a writer throughout the course of the semester.",
                "This course enabled me to grow significantly in my close-reading skills. We read each text, whether it was a poem, essay, speech, or novel, very closely. Professor Vogel utilized slides to prompt our class with particular passages and\/or lines, and we spent significant class time analyzing the layers of meanings behind particular words or phrases and applying those meanings to the larger text. I have found that even when I am reading a text for fun, not for any particular class, I read with a far more critical eye and I glean more meaning from reading now than I did before taking this course.\r\n\r\nI also developed my writing capabilities by taking this course. We wrote three essays throughout the course, and we received extensive feedback on each which has enabled me to make positive changes in my critical thinking and writing. Our essays involved prompts related to the close-reading and critical analysis work we did in class. Thus, I am now more able to both think detail-oriented and glean much meaning from a few words and to think on a larger scale and apply meanings from close-readings to the larger text, reflect on the impact of the text on the the historical period and the historical context on the text, and more. \r\n\r\nThis course revealed to me the development of the societal psyche; how as one human body our minds have changed and developed and progressed and regressed. I have learned how to trace tensions and conflicts today to issues faced throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. I have also learned that we all, even the most famous writers such as Walt Whitman, are human. Visiting the Beinecke Library and seeing original copies of Leaves of Grass and Moby-Dick, seeing Whitman's eyeglasses, and other such pieces made real to me the humanness of all we read, discussed, and learned this semester.",
                "I gained a pretty amazing understanding of the history and inspirations for American Literature, and the final essay--this task to summarize a work of professional literary analysis then make our own response or addition or negation of that work--was a unique experience for me, despite tens of English courses I've taken. It let me feel like I really did have a voice or something to offer to the literary world.",
                "I learned how to write thoughtful English papers that taught me how to close read, incorporate another academic article into my writing, and to build off of an academic article to write in conversation with their argument. I also learned how to speak in a respectfully critical way during our small seminar like discussions on topics of difficulty spanning categories like race, gender, and national identity. I learned how to parse through extremely dense novels like Invisible man and Moby Dick, learning to pick out the important passages.",
                "Your writing and comprehension skill improve greatly in this class.",
                "I loved the insight I gained from this course about closely reading and analyzing pieces of literature. I found this course really valuable because it taught me to hone my English skills to find meaning in just a few words or lines, deepening my understanding of complicated writing by teaching me how to analyze individual aspects of the text and building this analysis towards a cohesive comprehension. This course made me a much more introspective and keen-eyed reader, and I have found myself looking for significance in every phrase that I read now, from any text. I especially loved how this course taught me about the connections between different American authors, whether they were active at the same time or not. I came to understand American literature as a tapestry of experiences and approaches, both influenced by and influencing historical events.",
                "I loved this class. The syllabus selections were phenomenal and placed so well in succession so that the core ideas continued to build on each other. I developed my writing, critical thinking, and reading skills in this course.",
                "I gained a strong background understanding of American literature. I learned close-reading skills and how to structure a longer, more complicated literary argument than I was able to before.",
                "I learned how to appreciate literature when I initially didnt appreciate it at all. I also learned to how to read closely and slowly.",
                "I developed the ability to engage thoroughly with selected works as well as engage critically with them. I learned how to better write an acedemic paper while also improving the robustness of my reading skills",
                "How to close read and critically think about novels and American literature, how to analyze past novels and apply them to the present to better understand our world",
                "I solidified my analysis skills and learned about ways to stray from the 5-paragraph template. It allowed me to discover my voice as a writer and converse more deeper with the texts at hand.Also, I gained an overview of American literature which was absolutely fascinating!",

            "comments": [
                "The course provided a great survey of American literature while still enabling deep exploration of specific works. The only thing was that I wished we'd taken a bit more time to read Moby Dick, since I ended up having to skim parts of it due to the fast pace we read it.",
                "I think it was a strong overview of American Literature with a wide range of perspectives included.",
                "Although i liked that the course was mostly free-form discussion, I think it could benefit from a little bit more structure in the future to keep us moving through the assigned readings.",
                "The chronological progression of texts made for an interesting analysis of how the mental state of society as a whole has developed and changed, but I found myself burned out from extreme allegory. While the later novels we read, Moby-Dick, Invisible Man, As I Lay Dying, and A Mercy are all great works of literature, reading them successively was tiring. I found that I gained the most from Moby-Dick and Invisible Man, so I think either removing or replacing As I Lay Dying and\/or A Mercy with something more grounding would be beneficial.",
                "Structuring the class on the literary movements of Transcendentalism and Modernism was definitely a smart move. It let me understand the philosophies behind texts, and it made parsing certain styles of writing--like that of Faulkner and Morrison--a lot easier. I think a huge strength of this course was the student engagement, and I think Professor Vogel had a lot to do with that enthusiasm for talking and listening and learning.",
                "Strengths: This course featured some of the best discussion that I have ever participated in. The small size of this class made it so everyone's voice was heard, and the reading list ensured that we were able to examine close to every aspect of the American national identity, without being too heavy in one particular subtopic. You will leave this class feeling like you have a super strong foundation in knowledge of how American literature contributed to the overall literary canon, and you will get a great mixture of short essays, poems, and super long American Odyssey novels.",
                "I think that this course is especially strong in its teaching (I absolutely loved my professor, Shane Vogel). I think that the texts chosen for this course by my professor were very well-selected, since even the brief essays or poems we read by certain authors contributed to my larger understanding of the development of the body of American literature. \r\n\r\nI wish that the course had a bit more time to discuss some of the non-novel texts that we read (like essays by TS Eliot and Gertrude Stein, or poems by Gwendolyn Brooks), although I don't know what texts I would want to cut to make space for these slightly lengthier discussions.",
                "only improvement is that I wish we had been able to speak a little more freely without having to raise hands-- I think people often said things that were on their mind rather than continuing the line of thought introduced by someone else, which made it hard to develop a real flow to each class.",
                "The discussions were extremely fruitful and eyr-opening.",
                "A strength was Professor Vogel: he was a fantastic professor and he really cares about the literature and it shows. One weakness was that sometimes the discussion felt like it was always going a certain direction because he would present his analysis on the literature on the slides and students would agree or disagree.",
                "The course was fantastic. Extremely engaging, the chosen works were phenomenal,",
                "Strengths: very engaging discussions, great Professor, very well chosen novels\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This class was incredible! Professor Vogel chose books for us that are now some of my favorite. He kept us engaged even taking a trip to the Beinecke (my favorite class!). I would like to try to do discussions where we didnt raise hands and spoke more naturally, but I understand that can be difficult when everyone has so much to say.",
                "No weaknesses, it was a nice class"

                "Yes! I've never been a huge fan of classic literature but our in-class discussions really helped me understand and appreciate these great works.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone looking to have more exposure to American literature.",
                "Definitely, this course was a great way to expand on the literature I've read in high school. The ability to take time out of the day to discuss these great works with our classmates was a privilege. Learned a lot from my classmates and the Professor. Highly recommend.",
                "I would recommend, and have recommended, this course to another student. I grew significantly in my literary analysis and writing skills and I learned so much about American historynot traditional American history, but the history of both individuals, society, and how different regions in the US affected the minds of their inhabitants.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course. I think reading Moby Dick by itself is a worthy experience enough, but all of the books we read were incredible. Plus, there is so much to say about what these authors, writing in 1850's (Melville) or writing now but about the 1600's (Morrison), have to say about the foundation of this country, the prejudices it was built on, and the way we can work through them.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, take it with Shan Vogel if possible! Because each teacher can change the reading list a bit, I'd recommend checking the different reading lists of all the professors to see which one most closely aligns with what you want to study. The American literature foundation is so interesting, with so many different subsections of themes to explore. The reading was never boring, and the difference between types of novels and poetry presented was so large that it ensured you were never bored. Also, the essays are manageable and well spaced out, and the topics are super broad meaning that you are able to write about what you want to write about and you aren't forced into a particular narrative.",
                "Absolutely, and with this professor! He was great at facilitating discussion and balancing his own comments.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. I think it is a great introduction to American literature and provided me with a strong foundation to closely analyze complicated, challenging texts. The class inspired me to want to take more English seminars at Yale in the future, and I am sure I will use the skills I gained in this class in those future seminars. It provides a great basis for studying English and reading some of America's best authors.",
                "Yes! Professor Vogel is awesome, the syllabus is awesome, and the class really reinforced my love of reading :)",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed it and felt that it really improved my writing and reading skills.",
                "I highly recommend this course with Professor Vogel. Hes a strength to this course and whether you like literature or not, he will help you and he you might find that youll appreciate it by the end of the day.",
                "Absolutely! This course is foundational for anyone at all interested in American Literature. Obviously it is a requirement for English majors but i would recommend that any student take this class. The works you read are a tour de force in the American literary cannon, and are overall truly remarkable and enjoyable to read.",
                "Yes its a great way to investigate the past and present and read classics",
                "YES! I absolutely loved the material, but again, I think it was really Professor Vogel who made the course great!",
                "Yes I would, I learned a lot about American literature and how to close read. While there was lots of reading it was enjoyable."
