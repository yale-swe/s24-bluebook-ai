I feel more confident in my understanding of the ideas that have formed the foundations of political philosophy. I would have liked to read more works by women\/ethnic minorities as it seems more relevant to society today. The lectures were lower in quality compared to the other lectures in Directed Studies, however, and I think it could be improved.",
    "I Didnt understand how Nietzsche fit in with HP. I also wished there was more history mixed in with the abundance of political thought this semester.",
    "It's a great course with a fantastic reading list, I wish the professor and specific class I took had been more able to engage me and my peers with the material."
