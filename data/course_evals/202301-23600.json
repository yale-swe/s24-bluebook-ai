                "I learned so much about human rights as a philosophical construct, legal tool, and as a movement. The weekly writing responses allowed me to engage with the readings and practice short-style writing abilities. With each, I developed a thesis\/argument and was better able to understand the readings and my reactions to them better. This class should be taken by everyone, especially those interested in human rights\/humanitarian efforts, political frameworks, climate justice and environmental science, or philosophy. Easily my favorite Yale class so far.",
                "I learned how human rights are conceived by various traditions (of philosophy, advocacy, culture, etc.), how they are conceived and approached by the current human rights system (and how this conception and approach developed across history), and how they are practiced and debated by contemporary advocates and theorists.",
                "I have gained introductory knowledge in the history and legal body of human rights. I have learnt to think more broadly about the applications of human rights language and strategies.",
                "I gained a much more in-depth knowledge of the structure and procedures of the UN. Topics range from the creation of the UN to the recent developments in Yemen and Lebanon. The course focused on human rights violations, reparations, and future.",
                "I developed a basic understanding of some of the most important concepts, theories, and debates surrounding human rights and international law today.",
                "Beckerle is an incredible lector who is engaging and well organized. I learned something new and applicable from every class.",
                "Greater knowledge of international human rights bodies & law.",
                "I have gained a greater understanding in Human Rights, its history, its theory, and the law and politics that affect it.",
                "I learned much about the human rights framework, including its theories, organizations, laws, etc. I learned how to analyze human rights issues and critically assess the current system and laws.",
                "Through the lectures and the course materials, I gained a critical, multidimensional survey of the principles and politics that undergird human rights developments.",
                "By taking this course, I gained crucial insights regarding human rights both in theory and in practice. Units included theories of rights, historical developments and the human rights system, bodies of rights, human rights practice and contemporary debates, and human rights remedies.",
                "This course was very useful for anyone who is interested in human rights. It will provide you with the knowledge necessary to understand the essence of the international human rights system as well as its interaction with domestic and regional systems. Perhaps most importantly, the course will help you develop the skills and insights you'd need to thoughtfully critique and engage with the HR system.",
                "I learned about how the human rights framework is theoretical and practical. In learning about how human rights operates through the UN, advocacy networks, and legal frameworks, I gained an understanding of the various mechanisms.",
                "Human rights institutions, the moral philosophy behind human rights, critiques of human rights as a form of imperialism, policy proposal so that courts reflect the needs of victims",
                "I learned about the theoretical and historical basis for human rights as international law, as well as how the United Nations and other human rights bodies function.",
                "I learned about the theories that human rights are founded on, universalism vs. cultural relativism, history of human rights, applications, and using the system to achieve remedies",
                "I gained a theoretical and practical knowledge of how human rights institutions interact with the broader political framework.",
                "This was an incredibly useful class - not only for gaining a deeper understanding of how the human rights system works, but also for providing space, tools and techniques to think critically about human rights, the bodies that enforce them, and how the system could be reshaped or improved."

            "comments": [
                "I really appreciated the weekly responses, because they held me accountable both to doing the reading, and also to forming an opinion on the topics at hand, which was often hard. Professor Beckerle's engaging lecture style was another big strength, because I liked the group discussions and hearing other people's interpretations--I felt as if it was a crucial learning aspect to the debate of human rights interpretation and implementation. I also liked that the reading responses were due on Tuesdays, and were open to that day or the previous Thursday's lectures; it forced me to synthesize the lectures mid-week, which was nice as opposed to a Friday or Sunday deadline.",
                "Professor Beckerle is a central strength of this course (or, sadly, was: she will be leaving next year). She clearly cared about every student's learning and worked hard to cultivate a dynamic and inclusive lecture environment (she encouraged participation in the large lecture and sometimes split the lecture into smaller discussion groups). She also brought in very interesting guest lecturers. It is difficult to think of clear weaknesses in the lecture portion of the course. I did feel like discussion in section was almost never as productive or interesting as it could have been, often straying into stories and tangents that were largely irrelevant to the week's readings. Some of this (perhaps most of it) came from a lack of TA intervention when discussion veered off-topic. But I wonder if having a centralized course policy that encourages section discussion to focus primarily on readings would help make section into a space for real engagement with course topics.",
                "Strengths: Great survey of human rights as a project. \r\nWeaknesses: The section was weak, too much empty discussion",
                "The assignments (weekly response papers, in particular) were extremely helpful in facilitating student learning. The lectures were engaging and gave a good broad understanding of the issues covered. Sections were helpful in that, too.",
                "It would be nice to see other students work and have more collaboration throughout the year. Having weekly responses posted as discussion posts wouldve complimented my learning and engagement with classmates.",
                "Strengths: good lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sections where conversations sometimes felt circular and redundant. More guidance to make section conversations meaningful would be good.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures, amazing and knowledgable professor, interesting readings, clear feedback, flexibility with student feedback, great TAs, emphasis on participation and opportunities for group conversation, great guest lecturers\r\nWeaknesses: heavy reading load at times",
                "The strengths are that the lectures are critical and engaging to facilitate dialogue, learning, and inquiry. Through the lectures and the course materials, I gained a critical, multidimensional survey of the principles and politics that undergird human rights developments.  I also found the course to be very accessible, especially because I did not have a strong background in human rights studies prior to taking the course. I also appreciated the wide array of course materials that were employed, including podcasts, news articles, academic journals, etc.",
                "The course was arranged well and provided students with a fulsome overview of the human rights system locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally. The lectures flowed well, and Professor Beckerle was incredibly engaging. I appreciated the myriad of ways we could interact with course content, whether that was through lecture, discussion section, or office hours. Another major strength was that the course featured several esteemed guest speakers who shared relevant, real-life experiences in the realm of human rights. I also loved the range of readings; instead of just scholarly articles, we also frequently read news articles. The course could be improved via the provision of lecture slides and the addition of unconventional types of readings such as films.",
                "Strengths: Prof is a great lecturer and the syllabus was very comprehensive for understanding the HR system; the TFs were great! The weekly discussion posts were a great way to stay engaged throughout the course and receive consistent feedback.\r\n\r\nI think one way the course could be improved would be to provide the lecture powerpoints to everyone for accessibility purposes, as it can be hard to follow along with the lecture and take notes.",
                "Strengths: gives a clear and consice background of the key actors that shape the UN and international human rights bodies. knowledge feels applicable to the real world\r\nweaknesses: too much reading, and having a section might not have been necessary since we made use of frequent class discussion",
                "Professor Beckerle is amazing and the readings were great.",
                "Strengths: engaging material and readings, covers a wide breadth of topics\r\nWeaknesses: class time is too short (50 minutes) to fully break down the readings we did for class, more of lecture style class and with only a handful of the same people participating. I feel like classes should be longer and engage the whole class more to understand these complex topics",
                "It had very few examples from the US. Obviously, this is not a US-centric class, but a common critique of human rights is that they are standards being thrust upon non-western societies. If there were more contemporary examples of how human rights interact with the US it would go a long way in dispelling that critique.",
                "I really loved this course. The one thing I would say that would be great is if we could get some feedback perhaps on our final paper before it is graded (seeing as it is such a high percentage of our grade)"

                "YES YES YES, especially if Professor Beckerle returns to teach it in the future. Cannot stress enough how engaging and informative this class was for me. It's set me on a new focus in my political science career.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who has a prior, somewhat-developed interest in human rights. I would not recommend it to a student who is looking for a course that will plant a seed of that interest inside of them: because this course is a general overview, it will not be able to spark excitement in the way other courses (such as a more in-depth seminar on the relationship between climate change and human rights, or a course on the rights of refugees, or etc.) are.",
                "Yes! A very insightful lecture that approaches human rights from a variety of angles. Kristine was a huge part of why this course was so phenomenal.",
                "YES!!! It is such a good overview of human rights and its theories and it really leads one to reflect SO MUCH after every reading and lecture.",
                "Yes, if you are looking to receive a good broad overview of what the world of human rights and the academic & political world around it looks like. It offers a great starting point for engaging with more nuanced topics and concepts, and doing ambitious work outside of the classroom.",
                "Probably not. The lectures were interesting, but the reading responses felt like  makework, and section discussions rarely added anything of substance to the lecture.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students interested in Human Rights or political science.",
                "Yes, if you have genuine interest in learning about human rights and is willing to put in the work! Keeping up with the readings and engaging in lectures would allow you to get the most of the class. However, Professor Beckerle was a big part of what made the class so amazing, so I am not sure how it would look under another professor.",

                "I would recommend this course to anyone whos interested in the study and practice of human rights. Its a great introductory course and covers everything from refugee rights to the environment. The course is incredibly relevant to the present moment and does and excellent job of equipping students with the tools they need to address the pressing human rights concerns of our time.",
                "Yes! So many interesting and valuable pedagogical methods a very engaging environment",
                "Yes. I would definitely recommend this course to other students who are interested in human rights advocacy and law. It is useful for understanding the history of the system and how it works today. Furthermore, I appreciated that the class did not take human rights entirely for granted and instead we discussed its origins and thoughtfully critiqued our understandings of them.",
                "Yes, this course was intellectually challenging due to all of the theoretical readings, but I enjoyed learning about the foundations of human rights. The lectures were always engaging and the group activities helped to cement my understanding and put it into practice. The teaching fellows were always very helpful and provided great feedback that facilitated my learning.",
                "Yes, but only if they want a strong overview on the mechanisms of international human rights law and policymaking, but if they care about a specific human rights issue they should take a class that focuses on it instead",
                "Yes! It is a great introduction to human rights.",
                "Yes - you learn a lot!",
                "Yes, it was paradigm-shifting when it came to political institutions.  I don't think I know a single student who didn't have their mind dramatically changed on some issue",
                "1000%. My all-time favorite class at Yale. Professor Beckerle is an outstanding professor and I feel grateful to have taken this course with her."
