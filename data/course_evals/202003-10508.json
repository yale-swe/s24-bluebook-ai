                "Strengths: fun and laidback environment, predictable\/consistent nature of assignments, great textbook with lots of study resources and practice, reasonable workload for a foreign language course, great instructor\r\nWeaknesses: many of the in-class activities are heavily based on reviewing HW, could've had more opportunities to practice speaking and writing",
                "Costanza Barchiesi is an absolutely wonderful instructor. Having class Monday through Friday was a big commitment, but it was always enjoyable because Costanza made learning the material fun and low-stress. The class is taught almost entirely in Italian which was really helpful for learning the language. I wouldn't say there were any weaknesses to this class. Overall, it was a great course and I learned a lot."

The Zoom meetings ran smoothly and the format where we raised our hands to talk eliminated any awkward pauses or people talking over each other.

This course is fun and engaging and you learn a lot in just one semester. If you participate in class and study for the tests it's not difficult to get a good grade.",

                "Yes! It's probably one of the more laidback foreign language credits, but you still end up learning a ton about the Italian language and rich culture. It's pretty fast-paced and it could be difficult if you've never learned a Romance language before (the whole class is pretty much taught in Italian), but if you keep up with the work every day, you'll do fine. Costanza is such an amazing instructor, and she's here to help you succeed! She's incredibly kind and friendly, and it's such a joy to come to class every day.",
