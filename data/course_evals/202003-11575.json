                "Through our course readings, I developed the skills of reading with writerly eyes, a much broader sense of the modern essay, and a much deeper understanding of the strategies writers use and goals they pursue. The techniques we used to analyze these essays, such as reverse-outlining, cataloguing the use of specific devices\/effects, and generally assessing the intentionality behind these essays shaped, in turn, our intentionality in our own writing. Pushed to write essays in specific genres I probably never would have considered, I felt an enormous growth in my confidence as a writer as I observed my own process\/habits\/thought patterns through the strategies we developed in our discussions of class readings, along with workshops and teacher-student conferences.",
                "I learned how to analyze sentence\/paragraph\/essay structures, word and punctuation choices, and other stylistic choices to improve my own writing. Some examples are: When might you want to use quotation marks vs. italics for someone's dialogue? How can you use paragraph breaks to change the pacing of a story? How can you use literary devices to weave a thread throughout your essay that will leave the reader with an overall moral to the piece? How can you strengthen this thread? How can you change your voice depending on what topic you want to write about? How can you take on someone else's voice as a form of critique? How can you take away or give agency to someone\/something? How do you construct an audience for your piece?",
                "I developed writing skills related to how to craft an essay that is both artistically written and fulfills the goal of broad public relevance. I also developed my reading and discussion skills by learning how to annotate better, how to talk about writing, and how to foster an inclusive and engaging discussion environment. Finally, I gained new insights into how to be a better citizen, peer, and student by simply reading all of the fantastic writing that we did, workshopping, and working together to  help each  other in our writing.",
                "We read a lot of current articles and that was super helpful in analyzing themes. In general, learned how to structure a creative essay.",
                "How to write essays that go beyond the superficial, resonate with an imagined audience, and present unique insights. How to read critically by getting into the writers head as a means of improving your own writing and your overall comprehension. How to give constructive criticism to other student writers",
                "Overall, I understand myself much better as a writer now that I've taken this course! Specifically, I've learned how to better recognize elements of style and structure and how to use those elements intentionally in my own writing."

                "This course had a ton of strengths. The small size, the workshops (and especially the fact that the first one was sharing our personal essays), the varied material, and our professor's ability to foster a supportive environment made for an extremely engaged, compassionate, candid, and thoughtful class. Our class thrived in workshops, discussions, and writerly engagement, showing the effectiveness of the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shechtman curated a wonderful collection of articles to read, and the majority of them did a fabulous job at demonstrating devices that we could employ in our own writing. I loved that we had 1-3 short readings (about 2030 pages total) each class so that we could dive into each essay in depth.\r\n\r\nWeakness: We sometimes spent so much time on one piece that we couldn't get around to another piece that we read for that class. Near the end of the semester though, we caught onto this and started off discussing the shorter pieces first. Another critique that we as a class brought up was that the readings were often times longer than the 4-5 pagesthe limit for our own essays. It would have helped to read shorter pieces so that we could learn how to decide what to include in a story with word limits.",
                "Strengths: very engaging - great reading homework assignments that are very relevant, informative, and enjoyable to do, students get very close to one another and the professor by virtue of it being a small seminar and the collaborative nature of the course; well-paced - essay assignments were not usually back-to-back and the workload felt manageable; transformative: I really felt like I grew as a writer and person in learning to ask for help, input, and asking hard questions on how to improve my reading and writing; wonderful professor and classmates\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this is the third time I've tried to get into English 120... the lottery system is frustrating",
                "The strength was definitely Prof. Shechtman. She is so good and thoughtful when discussing your writing, and she pushes you to improve.",
                "STRENGTHS: first, Anna Shechtman!! additionally: focused discussions without borders, formidable essays to critique, Professor Shechtmans encouragement to pursue new avenues in our writing and reading. Regular one-on-one meetings with Professor Shechtman to discuss essay drafts. Rough and final draft system made the writing process more progressive and manageable. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: Hard to think of any! Occasionally we were not able to cover the two essays assigned for class discussion. This isnt necessarily a weakness though, as it only meant we dived deeper into the first one. Sometimes I also found it hard to get through the two essays (occasionally 10 pg+) in the time between Monday and Wednesday, since my Mondays were course-heavy. Overall though, the reading load (and writing load, depending on your writing process) was very manageable.",
                "The strengths were the constant focus on form, the brilliant professor who was incredible at giving feedback and being available, the great readings that worked well for short but focused analysis, the ability to workshop with peers, and the balance of writing where I felt I was able to gain experience without being overwhelmed. It is a course in reading for craft, though, which means some of the insights into writing in general can feel specific to a single work. This made it harder sometimes to apply takeaways from the readings into my own writing."

                "The small size enabled a very good flow of conversation considering the limits of Zoom. We were encouraged to leave our videos and audio on whenever possible, which for me reduced the strange hesitation I feel when there's a unmute button gating my decision to speak up or not in a discussion. The variety of interaction styles was very good (breakout rooms with 2-3 students leading to presentations in the full group, discussions with full group, student-teacher conferences, and class workshops).",
                "Using share screen to draft documents together on what we were learning or going through essays together was helpful. Zoom office hour meetings with  the  professor were helpful too. The students created a groupme which  was very helpful and helped in engagement.\r\nBreakout rooms are always a bit painful, and this was no exception.",

Overall, I felt that we were able to hold fruitful, collaborative discussions over Zoom."

Close-reading, discussing, and writing deep and meaningful essays is a wonderful shift of pace and perspective in anyone's schedule.",
                "Yes!!! This course helped me improve my writing so much in such a short time. I was only used to writing scientific pieces before this class, and this class helped me to explore the world of stylistic devices outside of academic talk. It also helped me become much more aware of the traps that I fell into with my own writing, develop Broad Public Relevance in my pieces, and strengthen the threads in my essays.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The relationships you form with your classmates and professor don't compare to any other  class. I felt I grew as a writer, student, and person. Take this class.",
                "YES ABSOLUTELY",
                "Absolutely. A not-to-be-missed opportunity to deepen your writing skills in a close class community that values creativity, threads, Broad Public Relevance (BPR), and your voice. Dont leave college until you take a class with Anna Shechtman! You write five short (4-5 pg) but challenging essays that push you to probe deeper into those experiences (either personal or rooted in your perception of the world) that you never thought to put into words.",
                "YES! If I put as many exclamation points as I wanted to after that, it would probably undermine the readability of this (thanks ENGL 120) but imagine there are a few hundred. This would probably be about the same number of exclamation points as times I gushed about how fantastic this class is. Especially with Prof. Shechtman. She's incredible as an editor for the rough drafts and is really good as a facilitator for discussion too. But overall, this course was just such a fun and productive way to explore writing. 100\/10, would recommend."
