                "The course has a lot interesting material, but the way in which students have to wrote memorize everything and the high level of detail we are expected to know for the tests were incredibly taxing and discourages most non-musically trained students from the class. \r\nThe materials for the tests should be shortened and the listening portions simplified, as the listening questions requires you to basically just memorize everything about these pieces than being able to \"listen\" and figure it out, which is what the course is advertised as.",
                "The professor and the TA were quite attentive and ready to help in any way possible whenever necessary. The professor made the class very enjoyable with her style of lecturing and the examples she provided during the class.",
                "I think this class attempts to cover simultaneously breadth and depth, which is pretty overwhelming. We covered 2000+ years of musical history but were also expected to know very minute details like the name of the Syrian city where the oldest notated song in the world was found (which was only ever briefly mentioned in one lecture and not particularly essential to the class). The quizzes and especially the exam were very stressful, and didn't feel that relevant to the skills of the class. I spent hours trying to memorize word-for-word the ten page-long, single-spaced study guides for each quiz, because the expectation was to regurgitate a paragraph (and sometimes multiple paragraphs) of information for each term. \r\n\r\nI would recommend restructuring the content. I think it could either be done chronologically OR focus on a specific theme. I found Professor Davis's lectures and assigned readings on music and politics/social issues to be the most interesting, and that might be a more engaging way to teach the class in the future. \r\n\r\nI also wish more of the class assessments were like the album review assignment. I really enjoyed that assignment, because it gave us a chance to be creative, think critically, and apply skills from our class, as opposed to the quizzes/exam, which promoted rote memorization.",
                "Strengths- Professor Davis was very approachable and kind. The discussion sections were smaller groups and were very engaging. The topics discussed in section were often times very fun and entertaining. \r\n\r\nWeakness- The class was often incredible boring. The quizzes took a long time to return and were graded unfairly. Often times, point would be deducted without an explanation as to why I was docked points. Professor Davis, while incredibly kind, took ample time to respond to emails and seemed to care little about the \"paperwork\" side of teaching. The assignments were often times unfair and graded even harsher.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-amazing textbook and lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-remote modality - would highly recommended taking this course in person",
                "The course overall was well organized and easy to follow. The discussion section in smaller groups was very helpful.",
                "Professor Davis is amazing! It is sad that most students are quite (and faceless) during zoom classes, but professor Davis always make the atmosphere of the class so lively and for that I also enjoy the lecture much more. The readings are very useful in giving us background, and the lectures and the lecture slides are great at giving us key information. The regular quiz are not to stressful, especially with a guide every time, but it helps me keeping up with the materials and making sure that I really understand different genre or periods of music.",
                "Strengths: The content was interesting. The album review was my favorite part of the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was too much content. The course was focused on both breadth and depth, and there was too much for too little a time. We had 2-75 minute lectures and 1-50 minute discussion section per week. However, there was literally no point in the discussion section, because it ended up being just an in-depth lecture on a subject. So we had 200 minutes per week solely about content, and not really about discussing that content. \r\nAlso, maybe this is the history-oriented person in me, but the course was structured in broad modules (like dance) and not actually based on time periods, which was afterwards made it very difficult to remember anything for the final exam. There was a real sense of time disorientation. \r\nFurthermore, all the learning and grading was based off of rote memorization, which is not only both extremely boring and difficult, it's not actually useful. \r\nAt the beginning of the course, I was hoping to do more content like the album review, but we only did that oncethe other writing assignment was... humdrum to say the least."

                "I personally would not. The expectations were unfair and the assignments were not practical. Professor Davis would be awesome to sit and talk with about music, and she is obviously incredibly knowledgeable in the subject. However, the course takes itself a bit too seriously.",
                "No. It's not a gut, but it did not really positively challenge me either. Prof Davis means well and tries to be cheery and helpful, but the assessments feel unpurposeful, the lectures are not interactive enough, and the material is not presented in a way that encourages real thinking. The textbook/lectures alluded to so many fascinating and impactful issues, from racism and sexism in the classical music world or how to delineate music from non-music, but section nor lectures brushed by them for the sake of covering content, which means we never had the discussions I was yearning to have.",
                "Absolutely! Prof. Davis is brilliant. She is extremely dedicated to her work and students. Her exams are a bit tricky, but as long as you study, there's no reason you'd fail. I wish that I took the course during the previous semester and had more time to immerse myself in the material truly.",
