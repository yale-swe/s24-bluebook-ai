                "I grew skills in close reading and analytical writing. I learned about literature outside of the Western canon, particularly related to themes of colonialism and post-colonialism.",
                "This class sharpened my close-reading skills and broadened my awareness of global Anglophone literature.",
                "I learned how to write complex arguments, how to actually outline, and how to do a close reading. I really enjoyed this class because of all the different colonial and post-colonial histories we got to explore through fiction. I became a more dexterous writer and speaker. The seminar style of the class makes discussions of each text really worthwhile.",

                "I learned how to more critically apply my close reading skills, how to articulate my arguments out loud in response to classmates, and how to engage with unique materials (primary sources, videos, photographs, etc.) in my study of literature."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The reading list for this class is incredible. Each book was honestly highly compelling in its own way and I felt that each book we read contributed to the overall purpose of the course. The reading list is paced well, too; I never felt like we spent too long on a particular book or that we were rushing to make it through a text. The class size is perfect for good discussions as well. \r\nWeaknesses: Not really anything. I wish we'd maybe done more work with actually comparing the texts, rather than working on one at a time, especially given the name of the course.",
                "Professor Richards is a strength!",
                "Strengths: we got a broad, comprehensive survey of English literature around the world; discussions were generally really good; Professor Richards structured the seminar time into a wide range of in-class activities, i.e. group work, broader debates, etc. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class moves through books a little too fast for my taste; hundreds of pages are only symbolically covered by a few close-reading exercises in class. As an aftereffect, the quality and liveliness of discussions started to die down towards the second half of the semester.",
                "I really liked the presentations we got to do--I think they helped gain new insight into our readings. I also liked when we put videos\/poems\/documentary clips in conversation with the text. The most memorable one was a Grain of Wheat with a BBC news clip of Kenyan independence. The contrast between the novel and the fear-mongering language of the clip was a useful way to dive into the novel and how the characters would have been seen by the western world.\r\n\r\nWhile there are a lot of readings, I think they allow us to have a wider breadth of voices. I wish discussion posts had been introduced earlier in the year and were more prominent on the canvas page as a deadline, because they were easy to miss. I think that more deadlines should have put onto the canvas calendar.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't really need them, I appreciated the indication of content warnings. However, I thought it was pretty inconsistent. As a comparative world lit class, there is a lot of violence--racial, sexual, mental health related, etc.--in the books we're reading. These realities are important when discussing the lived experiences of the characters, and I enjoyed these texts and discussions greatly. But some texts, such as DMZ Colony and The God of Small Things  would receive warnings while others such as A Grain of Wheat (specifically for self-inflicted violence; we got one for torture), Nervous Conditions (for household abuse), and Buddha in the Attic (for sexual assault) didn't. I understand that this is due to the fast paced nature of the class, but I think consistency would be beneficial for some students, especially when texts may hit close to home.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the assortment of texts we discussed in class. I also think the essay prompts were interesting and allowed us to dive into the text while also giving us agency to discuss what texts were most interesting.",
                "strengths: the selection of texts is really broad and teaches about corners of history that wouldnt be discussed in a traditional english classroom, the papers were well-spaced out to use feedback from one to help the next, discussion was structured in a way that encouraged participation from everyone, good mix of small group work vs whole group discussion vs individual work\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I think there were one or two too many books packed into the semester, i think we could have slowed the pace a tiny bit and been able to get more out of discussions and out of each individual text; also some texts that were an option to write a paper on were assigned the same week the paper was due, so you had to be reading ahead for it to be an option to use for your paper.",
                "Liked the readings. Discussions were disappointingly dry considering how rich the texts weregranted it was a 9am. Still, I felt like this class had so much unrealized potential.",
                "strengths- Professor Richards is super nice and understanding as well as passionate, good selection of texts to read, assignments were reasonable and well spread apart \/ felt manageable, class discussion was always insightful \r\nweakness - none really, the pace at which we read books could potentially feel fast to some",
                "Strengths: Collaborative, interesting projects, diverse assignments, welcoming class environment, very engaging discussions, wide range of books represented on syllabus\r\nWeaknesses: More feedback on papers"

                "Yes! This class was a great introduction to the English department at Yale. When I spoke to my friends about the course, I described it as the type of class I expected to take here, and I think that that is still a true statement. The twice-weekly, small, discussion-based class allowed me to develop good connections with my professor and my peers, and I felt that we truly approached each text through a careful and analytical lens. While the papers could be stressful, I really felt that they provided a great opportunity to challenge my understanding and interpretations of the text.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed leaving the Western canon for a semester, and Professor Richards crafted a fascinating syllabus. They are an incredibly kind and open professor.",
                "Yes",
                "If you have previous experience in English classes at Yale, or are astute at English, you should take this course. I had a bit of a learning curve because while I would consider myself decently good at literature classes, the jump from high school level to college was not always easy. More is expected of you in readings, discussions, and especially essays. In high school, I was often one of the few people actually talking in English class--in this class, everyone talks and is very attentive. It also (obviously) contains a more diverse array of texts than I ever got in high school. You'll learn a lot about world lit in this class, but you'll get more out of this class if you've taken a world history class before. The class assumes some level of knowledge about colonial history, though more detailed historical context is provided in class. It was a really enjoyable class, and stretched my writing and analysis skills.",
                "I would recommend the course because you learn so much more beyond the literature; every text had historical context and it really broadened the discussion and made it feel like a mixture of a history course and english course which was cool",
                "If you have to for the ENGL major. I think there are other courses that do a better job of broadening the literary canon.",
                "Yes !",
                "I would highly recommend ENGL 128 to anyone. Professor Richards did an incredible job of facilitating a classroom environment that was both challenging and welcoming; this was the perfect first English class to take at Yale. I genuinely and thoroughly enjoyed each and every book we read, and I looked forward to class each morning. This was my favorite class of the semester."
