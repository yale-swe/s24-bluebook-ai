                "Learned about sexuality through historical perspectives, read the works of various sex psychologists and theorists like Freud, Krafft-Ebbing, Foucault, and also from more modern perspectives. Analyzed archival material and also improved writing skills.",
                "I absolutely loved this course. We basically learned about the history of how homosexuality was pathologized. I learned to think critically, in terms of questioning the binaries we are taught to accept. I also really improved my essay writing skills\/time management.",
                "There were a variety of skills and insights developed throughout the course including: careful reading of primary sources, taking a \"first stab\" at difficult readings with confidence, and developing more personal style in analytical writing.",
                "This class is not just a straightforward explanation of the history of sexuality, it involves a lot of analysis and discussion of knowledge production i.e. what we know and how we how we know things.",
                "A richer understanding of how our understand of sexuality has developed over the last 250 years",
                "Im this class I learned how to contextualizar different documents about human sexuality within the time and culture that they were written. I also developed skills in academic writing and crafting my own arguments using primary sources.",
                "Talking about sexuality and learning about its history",
                "I learned how sexuality was studied early on. I learned how people have been trying to find the cause of homosexuality and how they conduct studies to do so.",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge about how sexuality was studied scientifically and psychologically. This course provides a nice introduction to the theories of Freud and Foucault and provides really interesting perspective on how we've come to study human sexuality.",
                "By taking this course, I further developed my college-level essay writing abilities, my critical thinking skills, and my ability to analyze literature.",
                "This course prompts students to think critically about the way discourse surrounding sexuality has developed over times and the ways that various disciplines (i.e. medicine, psychoanalysis) have conceived of it. Students explore these topics while also honing in on their writing skills (such as by writing papers based on archival research, theory, and primary sources).",
                "A lot on the history of different sexualities, genders, and the relationship between them and society. Sexology and sex as science was also read about. We read a lot of articles and books about sex, and it in the past\/how it was discussed."

                "Strengths: Professor Trumpler is super passionate and informed about this topicI felt like I could ask her anything and she would know the answer, or give a very thought-provoking statement in response. Readings are great. Essays are structured well and the class is light at the end of the semester, which is really nice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like there could be more guidance for in class discussions. Sometimes conversations felt stilted, like we needed more help on how to continue.",
                "The main strength of the course is Professor Trumpler. She organized the class in such a deliberate way that it felt perfectly orchestrated for student learning.",
                "The strengths of this class is that there wasnt too much pressure, which I think is important for first year students who are new to seminar style classes. The class was also very inclusive and was conducive to open dialogue about topics that are often times hard or taboo to talk about. It also was in a sense a self-selecting crowd so everyone taking the class seemed open to discussion on human sexuality. The weaknesses of this class in my opinions were that there was a lot of reading that made it hard to keep up with, and when theres a lot of reading its easy to assume that each individual reading is not as important. I also found that while reading I didnt necessarily know which parts to look for in the text that were particularly relevant. Maria Trumpler did an excellent job explaining to us in class after the reading what was notable and led us to that discovery in conversation, but I wouldve appreciated just a little bit more guidance on the front end. But that is just a minor complaint and otherwise the class was very engaging and enjoyable.",
                "N\/A",
                "I don't think there are weaknesses of this course because at first I thought it was going to be impossible for me to participate because I was uncomfortable  and confused at first but the class environment is so welcoming and safe that I eventually felt confident enough to do so. I think a strength of this class is learning how to write about and read really confusing material.",
                "Strengths: the reading assignments cover a vast amount of history which really allowed us to see how perceptions of sexuality had evolved. In class discussions were engaging and thought provoking. Professor Trumpler had incredible insights and facilitated discussions really well. \r\nWeakness: none except that I wish Professor Trumpler shared more of her perspective and knowledge at times.",
                "I think the kitchen table discussion format made the class feel very intimate, friendly, and inclusive. However, at times it was difficult to sustain these smaller discussions and full class discussions had to begin earlier as a result.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- great readings \r\n- lots of discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- not enough background\/lectures"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. As a first-year seminar, this course made the prospect of contributing discussion and writing papers much less intimidating. The content was also very interesting, and allows you to consider how sexuality plays a role in your life and how it was played a role in shaping society. I would totally recommend, especially to broaden your horizons if you are not a WGSS major.",
                "Yes! Totally changes your way of thinkingIve taken everything Ive learned from this class and been thinking about it in my real life.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Not only is the subject matter incredibly interesting and relevant for students of all backgrounds and identities. Professor Trumpler is very deliberate in how she organizes and teaches the course and it is a pleasure to watch her teach. The course has some incredibly interesting information presented in a variety of unique styles.",
                "Super fascinating, well organized, understanding and thoughtful instructor, and a fairly easy writing credit! As someone who generally dislikes analytical writing, I found the papers for this class to be pretty fun to write. 100% recommend, easily my favorite class that I've taken at Yale so far.",
                "Yes",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, as this was my favorite course I took this semester. Its relatively low stakes and is over a topic that I find very interesting, and if another student also finds it interesting then they would like the course.",
                "Yes, 100%",
                "Yes i loved this class it was like no other class ive taken before. I looked forward going to class and I think it was the perfect balance between learning a lot and not being overwhelmed  with work.",
                "Yes I would 100% recommend this course to another student. The readings are very engaging.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning\/discussing about sexuality as we read a lot of foundational authors in the field of sexuality (Freud, Foucault, Ebing,etc.)",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to all students because it really teaches you so much about how to approach not only sexuality, but science, marriage, monogamy, and so much more. It truly changed the lens through which I see the world and my place within it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was engaging, and interesting to learn about. For people who enjoy small discussions I would highly suggest taking this."
