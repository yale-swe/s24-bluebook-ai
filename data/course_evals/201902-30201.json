    "The course felt a bit scattered at first, and took some time to hit its stride.  I know one of the nice features of the course is that you can learn from so many different professors, but I found that a lot of them taught us the same things, so even though there was this amazing professor in front of me, I hardly learned anything new from them.",
    "This course was amazing. Brooks was a great professor however some of the other professors from different universities were hard to comprehend.",
    "S: Prof Brooks\r\nW: Nothing to show",
    "The strengths were the diverse experiences we received through the various teachers in the course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses were the lack of full class activities and simulations to give us real world explanations",
    "Some of the lecture handouts were somewhat difficult to understand. There was a lot of information packed into very little space. To that end, the inclusion of integration in some of our notes\/lectures were more confusing than clarifying.\r\nReally enjoyed Prof. Songa's guest lectures. Really enjoyed the connection of contracts to redlining in American real estate.",
    "Strengths: Talented professors, interesting curriculum, excellent guest lecturers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some mathematical concepts were not explained fully"

    "Absolutely, the course teaches contracts while giving you an in explanation of the crossovers between law and economics. I was able to take these tools and apply them to my every day life because when it comes down to it, everything is a contract of some sorts.",
    "Yes; a great way to see the world and fulfill economics requirements",
    "Yes I would because it is an interesting course that is engaging without being overwhelming."
