                "I learned a good bit of the works of the titular authors. I also got some experience in reading analyses and responses to the texts.",
                "I learned about the philosophical writings of Marx, Kietkegaard, and Nietzsche, as well as about how each of their lives informed their writings.",
                "I learned a lot about the three thinkers we read, considering that I had come into the course having only properly studied one of them. It was useful not only as learning about these topics from a spectator view, but also using them to challenge my own beliefs.",
                "Great overview of the thinking of these three philosophers.",

            "comments": [
                "Strength: the syllabus is awesome, and just doing the readings, you learn so much.\r\nWeakness: the seminar was way too many people, which really decreased the quality of the conversation. It should have been limited far more, because having so many people just made everyone's comments feel dispersed and non-connected. I wanted to have a more engaged conversation figuring out the texts.",
                "I think the only weakness of this course was trying to squeeze three of the most profound thinkers within Western philosophy into the same class. I believe the depth of these philosophers can only be grasped in a seminar focused solely on them alone. Aside from that, I believe we accomplished about as much as we could within the time span we had for each thinker and our conversations were well structured. Every other aspect of the course was fantastic.",
                "The course was great! Darwall is amazing, obviously, and the class discussions were interesting enough to keep me awake on Tuesday nights. The course was very well organized, as we got handouts each week with a list of topics we were going to cover. But Darwall also wasn't completely tied to the handout, so if something more interesting came up we'd pursue it. I think that's how seminars should run. One thing is that there were probably too many people, probably because a lot of people audited, which made it feel crowded and sometimes I had to wait a really long time to speak. But I didn't really mind because everyone else had such interesting things to say.",
                "There should be less reading because we never got through the material in any class. Also, the format is not great because we just end up summarizing the reading instead of discussing anything.",
                "The course is an excellent way to start to get into Marx, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche's thought. You read a large selection of the works given that it is a single semester course and I felt I understood their philosophies more leaving the course. Professor Darwall is also great at welcoming everyone in the class to contribute and making sure people understand the readings.",
                "This course was absolutely wonderful. My one suggestion is that it be taught as a seminar that meets twice per week next time, instead of once per week. It was disappointing to never be able to get through the material, especially since our class discussions were so great.",
                "It was a great class, but the large class size was a mixed bag for me. I felt that it was nice hearing many different views, but it also made it harder to participate. \r\n\r\nI also wished that we met more than once a week",
                "Decent introduction to the philosophers.   More of an exposition course, little critique.  \r\n\r\nReadings on Kierkegaard not ideal -- too much time on Either/Or vs later works.  \r\n\r\nWould have been interesting to have at least one summary lecture to link them all together.",
                "The breadth of the readings was simultaneously a strength and a weakness. Members of the class could find a variety of topics for response and discussion, almost always without repetition. This brought a diversity of perspectives and offered broad exposure to the readings. But because the readings were so broad, it felt impossible to get through all of them. If it takes me 10 minutes to read a page of Hegel (which it usually does), and the reading for the first class was 76 pages of Hegel, then I'd need 13 hours to fully prepare for class, plus a few more if I had a response paper due that week. I never got that much time together. I did, however, become a better reader through the class, and acclimated to each author's style after few weeks with their work.\r\n\r\nThe reading load also shaped the form of our class discussions. It seemed like there were a few people who could speak on the entire reading (very impressive, honestly), but most of us tended to speak on only a few sections--so different groups of people could speak in different portions of the class. This was different from the Yale seminars I'm used to, though not necessarily worse. If more cohesion is wanted, I would love to be be able to read one another's response papers* or see Professor Darwall's handout before class. That way, everyone could prepare some thoughts (response to the response).\r\n\r\n*This kind of accountability might help the significant portion of us who struggled with deadlines, too."

                "Yes! Prof Darwall always gives insightful comments, both on papers and during seminars.",
                "Yes, if you are self-directed and will do the readings yourself. The syllabus was really the strength of this class, but the class conversations didn't always feel completely connected with the texts, and if you didn't want to do the readings thoroughly, there was no pressure to have done them. I think this had to do with class size - if it were a smaller class, people would have felt more of a community connection with each other, and maybe would have worked harder to do the readings thoroughly. There were just a lot of people sitting silently on the outside of the classroom. Professor Darwall should have just admitted the number of people that fit around a seminar table.",
                "Yes, Professor Darwall is an amazing teacher and the source materials we engaged with can have a transformative affect on the way people see the world.",
                "Yes! If you're the kind of person who enjoys philosophizing on Tuesday nights, there's no better person to do it with than Darwall. It's a lot of dense reading but the material is interesting and you'll probably carry it for the rest of your life.",
                "Yes, but only if they are genuinely interested in philosophy. It's a great course, but it is definitely quite rigorous. You only get what you put into the course. The readings are very long, but if you like philosophy, they are incredibly interesting and thought-provoking readings. The short papers also help you engage with the ideas in a more hands-on way, and you present those short papers in class to help focus the discussion. Steve is great and gives really good feedback, and each seminar is always very well organized in terms of what topics will be touched on and discussed in depth. The discussions require a high level of understanding of philosophical argumentation and you cannot get by without reading what is assigned closely.",
                "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the three authors and is willing to put in some time out of class to get to know them. The classes themselves are not always the most stimulating, and sometimes are spent just going through piece by piece of the readings.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in ethics as well as in how the biographies of Marx, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche influenced and shaped their ideas about ethics.",
                "Yes, definitely. These three thinkers are must-reads and the way the course was structured was great for taking in a lot of their writings",
                "Yes, if interested in area.",
                "Yes. Thanks to the difficulty of the texts, I became a better reader through the class. When I was able to make a point in seminar that stuck, it felt like a real achievement. Here, there was no need to fill time with unsatisfying half-takes. And I really loved hearing my classmates present their response papers. They were brilliant."
