                "I developed my range of tone, my ability to do figure drawing, learned about light\/shadow\/perspective.",
                "When I took this course, I learned a lot more about the emphasis on articulation of space and techniques for observational study. I found it intriguing to learn about fundamental techniques by working in class and observing others' artistic practices.",

                "While I would like to say that my drawing improved during this course, I was too burnt out at the end to put any real effort into my work anymore. I have talked with other people in other Basic Drawing sections and this class has far more work than the other sections. Most of the work, while interesting, does not work to improve our skills. Instead, they are long--too long--assignments that sap your energy until you cannot stand doing art anymore.",

            "comments": [
                "I really appreciate how academic this course was. This provided such an in-depth, serious approach to drawing. The only downside of this is that I felt it was hard to get to know everyone in the class, meaning not only the students, but also Professor Bryant and our TF, Anne Mailey. I wish there was somehow more discussion space or perhaps collaborative space so that more of a community could be fostered. Especially on the undergraduate level, the arts community is very separated. Classrooms are the only spaces we realistically have to get to know one another.",
                "The course was very broad and covered a lot of information in a short period of time. Because of this, homework totaled to 8+ hours per week and it was hard to find the time to really dedicate towards each piece due to the time constraints (especially between Monday and Wednesday class). The class also didn't really follow the syllabus so we didn't get to do a lot of the activities I was looking forward to doing.",
                "Workload could be more consistent, final project could be more developed.",
                "I felt a bit intimidated as a non-art major in this class. The majority of people in my class were art majors. First, it's very hard to get into if you're not an art major (my tip is to just keep showing up and don't give up! many people drop). I wouldn't call this a \"basic\" drawing class. People are kind of expected to already be familiar with drawing. Try to find some funding for the art supplies you buy, because the prices for pencils, paper, sketchbooks, etc. add upand you're expected to buy these supplies yourselves. There is a lot of homework. But because you get so much practice, your drawing skills will definitely improve. Classmates were encouraging and nice but also a bit reserved.",
                "I would have appreciated a little more freedom with assignments throughout the semester",
                "Strengths: the theoretical components, the professor's presentations, live models\r\nWeaknesses: too much homework (from tuesday to thursday)",
                "The weakness of this course is that it is so draining. You are expected to do so much work that by the end of the day you cannot creatively fathom drawing anything else for the rest of your life. Another weakness is that I did not feel passionate--or inclined to be passionate--about what I was doing. I started the semester off being so excited and positive about this class only to find it slowly but surely hacked away with every assignment. At the end of the semester I just wanted the class to be over (which really is sad)",
                "Strengths: Partaking in unique and interactive activities beyond the classroom (touring art exhibitions set up by graduate students, making charcoal, visiting and working in a printshop, etc.).\r\n\r\nAreas of improvement: It could help to have a more formalized method of communicating and archiving our homework.",
                "I felt this class was teaching below the level of the class, but was still very demanding in terms of time. Professor Bryant expected about eight hours a week of work, and it often wasnt spread out through the week very well (four hours due Tuesday then another four due Thursday). I understand that its an intro class, but I do wish there were more creative assignments as opposed to mostly observational. Finally, the critiques were very long and I wish we spent more of class actually drawing.",
                "The strengths are that the Professor was very instructive in giving criticism and had unique projects.\r\nThe weakness is that that the course was very fast paced.",
                "A more realistic work plan\/schedule would improve this course",
                "The strengths were everything that transpired during class. Critiques were helpful and constructive, the still life assignments never felt uninspired, and the artist presentations were very eye-opening. The only weaknesses were the materials: we had to purchase a very large sketchpad, and I genuinely dreaded transporting it to and from class every Tuesday and Thursday."

                "Absolutely, but I would definitely recommend it to a student who was very passionate about art. There was a lot of work, and Professor Bryant was serious about the material at hand. I loved this aspect of the class, but this isnt a class for a student looking to take something for lightweight fun outside of their major (as it should be).",
                "If you want to learn more about drawing and art then I highly recommend this class but do be weary of the time commitment and homework load. As a STEM student, balancing this class with my PSET classes within a 5 credit course load was a lot.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they were truly interested in developing their skills as an artist (specifically in drawing) because the professor and many of your peers will be taking the work very seriously  which may be different than someone's standard high school art class which may have been more laid-back. If you're looking for something less engaging, this class may not be for you.",
                "Great comprehensive introduction to drawing, for prospective creative majors.",
                "Yes, but this class is not an easy class. I wouldn't recommend it as a fifth classthe workload is heavier than you'd expect. Professor Bryant can easily tell when you put in effort and when you don't. He's a great teacher who went above and beyond based on what I've heard about other basic drawing profswe did things like a printmaking workshop and made our own charcoal.",
                "If you are an art major, you have to take it.",
                "If you are genuinely interested in art and want to spend hours doing it, then yes. If you are more interested in trying this out and learning more about drawing passively, then no.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students -especially those who are NOT Art majors- since the studio-style classroom structure and unique homework tasks are a welcome change of pace among the weekly lectures, problem sets, exams, and\/or papers that may be in your course schedule.",
                "Id recommend this class to someone who hasnt had a lot of drawing experience but is willing to take a demanding class and put in the time. If you took AP art in high school or have had previous technical instruction I wouldnt recommend the class.",
                "I would recommend this course for both art majors and non art majors. However, it should be noted that many of the projects have high workloads and take a lot of time to complete.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! ART 114 teaches you not only about art, but about life. The opportunity to spearhead your own project at the end of the course is a very affirming experience."
