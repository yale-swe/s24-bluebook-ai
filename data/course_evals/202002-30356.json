   "comments": [
    "I have learned a basic understanding of cosmology and the story of our galaxy as well as neighboring galaxies. I've been given insight to the many celestial objects that exist within the different galaxies, including stars, planets, moons, pulsars, and so much more.",
    "I learned a lot about astronomy in this course: the early understanding of the solar system and universe, stellar properties and evolution, black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, galaxies, the Big Bang Theory and misconceptions associated with it, dark matter (or at least, our current understanding of it), among other things. I also learned about various scientists and their contributions, as well as the scientific techniques we have available and how astronomical discoveries are generally made.",
    "I learned about many basic ideas and theories in physics and astronomy. I also learned a lot specifically about science and research of stars, galaxies, and the universe.",
    "I enjoyed having an accessible kind of STEM class on an interesting topic. I got to review some chemistry and physics concepts, and tie them together through the lens of astronomy. Now if any space-related news come sup, I have a general reference point for what it means.",
    "A crazy combination of all the sciences, astronomy is! And this course really touched it all in a well-done way. Physics, chemistry, geometry, mathematics, geology, etc etc. I think it really helped build my confidence and passion to get a taste of all of this over the course of ASTR S120.",
    "From this course, I gained an introductory knowledge of astronomy.",
    "This class, at least the Summer Session Zoom version of it, is an example of not simply failed but misguided pedagogy. The professor and TAs showed no interest in constructive feedback and seemed more concerned with punishment. Commentary on homework assignments was sparse and sometimes nonexistent, often with many points deducted and no explanation given. The professor claimed toward the beginning of the class that the bi-weekly homework assignments and weekly quizzes were intended as useful tools for mastering the material and addressing areas of confusion. Laughable. A problem set assigned at the beginning of the second week of the class was returned the week of the final. That is to say, of the 9 problem sets assigned over the course of five weeks, only 2 (the simplest, least significant assignments of the bunch, material which would have little or no relevance for the remainder of the class) had been graded by the Monday before the final exam. If you prefer percentages (I know the professor and TAs certainly do) that's 22.2% of the total number of problem sets assigned for the class. For baseball fans, that's batting .222, ripe for a benching or demotion. Total dereliction of their most basic responsibility to the class, or the \"audience\" as the professor seemed fond of saying. Nice to know we were all spectators to 8 dull hours of introductory science for 5 weeks of our blissful quarantine summer. O joy, o rapture. The format of the quizzes was another example of the backward pedagogy of this backward class: 15 multiple choice and short answer questions, entered directly on Canvas, automatically graded and spit back out as a percent. Let's do the math: 15\/15 = 100%, 14\/15 = 93.3%, 13\/15 =  86.6%, 12\/15 = 80%. 3 automatically graded short answer questions wrong, no work shown, and your grade's down 20%. That's punitive. Made a power of ten error? On a homework question maybe that'll be a point off (not a percentage point, a single point, a fraction of a percent). On a quiz? Try 7 percentage points. There is no room for error and the professor is a terribly ungenerous grader. That cannot be overstated. You'll have to turn your desperate appeals elsewhere. Higher spiritual powers, perhaps. You'll need their guidance through these treacherous 5 weeks. To compensate for their completely delinquent grading, the professor and TAs staged nothing short of a last minute carpet bombing of the problem sets (what ever could go wrong when you're racing to grade 40 * 7, that's 280 for those keeping score at home, assignments in a single weekend?). Talk about an extreme distraction in the last and most stressful week of class, in which we had two more assignments due, daily lectures covering vast swathes of new material to attend, and a final at the end of the week to prepare for. Outrageous. Several all-you-can-ask, two-and-a-half hour review sessions were scheduled during the last week of class to make up for the grading delinquency. The TA overslept the most convenient and earliest one, the one that would have been the most helpful and given the most time for internalizing clarifications and review, and missed the entire session. So, let's summarize: knowledge is not the point of this class, whatever minor insights you might come away with after enduring Zoom-engendered eye torture and the professor's droning bass (which is monotony incarnate) and frequent, strange, and protracted asides about the media and the Church's proven historical affinity for all things scientific at lecture will be like the relief felt after vomiting from a bad bout of food poisoning, that is, sudden release at the point of near-surrender.",
    "I learned a lot about the planets, stars, systems in the universe. Also learned how to synthesize and apply physics equations",
    "As this was my first Yale course, I learned a lot from this course other than the content. High school courses (that I have taken) have a lot more structure, and information such as derived formulas are often handed to me. I learned to put in a lot of effort to construct basic things such as deriving equations and day to day summaries. This is also my first time having Discussion Sections, TAs, and classes with college students. Again, I was quite used to being handed information, but I learned that college courses require the student to take the initiative. I attended nearly every discussion session, office hours, and also joined a small student-led study group that pushed me to take on both course-related and social challenges. In terms of what I learned from the course content, I was always drawn to the Astronomy field because of my fascination with the interaction of art and science. This class helped me define the parts about Astronomy that correlated with my interest.",
    "I developed problem solving skills particularly in the field of physics and making best-estimate calculations for distances.",
    "A deep passion for astronomy.",
    "In this course, I applied basic physics equations we learned in lecture to solve problems about the universe. We covered ancient cosmology, our own solar system and galaxy, and the far reaches of our ever-expanding universe. I learned the difference between a pulsar and quasar, how we know what stars are made of, and what changes the appearances of interstellar objects here on Earth.",
    "I learned a lot about astronomy, which was interesting, but ultimately not super relevant to my life."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There is a lot of material that needs to be learned, but the textbook readings were very detailed and useful. During class, there could have been more interaction and involvement, but overall, it was a decent class.",
    "Strengths: Good textbook, passionate teacher, well organised (with class instructions available)\r\n\r\nWeakesses:",
    "Strengths: Professor Zinn is excellent, lectures were recorded which was helpful, weekly quizzes helped to ensure no one slacks off, PSETs were relevant to the material covered in class and looked like the final exam, structure of the course was very well-thought-out (in a manner that facilitated understanding)\r\nWeaknesses: the readings assigned were too much; considering the pace of the summer session, it was nearly impossible to get the readings done in time, especially for people juggling 2 YSS classes or an internship with this class. It would have been ideal if we were assigned excerpts that were important. Also, the Wednesday deadline to turn in the PSET was too rushed, especially for students who can't get support in a discussion section because of clashes with other classes\/internships or time zone differences, and so need more time to engage with the material and try the PSET problems.",
    "I think the problem sets, quizzes, and final exam were structured really well and did a good job covering the important information and concepts. I liked the polls, but they got less frequent towards the end of the course and they were a good level of engagement and participation in class and I wish they had continued to be incorporated.",
    "I felt like the questions on the homework sets were one of the most helpful parts of the course. Really helped to solidify the fundamentals of each chapter\/lesson. A couple of the lectures could run a little ling and certain subjects are a little dry, but overall good class.",
    "I gotta say I was NOT excited when I saw the incredibly dense schedule of classes, but in the end I was really glad we got to spend so much time learning and discussing, and I'm also amazed by the professor and TFs' willingness to be present and engaged for every second of it!",
    "The course is a manageable science credit for non-STEM majors. The content was interesting, and the calculations were not too hard, even for someone who hates math. The schedule of the quizzes and homework made for a helpful structure. I stopped doing the textbook readings after the first week and just looked to the textbook for clarification while doing the homework, because the content in class seemed repetitive of the textbook, and class discussions were the basis of our assessments. The short breaks in the middle of the class helped me to stay focused.",
    "If you are genuinely curious about astronomy and are willing to read the material from the textbook and beyond, I think this is a good course because the professor is extremely knowledgable and can explain any phenomenon in depth. However, I found the lectures to be a little bit incoherent in a sense that I often observed how some foundational and basic building blocks in our discussions were ommited by the professor during the lectures, which I am sure made the comprehension of this new material more difficult for people who took their first astro class. I often wondered \"How did we arrive to this conversation? Did we even define what the phenomenon at hand was?\". If you read the textbook in advance (as you are actually meant to do), there will be no issue with this since lectures build on the material very well, but without doing the reading in the textbook in advance, you might feel lost from the lectures alone, which is not great for people who just want to fulfill their SC requirement. But if you do the readings, the professor's lecture will add depth to what is said in the textbook, and you will have no problem. Just start doing all the readings from the very beginning.  \r\n\r\nBesides that, the professor and the TAs were really nice and were always willing to help.",
    "The strength of the course is that its really fascinating and the material is really cool. The classs weakness is that it just covers too much material for an introductory course.",
    "There was nothing in particular that I can say are really strong or weak about this course, but the only thing I think should be reconsidered is the misleading course name: 'Galaxies and the Universe\". There should at least be some mention of an introduction to astrophysics, and a much greater emphasis on the mathematics part of this course; I did not mind that there was math involved, but a few other students have also mentioned during study group session that they were surprised by the ratio of math to concepts in both quiz and homework assignments. I also think that Canvas should be updated; like every other course, the day to day agenda tends to get off track. However, this was never updated (and we were a few days behind for a while), but the textbook readings were never moved back so it kept us all guessing which class corresponded with which chapter\/class coverage.",
    "Great professor. Great topic. Not enough time.",
    "All of the lecture material was presented in detailed and clear PowerPoint presentations that were easy to follow and very helpful for reviewing. Prof. Zinn was a really good professor. He seems to know a bit of everything with regards to astronomy, whether it be the history of the field or the current attempts at solving the dark matter problem. The only weakness of this course is a lack of depth with regards to the extent certain topics were covered. This is very much an introductory course and I almost wish that some of the physics we learned was more advanced.",
    "I really liked this course, although the lectures could be dry at times."

    "Yes, especially if they were interested in astrology and cosmology, although it is a lot of readings that are pertinent to the course.",
    "Hm, maybe? It depends. For a science credit for non-science majors, it was definitely more complex than I'd anticipated. But it was also enjoyable sometimes.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This course is excellent for anyone who is interested in astronomy because it gives a great overview of the history, current understanding, and future possibilities of astronomical discoveries. It covers a range of relevant and interesting topics like black holes and dark matter. The course is not so general that you would feel like you didn't learn much, but it is also not so challenging that it feels impossible. Professor Zinn is also an excellent instructor. I really enjoyed myself and feel I learned a lot!",
    "Yes, good way to get a science credit or get into astronomy. It covers a wide range of interesting topics, and space is cool.",
    "Yes; it's a good science credit that you actually learn something in, and it's structured well.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in learning the basics of the universe, as well as students who are not scientifically or mathematically inclined but need the credit.",
    "I would recommend this class to people with genuine interest in Astronomy or\/and people who took physics in AP or IB or just love Physics because being profficient with Physics and Math made everything much easier. On the other hand, if you are not a science person and are looking for a class with little intellectual challenge, a class where you can easily get 100% of the material from just attending lectures, I would not recommend this class.",
    "See above.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to a non-STEM major and especially STEM majors, because all the material is accessible, and I think that anyone would find it interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this specifically to other high school students simply for the valuable college class experience. I would recommend this specific class to people who have\/will be taking a physics course, are proficient at math, and have an interest in the basic chemistry, history, and structure of the universe.",
    "Sure. I'm not a huge fan of the summer session model, but during the school year, would recommend.",
    "I think this course would be interesting to anyone who has even a vague interest in astronomy because it covers a wide array of topics in the field. However, for anyone wanting an intellectual challenge or someone who has already begun to learn about the cosmos, I would not recommend this course because it serves as a very basic introduction to the field.",
    "Yes, since I learned a lot of interesting information about something outside of my normal studies and found the TAs and professor very accommodating."
