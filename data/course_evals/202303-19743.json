                "The strength of this course was that it taught me the importance of putting in the hours to fulfill my vision of a project and the brainstorming process, and how important it was to come in with a plan before coming into the press. It also taught me the ability to come back from ideas and learn how to think of different innovative ways to see my idea or creation come to life in the printing press. The only con I would say is that in terms of structure I feel like it was hard to have enough time to do the final book project, and the essay in the mist of finals week , but yet again, I do not acknowledge that typography and printing is a lengthy process."
