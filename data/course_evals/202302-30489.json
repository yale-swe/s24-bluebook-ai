That being said, I do believe making the writing tutors available on more than 2 days during the summer would be highly beneficial since more often than not, I wouldn't be able to meet with a writing tutor before the submission of my essay due to very few timeslots available. The course included a lot of different pieces of writing to reference and learn about and they spanned a multitude of subject areas. However, I do wish we had the chance to watch the movies\/clips we were assigned since sometimes they were unavailable or we had to pay for them."
