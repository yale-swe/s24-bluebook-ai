                "We read western histories beginning with the first records of Greek historians (i.e. Herodotus, Thucydides) and ending with Roman theologians. I gained a fairly nuanced understanding of most texts on the reading list, which leaves me feeling confident in my ability to read and contextualize history from almost any time period. There was a special emphasis on drawing conclusions about the nature of humans and human societies from the various authors, as well as identifying the aims, motives, and limitations of historians' perspectives.",
                "I learned a lot about political philosophy and ideas on regime types, laws, leadership, free will, divine powers. I also got better at writing essays on these topics",
                "I learned about various ancient Greek and Roman perspectives on political science and history.",
                "I learned how to consider multiple sources and draw trends across thinkers and time periods. Not only did I learn specifics about Ancient Greece, the rise and fall of Rome, and the development of monotheistic faiths, but I became able to trace patterns of political regimes, justice, power, philosophy, God, the city, and other political themes.",

                "I loved this course! Professor Wilford was extremely knowledgable and prepared for every class. She did a great job facilitating discussion. My favorite thing about this course was that Prof Wilford would also deeply consider students' questions and opinions and give them a well-thought-out response.",
                "This course naturally requires a balance between historical and political thought, along with lecture and class discussion, and this balance was struck excellently throughout the semester.",
                "The reading list in this course is, for the most part, exhilarating. These historians are remarkably skillful writers and much of the reading is entertaining. However, the focus of the course is historical and political \"thought.\" It often felt that the history itself was being glossed over, and we were instead going straight to the conclusions we glean from it. This meant that only a tiny fraction of the assigned reading would be focused on in section. In DS, it's impossible to read everything, and because only some of the reading actually felt \"required\" for this course, I would often skip/skim much of the H&P reading. I probably got as much out of the texts operating this way as I would have reading every word, but a lot of the joy of reading these works was lost. The skimming is almost unavoidable with such a massive reading list, but pointing us to an hour's worth (or so) of crucial reading within the assigned reading for each discussion would be helpful.",
                "This course was great overall. The material was super interesting, Professor Wilfordss mini lectures at the beginning of each class were very helpful, and our class discussions were always very engaging. Shes a bit of a harsher grader than my other DS professors but shes lovely to talk to during office hours and will always offer helpful feedback.",
                "Though I enjoyed this course overall, I felt that it really should be split into two courses: one for political science and one for history. It was sometimes difficult to figure out how to connect the political science texts to the history texts, and much of the content of the histories was overlooked in favor of discussing the political science texts. That is probably inevitable given how quickly we had to move through the texts, but it is my only major criticism of the class. Otherwise, it was wonderful, and I got a lot out of the discussions.",
                "I feel as though it hasn't quite found its footing yet, it can't tell if it's a history class or a literature class or something else entirely.",
                "The books were really interesting and certainly all relevant and engaging. However, I only really understood the big picture in studying for the final. It would be nice if more time could be built into the reading schedule for consolidation and overarching reflection at the end, so as a class we could spend time synthesizing ideas. Also, the first half of class sometimes felt more like a lecture, and when we did have a discussion, we'd get off on some irrelevant tangent that not everyone would want to speak on. It would have been better if class time had been divided into sections where we decided from the class certain things would get discussed in each section so we wouldn't leave class feeling like we missed half the important content.",
                "Strengths - It was very easy to contribute to the conversation. The professor spent part of the beginning of class setting the context for the works we were discussing, which made the class a lot less daunting\r\nWeakness - I felt like a lot of the H&P readings we did revolved around the same topics, which made discussions a little boring at times since some of the writers agree with each other on certain points.",
                "The curriculum of this course did feel a bit all over the place at times, as if we were trying to cram political science into things written before the field of political science existed. For example, reading Exodus with a focus on the system of government developed in the desert and the significance of the law codes was a bit odd to me. However I still really appreciated all the individual pieces of literature we read. I think for this course, even more than the other two DS courses, professor really mattered. I was so lucky to get Professor Wilford who helped guide our class and gave us common threads and themes to focus on throughout the semester, continually referring back to one or more themes and connecting works across the course to create a more focused and cohesive experience. \r\nI do wish the readings assigned for this class were a bit shorter. The length made some of the assignments feel somewhat impossible, causing me to lose motivation, and the vast majority of what we read was never even discussed in class. I think this class could be improved by shortening some of the assignments."

                "Yes! Especially if you can get Professor Wilford as your professor.",
                "I would recommend this course as a way to gain a much deeper understanding of the political trends and historical agendas which began in antiquity and have guided so much of humanity's development.",
                "I would recommend this course because the reading list is truly great and will leave you with an understanding of ancient history and historiography that is rare for a freshman in college. But you will get out of this course what you put in. Of the DS courses, this is probably the one where you can most easily get away with skipping/skimming large portions of the reading. You really have to find that internal motivation to get through the H&P readings. But even if you end up skipping/skimming a lot of the reading, discussion sections and discussions outside of class with section-mates (especially during reading period!!!) can pick up the slack and leave you feeling satisfied. During the semester I never felt great about H&P but the process of studying for and taking the final showed me how much I learned and helped me deepen my understanding of each text. I'm glad I took H&P and recommend it.",
                "Absolutely, I would recommend DS and Professor Wilfords section. She is very sweet and easy to talk to and our sections were always really fun. She was super open to feedback on how the class was run as well. And DS is absolutely wonderful. I found all the H&P readings to be particularly interesting.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course. It offers a great overview of Greek/Roman thinkers (and history... but it really isn't focused on learning/discussing the specifics). It is interesting seeing how themes of political regimes, justice, God, etc. tie together and certainly shapes how you view the world.",
                "If you like history and learning about history in your free time, yes.",
                "Honestly, I would recommend this course just because I would recommend Directed Studies. After first semester I think it has the weakest focused curriculum, but the works themselves were incredible and definitely provided important context for the rest of DS. Thanks to Professor Wilford's guidance I also learned to read beyond the text, to read for the unwritten rules, cultural norms, laws, practices, and customs so crucial to understanding ancient societies. The reading load for this class was definitely a lot, more than either of the other two. It was so daunting that at times I couldn't even make myself start. But the reading itself was interesting!"
