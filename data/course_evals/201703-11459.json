    "This course would be improved if it were an hour and a half a day instead of nearly two hours, which is unbearable. None of us could concentrate for that long.",
    "Strengths:\r\n\r\nNot a huge work load outside of the classroom and small classroom size (5 people Fall 2017) make it a very good opportunity to learn a language with a great professor. The class really becomes very personal.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nHigh intensity during class and tests often, but that's to be expected with an intensive language"

    "Yes, if you are really determined to become fluent in Italian in as little time as possible. This class is two credits for a reason! Be prepared to spend almost two hours a day in class, and each week to do online homework, memorize about 120 vocabulary words and a couple of grammar concepts, and write a short essay (a couple of paragraphs). Since I love languages and really wanted to learn Italian, I had a lot of fun, but definitely had to put in the effort to prepare for all the exams-- ten regular exams and the 3-hour final.",
    "This course is fantastic but only if you're willing to put in the work to study for it. This is a class where you get out of it what you put into it, but Professor Iacovella is there to guide you through everything. I highly recommend it because of how small the class is and how personalized it becomes, something that's very beneficial to have in a language class."
