Sometimes, I felt a bit behind on my project though, and while the department has some recommendations as far as deadlines go, it varies from adviser to adviser on what they'll require from you.  It would be nice to have a class just about the senior essay like the year-long kids have for their first semester of the project.",

If a seminar will work for you to fulfill this requirement, then maybe choose that option instead?  PLSC 480 does require a lot of self-motivation though.",
