                "The professor's teaching style was a strength of this course, as he was always able to answer questions we had and stayed after class to help us with homework questions and our final project. \r\nA major weakness of this course was how long it took for each problem set to be graded. As a result, it would take a while before I knew what aspects I needed to improve in. A small weakness of the course is that the professor included questions in his slides for us to go over in class, but usually didn't include the answers in the slides. As such, when reviewing his slides for homeworks and exams, we would not know whether we were answering correctly or incorrectly if we didn't manage to write down the answer from class. I think this class would be improved with more guided problems during class on the slides.",
                "Great professor, material, and problem sets. Not as intensive and code-heavy as Id expect, which can be good or bad depending on who you ask.",
                "The strengths of this class are certainly Brian's enthusiasm and knowledge of statistics as well as the homeworks, which help understand the concepts very well. All notes and lectures are posted online, but that may have been a slight weakness as few people would attend the lectures. Another strength were our ULAs for the semester, who helped with homeworks generously. It was very easy to understand the concepts even without prior knowledge due to the logical progress that we made throughout the class, and Brian was helpful to clarify any material that wasn't clear or beyond the scope of the lecture.\r\n\r\nAmongst the weaknesses, I would say the lectures were sometimes not terribly engaging due to being largely based off of the notes/slides on the topic. Plus it was at 9AM so energy was low for much of the semester.",
                "Strengths: a decent introduction to the material\r\nWeaknesses: Going to class wasn't worth it because Professor Macdonald would just read what was on the slides. The explanations for concepts were really hard to understand, and it felt like the practical applications of what we were doing weren't explained. Generally, I didn't feel like I came away with much knowledge at all, and if anything, less interest in doing more statistics.",
                "More intensive, especially on R",
                "Strengths: Good survey of stats, good way to get familiar with R, great and knowledgable professor, reasonable workload and exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like it could have moved a bit faster so that we could have gotten to bootstrapping, ANOVA, and other important topics. Also more time could have been spent on doing regression calculations by hand so that we could have gotten a better conceptual intuition beyond mechanically creating models in R.",
                "lectures/course time needs more practice problems or applications of concepts. also, more r practice or gaining of R Studio proficiency really really needs to be taught. if knowledge of r isnt prerequisite for the class but then it is in our assignments and not even really taught to ushow are we supposed to know how to use it?!",
                "Give deeper explanation of the material.",
                "Because we were learning statistics concepts and application (coding) at the same time it was difficult to really grasp anything. If I had taken AP Stats in high school I might have been better off but with no prior knowledge I feel I didnt get very much out of the course",
                "The course was quite fast paced and did not go into much detail; a little hard to follow along",
                "Strengths - very accessible helpful professor, great TAs, well-designed exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses  especially with a course that focusses on fundamental concepts like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, they could be taught much better using real-world examples in class. What is bootstrapping? What does a confidence interval look like? What is a sample mean really - give examples for these. Some classes were far too slow (the introductions to probability in the first half) leaving less time to explore the fundamentals",
                "strength: the course is quite easy to manage\r\nweakness: maybe it's a bit too intro-like and I kind of hope it can go to a deeper level",
                "Strengths: professor was helpful and generous\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were a bit dry but otherwise give you a solid foundation in probability theory needed to work in R.",
                "The course is fine, but it could use an easily accessible calendar beforehand so that we are aware of midterm dates and things of that nature",
                "The course was aggressively fine. Lectures were not that engaging. Problem sets did serve to practice all the material that we would be assessed on. Office hours were incredibly useful and the main avenue I felt for engaging and improving my understanding of the material."

This is a good middle ground but needs to be changed to focus more on fundamental concepts in an illustrative way. I wish I came out of the class fully understanding what a p-value is but I don't.",

                "Not really. I went into it hoping that I would get a better understanding of the math behind stats from a computational perspective (i.e. splitting between the 100s and 230). However, it overly compromised on both of these with I felt not a really in depth evaluation of the statistics and very very basic R."
