    "I think I gained the ability to relate what I am learning in classrooms to the real world. I also improved my ability to speak in front of people.",
    "Having not written a single paper in high school, I absolutely despised the idea of taking such courses. Not only did this course teach me how to write academic papers, it also made me love the process of writing one! Studying and discussing the history of censorship was interesting as well, and the readings didn't disappoint either.",
    "I got better at evaluating arguments, and engaging with them. I also got a new appreciation for censorship and its exercise throughout human history.",
    "I became a stronger writer and debater  classes were all discussion-based, which was really helpful for learning how to pose arguments and respond to other people.",
    "In addition to writing and reading skills, I developed critical thinking skills as we discussed complicated topics.",
    "Helped me improve as a writer; however, took an odd approach in doing so."

   "comments": [
    "I liked this course a lot and thought the material was very interesting. It was clear that the professor was very committed to the course which was nice. However, sometimes he talked so much that we didn't really get to discuss things as a class. This was definitely partly due to the quiet nature of our group but I still think more group dialogue would have been nice. In addition, I didn't get a ton of feedback on my papers that I felt like improved my abilities as a writer.",
    "Strengths: prof is great. I really liked the class, I'm not sure how it could've been improved.",
    "I think the structure of the course started very organized and gradually unraveled a bit. Prof. Robinson is so helpful and funny that you just end up getting wrapped up in his stories.",
    "A strength is that the topics we discussed were fascinating and relevant. They really made me think about the nuances of censorship."

    "I would recommend this course to a student who wanted to take an interesting class, but wasn't looking to be a humanities major. I enjoyed the class I just wish that my writing improved more.",
    "Yes, take this class. Prof. Robinson is really great and the topic is fascinating. There really isn't a reason to take this class. It's a nice seminar setting and great way to do a WR credit. You will end up discussing a lot of really interesting and relevant issues.",
    "Yes! My writing improved and the subject matter is so interesting. From Supreme Court cases to NYT op-eds, the class is simply fascinating no matter who you are.",
    "This is a great course for not only writing and reading, but also critical thinking.",
    "If you need to learn how to write, this is your course."
