                "This class was a tremendous joy. I do not think I have ever been as engaged by course content before. Professor Koblentz-Stenzler led some of the most empathetic and thoughtful conversations I have ever taken part in, which was remarkable considering the weight of the subject matter. Yale does not have many seminars that work to really understand other people -- especially those at the fringes of society. I am so glad this is being taught. One of the interesting components was most people in the class had a personal connection to the far-right (usually family members who have fallen for conspiracy theories), which made for an admirable and uncommon level of empathy and perspective in the room. Professor Koblentz-Stenzler was clearly captured and engaged by every point made by students, which was so incredibly encouraging. This class is a must take. \r\n\r\nThis course was not easy. By that, I do not mean the grading was unfair. I mean that the content was really hard. We were warned of this. But the midterm project, which required investigating a far-right group, was a sobering experience. It was one of the most emotionally challenging things I have ever done. I am so much stronger for it -- but I just want other students to know: Expect to be challenged in this way. I admire the strength of everyone in that class.",
                "Yes, it was interesting.",
                "Yes! Liram is an incredibly insightful lecturer, and she made it worthwhile to come to seminar each week. The class had immediate applications to the political sphere of Fall 2023: Liram adapted some of the lectures to give more context to the Israel-Hamas war, and her treatment of the material was level-handed and quite informative. I came out of the class with a far more in-depth understanding of extremist movements than one could glean from the NYT or WSJ, and it'll greatly help inform my viewpoint on modern politics.",
                "I think the content of this class is incredibly interesting , but i think it's logistical shortcomings are enough of a reason to not take this class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! No matter what your major is, it's important to be a smart consumer of online content and be able to identify content that seems harmless but is connected to far-right and antisemitic groups.",
