                "Speaking in a classroom setting, concise academic writing",
                "The combination of first and second semesters in H&P provides insight on the development of ideas and political systems across time and provided nuance to my perception on human nature. I encountered various theories about the best form of regimes (in terms of security\/effectiveness vs morality\/rights), the relationship between the sovereign and the people, societal values, matters of justice, civil rights and morality and much more. The relevance to present world affairs felt even more apparent than during first semester.  Skills  I continued to hone the same skills as first semester - reading and writing well and quickly, critical thinking, group discussions."

            "comments": [
                "I really appreciated that Professor Schweiger posted all of the readings, including exact sections and page numbers, on the syllabus; some of my other professors would only tell us verbally, in class, which made in harder to plan ahead.",
                "Strengths: wonderful instructor; very engaging material with lots to discuss; great introduction to modern political theory\r\nWeaknesses: heavy reading load and quick pace, but this is a general aspect of DS",
                "Strengths: The H&P instructors often have extensive backgrounds in scholarship surrounding some of the authors on the syllabus, which really enriches the course. For example, Prof. Schweiger's knowledge of Marx and his contemporaries was helpful to understanding the texts we read in DS, which often referenced works like The German Ideology that were not on the syllabus. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures greatly varied in quality, but overall they were informative.",
                "The number of texts on the syllabus and the pace at which we went through them often left me feeling like we didnt get to discuss important parts of the texts. I think removing a few texts could go a long way, as well as thinking about which texts need to be on the syllabus (and what is implied by the inclusion (or exclusion) of certain texts). The text that continued to come up in lectures was The Wretched of the Earth by Fanon, but there are other texts which might also be worth including (especially non-Anglo\/American texts)",
                "I enjoyed the material and the schedule for the course",
                "The texts were fascinating, my fellow students were engaged and contributed to stimulating discussions, and Prof. Schweiger was an incredible instructor. \r\nThe primary challenges with this course are inherent to DS as a program committed to covering foundational texts in intellectual history - On the one hand, a relatively demanding but rewarding workload. On the other hand - I'd always wish we could have spend more time on some thinkers, while wondering what other thinkers could have been incorporated into the curriculum, but without feeling like any particular thinker we've covered is dispensible."

                "Absolutely. The material in the second semester of DS H&P is fascinating and engaging, and lays a very strong foundation for understanding contemporary political systems. Prof. Schweiger is an amazing instructor and makes the material come alive.",
                "Yes, I absolutely would recommend this course  the fast pace can be challenging at times, but Professor Schweigers teaching makes the class worth it.",
                "Yes! In DS in general, the community that one develops is excellent and quite tight-knit. Academics wise, DS experiences vary greatly depending on instructor and section, so I would recommend closely reading course evaluations before choosing which professor to take classes with. In my case, Professor Schweiger's section was a great learning experience, and my section became good friends with each other because of how open and inclusive the section was.",
                "Yes",
                "If you enjoyed DS first semester - absolutely! DS was an eye-opening, transformative experience for me and this section was consistently wonderful. Prof. Schweiger is a caring and brilliant instructor. She provides fascinating insights and guides the discussion masterfully while encouraging the students to grow as thinkers by actively participating and interacting with each other's insights."
