                "I learned the must-know works of French literature and its authors",
                "I learned how to analyze and interpret French literature through a more sophisticated fashion. I also gained skills in writing more formal analyses of the literature we read, which I had never done before since none of the prior French classes I had taken required formal papers, and I developed the ability to do research of my own on certain authors or topics that we did not have the chance to explore further in class, using French sources.",
                "A lot of knowledge on the artistic value and literary techniques of a wide range of French writers/authors. This was an excellent intro to French literature class, and the readings also required us to understand the French philosophy behind the words, which was a great addition to the learning experience."

                "Strengths: The readings were all very interesting and the discussions we had were always fascinating. The workload is very reasonable and the readings are so enjoyable.\r\nWeaknesses: None! I loved this class.",
                "Strength: great overview of French literature. If this is what you're looking forward, great class. Also a good transition from lower level French classes.",
                "Strengths: we were given a lot of historical and personal context to all of the authors we covered and the movements in which they were involved, the class covers a large span of time so it was always interesting to see how styles and movements evolved from or contrasted each other, we had a good mix of diverse authors and many different genres of text (prose, plays, poems, etc.), and I really enjoyed the presentation we had to do at the end since it was such a fulfilling task to tackle a work on my own and have to piece together the meaning and significance of the text in relation to the author's experiences and their other works \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: essentially none; sometimes I wish we had more time to go more in depth with certain texts, but I recognize that since this course is meant to be a survey of French literature over many centuries, that is not really an option, and I think Madame Sanjabi did a great job at leading thought provoking and nuanced discussions despite the time constraints.",
                "Strength: Mme Sanjabi was a great teacher, she is just such as a kind, understanding and knowledgeable teacher. Some of the topics of the curriculum weren't of personal interest to me, but Mme Sanjabi made it exciting to learn them."

                "This course felt as I imagine any seminar would have felt in-person even thought it was through Zoom.

                "I thought the Zoom lectures were fine, a bit long to sit down but we actually always had a shortage of time at end of class (always had more to talk about the reading), so I think it just has to be in-person."

                "Yes; it's a lowkey course where you can learn about French literature without worrying too much about workload/too much reading.",
                "Definitely take this class! It is such a great starting point for someone who has not read much French literature and is working to improve their written and verbal French skills. The class is chill and so enjoyable, but you will learn so much and improve your French.",
                "Yes. Great overview of French literature in French language. Does not feel too overwhelming although we do read some serious works. Do take because the workload is manageable and, in the end, you will be say that you read certain works and know famous French writers",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in French literature! Madame Sanjabi is amazing and very open to hearing all kinds of different interpretations, and I genuinely enjoyed listening to how all my classmates interpreted our readings. The readings are all very manageable in terms of complexity and length, and the selection is so diverse, so nothing ever felt repetitive. The papers are a manageable length, and Madame Sanjabi offers a variety of topics to choose from, so it's always easy to find one that speaks to you. The fact that the first draft of the paper is corrected for grammatical errors but not graded really helped with making the papers seem less daunting and also allowed me to really focus on my actual content. Overall, this course was super accessible for someone like me who never had any prior experience with French literature, and the focus really is on fostering interest and developing skills than finding the \"right\" interpretation.",
                "Yes, if you're a French student you should take this course, and I can say that if you take this course with Mme Sanjabi and you are engaged, you will get a lot out of it, and a basic understanding of French literature from 12th century to modern literature and the techniques they use as well as the philosophy and thinking behind their writings."
