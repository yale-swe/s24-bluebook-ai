    "A thorough discussion of modern Italian history, beginning in the late 1930s\/early 1940s with World War II. I learned a lot about Italy in the four decades between World War II and \"la strage di Bologna\" in 1980, with an emphasis on the critical reading of primary sources and the analysis of contemporary issues through the lens of mid-20th century Italy. My written and spoken Italian improved dramatically through this course, and my vocabulary also grew significantly. I absolutely loved the emphasis on not only proper grammar, but also correct style. It was really cool to start writing more like an Italian and less like an American with access to a dictionary and Google Translate.",
    "I learned how to better express myself in written and spoken Italian. I also learned a lot about contemporary italian history through the lenses of Italian social movements.",
    "I improved my Italian language skills while also learning about a subject I didn't know anything about before (modern Italian history).",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of Italian history from the middle of WWII through the beginning of the 1980s that has changed my perceptions and informed my understanding of the backstory and the current state of affairs in the country.  It has also inspired me to look into the events of this period more deeply, and to seek out information on the intermittent thirty years of political and cultural turmoil within Italy between 1980 (when the period that the course covered ends) and now.",
    "Knowledge of history of post world war Italy, mostly seen from a sociological point of view.",
    "This course enabled  me to develop insights on a vast array of central questions regarding Italian history. These insights, which the course developed through thought provoking presentations and assignments, provided me with a better understanding of the implications of the North\/South divide, migration, decolonization, and of the youth, worker, and feminist movements of the 1970s. The course's use of Italian-language primary sources also provided me with the incredible opportunity to be exposed to Italian academic writing for the first time.",
    "I became a much better writer and reader in Italian"

    "The subject matter in this course, and the instructor, were undoubtedly the highlights of the course for me. Serena is incredibly passionate about teaching, and it is evident in her carefully crafted lessons. We went on several edifying and entertaining field trips, including to the Beinecke to work with 1960s documents from the Italian counterculture and to the Yale Farm to discuss the role of domestic labor in Italian society. It's also fascinating to learn about a country with such a robust and dynamic history - Italy transformed dramatically, multiple times, from 1940 to 1980. The only weaknesses that I can think of are us not having enough time to delve deeply into some topics (we spent a lot of time on the years around World War 2, but very little on the 1970s) and the assignments being very backloaded (three of the five compositions fell within the last month of the course, and two of them were quite long). The course was incredible - I wish it would last another semester.",
    "Strengths of the course  so many. Italian history delves deep into the seminal social movements that comprise the socio-political history of Italy. The learning was interdisciplinary and there were often very interactive lessons that made retaining the information easy and fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course  there are a lot of assignments which didn't all feel necessary to gauging my knowledge of the course material.",
    "I really liked how this course took advantage of the many resources Yale has to offer. We had a great week of sessions where we went to the Art Gallery, Beinecke, and Farm. That was great because it provided a more relaxed environment and made me feel more comfortable speaking Italian.\r\n\r\nI also appreciated that Serena was very thoughtful about each of her students. For each assignment, she wrote a variety of prompts so we could have the flexibility of choosing which one best suited us. She also met with me individually to talk about how to improve my language skills.",
    "The timeline of the class can be improved. A lot of assignments ended up being all crammed in at the end.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course and I was happy I decided to take it over other L5 Italian options.  Its strength was its format, focusing largely on discussion between a small group of students, in Italian, of the material and often branching off into related discussions on current affairs in Italy.  My favorite moments in this course were those when Prof. Bassi would lead an all-class discussion, allowing students to build upon, contest, and engage with the ideas of their peers.  These were the best moments because they usually came after the class had been exposed to new material, and they allowed us to process and digest that material and its implications (both in the past and the present) as a group.  Prof. Bassi often asked provocative questions directed specifically at individual students.  Students, I believe, were free to pass up answering, but we rarely did because we appreciated how these questions made us concentrate and articulate a reasoned answer.  I enjoyed watching Prof. Bassi distribute these questions and guide the discussion; I enjoyed answering these questions when called upon, as they gave me a chance to practice my Italian conversational skills in a way that required some measure of precision and thought; I enjoyed when Prof. Bassi fielded inquisitive questions from students which nearly always provoked an intriguing bit of background or a fascinating tangential discussion.  This was by far the strength of the course; perhaps I found it so refreshing because I have not taken a large number of seminar classes, but this type of dialogue combined with the Professor's openness to facilitate a flowing, changing discussion allowed for more learning, I think, than a strict lecture format would have.  \r\n\r\nThere were no explicit weaknesses about this course besides a few elements of its structure.  Personally, for as much as I enjoyed the group discussion, I disliked when Prof. Bassi broke the class into small groups of twos or threes and asked us to discuss something among ourselves.  I found these groups did not often conduct a truly inclusive conversation and that they often ran out of things to say.  Although I can definitely understand its potential merits, I feel that forcing students to converse and engage with the material in this specific format is largely counterproductive and that learning would be better facilitated by larger group participation.\r\n\r\nI also found that the assigning and completion of homework was a bit unusual.  I did not mind that many of the assignments we were asked to complete were ungraded, but I would have liked to receive feedback on them nonetheless, especially the written ones.  I  saw feedback for only a few ordinary homework assignments, and we never received word on grades or feedback for three of the four essays we wrote.  Additionally, I thought homework was assigned in a poor way.  I mean to say that it was not always clear what we were expected to do, when we were expected to do it by, and where we would find the materials and resources either necessary or helpful in completing our homework.  \r\n\r\nAs I am still seeking to improve my written Italian, my main complaint is that regarding the lack of feedback.  The homework assignment issue was simply something that I think could have been done a bit more efficiently.",
    "One of the course's principal strengths was its ability to connect the many historical themes of the post-war era to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of this critical period in Italian history. I always felt that our assignments were focused on not only increasing our knowledge of this time period but in developing a critical lense with which to regard the events that we read about. The focus on class discussion and taking the time to dive deeply into each theme of the class was also a major strength.",
    "Great class discussions",
    "Well taught, focus on writing and improving writing in Italian"

    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any students interested in improving their Italian skills, learning about 20th century Italy (which should be everyone, since Italy's postwar history is fascinating and incredibly dynamic), or simply cooking some pizza in an old fashioned brick oven. Serena is probably the most dedicated professor I've had at Yale, and that alone makes the course a must-take.",
    "Definitely. Italian History was a great course and for anyone interested in southern Europe, or contemporary European politics, this course is a homerun hit.",
    "Yes, definitely. Serena is a great and creative teacher who has a good ability to keep students engaged.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is seriously interested in learning about some of the cultural forces that shaped and continue to play a role in shaping Italian society.  I found this course extremely interesting as we progressed through an examination of Italian history from a number of different angles, including through the eyes of civilians during the end of the war, Jews, resistance writers, Fascist cooperatives, social action leaders, and marginalized groups.  I enjoyed how our coverage of history touched on so many different areas, from the bloodshed of the war and chaos of the new government that formed afterward, to the advancement of Italian industry, to the social revolutions of the 60's and terrorism of the 70's.  My only regret is that I wish some areas could have been covered in more depth.",
    "Absolutely if interested in Italian or European history.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I say this because this course provides truly captivating insights on the transformations that occurred in Italy during the postwar era.  The class created the perfect environment to grapple with difficult concepts while developing a strong understanding of the driving forces in Italian history in this period.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Couldnt recommend this class highly enough. It really made me more interested in contemporary Italy."
