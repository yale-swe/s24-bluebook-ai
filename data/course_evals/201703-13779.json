    "GREAT COURSE! Looked forward to it every day! Probably the one thing that could have been improved is that the textbook is not incredible and we could have used more outside work to have more language practice."

    "I LOVED THIS CLASS! Sabrina was a fantastic teacher and I genuinely looked forward to going to class every day. Also, Portuguese is a ridiculous and great language and I'm so glad I fairly randomly decided to take it (already finished my language requirement taking French). In comparison, much less worse than the French classes here (can't speak to other language departments), but I still feel like I have a good grasp of the basics of Portuguese!",
