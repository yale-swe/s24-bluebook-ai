                "strengths: econometrics is a cool topic\r\n\r\nweaknesses: where do I begin...\r\nthe professor provides no notes or class materials. The only \"learning\" in this class consists of the professor writing on the chalkboard and then promptly erasing it. If you miss what he wrote, tough luck\r\nI don't mean to be offensive, but I could not understand what the professor was saying 80% of the time due to his accent, adding another layer of difficulty to lectures\r\nlectures are not recorded, so you really have no reference if you miss something\r\nclass is as difficult as a math class, yet on the awful grading curve of the economics department. There are only 20-30 other students and they all act hyper-competitive because every single one of them is determined to be on top of the curve",
                "Strenghts: great mix of theory and practice; psets were interesting; sections were great; Prof. Kim often reviews previous lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: could be heavier on the math at times; lectures can be fast-paced",
                "Strengths: material was reviewed in class, which meant that even though the material was difficult and often not intuitive, we learned by practicing it over multiple lectures, problem sets and sections. The class is well-structured, and from the problem sets and practice exams, it was clear what we were expected to learn and internalize. The problem sets were difficult, but there was an incredible amount of support in office hours and TA sections, so the work always felt manageable. Weaknesses: There were no notes or slides posted for this class, and while the textbook was helpful, it didn't exactly follow what we were learning for lecture.",
                "Weaknesses: NO notes, Min just writes on chalk and we blindly copy things down, explanations could be valuable\r\nStrengths: TA Bjoern",
                "Well taught class with empirical examples to accompany really strong theoretical foundations",
                "Strengths: Comprehensive coverage of topics around linear regression and its many variations. You'll cover a lot, and the vast majority of content is relevant.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Kim lectures quite quickly, so if you're a slower notetaker, you might simply miss out on some content. After he erases the board, the only way for you to see it again is to borrow classmates' notes. That can become troublesome if you need to borrow notes often. Prof Kim usually doesn't post his notes on Canvas - that was the biggest weakness for me.",

                "Outstanding course, its challenging in nature but it rewards hard work and taking time outside of class to review the material on ones own will pay dividends",
                "I think overall the course does a good job of addressing a wide breath of concepts and laying an econometric foundation. It helps you understand the theory behind a lot of things, so your understanding is well rounded. Although the psets tried to address this, I think though that I could have benefited from more coding practice because I still feel a little unequipped to do anything more than the most baseline econometric work/applications in reality, even if I understand the theory. Also, sometimes lectures are so math/proof heavy that it can be easy to get lost.",

                "Unless you are a Econ-Math major who already knows everything about Econometrics and lacks a capacity for human empathy, do not take this class. I completed the course in part because I felt a deep responsibility to warn those thinking about taking ECON 136 in the future. I am a martyr and you're all welcome for my sacrifice. As all econ classes are, this one is graded on a curve. There are only about 25 students taking the class and they're all uber-smart gunners who would probably be willing to kill a family member for an A. I feel justified in saying this because several students consistently displayed rude behavior and even purposefully distracted others during lecture and tests to gain a competitive advantage. \r\n\r\nOn top of this, most of them seem to already know the subject before even starting the courseI say this because some would never come to class and there was absolutely no class material posted outside of the lectures. There was no other way they could've learned the material. Despite being the equivalent of a 200-300's level math class, your transcript will show that you took a 100 level econ course (likely with a poor grade) as your reward for all the pain and suffering. \r\n\r\nBut maybe you're just a smart little robot who derives pleasure from crushing everyone else's hopes and dreamsin that case this class is for you.",
                "Yes. Good mix of theory and practice. Will definitely learn a lot about regression",
                "If you are interested in gaining an in-depth knowledge of econometrics and the theory behind it, then I would recommend this course. Otherwise, this class will be very dry and possibly overwhelming as it is very easy to feel like you're falling behind.",

                "Great course with Min",
                "Take it with a good professor if you can. The instructor really matters for a course like this. If you have a dry lecturer, the classes just drag on and on. If you have an inspiring lecturer, you'll be motivated and excited to learn.",
                "Yes. Went into this class thinking it was gonna be a drag, but honestly it was very enjoyable. Essential for anyone who is doing economics-y stuff and is looking to go into a quantitative field. The class gives you a solid theoretical understanding of basic linear regressions, as well as the practical skills to read papers and implement methods yourself. Being good at math and having seen a proof before certainly helps, but in terms of specific background you don't really need much save for basic stats (S&DS 242 type stuff), a class in linear algebra, and the ability to take a derivative.",
                "Absolutely, tough and engaging but Bjoern and Min were incredible, and the content is actually quite interesting and applicable; just be mindful and patient with a steep learning curve",
                "I think if you want to get a good theoretical foundation in econometrics, it does a good job. It's also required for a lot of people. The class is very math heavy, which can be hard to get used to in the outset but I ended up adjusting by the end and it felt more doable.",
                "No, unless it's a required course for you. The professor taught it badly and the course material is very dense.",
