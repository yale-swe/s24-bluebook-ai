While I learnt a great amount from listening to my classmates speaks, I wish more time could have been spent on hearing the professor's voice and having her lead the discussion a little bit more than just the student leaders.",
                "i really liked the weekly reading responses, they definitely kept me accountable in doing the work for the seminar. the final project was also super flexible and i definitely got a lot out of it! everyone's final papers were also really diverse, and learning about this new field was definitely insightful. since the material was super new everyone was really interested in the topics and very engaged in class discussions.\r\n\r\ni do think we wasted WAY too much time going over each other's paper outlines for the midterm, as prof tahir required as to (it took up basically 3 weeks, which i think could've been used for discussion). one solution if this course is offered next semester is a graded group peer review i think."
