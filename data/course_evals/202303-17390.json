                "It taught me how to think about the intricacies of engineering systems that utilize natural resources in a cyclical manner to sustain a growing human population.",
                "I learned about the entire process of wastewater and air quality treatment, as well as basic organic chemistry since this was my first science class at Yale.",
                "I learned to apply chemistry concepts to solve real world environmental engineering problems. Learned how to do a Mass Balance, a universally applicable tool!",
                "I learned basics about environmental quality standards and how our daily lives are affected by environmental engineering. I learned about how humanity has tried to mitigate our impact on nature.",
                "I feel like this class gave me a good review of the parts of chem 2 that I felt the most shaky about. Lots of mass balance and a good understanding of where we are as a society when it comes to environmental engineering.",

Professor Fortner would typically provide historical context for all of his lessons to show the progress we have made to address public health risks. The course also relied heavily on chemistry concepts and reinforced them through problem sets. I was most surprised by the fact that seemingly complex environmental processes can be simplified (for our purposes) to easily adaptable physical and algebraic laws.",

                "Tests are based mostly on psets, so most of the material you have to learn is from the psets, which are mostly calculations of environmental structures. These structures actually felt more like civil engineering ones (water treatment plants especially), but calculations are mostly based on mass balance and specific formulas, which is what you focus on studying for the exams. Fortner's lectures were very interesting and I loved learning about historical environmental disasters, but they were usually briefly touched on and never on exams."

            "comments": [
                "The textbook was awful you have to search for the formulas you need to use, and it's not always super helpfully laid out. That said, if you're willing to put the work in, you can understand the material fine.",
                "Professor did not actually go over material covered in exams during lecture. It was more so focused on the field of environmental engineering as a whole. That said if you don't mind learning material on your own outside of class go for it.",
                "strengths: interesting content, amazing professor\r\nweaknesses: none really\r\nthe psets & tests are hard but this is Yale, what do you expect? this course is challenging in the right way\r\nthe professor also gives you an extra credit optional paper to write at the end. literally just free points.",
                "Strengths: test structures I love. The closed notes and open notes sections complemented each other well and made me feel like I wasn't wasting study time on pointless things.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A main weakness is the textbook, which organizes its quantitative information horribly, with most useful material being located in the example problems rather than the body of the text. This disorientation is expounded by lectures that basically make no attempt to explain any of the quantitative side of things. I think the lectures could spend less time riffing on random, albeit interesting, topical information that isn't on the test, and get a bit more into the nitty gritty of  breaking down the quant stuff and how to do it.",
                "One strength of the course was John's enthusiasm and excitement for all the material.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course was the way that the material was presented. John  would click through slides too quickly for me to write down/retain information - it felt like we rushed through some material while taking too much time on other concepts that we weren't tested on. In addition, there wasn't much structure or feedback (no review sessions, no exams returned with information, etc.). I also felt a bit disconnected to what we were learning - in the beginning of the semester we had talked about going on field trips, but none ever happened. (I do think that this is because of some stuff John had unrelated to this class this semester.)",
                "Strengths; covers a large variety of material, interesting and relevant lectures, reasonable workload\r\nWeaknesses; sometimes brings in complex multi-variable mathematical equations out of seemingly nowhere; although time is already too little in a broad course like this, it would have aided in developing the methods of thought underlying the equations and the interactions of different variables",
                "This course gave a fantastic overview of the environmental engineering field and provided a solid basis for quantitive problem solving. Strengths: enthusiastic instructor, engaging lectures, fair assessments. Weaknesses: out-of-date textbook; never received feedback on any exams; no opportunities for engagement other than attending lectures and submitting textbook problems.",
                "I think that the teaching was great and we covered a lot of content in the class. I think it might have been helpful to have teaching fellows for the course to have smaller discussion sections during the week.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fortner is such a wonderful guy and is very kind / willing to work with you. The course content was also interesting and applicable to the real world since we're experiencing many of the effects of climate change right now.\r\nWeaknesses: I personally didn't love how quickly we moved through the content and would have liked to focus more on a specific concept that's important for future ENVE classes (like mass balance), but I understand that this is a survey course that needs to cover a great deal of information. I also wished we went through more examples during class time. Lastly, I really think this course needs a new textbook; the textbook is incredibly old and outdated while also containing errors.",
                "The lectures oftentimes felt rushed and lacked a level of depth that would have helped me absorb the material better. The professor sometimes was soft spoken so perhaps a mic during lectures would be best.",
                "I thin this course is very good at covering an equal amount of concept/legislation about environmental engineering, as well as actual engineering problems themselves.",
                "The graded assignments had a strong emphasis on technical/mathematical problem solving, but professor focused on more conceptual ideas in class. For problem sets and exams I self taught most of the problem solving techniques",
                "Strengths: Textbook available for free on Canvas, curved tests, real-world examples, great test prep given\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures moved too quickly to take effective notes at times, equations not explained thoroughly enough, PSETs 2x too long.",
                "I honestly cannot think of any real weaknesses to this course. This is a fantastic class.",
                "The lecture style of the class made understanding the course content very challenging, as it was not always clear what portions of the lecture were meant to be focused on for testing purposes. This being said, the professor presented the content in a way that was more fun and engaging.",
                "Strengths: Material is interesting. Textbook is very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "The topics and lessons of this course were well informed and usually really interesting.",
                "I found some of the concepts to be a little confusing because we didn't spend enough time on them in lecture. We should have spent more time in class working on solving problems, rather than going over broad topics",
                "Exams were usually just like the psets, so you have a good idea of what to expect. There's also a generous curve that makes it pretty easy to do well. Fortner was also always willing to meet with students and his lectures were pretty fun and engaging. However, lectures didn't really help with doing the psets and you had to do them almost entirely by reading the textbook, which was sometimes not helpful either. Homework help sessions were at inconvenient times for a lot of people and were usually too short, and the TAs usually didn't know how to do the problems either."

This class is by no means a gut, and I was a bit in over my head, but it's not bad at all. Professor Fortner is super willing to work with you, and the curves are really nice. In the end, I feel like I was able to go out of my comfort zone and stretch myself without worrying about failing the class. It was also a pretty interesting class in and of itself!",
                "Yes, but only if you actually have a strong math & science (especially chemistry) base. You can definitely get a good grade in but that's just because Fortner is super understanding with his grading - the PSETS are HARD. Very hard. And so are the exams. \r\nThe content is super interesting and I'm glad I took it, but I'm also glad it's over.",
                "yes, but probably not just for the qr or sci credit. I don't know why I did that, but the class is not at all a gut and you will have to study and do work. That being said, it's pretty cool and a fun class to take with friends.",
                "Yes and no. Depends what you want out of a course. It's required for Environmental Engineering majors, but it was not the most engaging. However, John really cared about the material and for each student.",
                "Yes, it covers very interesting and relevant topics in an approachable format",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student with some background in chemistry who is interested in things like how drinking water is treated and how to calculate the environmental impacts of industrial activity. The workload is less than a typical STEM class, yet the problem sets still offer a solid opportunity for developing quantitative skills.",
                "Yes I would.  I think that the course is a great introduction to environmental engineering and what the rest of the courses in the department might look like.  I would also recommend it to students who are not planning to major in environmental engineering because it is just an overall interesting course with a passionate professor.",
                "Yes! As an EVST major who did not enjoy intro chem sequence, I was hesitant about taking this class. However, I looked over the syllabus and I was really intrigued by the topics. So I figured, what the heck, I'll take it! This class was super accessible, even for me, who does not enjoy chem lol. Professor Fortner is also so incredible and makes the class super engaging. If you're on the fence and willing to put in some work (although def not the most intensive class I've taken here) then I would encourage you to go for it!",
                "If you're interested in Environmental Engineering, I would recommend taking ENVE 120 and another ENVE course concurrently (like ENVE 373 or ENVE 360). That way, not only are you getting a survey of different topics that encompass Environmental Engineering, but you're also diving deep into a specific area.",
                "I would only recommend this course to satisfy the science credit requirement for those pursuing a B.S EVST.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student looking to understand environmental quality, hazards, and treatments, not just those looking into environmental engineering.",
                "Yes, this class was a great way to be introduced the field of environmental engineering. I learned concrete skills and learned to analyze water treatment systems and air pollution dynamics.",
                "Yes, I am a Film major and needed this for a QR - it's a doable class, although it has to be your #1 focus of time management to get a good grade. Professor Fortner is an extremely accommodating and kind professor and also made lectures funny sometimes which I appreciate.",
                "I think every freshman interested in environmental subjects should take this class! I would have been an ENVE major had I taken this class freshman year.",
                "This course provided an interesting new perspective, but I would not recommend this course to someone who did not have prior interest in the subject matter.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is opens up your mind to different environmental engineering topics making it easy for you to identify a specific area you may be interested in.",
                "Sure, the professor is great and the content could be interesting, but its not as interesting as the subject matter might seem on first glance",
                "If you're looking for a fulfilling and rewarding science credit, this is it. I took it as a non-major, and I felt I was able to succeed and do my best in the class.",
                "This course is a relatively easily graded class for non environmental engineer majors who have an interest in this field. Great for exploration of interests.",
                "It's not a bad course if you're an ENVE major and have to take it as a requirement or as an elective for another engineering major. However, if you're more interested in environmental studies, you'll probably find this class pretty tedious or find the work a little pointless because it's very heavy on calculations and formulas. I also thought it felt too much like civil engineering sometimes and it made me lean away from the ENVE major at Yale. This is also a QR credit and the QR really comes out in the psets."
