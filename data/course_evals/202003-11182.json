                "The only aspect I did not improve in significantly was my handwriting skills, mainly due to the online format of examinations. However, we still were able to get some practice in the form of handwriting our essays. Other than that, all of the homework was well spread-out such that I never felt particularly overwhelmed by its work at any point in the semester. The nightly assignments took about an hour each, so we got lots of practice in and I was able to still improve.",
                "Strengths: Wang Laoshi is amazing. She's amazing. I love her so much. \r\nWeaknesses: It is going to be a lot of work, but language classes are always a lot of work, and Chinese isn't an exception.",
                "Strengths: The setup of the daily schedule was incredibly convenient. Because the class meets every day, it was useful to have a visual that informed me what homework was due each day. I was also able to work ahead when I had the chance.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This isn't a weakness per se, but the virtual format required adapting to a lot of new technologies. Also, the dependency on Zoom- and, therefore, Zoom's stability- made participation especially difficult. Because I can't whisper to another classmate or outright ask another classmate for help in the virtual environment, my learning comes entirely from the professor. Perhaps increased utilization of break-out rooms would be useful. Additionally, Zoom was unkind to my camera the entire semester, so I was not able to participate as well as I would have liked to, or I had to overcompensate and constantly answer questions because the professor would be less likely to call on me without my face being visible. (This is no fault of the professor in my opinion, and entirely the \"fault\" of the class format due to COVID.) Lastly, the virtual format, the accelerated speed of the class, and the amount of homework meant that a lot of assignments that we completed were not checked during class time. We did not correct any Reading or Listening assignments, and I had many questions on these assignments, but I was only able to ask them in office hours, which was held at a time that did not work for my schedule."

                "This was overall an amazing class despite the Zoom format!",
                "The course was incredibly well-structured. It was very clear what we had to do every day for homework, there were minimal technical difficulties, and surprisingly, I still learned a lot of Chinese despite the circumstances, although of course it would've been nice to be in an in-person classroom setting. I think something really important is that Wang Laoshi really cares for her students, not just as academics but also as people. I don't think any other professor has ever been as understanding and kind to me this whole seemster.",

This is the first semester of the second year of Chinese language, it is meant to be intensive, and the content is imperative to gaining fluency in Mandarin Chinese.",
