   "comments": [
    "I learned aural skills and some music theory through different chords. I enhanced my rhythmic abilities including polyrhythms and piano skills. Overall, I improved my skills to be able to notice different things in music and to be able to detect and analyze them.",
    "The class helped me get a lot better at dictations and sightreading.",
    "I learned a lot about how to recognize chords and deconstruct music when listening, and I learned more about how music is written. I developed more skill reading sheet music.",
    "Strengthened skills in harmonic analysis, sightreading, and sightsinging. New knowledge of 7th and augmented 6th chords.",
    "I feel that this course has improved my dictation skills and sight-reading ability (hello alto clef). I loved the opportunity to meet other music majors, who were all very kind, enthusiastic, and down to study together. You'll find that the chords and progressions you learn in this class appear in unexpected places - like your favorite playlist!"

   "comments": [
    "The course was interesting and a nice survey of a variety of important chords. We also covered different material like clef reading, rhythm, hearing scales, and piano skills. All of this knowledge will be very beneficial to me in the future. What we discussed was always interesting whether it was about the curriculum or not. However, the way the material was presented could be improved. We often got off topic, which made the course slightly disorganized and slightly difficult to follow. We rarely had assignments other than piano lab and preparing for the exams, which can make it hard to learn. Overall, more structure could be beneficial for learning.",
    "It is very low key but also very well structured and informative!",
    "I think overall it was very strong. It brought me out of my comfort zone and taught me a lot without ever becoming needlessly stressful.",
    "Small class size ensures lots of class participation. I wish we had more time in the keyboard lab; 1 half-hour session per week seemed a little too short and we couldn't really explore much material in depth.",
    "This course is a wonderful complement to Music 210 or 211; developing musicianship skills is rewarding and, in this case, requires very little homework. Nate is an excellent professor who challenges you in the friendliest way possible! He creates a chill, non-competitive atmosphere in which students who care about music can learn from each other. It's clear how deeply he thinks about the material he teaches, and he applies it to contemporary music in fascinating ways. Cross your fingers for a tangent every now and then, because Nate can turn a seemingly obscure music theory topic into something relevant and thought-provoking! My classmates and I often found ourselves continuing class discussions as we walked to our next destination.\r\n\r\nIf I had to name a weakness? Our keyboard labs with grad students were fun but not very challenging (I spent most labs learning jazz progressions, so it may be specific to my instructor)."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course only if you are really interested in music theory and applying it to aural skills. I think the course is more difficult than is reflected in the workload, and you have to really like learning about chords, rhythm, and listening to how they all fit. You also have to spend some time outside of class practicing these skills by yourself. If this sounds good, then this may be a good course as I think it was an interesting course. The piano lab is a lot of fun, and you can learn piano skills, such as figured bass and playing different pieces. Still, be aware that the course can be slightly disorganized.",
    "Yes! It is very fun and a great way to end the day.",
    "Absolutely. It was very well-taught, introduced me to skills and topics I had little exposure to, and did so without becoming a burden on the rest of my schedule.",
    "Definitely would recommend to any musically-inclined student who wants to improve sightreading and sighsinging abilities.",
    "Yes! I would highly recommend this course, as long as you have some background in music theory. It's fun, engaging, introduces you to other music majors, and doesn't require much out-of-class work. I am a musician (with no formal training in theory prior to this class), so I felt rather lost with analysis but confident with sight-reading. If you're in my situation or vice versa, expect to do a little bit of catching up, but it'll be manageable. Enjoy!"
