    "I learned major themes in ancient, medieval, and early modern history",
    "I learned a ton about Jewish history from prehistoric times to the post modern and also the evolution of Jewish thought and religious practices over that period. This course also delved into Christianity and Islam to put the history of Jews in a greater context. There was also a research paper and Professor Marcus gave lots of feedback to improve writing, structure, and arguments.",
    "I learned a clarified history of the Jews, and about the theories developed around that time period.",
    "I didn't know very much going into this class and I learned A LOT. The class starts with Genesis and runs through the 16th century of Jewish thought, exile, and diaspora movements. It's very interesting but definitely a lot of information.",
    "A lot about the history of jews",
    "Writing a paper just from primary sources!",
    "This course gave me a better understanding of Jewish History in general. It taught about how and why Jews migrated from one land to another, and identified the unique diasporas in which Jews dwelled. The course teaches about relations between Jews, Muslims and Christians in the Medieval period. A wide variety of topics are discussed including Jewish beliefs, sects, persecution, and Jewish contribution to society. Overall, it was an amazing class that changed my perspectives and increased my knowledge on Jewish people and Judaism.",
    "Honestly prior to taking this class, I knew nothing about early Jewish history. The way Professor Marcus teaches, you will literally never forget the material if you actually go to lecture. The midterms were completely fair- you go to class, you get the material. The paper was difficult for me, but Professor Marcus was there every step of the way for every query and in the end it was a really rewarding assignment.",
    "a good historical overview of Jewish people, culture and politics, from biblical times to early modern. The final paper which emphasized reading of primary texts without scholarship was an interesting exercise.",
    "Research skills and Jewish history.",
    "I learned how to analyze primary sources and use them and them alone to write a paper."

   "comments": [
    "Prof. Marcus is engaging, but he is also a little hard to follow because he jumps around.",
    "Lectures are extremely interesting and engaging. Could be improved by lecture having more of a structure.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and wish there were more assignments to engage myself in other than two short midterms and a final paper. The material was very interesting and even though I was attracted to this class because of its light workload, I am kind of sad it's over and I finished everything. This would give students more room to work for a good grade and really engage in the material if they are willing to put in the work. And I have not seen my grade yet so I'm close to unbiased.",
    "The organization of the lectures was oftentimes confusing, especially when it came time to study for exams. However, the content is interesting, and Prof. Marcus's excitement and vast knowledge about the subject was inspiring.",
    "Strengths: There is so much information to be learned and Professor Marcus does a good job of getting through it all.\r\nWeakness: Professor Marcus is sometimes all over the place and its hard to follow. Also class is 1h15min which doesn't seem bad but feels long when he's pushing so much information.",
    "Lecture was very interesting, sometimes jumped around a little bit",
    "No slides, so you have to stay on your toes (and show up to lecture). Names are difficult to judge phonetically if youre not familiar with Jewish names. Wikipedia your notes after class to fully grasp whats going on.",
    "The only weakness of this class is that when you're studying for the tests, you have to rearrange your notes a little bit because he will go from one topic, to another, and then back to the previous one. That being said, his lectures are incredible."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but be aware it can be hard to follow.",
    "Yes, it's extremely interesting and engaging. Professor Marcus is an amazing lecturer and genuinely cares how much you understand the material.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class. Not a heavy workload, material is very clear and lectures are as well (they are interesting but have a lot of material and this class is also long so the last 15 minutes are a grind), and Professor Marcus is very receptive and willing to help you understand anything. Very smart and nice dude",
    "It is a wonderful course, but you must pay careful attention to each lecture and keep up with the readings if you want to reap the benefits.",
    "I would. Its interesting and there's a lot to learn. If you're Jewish it gives a lot of information that's nice to learn. If you need to fulfill a history pre-req this is a great class because low workload and not too difficult.",
    "This is a great course if you are genuinely interested in Jewish THOUGHT and the evolution of Judaism from biblical times to the 16th century. Professor Marcus is incredibly smart, but a little all over the place which can be frustrating. It's an incredibly easy class to do well on, especially if you do the readings.",
    "Yes, this was a very interesting class",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, this is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "THIS CLASS IS THE MOST AMAZING CLASS IN THE WORLD. IVAN MARCUS IS A GEM, HIS LECTURES ARE GEMS. JUST TAKE IT, OK. The material is SUPER engaging. I actually may cry I loved this class so much. Wish I was kidding, really not.",
    "Yes,I really enjoyed this class and it forced me to learn something I was unfamiliar with",
    "I took this course just because I needed a Hu credit and it happened to fit with my schedule but it ended up being the course I looked forward to going to most for the semester. Professor Marcus is great and is clearly enthusiastic about what he teaches, and the material is fascinating. Learning about the history of the Jewish religion, and how Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all impacted one another over the course of history will change the way you view these religions in the present-day. As long as you go to lecture, the in-class midterms are very easy and the paper is pretty straightforward as well. Overall, this was a great course with a pretty low workload.",
    "Rambling and disorganized lecturer.  You need to do the readings or else you will not get much out of the course.",
    "This course was laid out very well and the two midterms and final papers split up the work evenly."
