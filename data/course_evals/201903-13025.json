   "comments": [
    "Editing\/revising essay skills, ability to see techniques in writing and emulate them",
    "I learned that the modern essay encompasses a diverse range of genres, each with their own rhetorical techniques. I learned how to write about myself in a way that is interesting for other people to read. I learned to see how an essayist manipulates the reader's expectations in order to keep them engaged. I learned to analyze my writing down to the level of a sentence.",
    "I learned a lot about the craft of writing. I have names now for things I did intuitively, and that has helped me be a more conscious writer--and a more conscious reader, as I look to identify those techniques in the works of other authors.",
    "Vastly improved my writing skills, with a focus on casual writing and personal essays. Learned a ton about specific writing techniquesand also got great practice and feedback.",
    "I learned how to close read more carefully and gain a greater appreciation for essay writing, something I'd never really explored before. More specifically, I gained a new set of specific literary and writing tools to approach both reading and writing the modern essay.",
    "This class functions sort of like a how-to-write an essay in the New Yorker magazine, which is super fascinating. You learn how to condense you're writing, and to really work on writing very strong and effective non-fiction prose. I was much more accustomed to taking classes or at least, for myself, writing fictional material, so this was a really interesting change of pace. In Shirkhani's class in particular, you'll work on five different types of non-fiction modern essays: Personal Experience, Place, Person\/Process (depending if she changes this or not, she said this was her first time covering Process), Cultural Critique, and Satire. I learned how to not only write an essay on each of these topics, but how to read a piece of writing, breaking down its nitty-gritty. You don't just read and analyze the piece as a whole; we spent whole periods just working on a sentence or paragraph. All of our sentences have a reason to be in the pieces we are writing, so I'd say that I learned how write more effectively, in general.",
    "I learned how to look at pieces from the perspective of a writer looking to improve their craft.",
    "I learned how to read and write compelling modern essays. And using the techniques I learned, I even became a more interesting conversationalist and speech writer.",
    "I learned to read more critically. I learned to edit my own writing, to respond to criticism, and to ask for help. My writing in general became sharper.",
    "I learned how to write better-crafted sentences and essays and identify how rhetorical strategies contribute to meaning in essays. I now read any piece of writing radically differently than I did before.",
    "This course improved my ability to read modern essays, dissect how authors created the effects they achieved in their pieces, and begin to use those sorts of rhetorical choices to improve my own writing.",
    "I learned to communicate ideas through not just the meaning of the words I write, but the way those words are put together. I learned to write in a more beautiful and effective way. I also learned to recognize stylistic choices in the writing of others and integrate those into my own writing. Lastly, I learned to be observant of things in the world that are worth writing about."

   "question_id": "YC403-YCWR",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: feedback we received (both from peers and from professors) took my writing to another level. \r\nWeakness: because the essays are graded comparatively, its hard to see your own improvement",
    "The course curriculum is outstanding. Each essayist that we read has different ways of seeing the world that they bring to the table. The seminar format means that each student gets to participate in meaningful class discussions with their peers. The peer feedback system is a great way to get many eyes on your work.",
    "Strengths: excellent teaching, really useful skills, great selection of readings.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: none",
    "Strengths: The workshop style really enhances the mode of learning, and it's very useful to get feedback from your classmates. We also learned extremely specific tools that were easy to apply to help enhance our writing. Weaknesses: Sometimes we didn't get a chance to get to all the readings, and it would have been useful to have kept an ongoing log or bank for the specific terms\/skills we learned in class. It might be hard to remember to use them all otherwise.",
    "I'm not sure if this is simply an English 120 fault, or just this particular section, but I think a lot of the class is devoted to reading other peoples' work, and not a lot of time spent putting those techniques EXPLICITLY into practice. In a past creative writing class I took, we would discuss a particular move or technique from the author, and then attempt to apply that to our own writing--in class. However, in this class, we might discuss a multitude of moves, techniques, approaches, and instead of say, working on them in class, or workshopping a few ideas in class, all of the onus would fall on us out of class. That's not to say that that is a bad thing; I just think I would have preferred more explicit instruction in class. \r\n\r\nI think one of the biggest strengths, though, is the immense amounts of feedback you will receive on your writing. Whether you are being workshopped (which everyone must do), or simply receiving comments from Professor Shirkhani, you'll have ample suggestions and comments from your peers and your professor. Professor Shirkhani provides copious comments and ideas, and is always available to meet and discuss.",
    "The feedback for essays was really good. I wish we talked about the pieces we read for homework more efficiently to get through all of them.",
    "We learned by example. We read really good essays from the New Yorker and New York Times, and sieved out techniques that we could then consciously apply.",
    "There is a lot writing in this course, which may seem self apparent, but deadlines picked up as the semester progresses. The amounts of reading is very manageable. Professor Shirkhani provides really comprehensive, helpful feedback. Class discussion involvement is high.",
    "strengths - prof Shirkhani is supportive & insightful; readings are very fun; class well-organized.\r\nWeaknesses - none! a fantastic course",
    "Strengths: the setup of the course (readings, in-class discussions, essays and workshops) was perfect for teaching the skills the course aimed to teach; the in-class discussions led by Professor Shirkhani gave us the instruction we needed to see deeper into the pieces we did for reading, and were just enough guidance that we could then go home and explore similar lines of thought, building our own rhetorical eye as readers and writers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no major weaknesses; I only wish we had more time\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the little \"games\" we would play (push\/pull, high\/low for the humor unit, etc.), and I wonder if it would help to push us to take that implicit knowledge to the next step and make it explicit. (People would hate this suggestion, but maybe give those \"games\" as part of the reading and ask us to jot down what we're thinking about push\/pull, or even just discuss it with a partner more in class--we did that once and it helped me make explicit my intuition)",
    "A strength of this course is that it changed how I see the world. Also, Professor Shirkhani was so involved and gave incredibly thoughtful feedback. \r\nA weakness of this course is that it was an enormous amount of work. I think this could be adjusted with the number of workshops: only having each person be workshopped once."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "YES! You learn type of writing you wont learn about in other typical writing classes, build connections  with  other classmates, and come out with a set of essays that are personal and representative of who you are.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. The course teaches you how to write in a style that is likely different from any writing that you have done before. The modern essay is everywhere in the modern world. It's important to understand how it works so that we can see how we are being manipulated. Even if you are going into a STEM field, this course is invaluable in that it teaches you how to make your writing interesting to other people. Even scientists have to write grant proposals. Finally, I found that in writing about myself, I discovered things about myself that I hadn't known previously. As cliche as it sounds, writing a modern essay is a journey into your mind. I found it cathartic to articulate my thoughts and experiences.",
    "Yes. Has definitely improved my writing thanks to the models we read for homework, peer review, and comments from\/draft meetings with the professor. Excellent syllabus with a lot of essays that are simply good to read. The five units present unique challenges, and they never feel stale. Great, intimate classroom environment with lots of lively discussion.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I would absolutely recommend English 120 with Professor Shirkhani. She is genuinely one of the best teachers I've ever had, and is truly just a flawless human being. Everything about her class is simply outstanding. The reading selections are incredible: I was introduced to authors I now love and enjoyed reading every single essay, while also admiring the excellent writing. Class discussions are productive and engaging: I always found myself losing track of time and totally engaged. Assignments are very well structured to help your learning, feedback is copious, clear, and helpful, and grading is really fair. I learned an amazing amount about writing, and I think my writing improved more in this class than the past 15 years of my education combined. The workload is a bit greater than an average course, but is totally worth it--every single bit of it is instructive and insightful.\r\n\r\nProfessor Shirkhani is unbelievably insightful, finding ways to demonstrate concepts, lead the class to find important details on their own, and pointing out the techniques and strategies underneath successful writing in ways that blew my mind every single class. Multiple times throughout the course, at 9:15 on a Tuesday, I found myself wondering in amazement \"Wow, how is she actually this incredible of a teacher??\" Not to mention that she is the nicest, funniest, most humble, sweetest human being on the face of the planet. She is completely dedicated to helping her students learn, and she so clearly loves what she does. Being in her class is simply a joy. \r\n\r\nI've always hated writing, loathed it in fact. After this class, I can honestly say that I love to write. If you can get in, absolutely take this class.",
    "Yes, definitely! Please take this course whether you are considering the major or not! It's a great way to enhance your reading and writing in not too much of a high stakes environment. Professor Shirkhani is a lovely person and teacher, and you will see your writing improve if you put in the time and effort. Not only do you get to learn from her and the readings assigned, but from your peers during workshop, which is one of the most valuable parts of the class.",
    "This is a difficult question for me, in that I was recommended this class not only by Professor Shirkhani herself, but also by several other students. I think that if you're tired of reading fiction is English courses, or you want to try something entirely new, to which you may not have been exposed before, then this class would be perfect for you. It's definitely not an easy class in any way, shape, or form--there is a lot of reading, sometimes very lengthy reading, and you'll be writing a 5-page essay (about 5 pages, anywhere from 750-1500 words) every 2-3 weeks, then spending another week or so on revisions. So don't go into this class thinking that it will be a piece of cake. I thought non-fiction prose would be fun and simple, but I was soooo wrong. Grading is pretty strict, and when you get your first few paper grades, you kind of have to re-evaluate your strengths as a writer; it certainly knocked my confidence level down a few notches. So please be cognizant of the fact that there is a lot of work involved in this class, and definitely not at an easy A at all. But a super fascinating topic, and I think everyone should have the chance to partake in this type of learning environment. I mean, the pieces are fun to read, so it doesn't hurt to do the readings!",
    "This is a very good course to take if you want to get a lot of practice revising essays and working on pieces like a professional essayist would.",
    "Yes! This is a must-take Yale class (especially if you can take it with Professor Shirkhani). I took it as a senior even though I didn't even need a writing credit,    and it was so worth it. You can't change people's minds with English 114 style rhetoric and papers, but you can with stories and op-eds.",
    "Yes, if the student is looking to really improve their writing at an intro level.",
    "Absolutely!! If you want to improve your writing across every discipline - absolutely. If you want to increase your understanding of the underbelly of literature - absolutely!!! If you want to learn how to structure academic essays, however, not this class.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn how to write, this is the course for you. And Professor Shirkhani is AMAZING",
    "Absolutely! It helped me grow in just the kind of way that I hoped my time at Yale would."
