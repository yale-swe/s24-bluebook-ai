                "I improved my close reading skills, and I learned to question everything as a historian.",
                "In this course, I gained a lot of knowledge about the history of al-Andalus and the connection it has with the history of that time. Additionally, I was forced to ponder a lot of topics that seem to have easy answers but in reality are very complex and that helped increase my understanding of the world and how history has changed who we are today. I think the biggest skill I took from this course had to do with my writing. The professor's biggest goal was to ensure that we improved as writers, and I believe I did.",
                "My writing skills were totally transformed in this class. I entered the class being a fairly strong writer, but left with a real grasp on the importance of intentionality in writing and a set of rules to help me reach that goal. The course also changed the way I think about history. Professor Fancy's insistence on critique rather than positivism made me think about the study of history in a fascinating and provocative way.",
                "This is a wonderful introductory seminar class. You really learn how to engage with others and with texts in a productive way. This course also really helps you develop your own writing style.",
                "I learned to think within the discipline of history, which appears to be a very different way of thinking than what would be found in economics or political science. This was valuable, because I found that I am better at quantitative reasoning and thinking through economic concepts than I am at historical thinking. I also improved my writing skills in the course.",
                "This course taught me skills needed for the close reading of texts and specifically how to approach historical documents. Additionally, this course helped me develop a toolbox for essay writing and analyzing a multitude of sources. This course completely transformed my understanding of History as a subject. In high school, History was always taught as a fixed subject or in a solid state of matter--this course made me think of history as existing in more of an amorphous state open to asking questions and developing arguments. I learned the importance of investigating the context and implications of sources."

                "Strengths:  it was a phenomenal class because I learned how to think very critically\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were a bit too much, and it's hard to keep up all the time.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is the professor. Without Professor Fancy, this course would not have been as interesting and helpful as it was. The emphasis on historical thinking and writing was a great introduction to history courses offered at Yale, and it was truly such a valuable experience. The only weakness I can think of is that the readings do get a little tough at times, like there will a 2 day period where we have to read over 150 pages, but that is also manageable because he did not force us to have it done if we were still able to contribute to class discussions.",
                "The topic is undoubtedly interesting so thats one strength for sure. The texts are amazing to read and the conversations that come from the texts seem really relevant to the modern day and to everybody in the class. Its a hard class in terms of reading workload but professor fancy is very understanding. The only major weakness is that the discussions are very guided and it feels a bit like everything said in the class has been said in the class before, like a little bit too scripted, but other than that it was great.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any first year coming into Yale who has any desire to improve their writing skills while also learning about the lost history of al-Andalus. The course had such interesting content and it made me a better student at the end of the semester. Even if you're not interested in the history, this course still ensures that you improve in some way.",
                "I would without question recommend this course. It was so beneficial to take in my first semester and I feel much more prepared to take upper-level humanities courses. Professor Fancy is a wonderful resource for advice and academic feedback that any student would benefit from.",
                "I would reccomend it to a student interested in religious history who wants a really strong seminar.",
                "Yes, because I improved my writing. I also found it valuable in assessing what I actually want to study here at Yale.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I think this course is especially good as a first-year seminar because it was a great introduction to essay writing and research at Yale. I was also very interested in the subject and course material. This course was a great way to study nuanced and complex relationships between groups of people and the concept of tolerance."
