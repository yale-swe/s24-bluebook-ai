                "A lot of useful knowledge about the US healthcare system - practical and information can actually be applied in real life",
                "This course allowed me to get an understanding of how the healthcare system in the USA is structured. It also allowed me to think critically about a lot of the topics that we were discussing.",

Prior to taking this course, I had no idea just how complicated the way that we deliver healthcare can be, so I gained a lot of insights.",
                "As a CS\/Econ major and simply a college-aged person, I developed a ton of very practical knowledge about the US Healthcare system and how insurance, physicians, and government all interact in this system as we know it today. Topics included Medicare, Medicaid, healthcare spending as a whole, insurance, physician labor markets, physician compensation, prescription drug market, FDA, and all of these were grounded in understanding economic principles that drive this system. As an example of the usefulness of this knowledge, I even learned how I would obtain insurance myself after graduation and the various means to go about doing that, depending on your stage of life and circumstances.",
                "I learned more in this course than I think I have in any other class I've taken at Yale -- from different insurance plans, the ins and outs of Medicare and Medicaid, etc. This gave me a greater appreciation for the intricate discourse that goes into health public policy.",

Professor Forman's extensive knowledge and experience in healthcare significantly enhance the learning experience. His teaching style is highly effective, facilitating a deep dive into the complexities of healthcare. The real value of this course lies in his unique perspective and practical advice on navigating and addressing the challenges within the healthcare system."

                "strengths: howie knows what he is talking about and is passionate about the work he does\r\nweakness: he talks too much with too much fluff, can't really hear him from the back of the classroom, you have no guidance on midterms or final paper or final exam, grading is sucky, there's no curve",
                "Strength: straightforward grading guidelines, relatively large and communicative teaching team (prof + 3 TAs)\r\nWeakness: if you don't already have prior interest or knowledge in healthcare, this class will be extremely boring",
                "Way too overwhelming to have Professor Howie talk for the full 1 hour 15mins and take notes the entire time. I think if the slides were better aligned, we could pay better attention in class without the pressure of having to write everything down. It is really difficult to have the attention span for 1 hour 15 mins straight.",
                "well organized and full of great information, I learned a lot. It is sometimes difficult to take all of the notes because the professor speaks fast there is less information on the slides",
                "This course was probably one of the more interesting and applicable courses I have taken at Yale. I think it truly shed light on the inequities of the healthcare system in a non-biased way. I think that the discussion posts were a good way to stay engaged with the course content without  getting bombarded with work.",
                "Lots of information that is difficult to process in the speed that the course goes, felt the exams grading was a little too nitpicky and vague",
                "strengths - very interesting and important topics were covered, lots of good content \r\nweaknesses - must attend lecture or you will not do well on the exams. most of what is testing is on what is said, not the slide info.",
                "The material was always presented in a way that was digestible. The material was also very interesting, and the small class setting allows for a lot of discussions. \r\n\r\nI wish the class was a little more quantitative and incorporated more economic concepts.",
                "I liked how lectures-focused it was. It encouraged us to really listen to the Professor",
                "Strengths: Covers a lot. Really helps you understand essential concepts in health economics. Good exposure and discussion about issues and nuances in the industry. SUPER cool guest lecturers. Overall great course if you're interested in health economics or even healthcare in general. \r\nWeaknesses: It's hard to hear the professor sometimes, and lectures are not the most engaging, so it's hard to keep up. The rubric for the final paper was also very vague, and there was not much instruction how to write the paper, so it was a little confusing to write.",
                "Strengths: Students are allowed to record the lectures, there are no actual homework assignments, and Professor Forman can be funny. \r\nWeaknesses: As someone who had been looking forward to taking this class for over a year, I felt quite disappointed. The lectures are disorganized and difficult to follow since Professor Forman sometimes just neglects the slides and goes on tangents. It feels like there's not adequate background context given in regards to topics, which can make the information seem abstract or foreign at times. The discussion post assignments, although helpful in giving students a grade boost, almost felt like busywork and were something that students could put nearly 0 effort into\/learn nothing from and still do well. The teaching team as a whole wasn't great, and no one really seemed like they were enthusiastic about teaching the course material. The TF Bri was extremely passive aggressive, cancelled her office hours the week of the final, refused to respond to questions over email the day before finals, told the class she had to leave her review session exactly on time so she could go drink, complained about how students with disability-related accommodations would have to take their finals 2 hours earlier than other students, and overall made it really apparent that she didn't like her job. Also, even as someone who did well on exams, I feel as if the exams did a poor job of gauging student understanding of the material, and were just dependent on how harshly the TF felt like grading and random things that Professor Forman mentioned during lecture. Lastly, I wish there was more Economics taught in this class; I genuinely have no idea why this is an econ credit; we referenced economic concepts for like 1-2 weeks and that was it.",
                "The course is very interesting and I thought the exams were quite fair in terms of assessing knowledge. One minor weakness is that Professor Forman would sometimes be hard to follow in lecture, especially when he went off the slides and you missed something he said for one moment. It would be helpful to organizationally have all of the lecture material readily available to review via slides or other means.",
                "Howie is one of the best, most engaging lecturers I've had at Yale, and the hour and fifteen minutes of the lecture flew by every class. The class structure was also set up for a good balance between exams and written assignments.",
                "Dont think there should be a module 3 exam and a final paper; it was crammed too much",
                "Strengths: Loved the content of the class - very applied and applicable. Howie is an amazing professor.\r\nWeakness: None",
                "Very in-depth so you feel like you know a lot about the topic. Wish they could apply knowledge more to other fields to make it engaging for all.",
                "Strengths: The lectures and guest speakers were extremely interesting, and I enjoyed how Prof. Forman created an environment that encouraged students to ask questions. It was great that we were learning from recent data while the professor could add on with his own experiences and current events. I also like how our homework is more in the form of discussion section posts where we could get questions answered and learn more, rather than psets.\r\nWeaknesses: No big ones, although it would have been nice if the exams were a bit more weighted towards short\/long-response questions rather than MC and T\/F.",
                "Professor Forman's lectures are a vital aspect of the learning experience in this course, as they provide rich insights and foster deep understanding. His discussions effectively illuminate the subject matter, making class attendance essential for grasping the full depth of the material. A weakness is that the class lacked more interactive elements. This would allow students to apply foundational knowledge to real-world contexts, thereby bridging the gap between his instruction and practice. Another weakness was that the tests required a lot of memorization and writing. At times, the questions seemed a bit random.",

                "I would recommend this course only to those who already have interest \/ knowledge in the US healthcare system. This class feels very highschool-y, meaning that the information is one directionally delivered to us and we are forced to memorize everything that was said during the prof's lecture. No information synthesis or critical thinking to form original thoughts about the course content, so for me, it felt extremely boring. The prof also goes off tangents a lot (to respond all questions during lecture). Unless you are thinking of having a career in healthcare or medicine, take another Econ course, there are better ones out there.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Forman is an incredible professor; you can tell how much he loves teaching this class, and he is great at it. Genuinely one of the classes where I learned the most about the real world and how it works at Yale. Super valuable, especially as someone interested in healthcare policy! I'm a history major with minimal economics experience (only took the intro classes) and it was totally fine!",
                "Yes, such an important knowledge base to have and Professor Howie is so knowledgeable and interesting",

                "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. While I have always heard of the issues with our fragmented health system, I never truly got to recognize the issues until I took this course. I definitely would recommend this course if you are interested in economics and medicine.",

I really loved the course even though it started off feeling very dry, I really appreciated all of the information that we were taught and feel like it became more interesting once I really studied and began to understand the material. Definitely helps you get a good foundation in understanding key concepts in the health economics field.",
                "Yes! I found lecture to be super engaging and applicable!",
                "Yes if they're good at memorization. No if they want an engaging course.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to anyone at Yale. Super interesting stuff in my opinion and very, very practical. So often you see people talking about how U.S. healthcare sucks, but honestly I don't think anyone knows why that is or what even about it sucks. The workload isn't bad at all, which makes it an even more appealing course. You just have to be willing to attend and pay attention in lecture, which I really think isn't that much to ask, especially since Howie is a very personable and fun professor to have.",
                "100%. You learn SO information in this course that is undoubtedly relevant in the real world\/outside of Yale.",
                "Yes, its a really interesting and engaging course. Howie is a fantastic lecturer and shares great insights from his work in a hospital, which provides a really interesting perspective. \r\n\r\n However, bear in mind that the final is much harder than the midterms and the paper is harshly graded.",
                "no, the grading was very nitpicky.",
                "If you have a big interest in healthcare and want to go into a healthcare profession",
                "Yes. Great way to learn a lot about the US healthcare system if you dont know anything",
                "Would definitely recommend this class to another student. As a CS-Econ major, I took this as an elective and it was definitely one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. I have interest in healthcare\/biotech and this class was very applied (not much theory like the intro econ classes) which I loved. Low workload day to day, but high engagement in class, which I believe is the optimal structure.",
                "Yes, especially if interested. It's a fascinating lecture.",
                "Absolutely! As a pre-med, this class not only taught me so much useful information about the US healthcare system, but really opened up my eyes to a new set of problems that we need to work on in medicine. The class is fairly low workload, but extremely thought-provoking. Also, the professor is a great lecturer and very accessible for questions after class and in office hours.",
