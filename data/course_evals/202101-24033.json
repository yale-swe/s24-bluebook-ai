I usually felt prepared for my tests and I never felt like I had to cram to study anything. The pacing can feel a little intense sometimes but ultimately the course was forgiving when it needed to be and I did not have any problems nor did I fall behind. A weakness that I could see is that this class would be very hard to catch back up with if one where to fall behind though I am not sure how that could be remedied without taking away what makes this class successful to begin with.",
