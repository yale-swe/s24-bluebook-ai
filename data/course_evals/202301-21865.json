One big takeaway was that too much time is spent talking\/discussing\/planning when really implementation is the hardest part. This course gave me hope for our future as a society and showed me that it will take considerable effort to fix the current systematic problems we face.",

                "The course is almost entirely guest lectures. These are really interesting but it is easy to become disengaged when non of the content is being examined. \r\nI think having one or two workshops where we learn about planning or implementation strategies would have been good.",
                "Strengths: the guest speakers were great, I really enjoyed working on the independent project since it gave a lot of freedom to students to allocate their time however needed \r\nWeakness: none",

                "it was the best course ive taken",
                "Overall a relaxed class with the project being something that I was genuinely excited to work on. Nothing to complain about here",
                "The guest lectures are so cool! It's such a unique class given that it's mostly guest lectures.",
                "The course benefitted from an enthusiastic teaching staff and interesting material, but it could have been improved with more of a focus on sustainability related SDGs.",

                "More structure instead of just examples but that also might be the appeal of the course",
                "They need a stronger attendance policy, I wish I showed up more, and I felt like I needed a little nudge",
                "Strengths: Very engaging, diverse, and impressive guest lecturers. I was exposed to topics\/orgs I had never heard of and will never forget.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very little engagement with the professor and TAs. I wish we could have dedicated at least half a lecture on each of them and what they have accomplished.",

If you are interested in the challenge that climate change is causing, or any world injustice then this course gives you the time to research further and create plans to fix it. If you have any passion and want Yale credit to research it, this is a great course. Moreover, there are always cool and interesting grad students in the class who bring a unique insight into the field.",
                "Yes! If you want to do something really creative and step out from your comfort zone do it! It's a course that is meant to empower you to be sort of an entrepreneur\/leader of a project and you can learn so much out of it.",
                "Yes - highly recommend this course! No matter what major or field you plan to work in, Sustainable Development Goals are related in some way. Hearing about other peoples' work and creating an independent project really helps you develop valuable skills and knowledge.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! It is a super interesting course. You get to listen to different speakers throughout the semester and then complete a project based on your choosing.",
                "Yes! Amazing speakers and leaders from environmental\/conservation fields around the world, which is a great networking opportunity. Amazing course where you are given the opportunity to propose and implement your own projects of your own passion.",
                "Yes, great way to learn how to take initiative on a project and flesh out ideas.",
                "Yes!! If you want a chill class and also give a shot at designing a project to solve a problem you care about, this is definitely for you. The class is just speakers and deliverables include stuff for your project and discussion posts for the speakers.",
                "Yes! Such a fun cool course.",
                "Yes; it is a great class that centers around building a project of your own that targets the SDGs. Lots of freedom to make actual impact, and the guest lectures are very interesting and a great way to connect with leaders in the field. Could use more feedback, especially on the midterm (which is a progress report on the project). Professor Geballe is very nice and helpful.",

                "Yes - it is a course very much grounded in real life applications.",
                "No unless there is a project you are interested in implementing, dont take it. I thought I would learn more concrete things but instead it was like an open lab workshop",
                "Yes, it was a blast and each lecture provided a new perspective on potential carrears and interesting paths to take out of college",
                "Definitely! It is very low pressure, purely designed for student engagement with diff. orgs and networking with impressive and accomplished individuals that might work in an organization or field you are interested in interning at.",
                "Yes, the material is very cool but the organization of the class is very low.",
                "Yes",
                "YES! Such an amazing course to develop a real action plan to take steps for a more sustainable future!",
                "Yes, I learned a lot about sustainable development goals through the guest speakers and learned a lot about the factors involved in implementation through my final project. It was really cool to meet so many different people who carry out the SDGs differently through their work. It was inspiring"
