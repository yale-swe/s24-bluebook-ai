                "The strengths of this course were Prof. Arkolakis and his careful explanations of the content. I also enjoyed being able to experiment in QGIS. I would say the only weaknesses of the course are the fact that problem sets and exams can be very difficult and there was not much review material provided in advance of the final exam.",
                "The variety in topics  covering history, theory and analysis  makes it one of the most well-rounded economics courses at Yale.",
                "The course covers a lot of different topics, and it's interesting to go from historical examples to the development of economic models.\r\n\r\nI did not like the fact that each problem set was 10% of the overall grade. Getting a single part of a single problem wrong resulted in a 10 point deduction, equivalent to one whole percentage point overall. More (smaller) problem sets would have been preferred, rather than only 3 problem sets.",
                "A strength is that the lectures are very organized.",
                "Strengths: Applied economic models to a variety of interesting questions and although the models were simple I did feel like they were worth considering as models of what was going on in the real world; Arkolakis is clearly an expert in the area and does a great job of simplifying what could be complex ideas into easily understandable pieces; PSETS do a good job of helping you better understand the models by solving key components of them; Exams were fair and studying for the exams really did help me learn the material in a deeper way, which I think is a big plus. Weaknesses: Sometimes I lost the thread of the course in that I would get lost in the details of a particular lecture/problem without recognizing how it fit into the overall picture of which model we were using and exactly how we arrived at that point. I think this is an area which could be readily improved upon by just mentioning what model is being used to at each stage and how the problems relate to issues we have previously considered; Felt like PSETS, though helpful, sometimes (once or twice) had problems with just annoying algebra which didn't provide any very deep understanding. My guess would be that some other problems would still be equally challenging but provide a more general understanding of how those models were functioning.",
                "Weaknesses: though the models we started learning were relatively simple and seemed intuitive to understand and think about how different shocks change the result, the models quickly became more and more complex and unintelligible. It was extremely hard to see how the models connected to the real world, and when we did talk about real world examples they seemed very disconnected/unrelated to the models themselves. Much of the class is just various algebraic manipulations/derivations of various of the model equations, which made it feel more like algebra/calculus (with literally never any actual numbers, just variables) than an econ class seeking to model actual human behavior. Both the class slides and hw solutions skipped numerous steps and explanations for these derivations, so we were often left guessing/checking/rearranging to try to figure out how the equations were achieved, and even then having no idea why. HW and exam feedback was also extremely minimal and hard to understand. In the end the class was extremely theoretical and for that reason I found it extremely hard to follow and pay attention.\r\n\r\nStrengths: it wasn't that much work I guess, hw grading was pretty lenient, when we looked at real urbanization and space data that actually seemed relevant to the world, the small bit of GIS we did was interesting (would have been nice if we were actually taught how to use the software rather than just answer a couple specific pset questions), guest lecturers were an interesting connection to other research.",
                "Strength: I like the material covered in this course. Prof Arkolakis explains the ideas in a really clear way. By the end of this semester, I think I get some insights on not only the mathematical modeling (which is the core of the course), but also general concepts that affects the economic performance from the spatial perspective. Moreover, the guest lectures are really insightful. I was excited to see the applications of our models in active research. Also the workload is relatively low (a huge plus during course selection).",
                "Strength: Good professor, enough content for the semester; Weakness: Difficult",
                "I didn't go into this course thinking it would be as theory heavy as it was, but perhaps that is my own fault. I have data science background, so I really enjoyed the discussions on say the Fogel paper or the interstate highway counterfactual. I really liked the GIS portions as well, I wish they were more than a sideshow and we did something substantive with it. I think all the theory portion before midterm was great but past then I became lost and bored with it.",
                "Strengths: workload is manageable and the problem sets really help me to understand the course material and different models.\r\nWeakness: lectures could be more engaging. Also, this course involves a decent amount of math, but I feel that some math part is made to be that complex (more complex than it could be).",
                "A strength of this course is the content; it is very engaging and interesting to learn about. A weakness of the course is the memorization necessary; the exams are really just how much you can regurgitate, which doesn't seem to facilitate learning very well.",
                "The workload of the course is very fair--3 psets over the semester, one midterm, and one final. The material tested on all is also very fair. I appreciated that the exam covered only material that we explicitly covered in lectures. Overall, an excellent class."

                "I would certainly recommend this course to any student who would like to have a better quantitative grounding in economics. This class is definitely conceptually challenging to grasp, so be sure you are interested in the content before you take the class!",
                "I'd definitely recommend this class to any Econ (or other major) student interested in learning about how space (distances between locations, geography, etc.) shapes how people and economic activity develop and interact (e.g., growth of cities, benefits of openness to international trade, urban planning, etc.). I believe this course is now required for Econ-math majors/can substitute for Econ 350, but this course is definitely worth taking regardless. The workload and difficulty of material is very manageable (just 3 p-sets, midterm, and final), and Professor Arkolakis's instruction is incredibly clear. As a senior Econ-math major, I can confidently say that this is one of the best classes in the Econ department, and is worth shopping at the absolute least!",
                "This course is a must-take. Take it and thank yourself later.",
                "Yep, it's a solid senior economics seminar, and a good course for CS and Econ majors.",
                "I would recommend this to someone who is interesting in exploring different fields of Economics. It opened up my perspective",
                "Yes. This is a course which nicely expands the basic toolkit which was covered in intermediate classes and applies it in contexts which are both interesting and feel at least somewhat tractable with the models we use. It isn't the most incredibly captivating course on a day-to-day basis, but stepping back at the end of the semester I think it taught me a variety of approaches to modelling questions as well as how to approach solving some types of models, all while keeping the real world context in mind. If you are looking for sort of further economics exposure while having a fair bit (though nothing crazy) of math, then this is a good course for you.",
                "Don't do it!!!! Unless you are genuinely interested in extremely theoretical models and doing hours of algebraic manipulations of variables without EVER seeing an actual number or an application to real life data of the model. Explanations of the models if you haven't seen many econ models before were very minimal, and feedback was unhelpful. This class was not worth the low workload, the homeworks (though there were only 3) were a few hours of equation manipulations to attempt to arrive at the given solutions. It was extremely difficult to stay engaged with no real numbers, solutions, or applications of the model we were learning. If this class can increase the amount of real world applications and include much more intuitive explanations as well as helpful feedback and detailed explanations as to how and why various equations are derived, then maybe it will become worth your time. I found it impossible to remain engaged or to understand the use in learning what we were taught.",
                "Yes. If you are interested in spatial or urban economics, inequality, and/or infrastructure, this course is a great high level introduction that is challenging but rewarding.",
                "I would highly recommend this course, especially to those who want to learn more about how geography and other spatial factors influence the economic allocations.",
                "If you're interested!",
                "Yes, but only if you have strong math background.",
                "Yes, if you are in the Econ-Math major. I think it's important to take if you are interested in the subfield of Economics of Space/Geography/Networks, etc. because it teaches all of the foundational models. However, if you are not interested in math and theory behind many of these models, I don't think you'll really gain much from this class.",
                "I would recommend this to another student only if they are very interested in the topic and not looking for a course that really pushes them.",
                "Yes--excellent course with interesting material, fair workload, and fair exams. Only caveat is that the course is heavy on memorization from the lecture slides and the midterm/final is quite comprehensive. There is no curve in the class, but this is actually quite fair as the exam material tested is reasonable and the lack of a curve means that your performance is not compared to that of your peers, who are likely to come from different backgrounds than you. (Class composition is a mix of people from Econ, CS, Applied Math, etc)."
