However, after spring break, we started doing zooms with Indonesian students so much, it felt like we never really had the opportunity to learn more of the language. While it is cool and beneficial to directly interact with the Indonesian language and culture, it felt like the zooms ended up hindering the class more than they helped because they were too often.",
