However, after spring break, we started doing zooms with Indonesian students so much, it felt like we never really had the opportunity to learn more of the language. While it is cool and beneficial to directly interact with the Indonesian language and culture, it felt like the zooms ended up hindering the class more than they helped because they were too often.",
                "I think the chats on zoom were very good. I think we could do a little more direct vocab",
                "Class was very enjoyable and the teachers were really supportive of students in the class. I think main weakness was not a ton of feedback on performance along the course of the semester",
                "This course is very fun and interesting. I would have liked if we covered a bit more grammar and pronunciation. But overall, this course is part of an excellent introductory series that helps develop a deep interest in the subject.",
                "the teachers create an extrordinary sense of community \r\ncould be better organized however",
                "This course is awesome! Pak is incredible",
                "Classes are a lot of fun!",
                "A little more focus\/direction in the latter half of the semester, and more focus on vocab\/grammar than before."
