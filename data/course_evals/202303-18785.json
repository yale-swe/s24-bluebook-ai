                "Strength: I had a great instructor.\r\n\r\nWeakness: This course moves too quickly, and I would appreciate more course material (e.g. notes) to aid our learning. Also, from talking to my peers, I learned that teaching quality varies a lot between instructors.",
                "Make PSets more similar to what is asked on exams. The only real preparation for exams are the past exams. PSets are really different from what we are tested on.",
                "Strengths: Professor Yarmola, his handouts, peer tutors\r\nWeaknesses: peer tutor hours are 9pm onwards, there is no streamline in the handouts per section, choosing a section Professor with low ratings will directly reflect on your grades, very time consuming",
                "A strength of this course was having the Ximera practice sections. A weakness was the lack of adequate preparation for how much work should be shown on exams.",
                "I think advising and tutoring resources for this course could be better organized as it was very difficult to find more tutoring that worked well for me as a student who was struggling with the content and generally benefits from more personalized tutoring than was made available to me this semester through the TAs. If you have a need for slower, more one-on-one help, which I very much needed this term, it is entirely up to the willingness and availability of your professor whether you can get it or not. I was fortunate enough to have a professor that made himself very available to us and whose teaching style worked really well as he was able to find new ways to explain concepts at a pace that worked for me. Not everyone was access to this availability and synergy with their professor, so I think there should be more options for receiving one-on-one tutoring throughout the semester both for psets and going over class material, which we learn at a very fast pace.",
                "Strengths: the ximeras and psets ensured that we did not fall behind in the material and aided the learning done in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class was very fast paced and falling behind in one session was very risky."
