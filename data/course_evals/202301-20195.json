                "Strengths: Great readings, very insightful class discussions, and the professor is clearly extremely engaged and interested as this is his topic of expertise.  Surprising for a history course, there is not a lot of writing -- just five short discussion posts and one final paper of 10 or 15 pages.\r\n\r\nPotential weaknesses: Some students are more engaged than others in the discussion, it is easy to skip the readings and fall behind, and the \"class presentation\" component of the grade seems very vibes-based (you just talk about the readings for the week you're assigned for 10 minutes or so without any slides or anything). \r\n\r\nThis could also be a strength, depending on how much work you want to do. This seems like an unintentional gut history class, and as much as I appreciate the low workload, I feel that the learning outcome could have been improved by increasing student engagement.",
                "learned a lot improves as semester continues",
                "More structured/interactive material would be great discussions are fantastic, but structured assignments hold everyone accountable for completing the readings.",
                "I really loved the reading. It was very cool being able to read Professor Grandin's book whilst hearing his insights in the class. The books assigned were very manageable, and I found those the best sources to draw upon and gain an understanding of the class.",
                "Strengths - interesting readings\r\nWeaknesses - poorly organized, not well-structured, not suited for seminar style discussion, not academically challenging",
                "I thought this course was not very well organized and the professor did not always provide structured feedback.  I think this course is more akin to a directed reading than a class--it is really what a student makes of it."

                "I would definitely recommend it especially for US history people because it teaches you a lot of important history that you might not be learning in other US history classes. What you give is what you get for this class, so if you're not planning to do the readings you might find the seminars less engaging.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Professor Grandin is excellent and a great lecturer as well as a great seminar facilitator. Even if you don't take the course, you should read his books on the subject (they'll also help you decide if you're interested in the course). The workload is fairly light, so this is a good \"fifth course\" in the sense that it will definitely not overwhelm you, and it'll be something to look forward to.",
                "I would for the subject material",
                "I would, it was a really interesting part of history to get to know.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they have a strong interest in Latin American studies and there are no other courses available in that area if study (which tends to be the case at Yale). The course is easy and Professor Grandin is an easy grader, but there is little to no incentive to do readings because he lectures for most of the seminar. I have received no feedback on my reading responses all semester and have no idea what kind of grade I will receive in this class.",
                "I would recommend this course if someone already had interest and familiarity in Latin America. This course may be engaging for someone who is a self-starter and is willing to do lots of research independently. If someone is looking for an introduction to the topic they should perhaps look elsehwere."
