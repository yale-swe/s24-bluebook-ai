A weakness of the course was the large class size. There were 22 students enrolled and I think the class could have been more engaging if it wasn't as large.",
                "There was great joy and excitement by both the students and professors to be in class everyday.",
                "Strengths: Pak Indriyo and Uni Adel are amazing teachers. So energetic and kind, never a dull class. They go over everything very in depth and making learning Indonesian and the culture so fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was a little more structure in the class, maybe have a structured syllabus and upload early onto canvas. For example, maybe start with sentence structure and word formation before learning random topics. Also, canvas could be updated more frequently.",
                "Great mix of learning in a fun way and getting down to business to highlight the important aspects of both Indonesian culture and the language.",

                "My strengths are the certain basic words and numbers, but my weaknesses are more specific words and sentence structure.",
                "Very well taught",
                "Strength was just doing exercises together in class to keep people engaged."

                "Yes I would",
                "Yes. The course is very interesting, because I feel that know one really knows about Indonesia. Learning a language like Indonesian, which is an uncommon language I feel, is a fun skill to learn."
