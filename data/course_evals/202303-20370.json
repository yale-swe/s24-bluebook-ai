                "I learned a lot about the basis of the U.S. legal system, and how other G-20 countries' constitutions relate\/differ from one another. A comparative lens to constitutions, forms of government, and rights.",
                "I learned how to compare institutions and constitutions across the world. I also learned to write law-focused papers across jurisdictions and how to gain a robust understanding of a particular country's legal history and culture for my final paper.",
                "I learned much about our constitutional system, the legal systems of countries worldwide, and my own interest in the law.",
                "This class was a really interesting survey of American constitutional law and constitutional law in other democracies around the world. I think the course did an excellent job of providing the historical and technical context necessary to have fruitful, topical discussions about subjects that were deeply meaningful to students.",
                "learned about the historical trajectory and case law of G20 nations and compared them, also learned about influences one nations' constitutions had on others' development (ex. US on Japan)",
                "The course served as an excellent introduction to the core features of US constitutional law, as well as a broad survey of the US Constitution's similarities\/differences with other G-20 states.",
                "A broad, general understanding of how different nations constitutions, interpret different important aspects issues.",
                "This course is a great comprehensive introduction to constitutional law from a comparative angle. We analyzed a wide variety of topics, from the procedural and theoretical origins of constitutional law to specific cases on freedom of religion, property rights, and equal protection. The course better acquainted me with legal cases, terminology, and approaches to evaluating and comparing constitutionalism across the G-20 nations.",
                "I learned the basics of Comparative Constitutionism.",
                "I learned a lot about other countries constitutions as well as our own. It is interesting to see how our Constitution influenced so many others and how they came to develop their own practices and legal methods. Calabresi is an amazing teacher that brought an interesting perspective that is often underrepresented in Yale courses and really pushed me to think harder about things and take a second look at some of my own beliefs."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths - Calabresi is very knowledgeable on the course material. The book\/readings are dence but well structured and help you learn a lot. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The course functioned a bit more as a leminar, particularly in the first half of the seminar, but this got better throughout the semester. I think if the discussion questions could have also focused more on comparing two country's systems and what we think might be better would have been interesting.",
                "Strengths: The content is fascinating, and Professor Calabresi is deeply knowledgeable. The casebook is interesting, and I would never have had the opportunity to think as deeply about each issue in so many different national contexts. It also taught me more about the US legal system through the comparison to other countries, particularly on areas where the United States is an outlier (e.g., free speech). I also enjoyed writing the book review and the final paper. Weaknesses: I think the course might have benefited from a weekly writing assignment to gather our thinking before class. I always enjoyed class discussions, but it might have been nice to be able to base my participation off of a written response.",
                "The readings were incredibly informative and I really feel like I learned a lot in the course. Professor Calabresi's seminar structure is not always conducive to super free-flowing debate, but still works to engage students and allow us to have meaningful conversations.",
                "strengths: working through the case law of various nations, particularly learning about different way they approaches the same constitutional issue (ex. freedom of press, religion, federalism, etc.) was very interesting and to this end, the readings were interesting too, the professor is also a nice, kinda shy guy\r\nweaknesses: the actual lecture was very dry and the discussion, especially in the questions posed by prof often felt very basic and surface level (ex. what are your thoughts on abortion?), the reading were also not feasible to complete, nor did they feel like they were mandatory (just know a bit of general stuff about the topic of the week before seminar)",
                "maybe a little more specific and accessible readings might've helped.",
                "The professor has an incredible depth of knowledge and the casebook (written by the professor) was accessibly-written, thorough and enjoyable to read.\r\n\r\nNot many recs for improvement",
                "I really enjoyed the course, but I think more in-depth discussion of individual constitutional issues and cases, rather than a larger survey of how a given issue is interpreted in 20 different constitutional regimes might be helpful. However, Professor Calabresi led a good seminar that was engaging most of the time.",
                "Professor Calabresi is very knowledgeable and asks striking questions during seminar that make you draw on a variety legal topics and principles to answer. He is also good about clearly separating objective legal information from his personal academic views, and he fosters a class environment that welcomes a variety of opinions and lends itself to quite comprehensive debates. I learned a lot not only from Professor Calabresi and the case book but also from my classmates, and the diversity of beliefs in class allowed me to evaluate topics from perspectives I hadn't considered before. I also enjoyed reading and review Professor Ackerman's book Revolutionary Constitutions. My only criticisms are that I wish we received more specific feedback on our midterm papers as well as more specific instruction on what to write for the midterm and final--the prompts were quite vague, and the lack of a grading rubric or model papers meant I had to ask Professor Calabresi for clarification on expectations quite a few times during office hours.",
                "The seminar was too large and ended up being more of a lecture than a seminar.",
                "The greatest strength of the course was Professor Calabresi. Professor Calabresi is a kind professor who is knowledgeable about the material. He is an amazing teacher that brought an interesting perspective that is often underrepresented in Yale courses and really pushed me to think harder about things and take a second look at some of my own beliefs. The concepts covered in class are fascinating too, especially for someone who is pre-law."

                "Yes, if you are interested in learning more about the US legal system and the legal systems of other countries. I would probably advise taking another law-focused class first, because you might otherwise find yourself trying to keep track of legal concepts while also learning about all of its different incarnations in the G-20 countries. That being said, it's an interesting, approachable introduction to the field, so I wouldn't be daunted if it sounds interesting. Professor Calabresi also has such a deep knowledge of all of the content of the course, and it's fascinating to hear his explanations.",
                "Absolutely, just merely because the opportunity to learn from one of the best legal scholars of a generation is too big to pass up.",
                "If you are at all interested in learning about how other countries organize their constitutions, this is a wonderful class to take. Professor Calabresi is extremely knowledgable and cares deeply about his students.",
                "probably a good class to sit in on\/audit, but i feel as though you could learn a lot just by reading the course book or just talking to Calabresi; the class itself was nothing special and there are probably others that are more engaging. but if you want to have access to calabresi to chat in his office hours, that's definitely a perk.",
                "Yes, definitely",
                "Absolutely!  The course is a must-take for any student interested in constitutionalism and law.",
                "I would, if you are a real junkie for constitutional law and comparative politics. I think if thats not something youre interested in the course can get very dry very quickly. A lot of the information comes from the casebook and is not discussed super in depth in class. So its one of those classes where you get a lot out of it if you put a lot in. But if you dont do the reading and just show up to class, even if youre engaged, you probably wont have a great time.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to any student interested in law and comparative politics. You will gain a strong foundation in a variety of legal topics, and you'll learn quite a few interesting historical facts along the way.",
                "The seminars were not super engaging. Professor Calabresi would summarize the readings and then we'd discuss. Nothing really got beyond surface level in our discussions and it felt more like people were performing than discussing. Professor Calabresi cold calls, but only asks opinion questions not fact questions so you don't have to do the readings.",
                "This course is a great intro to comparative constitutional law, but requires some personal initiative.",
                "Yes I would. The topics covered were very interesting and Professor Calabresi often brings perspective to classes that is not often represented. There is a lot of freedom in the course on what to write about. The workload was manageable --- all we had to do was a 10 page paper and a 20 page final."
