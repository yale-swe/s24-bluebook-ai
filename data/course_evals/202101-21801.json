                "I gained a deeper understanding of both the history of China and the analysis of poetry in translation. My previous courses on China rarely discussed the role of women in Chinese society so this course was a breath of fresh air: Chinese womens poetry allowed us to investigate the rich history of feminism, and its intersections with political and other social developments, across the dynasties.",

I learned about how feminism came about in China, and I learned how the words of Confucious were used by women in order to make their arguments.

                "It was a wonderful course. Professor Chang is absolutely amazing. She lectured passionately while allowing space for students to jump in with our own thoughts and questions. I thought the lecture-discussion format was effective and the course content was well structured in chronological manner.",
                "I dont really think there were weaknesses. Professor Chang was beloved by the class, and her syllabus was a wonderful introduction into the Chinese literary canon. I loved that the class was organized by theme; it made the pacing really great.",
                "This class is so wonderfully taught. The discussions are very student-driven and Professor Chang knows so much about all of the topics.",
                "there were so many poems assigned for each class yet very few discussed, so it was often difficult to do the readings since the load was so high yet it felt like we never talked about the majority of them. professor chang is the BEST though, shes so passionate and fun and it was such a joy to hear her talk about the content. she also gives very thorough and clear comments on the essays which is super helpful",
                "strengths: the professor is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. the teaching team really encourages student participation as well.",
                "Strengths: Really amazing professor who is extremely passionate about the subject. Interesting discussions led by TA.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures went on for very long with little student engagement",
                "Strengths: Professor Chang. She is absolutely wonderful. She is so brilliant and just so lovely. I greatly enjoyed learning with her. \r\n\r\nThere are no weaknesses to this class. It was so well taught and it was such a joyful class because it is a topic that is not usually talked about.",
                "The course material - women in literature in traditional China - is such a fascinating, niche topic. \r\n\r\nI wish that this course had been in person to facilitate more engaging discussions, but all things considered, the Zoom format worked well."

For this reason, I would have preferred the addition of a weekly Canvas discussion post or comparable alternative. Live virtual discussion may have been more fruitful that way.",

The class is accessible to all students as it is taught in English and there are no prerequisites, and I think both students who already know about this topic and those who are less familiar with women in ancient China will enjoy this course."
