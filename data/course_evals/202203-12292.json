                "Learned about child development and the structures surrounding child development, e.g. psychology/social science theories of child development, and corresponding policy/curriculum choices based on such theories. A big component of the course was the weekly observations of children, where we'd see the developmental principles discussed in class in practice. These helped me develop skills such as learning how to support and speak to young children. This class really gave me a deeper appreciation for early childhood educators, as well as for the enormous amount of development that happens at an early stage--e.g. language acquisition and social skills and such, and the role of play in helping to develop each of these areas.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths are the opportunities to observe outside of the classroom and the professors, they are really caring. Something super especial about this class is that they bring many guests to do the week's lecture, and since all of them are passionate about what they talk about, the passion for the topics is very contagious. Something to improve is the structure for the class: instructions for the journals were not clear at all until pretty late in the semester. Additionally, instructions for the group work were slightly vague. I also feel like the class could benefit from having more time to engage, and having it be an actual seminar rather than a small mini-lecture which is what it felt like for most of the time. Still, probably one of the best classes in Ed Studies!",
                "I enjoyed the observations! Sometimes it felt like a lot though because it's a long walk to the child care center and then another 2-3 hours of observing and commuting to the places. I loved everything though.",
                "The strength to the course was definitely the required child observations. The course could be improved by having more opportunities for discussion instead of just listening to lecturing.",
                "Strengths: a lot of the course was structured around our weekly observations--I definitely think that seeing child development in practice was the primary part of my learning, and is the primary strength of this course. I think that it was also a strength that the professors had been in the field for so long, and that they would bring in guest speakers to speak directly on the fields they worked in--e.g. they brought in teachers to lecture on curriculum, a psychologist to speak about psychology, etc. All in all--I think the course is pretty in touch with the practice of child development, which really helped me engage with it. The workload also never felt overwhelming. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lecture portions of the class were a tad long. I wish we'd spent more time discussing the material in the class. I also think that more clarity on the expectations for the assignments would have helped. I think also the instructors would benefit greatly from learning how to use Canvas to its full advantage; typically we'd submit things via email, which could've been facilitated by using an Assignments page on canvas, and similar such things would've made the quality of life better. In terms of workload, keep in mind that you will have to spend time each week out of class doing observations, which I didn't mind (and, as above, found a good experience), but which can be a lot depending on how busy you are.",
                "The strengths of the course are the professors and their guest lectures. I was exposed to various facets of the field and I felt that I retained much of the material presented to us. The context was incredibly interesting and useful, especially for those pursuing futures in child care policies. I gained a newfound appreciation of child care and education, as it is far more complex than I initially presumed. Another strength was the observations of the daycare and individual children. I felt like I could finally apply what I learned from the lectures and readings to real-life scenarios. I was able to apply my knowledge and write journals that reflected these connections that I made between observations and course material. As such, I retained the material and understood the implications of what I learned in the course, which will be useful in my future medical career. I don't think that the course can really be improved because the professors were understanding of the students' situations, even when there was confusion with the journal writing instructions. The professors are clearly passionate about the material and care about the wellbeing of the students, which leads me to the conclusion that there are really no weaknesses in the course.",
                "STRENGTHS: Getting to observe real teachers who are experts in the childcare field. Also talking to guest speakers who are deeply involved in the work we were discussing. WEAKNESSES: Sometimes, it felt like the instructors and daycare center supervisors were saying that a parenting technique or idea was \"CLEARLY the best way\" with tone of judgement, especially towards people/cultures who parent different/have different values than white-American-middle-class. In fact, very few students had white-American-middle-class upbringings, and it felt like all those parenting styles were discounted and othered as \"less than.\" Phrases like \"that's why I don't understand parents who...\" or \"that's why THOSE kids aren't successful\" felt like it was targeting BIPOC and immigrant parenting. I encourage the entire teaching team to really think about what conclusions are supported by large bodies of data, which are supported by case studies, which are supported by personal experiences, and what voices and experiences are left out of data and conclusions. I also noticed that there were quite a few Asian American women in the class, and it seemed that the teaching team could not tell them apart, even after 13 weeks of instructing a small seminar class. They would mix up their names and specifically call them out for attendance. This also added to the air of judgement towards immigrant/BIPOC parenting styles that I was picking up from the teaching team.",

I feel like at times the lectures were just being dragged in order to fill in the time, while I feel like the professors had so many experiences to share that could have made it more engaging. Every time they talked about an actual case or real life examples, the whole class would find it fascinating. Overall I think it is a fun class to take, and you will be much more appreciative of child development after having taken it. You will spend a lot of time around children too, which is super fun! The professors are adorable and super caring, so that is definitely another plus. Probably one of the best Ed Studies courses out there!",

The material is very engaging and both the professors and guest lecturers place a lot of effort in cultivating a course that demonstrates the complexity of child development, care, education, and policies. Regardless of your background, I believe that there is much to be gained from the course, whether it be through a research scope or one focused on politics. Further, the professors are passionate about the material, which makes it much easier for the students to retain the information and understand its application to real-life. Also, the professors care for their students, which is priceless in a course.",
