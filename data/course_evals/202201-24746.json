                "I thought the ability to view objects in the YUAG and at West Campus was amazing, and I liked the way that movies, videos, and images were incorporated throughout. There were a lot of readings (the class is really based on readings) so at times I think a slight change in format would have been nice for assignments, but on the whole the class was very interesting and there was a lot of material to consider.",
                "This course was excellent. The trips to museums, where we could actually examine pieces of art first hand, was extremely riveting and relevant for helping us form ideas and connections about buddhist practices, especially in Japan. The readings for this course were also very engaging. I cannot think of any weaknesses or improvements.",
                "Strengths: The syllabus is clearly thoughtfully put together, and the readings were all fascinating (+ it was the perfect amount of readings). The reading response assignments helped me think through some of the issues discussed in them before diving into the class discussion, which was very helpful. Professor Cross is super kind, attentive and accessible (we had one-on-one meetings which made my experience in the course more engaging). Our visits to the MET, the YUAG and some other Yale collections were also great - it felt like the course really made use of a lot of resources that are available at Yale, which I really appreciated. No weaknesses!",
                "Sometimes the class discussions never dug deeper than the surface level of the texts we read. However, this class was great in how it encouraged each of us to explore our own interests in these topics.",
                "This course was incredibly interesting throughout and had riveting discussions led by Professor Cross. I looked forward to going to class each week, and the various field trips were also quite exciting. Professor Cross also gave detailed and fantastic feedback on all of our reading responses and assignments. I have no criticisms of the course - I just wish we could have met for more discussions and that I had gotten the chance to get to know the others in the seminar better!"

                "yes! so interesting and well structured and lots of amazing field trips",
                "If you are very interested in East Asian religion, yes! As long as you are interested in these topics, the class is manageable, consistent in terms of subject matter and workload, and Professor cross is really kind.",
                "I would most certainly recommend this class to another student. The concepts, ideas, and pieces of art explored throughout the class are very interesting, and you gain so many new appreciations.",
                "Yes, 100% - one of the best (if not the best) courses I have taken at Yale! Professor Cross is amazingly kind and attentive, always provided clear feedback, organized one-on-one meetings, etc. - it was clear that she cares about her students. The readings were fascinating and the in-class discussion was always interesting. The assignments were totally manageable - you will definitely spend quite a bit of time on them, but I felt that they went a long way in helping me retain things and build on ideas from previous weeks. There's also a lot of variety in the course - we watched a film, visited the MET, the YUAG, the Beinecke and some other Yale collections, and overall just made use of a lot of resources that we often forget are available to us. The course also teaches you so much about Buddhism, funerary rituals, the intersection of culture and religion, etc., and I have been surprised at the number of times some of the themes from the course came up in conversation with friends or deepened my understanding of modern media that touches on these topics. Could not recommend enough. Take it!!!",
                "Yes, it was very fun!",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in East Asian history, Buddhism, or customs surrounding death. Ultimately, even if you're not interested in these things, you will probably love this course!"
