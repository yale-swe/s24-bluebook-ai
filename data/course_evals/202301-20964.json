I learned a great deal about some inorganic lab techniques that paired quite nicely with prior knowledge of organic technique/equipment. In the lecture portion of the lab, we learned about techniques ranging from x-ray diffraction, organometallic coordination, coordination complexes, and organocatalysis.",

                "Dr. Parr strikes a really good balance of guiding you through the whole experiment, analysis, and writing process while also forcing you to work through challenges on your own. I learned a lot how to connect a few numerical data points to concepts (as opposed to more rigorous numeric analysis, like in pchem lab). My only real \"weakness\" for the course is that it would have been nice to have our third lab report back before turning in the final report.",
                "Really fun lab with pretty products. The lab usually goes on until at least 5, and we have 4 pretty intense lab reports. But I learned a lot and immensely enjoyed this class. However, the class is slightly disorganized at times (no submission link, not super clear instructions sometimes, etc.)",
                "I'd say the biggest strength of the course are the Friday sessions where we discussed how to take our results and turn them into a paper which flowed and effectively communicated results. The discussions of analysis (and just how much information a single spectrum could contain) and figures were consistently helpful and gave us tools to effectively communicate research in the future.",
                "Strengths: This course is ripe with strengths. Its main strength, in my opinion, is the knowledge and preparation of Dr. Parr. I always felt as though the course had a great flow to it, and lacked \"filler\" work that wasn't productive. This course was a very low-stakes, but more independent lab where you could make decisions on your own about experimentation and procedure. \r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness that I can think of is that, this year in particular, the lecture portion of the lab was inadequate in teaching us the skills that we needed to be prepared for this course, content-wise. Upon doing each of the labs, we were being introduced to crystal structures, coordination chemistry, and polymer chemistry for the first time, where this is something that we should have learned already in lecture, but didn't. This often served to give the students who took CHEM 252 in advance a bit of an advantage. So, I would recommend maybe doing a little bit less history during the lectures (since we come across it anyway in researching for writing introductions), and focusing on what the required knowledge for analysis in reports is.",
                "Wonderful course! You learn so much and lab reports are difficult but you get so much out of it and its very rewarding to look back on your progress at the end of the semester. The experiments we do and relevant and very interesting and they introduce you to great literature",
                "This was a wonderful course. I really enjoyed all of the experiments; each one taught me new skills and concepts. The course was well-organized and I received clear feedback on all of my assignments.",
                "Strengths: it was for the most part a reasonable course. Dr. Parr was helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: poor organization, long lab reports."

                "Yes! Definitely worth taking alongside the inorganic lecture, regardless of the professor. Inorganic chemistry has some difficult concepts that clicked a lot better when I was able to experience them and was forced to work through them in the writing process.",
                "Yes. You learn not just chemistry, but academic writing.",
                "I would. The workload is substantial around the time that lab reports are due, but the experiments and concepts involved are interesting and I learned a lot from working with my data to make polished reports. Dr Parr is a lot of fun, very accommodating, and highly knowledgeable about the subjects we discuss, just be sure to finish up working by 5 p.m. if humanly possible because at that point he would very much like it if you left. Do ask him about New Wave music though, we had a great running joke about Talking Heads by the end of the semester.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Assuming you're taking it because you're chemistry (or MB&B) major, this course was a great, low-stakes way to do lab experiments relating to inorganic chemistry. The workload of this course was not too great, but it could, at times, feel overwhelming if you start lab reports late. It's much more doable if you start your lab reports a week in advance, as they can take upwards of 10 hours + to complete. The lab reports, even though lengthy, were actually not horribly because this felt like the first lab where my results could actually be used for analysis, and not just restating what I did in lab. Also, if the concepts are at all confusing, please don't hesitate to visit Dr. Parr he is more than happy to explain the chemistry that you'll need to understand your report, especially if it has not yet been covered in lecture.",
                "Yes! The course is lots of work but is very much worth it for the amount you learn. You get great feedback to improve your scientific writing skills and since youre writing papers in ACS style, you feel very well prepared for future work in chemistry. Definitely recommend for chem majors as the advanced lab requirement or for anyone else looking to learn more chem techniques or improve their writing skills! This goes even if you didnt take it for a writing credit",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially as the lab elective requirement for the Chemistry major.",
                "It depends. Its a good course but the workload is significant."
