                "My Spanish reading and writing abilities grew immensely through this class.

I would have had more help with speaking if we were in person, but Zoom of course made discussions and easy feedback more difficult.",

                "I found that this course was very helpful to improve my Spanish. I learnt all the tenses in Spanish in which I was a bit uneasy with. I learnt a lot about Latin American cultures to which I havent been exposed before."

                "The course really features a diversity of teaching media. From podcasts, to books, and history, I engaged with Spanish in a lot of different ways. I really enjoyed this because it just generally helped me improve in the language. However, I felt the grammatical aspect of the class was kind of tangential. We went through a textbook and had required exercises, but they were never really taught in class or clearly tested, we were just expected to understand and be able to use the tenses in conversation and writing. This could be improved by spending a little more time teaching grammar.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Baffi was very nice and understanding. She was really passionate about helping students to learn the material. She also made the class more enjoyable by having us watch movies, listen to podcasts, and read short stories, which were more interesting than just reading the textbook, etc. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The online textbook we needed for this class was over $100 for one semester (I can't remember the exact amount). And you had to get it because that was how we did a portion of our homework (Supersite). We had different assignments on Supersite and on Canvas, which was a little confusing sometimes. Also, if you are more introverted like I am, then this class will be more challenging for you because you are expected to participate quite a bit.",
                "I felt this course provided a well rounded balance of speaking practice, written practice, and reading practice. We were able to engage with fellow classmates in break out rooms. I think because of the virtual format, there was some confusion in the beginning of the semester as to the course materials and how to obtain those. But overall I really enjoyed it!",
                "I really enjoyed the way in which Professor Baffi presented information in different ways and taught us a lot about the different cultures and customs.",
                "Strengths: The course was the right level of challenging; it was not a huge step up from Spanish 130, but I feel like I am a better speaker after it.\r\nWeaknesses: Languages at Yale are just a lot of work; there was daily work, and always an assignment around the corner.",
                "This course enabled us to fully master Spanish grammar and appreciate Latin American culture. I feel like the exams could have been more less direct grammar application and more language based."

                "The course overall did quite well. The first weeks were a little rough as figuring out the best way to conduct class was determined. I really enjoyed having two asynchronous days with more work because it allowed class to be more focused on discussion and understanding. I would just say that feedback needed to be more prompt and more regular. It was frequently hard to get feedback on our writing or speaking in class, and then feedback on assignments could take a while to be returned, making growth from past work slow.",
                "I think the breakout room discussions were nice because it was with a smaller group so people felt more comfortable talking most of the time. However, I think they were utilized a bit too often (almost every single activity was in a breakout room).",
                "Breakout rooms were successful. Additionally, I appreciated that the professor allowed us to watch the films on our own time as opposed to in class. This allowed for greater flexibility.",
                "This course was properly adapted to accommodate students in the pandemic. I finished Spanish 130 in the spring (when school first closed), in which instructors made no changes to the syllabus (strict attendance policy, daily Zoom classes, etc.) and it was plainly a nightmare. Taking this course shortly after was like night and day. We had synchronous\/asynchronous days, and Profesora Baffi specifically was extremely understanding and flexible.",
                "The breakout rooms helped us speak in Spanish with ourselves and sometimes with the Professor. The projects were also very helpful to improve our  Spanish."

                "If you are trying to fulfill your language requirement, or continue getting better at Spanish, that is the purpose of the class. It is a no-frills language class. While the focus is not on grammar and vocal, the focus of the class is still improving your Spanish skills. If you are at all shaky in writing or reading, this class will help with that and, in my case, has made me more confident to go forward and take a L5 class. However, the class is not easy, you need to put time into learning that language well.",
                "I would only recommend if it is to finish a language requirement. Prof. Baffi was extremely nice and kind, so if you're going to take this class, I would recommend taking it with her. However, the workload was quite a lot (even in the online format) and the material was somewhat boring at times. We \"learned\" a lot in a very short amount of time, but I didn't feel like I absorbed most of the information.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to a student continuing their Spanish language requirement. The workload was greater than L3, however I appreciated that there was more opportunity for genuine conversation as opposed to structured\/question& answer dialogues.",
                "I would not recommend that a student take a language remotely. It was a lot more difficult than learning in person",
                "The level of rigor definitely depends on your professor. If you have the opportunity to take it with Profesora Baffi, I would highly recommend it! I do feel like I am better off having taken the class as part of my language sequence (120-130-140), as I feel like a confident speaker.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it helps you improve your Spanish at least grammar wise."
