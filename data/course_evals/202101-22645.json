                "This course gave me a great understanding of game theory and its applications to analyzing  decision making in international relations.",
                "I learned about the rationalist perspectives on major international security issues, such as whether Germany rationally started WWI to preemptively disable Russia or whether the US was rational in invading Iraq in 2003. I also learned about the mathematical analysis of social sciences problems. At first, I was not a big fan of quantification and formalization of great power dynamics because I believed that they are too complex to be explained in numbers. But after taking this course, I was convinced of the validity of the applications of game theory to international security because under the correct set of assumptions. it produces interesting insights and fits the empirical evidence. It is also much easier to understand complex logical reasoning chains with game theory than just with words.",
                "I gained a strong grasp of game theory and how to apply it to political situations, and got access to a wealth of academic literature about the history of these conflicts and about how game theory concepts (signaling, repeated games, etc.) are expressed through them. Questions like \"Was the Iraq War mistaken\" and \"Were the Christmas Truces of 1914 irrational\" were thoroughly discussed and answered in this course.",
                "Comprehensive understanding of game theory and realist international relations theory",

                "This course was a great mix of game theory and IR. I came in with very little experience with either and felt the balance between the two of the class was effective",
                "concept of rational choice, solutions concepts in game theory, modeling and solving interactions between states using game-theoretic models, insight into the rationality of war, bargaining, and nuclear proliferation",
                "I developed an introductory knowledge into the field of game theory stretching from Nash Equilibria to Perfect Bayesian Equilibria. However, the main takeaway from the course was how this knowledge could be applied to International Relations. These models would provide a foundation with which we could analyze historical events through a game theoretic lens. For example, we would analyze a model and argue a statement such as the U.S. invasion of Iraq being rational."

                "I thought everything about it was great.",
                "The main strength of this course is that after we learn a certain concept in game theory, we immediately use it to understand real-world problems that matter. This course is also more focused on thinking about a problem and what different actors would do than about math and unnecessarily complex calculations. Despite being less math-heavy and more applied than other game theory courses, this course still covers the same concepts you learn in other game theory courses.\r\nAs to the weakness, it would be great to practice making games ourselves to describe a certain conflict and not just solve already prepared games. Also, the lectures mostly just went over what we could read in the books with little new material.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Clear, detailed feedback on homework assignments and midterms\r\n- Engaging lectures with discussion components\r\n- Useful sections with problem breakdowns\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- It took a long time for midterm 1 grades to come out\r\n- I feel like we should have more in-depth step-by-step problem breakdowns",
                "I thought it was a good class! The workload was manageable, and we adjusted pretty well to the virtual format. There were some lectures where Professor Debs seemed to speed through things, so my only suggestion would be to shorten the agenda for each day if possible.",
                "Strengths: The course provides a nice overview on game theory and its applications on international relations issues. The application part is interesting. Prof. Debs and Micheal the TF are really nice and helpful. The workload is moderate; not too much so theres enough time to digest everything. Weaknesses: not a ton. The class can perhaps be a bit more engaging but that might improve when class goes in person without COVID.",
                "I thought the way this course was set up was extremely effective. Doing the readings in the textbook before class made the mathematical material much easier to follow, and I appreciated that we could then use class time for a bit more discussion. Going over example problems in the weekly sections was also very helpful",
                "Strength: well-organized material - a solid textbook and a logical progression through theory interspersed with examples. Prof Debs is clear and engaging, and in-class discussion segments helped commerce of ideas between students too.",
                "Strengths of this course include the organization and the systemic teaching of the material. Game theory courses generally require a economics pre-requisite while this one does not and the way the game theoretical topics are approached because of this made it more accessible to me. The connections to IR were relevant and generally followed historical order. The TA and professor were also readily available in case some of the topics did not make sense. An improvement for the course could be the use of breakout rooms which I felt limited the time we had to talk and usually only a few people could voice their opinions."

I am personally not that into war, but needed to take game theory for the EP&E major. If you want to fulfill the game theory requirement in the easiest way possible, this is not the course for you! If you want to learn game theory AND apply it to recent violent conflicts, especially those involving nuclear weapons, you should take this course.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. This class covers approximately the same topics as the game theory class in ECON department, but the application of game theory on IR is really interesting and I recommend those who want to study more about political science/IR to take this version, especially those whore interested in international security. The workload is moderately low and the professor is nice. Good class in general.",
                "Yes! Professor Debs's work is very interesting to read and discuss with him and classmates. This felt like a great mix of both game theory and IR concepts from historical to more current events and I feel I learned a lot about both.",
                "YES if you want a more integrated, practical (and imo more transformative) approach to game theory",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I did not think I would like this course much as it is not really related to my major; however, I ended up enjoying the course as the game theory does get a little heavy but does not get overbearing. The connections to international relations is also very interesting and generates a new way to look at major historical events."
