Instead, we often had 4 or more relatively complex and long readings and would only talk about one or two of them over a whole 2 hour class period. The conversation during class was centered around certain topics but otherwise was unstructured. Conversation often drifted and fragmented, a problem which might have been solved if we spent more time talking about more specific readings and topics. This might have been a product of having so much material to cover but it still could have been focused into less readings."

The first half was very difficult for me to get through, it was lots of thick readings + movies. The second half got way more interesting. \r\n\r\nThis is not a gut! At least not if you want to be in a comfortable spot to write a 1500 word midterm and 3500 word final. \r\n\r\nHence I would recommend it to people who are genuinely interested in the subject, otherwise consider a different course",
