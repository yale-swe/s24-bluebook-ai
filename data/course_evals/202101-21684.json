The course covered the basics of cell biology, discussing protein synthesis pathways and organization, as well as larger ideas in cellular systems and organization. However, the real power of this course came from how these ideas were interleaved with ideas of how these systems are discovered and building up biological reasoning. Every lecture focused on explaining a system and how it was discovered to help you understand how biological research is done and how results are interpreted. I found this incredibly fun because the focus of the class was much less on learning information and much more on being able to understand how to think like a biologist in designing experiments to test hypotheses and then evaluate results and propose explanations.",

Basically, we covered a few cell biology topics in (some) detail, instead of doing a broad survey of the whole cell.

I came in with very little knowledge of cell biology, only taking in what I had learned in high school (mitochondria, cell diagram, etc). However, I learned that there is so much more to cell biology than the basics, and I did find the material to be very interesting. I think the most important thing I learned by taking this course was how beyond important collaboration is when permissible attending peer tutoring sessions and talking over some of the PSET questions with peers was the only thing that got me through this course. If you are going to take it, make SURE you have enough time to collaborate and go to peer tutoring sessions  otherwise, it will be a challenging semester.",

Specifically, I gained a greater understanding of the structural and functional aspects of biological membranes and associated membrane proteins, different mechanisms of membrane transport and endocytosis of various cellular substances, and different mechanisms of protein synthesis and protein secretion pathways. I also developed an in-depth understanding of the functional and structural aspects of the cytoskeleton of an animal cell, including an in-depth understanding of the actin cytoskeleton as well as microtubules and their role in cell division. On top of gaining an understanding of biological processes and structural biology, I gained an understanding of the experimental techniques and instruments utilized to initially discover these biological processes and aspects of cell biology.

In high school, the focus was primarily on general processes within the cell, but I was very happy to have learned much about biotechnology and have the opportunity to apply our knowledge as if we were to conduct experiments in the lab ourselves through the problem set questions. I was challenged in this course, which led me to finding a group of students with whom I met to talk through the material. It is because of the peer-tutoring sessions, the discussion sections, and this course, in general, that I also feel more comfortable reading scientific papers."

                "Sometimes hard with just recorded lectures",
                "The strengths of this course are in the depth of knowledge that we develop in half a semester. The peer tutoring sessions were critical to my understanding of the problem sets, and the discussion sections were crucial to my understanding of the weekly paper. It could be improved by breaking up the videos into 30 minutes.",
                "This course was a bigger jump from BIOL 101, and I struggled in the transition. I think while BIOL 101 is easier to get through because of the overlap with AP Bio, BIOL 102 is a lot harder because the information is all very new and the PSETs are all about applying this new information. Thank goodness for office hours with the peer tutors because they are all super helpful with helping us understand and complete the PSETs.",

                "This class was extremely informative.",
                "Strengths: Professor Loreng and the peer tutors! They really helped me get through content and problem sets each week. Weakness: Professor Mooseker. He clearly knows what hes talking about, but he never articulates anything in a way that wed be able to understand.",
                "strengths: problem sets were very fair and representative of the material taught. The course was very well structured and organized. The weekly review sessions with Professor Mooseker were very helpful and engaging. Feedback was delivered in a clear way. All in all, I felt like I actually learned some interesting bio in this class. \r\nweakness: none!",
                "The strengths of this course was the preciseness of the content provided in lecture, which helped the student's understanding of topics in cell biology. The problem sets directly supplemented the material presented in lecture. One of the weaknesses of this course was that the material presented in lecture, although in depth, was sometimes presented in a way that made it difficult to understand for an introductory biology student.",
                "The course was not very organized and the amount of content presented in the lectures was overwhelming. I did not feel like I absorbed any of the information from the lectures. There was also not a lot of coherence between the lectures every week. Several details about very specific topics were presented and were never touched on again. BIOL 101 was much more organized and the content was formatted better.",
                "I think the strength was how focused the psets were on reasoning. Any necessary factual information could be looked up so the focus was on thinking through problems. This was hard at first, but very fun and rewarding. I did find the papers we read for discussion section were sometimes very related to concepts in class and provided useful case studies of the procedures we were discussing, but sometimes were further removed and felt less relevant to course materials.",
                "Strengths: cohesive, problem sets were useful to synthesize the material\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be dull and it seemed arbitrary what material was chosen to be important or to be covered at all",

                "Strengths: I thought the experimental techniques were really annoying to learn, but I learned a ton about biology and how researchers find things out. I also appreciated the fact we focused on a few important topics, instead of having to cram a bunch of facts about unrelated systems. Finally, the only assessments we had were quizzes on course content and weekly psets, which was nice.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sections felt basically useless -- we listened to a TA talk for a bit, had a really short breakout room, then left without gaining much.",
                "The discussion section and peer tutoring session added a lot to make the material easier to understand.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The discussion sections were very helpful with the readings.\r\n- lots of resources to ask questions about psets and concepts\r\n- psets were collaborative and working with peers helped strengthen my knowledge of the material\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- content of the course seemed very specific to microtubules and not as general to cell biology",
                "Strengths: Professor super willing to help and accommodate the class.  He really cared about our well-being and made himself available throughout the course.  Discussion sections were helpful.  Peer tutor office hours were ESSENTIAL and SO helpful for completing the problem sets, which weren't that bad with the help of the peer tutors.  I appreciated how the professor gave us quiz worksheets to fill out as we viewed the lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: I constantly felt confused by the lectures and what we were supposed to be learning.  On many occasions, lectures were filled with vocab and concepts that I did not understand, having not taken AP Bio in high school.  Many times, I would get through the entire lecture and only realize at the very end what the main point was supposed to be (ex: describing the pathway a protein takes through the cell once it is made).  At the end of the course, I didn't really know what the main takeaways were supposed to be.",
                "The powerpoints were often packed very densely with information, which did not always appear on problem sets. This made it difficult to focus on what the professor was saying, as their was so much material moving so quickly, and also made it difficult to identify the important topics. The pre-recorded format was helpful, however, for enabling pausing and re-watching of this material. Additionally, the peer-tutor OHs were invaluable, but this does suggest that the lectures themselves did not enable a sufficient understanding to complete the assignments.",
                "This course was very information-heavy, which made it difficult at times to properly digest the material each week. I appreciated the asynchronous recorded lectures that allowed me to go back and clarify any information I struggled to understand.",
                "Great course.  Very well taught and facilitated. I wish discussion sections were not journal clubs because the content covered in lecture was challenging, and a section for clarity would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: Covered a lot of content in a short period of time.\r\nWeaknesses: I enjoyed BIOL 101 much more than BIOL 102. In BIOL 102, I felt like more of my focus was on maintaining my grade, while in BIOL 101, I was more concerned about mastering the content. The two courses feel severely disjointed, and my shift from 101 to 102 felt staggering. I think this course would benefit by being more cohesive with 101, especially since I felt like I learned more effectively in 101 as a result of less emphasis on grades than in 102.",
                "The course is good at helping to decide if you want to keep going with biology, for better or for worse. It is rigorous and challenging enough to let you see if you truly wish to keep learning about it. The course is interesting and the collaborative PSETs embolden us to be better biologists.",
                "Strengths - collaborative PSETs and the peer tutors Kevin and Drew\r\nWeaknesses - I honestly learned nothing from this class. It was a huge jump from Bio 101 to 102. The lectures were so dense and I didn't see where everything was going and how everything tied together. I honestly cannot point to a single thing that I learned from this course. The lectures were packed with big words that only super smart people can understand, and given that the Psets were due on Mondays, you only had Monday afternoon to Wednesday morning to watch all the lectures since the quizzes were due in the morning. This is not the only class I was taking! So of course I did not have time to digest every lecture (would have required me watching them over and over again). Everything was really hard to follow.",
                "The course covers very specific topics and goes through material very quickly. It really helped in my understanding of how cells behave but otherwise, the engagement was low and sometimes felt very tedious.",
                "Lectures were not really engaging.",
                "The recorded lectures were extremely difficult to learn from and hard to understand. The material was not clearly presented and it was hard to understand. The quizzes were supposed to have questions in plain sight and they were not at all. Prof Mooseker did not explain things well he would just say certain terms that were not previously mentioned in one quick sentence and we were expected to have in depth knowledge about it. Strength was my TF",
                "Dr. Moosekar seems very kind and passionate; unfortunately, his teaching is esoteric and difficult to follow. He goes into extreme detail without giving a larger picture, making lectures very very difficult to follow. I really did not retain anything from lectures; all of my learning came from doing the PSETs and completing my own independent work. That being said, the Peer Tutors were a HUGE strength--they were extremely helpful and were great at breaking down work and helping with the PSETs.",
                "Strengths: TA office hours helped tremendously with the PSETS, which without the TA's help, would be extremely difficult to complete (they were not straightforward from lectures). Weaknesses: PSETS and Quizzes. The PSETs contained ambiguous, difficult questions that were not easily answered by referring to the lecture videos. The weekly quizzes were definitely the worst part of this course. The questions contained incredibly ambiguous answers and they were extremely time-consuming even after pausing while watching the videos (e.g. the lecture videos may add up to 90 minutes, but the quizzes, which were only 10-15 or so multiple-choice questions, would add another 1-2 hours to that time). These could be improved by using wording and vocabulary that matches up with the videos to reduce ambiguity and confusion.",
                "A weakness of the course was the prerecorded lectures. They were very difficult to get through because of the specificity and complexity of the content. Also, there was no evident path of learning. That is to say, it seemed that we were learning things at random and it was hard to decide what content related to what. A strength of the course was the fact that all documents, hand outs, and notes were available to download on Canvas.",
                "The strengths were the review sessions with the red questions causing us to delve deeper into each topic. These sessions truly helped me succinctly understand the material because while the lectures are very informative, a lot of information can be overwhelming when understanding the information. A weakness was the weekly quizzes that were 30 percent of our grade. While it was really good because it helped us figure out what to focus on from the sea of information, each question's length was so long. One sentence was 4 lines long which only complicated the idea it was trying to portray. Next time make the questions multiple sentences to increase understanding and sometimes there were some things that Professor Mooseker would not talk about in the quiz. Please make the questions less specific if not referenced in the lecture.",
                "The class couldve benefitted from more tailored lectures or a more streamlined lecture so as to not confuse concepts that have overlap. Besides, that the lectures were very helpful.",
                "Collaborative psets and peer tutoring were a great way to learn the material while engaging with peers. It was the only way to understand the lectures that were really dense, and a lot of the time felt like they weren't getting straight to the point.",
                "Strengths: It was very well organized, and they were very proactive about answering questions people had on Ed discussion. There we also a lot of opportunities for support, including the weekly review sessions or the peer tutor review sessions\r\nWeaknesses:  The lectures weren't very engaging, but I think this was more of a product of having asynchronous, virtual lectures.  While I appreciated that the course was centered more towards applying the content to laboratory settings as opposed to memorization, I didn't retain as much elementary information as I would have liked for more advanced biology courses. However, learning to apply concepts is a vital skill, and this may be a necessary trade-off.",
                "The course lectures, although long, were packed with lots of information that was presented very clearly. It was very easy to follow what was being taught at the time. The problem sets were very well created in that they really made you think about the content and apply it.",
                "I personally loved the format of the class and being able to learn at my own pace. The information taught in this class is much deeper than AP biology and really gives you a good overview of the specific mechanisms that cells use. The weekly discussion sections were also very useful in helping us understand how to read scientific literature. I do not think there were any weaknesses for me.",
                "This course worked very well online! The recorded lectures were great, Prof. M's review sessions were extremely helpful and section was relevant. Perhaps less weight on the quizzes would be a good idea, since multiple choice questions are not conducive to critical thinking, which is a hallmark of the course.\r\n\r\nProf. M is the strenght of this course. He makes things not too complex and not too simple, so you end the course with very specific knowledge while not being overwhelmed by nomenclature. His way of explaining things is perfect for an intro course that actually tries to teach.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Mooseker truly cares about his students and was always available one email away. Although the recorded lectures could drag and get boring, he was always willing to explain something over email and engage with students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was very unengaging as a result of the remote adaptations.",
                "-",
                "The course was very highly organized and Professor Mooseker was extremely helpful and warm. He was keen to help whenever I had any questions. I can say the same thing about the TFs - they were all extremely kind and keen to help.",
                "This course is helpful in using the scientific journal papers assigned each week to explain and supplement the lecture information about cell biology topics.",
                "The material is interesting and the homework is not too difficult while still being engaging.",
                "The strengths were that the lectures greatly prepared me for psets and quizzes. However, I think some of the weeks, there was a lot of material covered in lecture that sometimes got hard to manage.",
                "The lectures were relatively well taught, however the psets often had questions that could be difficult to discern, and in many cases asked for plausible explanations, but would award no points for explanations which weren't a perfect explanation for the phenomena. This also encouraged a very heavy reliance upon the office hours where students would simply be given the answers to the psets or present their answers to the ULAs until their answers perfectly matched the rubric, which hurt learning.",
                "Weaknesses: Unclear\/jargony\r\nStrengths: I became so much better at biology and synthesizing info",
                "Strengths: A TON of content, the review sessions were helpful, lots of support.\r\nWeakness: Content would get extremely complex very quickly with little to no in depth explanations. Most of the topics I was learning and applying to the PSets were just going off of what I was told and saw in the notes, not what I actually understood.",
                "Strengths: super helpful peer tutors and kind professors. ULA's and TA's are super helpful too!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Content is really dense and definitely not intro-material, so that can be kind of intimidating at first, but don't let that scare you away because there are SO MANY other students who feel the same way!",
                "Strengths: Discussion sections (journal clubs) were taught well and organized. Problem sets were hard but did a good job testing our understanding of the material. Peer tutors\/office hours were extremely helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: recorded lectures were fast-paced and felt disjumbled at times. Think it will be better in person though",
                "Strengths: TFs and Peer Tutors were great, very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of learning packed into just 48 hours each week, since the lecture quiz is due on Wednesday morning and lectures are only released on Monday (or most students are focusing on the problem set until then). Would you consider moving the lecture quizzes to Thursday morning to give students more time to watch lectures?",
                "The teachers were so kind and available for help!",
                "The recorded lectures were dense in content and, at times, difficult to understand. Some of the peer tutors at the review sessions were so concerned about \"not giving away the answers\" to the problem sets that they did not actually help clarify class content. \r\n\r\nHowever, the weekly lecture quizzes helped to keep me focused while watching lectures.",
                "Weakness: the material was too specific to be considered an introductory cell bio course. We learned very intricate pathways and barely discussed any organelles and cellular components beyond vesicles, ER, golgi bodies, and cytoskeleton. The PSET questions are also absurdly vague but have very specific answers (grading was very strict and points were docked off for reasons not made clear in lectures).\r\n\r\nStrength: none",
                "I liked the idea of having weekly quizzes and the psets were also decently challenging. However, I often found myself not engaging with the quizzes. SOm information was hard to obtain from the lectures alone, and I didn't find the book useful at all. The psets themselves were hard on their own, and if it weren't for office hours, I don't think I would have done as good a job as I did.",
                "The lectures were clear and concise and I thought the PSETs were well constructed.",
                "Not a very engaging class.",
                "This course was laden with information and fairly difficult to follow along.  We delved into so many small details with each lecture that I struggled at times to fully grasp the information presented to me.",
                "Strengths: I think Prof. Mooseker was one of the most compassionate and kind professors that I have met at Yale. I think is very genuine, and you can definitely get a sense of that compassion in his interaction with students. I also think his passion for biology lends to him being engaged with the material in a way that can be helpful to students. \r\nWeaknesses: While a lot of weaknesses may be due to the virtual format of this class, I think that some can be improved upon for a more beneficial semester for students. Firstly, Prof. Mooseker, while it may seem simple to him, uses very inaccessible and complex vocabulary in his lectures often, to the point where you cannot even understand sentences because it is assumed that you know what he is talking about. Secondly, I think that the problem sets were not great evaluations of what students understood. They were often \"pushing\" the knowledge of the course material, which, while effective in some questions, is difficult to achieve when every question is \"pushing.\" Thirdly, the discussion section format of discussing papers was wholly ineffective for me learning about those papers, which often seemed just barely germane to that week's course material, made little to no difference in my knowledge. I think discussion sections would be better spent going over course material, as the TAs may be able to explain things in a more accessible way that Mooseker cannot. The last thing I would say is that",
                "Everything asynchronous was a challenge for staying motivated and it felt like most of the biology information was skipped over. I felt like the content on the psets did not translate very well and I felt like I had not learned very much.",
                "One strength of this course was that it was focused on learning and assessing the learning through psets, so no tests. One weakness of this course was that the review session sometimes was way too fast to keep up with since there was alot covered in the lectures.",
                "The course was interesting but I never really understood what I was supposed to be learning. Most of the information communicated in lectures felt tangential to my future science career at Yale. I learned it so I could do well on the quizzes but it felt unnecessary. Also, many of the words used in the lecture were never clearly defined, which complicated an already difficult subject matter. I know scripted lectures can be more boring but they would definitely help in this case because during many lectures Professor Mooseker would start a sentence like \"[complicated vocabulary word] refers to...\" and then get sidetracked so I never got a clear definition of the word.",
                "A lot of complex content was covered in lecture, so adding review materials such as a study outline or importantly vocabulary list could be useful to summarize each unit.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are well organized, extremely insightful \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are difficult to understand, difficult to retain knowledge",
                "Strengths of this course includes the approachability of the professor - I felt comfortable emailing him with any questions I had about both the course itself and the content. A weakness of the course was... well, I think it's just that the method through which the professor taught just doesn't match my method of learning, so I really struggled with understanding much of the content, because Professor Mooseker was an auditory presenter while I am much more hands on and actually have an auditory processing disorder. So for me, improvement should find itself in adding versatility in the methods of teaching.",
                "The discussion sections were well organized and the lectures were detailed and interesting.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Mooseker is very kind and accommodating to all his students. The course is also very well organized (at least when I took it virtually). I enjoyed the use of key topics and questions in the study guides and lectures - they helped guide me through the huge amount of information taught in the course. \r\nWeaknesses: This course is a major jump from Bio 101, and you're not exactly eased into it. The wording of the quiz questions was tricky, and I was more confused on what the question was asking rather than the concept itself. The PSET questions jumped around the lectures, and I didn't feel like they helped me understand concepts that were taught during the lecture.",
                "-recorded lectures were a little hard to follow and psets were hard enough that I learned less than I struggled with them. It was almost mandatory (but unsaid) to attend peer tutor sessions to complete the psets with a good grade. Psets were toughly graded!",
                "Strengths: great content and interesting journal clubs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: big step-up from 101, basic concepts are not adequately explained or even discussed before covering new topics and (often unnecessarily long) weekly PSETS.",
                "The material was way too dense. The professor literally has hundreds of slides per week and I do not feel like I absorbed any of it. As someone who hasn't taken a biology course since freshman year of high school (not AP), I felt very unprepared for the course. I believe there was an option to do enrichment, but after succeeding in BIOL 101 without enrichment I did not think I needed it for 102.",
                "This course should not be taught only through recorded lectures. This course would of been better with live zoom class format, with recordings for those that cannot attend.",
                "I liked the recorded lectures, but I wished that somehow they were more entertaining.",
                "The discussion of the various experimental procedures (through both the discussion of scientific literature as well as separate lecture material) used to discover the various biological phenomena in this course as integrated into the current version of the curriculum is an obvious strength of this course. This discussion of experimental procedures will likely be very useful for the students taking this course as a majority of the students will likely find themselves in laboratories at some point throughout their careers. Learning about the experimental techniques used and increasing our literacy in reading scientific literature, especially the materials and methods section of scientific papers, will likely be a useful skill for most of us. I believe that another strength of the course was the inclusion of a weekly informal review session with the instructor. Given the nature of the material discussed, it was beneficial to have this informal review session in order to review the week's lecture material and clear up any misconceptions.\r\nNonetheless, there were a lot of points over the semester where I thought that the material was not that easily digestible, mostly due to the overwhelming use of undefined jargon. It would have been beneficial for vocabulary and jargon-y terms to have been discussed a bit more in-depth. In terms of content, I personally thought that a glaring omission from the course was the discussion of cellular signaling pathways. However, while I think that this topic deserves to be covered in this course in some capacity, I'm not sure what I would have detracted from in order to fit this topic into the time constraints of the class.",
                "Strengths: lectures were recorded so they could be rewinded, sections were very helpful as journal clubs, pset q's were mostly clear and straightforward. Weakness: other than lots of vocabulary\/jargon, not much!",
                "Strengths: the weekly review sessions were very helpful for concept clarification and the recorded lectures were in-depth and interesting; Weaknesses: the breakout rooms in discussion sections were sometimes rushed",
                "Material got really advanced pretty fast",
                "This course focuses heavily on lab techniques and procedures, far more so than BIOL 101. Because of this focus, I felt like I didn't develop as strong an understanding of the actual findings and concepts of cell biology. The lectures also felt somewhat haphazard; I would have appreciated a more methodical, streamlined approach. It also often felt as if the lectures were simply read from the slides, and they presumed a greater existing knowledge of certain topics than I had. I found it fairly easy to answer p-set questions based on the lectures, but information that I was no explicitly asked about on p-sets often went over my head. I don't think I've retained much information from this course.",
                "A strength is that since lectures were recorded, they could be viewed at your own pace and whenever you had time. A weakness is that it did not really encourage retention of the information because quizzes were open note.",
                "This course had a lot of interesting material and the recorded lectures were interesting. However, I think if possible, the quizzes and the problem sets should focus on big concepts rather than small details, because I think that would improve retention. The problem sets were also incredibly difficult.",
                "Lectures and section were informative, format was not very engaging.",
                "The PSETs for this course are difficult, but the ability to collaborate on them makes them doable. Also, discussion sections are very helpful for understanding each week's scientific readings.",
                "I was very satisfied with the support system as well as the overall collaborative atmosphere this course offered. The peer-tutoring sessions, the discussion sections, office hours, and outside collaboration all served as spaces to ask about the material as well as help others. My only suggestion would be to change the peer-tutoring hours to one or two days back as the hours this past semester occurred the night before the problem sets were due.",
                "I fee like a lot of the struggle was based around the online format of the class. I think the class definitely was able to keep a timely format but the quizzes felt rushed and felt that they were needlessly worth as much as PSETS when the amount of work to go into them was less than PSETS.",
                "The focus of the lectures weren't clear. For this part of the curse they can improve by being clear about the learning objective like in 101."

                "The weekly review sessions were helpful, but I think they could have focused more on student questions and problem set concepts rather than going over the same slides from lecture.  The peer tutor office hours were very helpful.",
                "The amount of lectures that we were required to watch each week became overwhelming as well as the weekly quizzes that restricted my own pace by pushing new information at the very beginning of the week. This was an issue often due to my schedule with other classes because the many hours of lectures were extremely time-consuming.",
                "In 101, we had limitless attempts to answer lecture quiz questions. I feel like 102 would have benefited from the same, and I am not sure what we gained from only being able to submit quizzes once, besides increased stress and pressure.",
                "Recorded lectures were decent, but I feel that in person lectures would be much better. This course, in general, seems liked it would be much better in person.",
                "Changing the 2nd pset to a collaborative one was a very good move. Additionally, the peer tutors were very helpful. The weekly quizzes were not as easy as advertised. We were told the answers would be right in front of us and that we'd all be able to get 100s on the quizzes, but I know most people did not get 100s on all the quizzes, including myself. Either a) the quizzes should be easier or b) the quizzes should allow you to retry them until you get all the answers correct (and this would facilitate learning as well!)",

I also appreciated that we had synchronous review sessions every week!",

                "I really liked Professor Mooseker's Wednesday live virtual sessions, and the peer tutoring office hours on Sunday's really helped me through the Bio 102 psets. It can be difficult to focus and engage on lectures that are all recorded, but that was also nice because I could always go back to the lectures and refer to them to my convenience.",
                "It is hard to motivate oneself to watch 2-3 hours of recorded lectures each week (though the need to complete the weekly quizzes and problem sets provided incentive). Live lecture, with the opportunity to ask questions, may have been more beneficial",

                "Hopefully there will never be another COVID-19 semester, but I do think that the virtual peer tutoring sessions were very helpful to understanding the course material better. Additionally, being able to improve our grades with quizzes also helped! That said, I think that Mooseker's lectures may have been more interesting with a slightly quicker cadence, but at least he acknowledged that our virtual lectures could be sped-up to help with that.",

                "The every Wednesday review sessions are difficult to attend because they are outside of class time. The information given outside of class is critical for completing psets. It would be most helpful if Wednesday review sessions were part of the allotted lecture times. \r\n\r\nIt was extremely difficult to collaborate with others virtually. Revealing students to other students in the same college would have been helpful in finding people to collaborate with.  \r\n\r\nThe lecture quiz answers are not clear in the lectures. The wording on the quizzes is extremely dense, making the quizzes very painful to take.",
                "All of the lectures were prerecorded, which was really appreciated. Slow wifi or computer issues didn't come in the way of gaining the material, so that was an absolutely brilliant strategy. I really can't think of any way to improve things COVID-wise, maybe just figuring out closed captioning would be really helpful.",
                "The whole remote section for biology, a challenging subject, was not ideal",
                "The recorded lectures were not engaging and had to be put at twice speed most of the time. I think that improvement of this course would benefit from the use of online lecture tools like 3D models of specific cell structures.",

                "The Ed Discussion forum was incredibly useful for clearing up misconceptions about both the lectures as well as the problem sets. As such, it would be incredibly beneficial to continue having an Ed Discussion forum even after the class returns to in-person instruction.",
                "It was helpful for there to be weekly review sessions held by Professor Mooseker in making somewhat of a classroom presence in this crazy year. Sections also utilized breakout rooms and I felt quite supported with the resources provided, such as peer tutor office hours.",
                "The recorded lectures and weekly review sessions were very effective.",
                "Discussion sections were good.",
                "The practices were successful, particularly the fact that lectures were prerecorded.",
                "Weekly quizzes helped synthesize material from lectures.",
                "I would say that the recorded lectures were very successful during the pandemic. I know that along with many other students who took this course, I was able to follow along with the lectures at my own pace, and the weekly quizzes helped reinforce my understanding of the material. I also felt that the breakout rooms were very successful in encouraging collaboration and engagement, specifically in the discussion sections.",
                "PSETS worked but the quizzes and the lectures were sometimes harder to do."

                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who would like to take more advanced biology courses. It well set a great foundation for your future learning!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I think this class was super informative and helpful for future biology classes. We learned to critically analyze biological functions and experimental procedures and also discuss in-depth important papers related to cell biology.",
                "Haha, no. Unfortunately you have to take it if youre a bio major or pre-med.",
                "YES!!! Take this class if you have some sort of interest in bio! The material in this class is super interest, and the workload is very manageable. At the same time, this class challenges you to think about real-world situations. You read and discuss ton of cool scientific papers, and you actually feel like you're thinking like a scientist. Great class!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The lectures, discussion sections, and accompanying assignments increased my understanding of cell biology. These aspects of the class, in addition to helping me understand the content, helped me gain a higher sense of critical thinking. The workload for this course was average, while the intellectual challenge was greater than the average Yale College course.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who need it to take higher level biology courses and meet major\/grad school requirements. I would also recommend it to students interested in working in a research lab. I would not recommend it to students looking to learn the foundations of biology out of pure interest, though. Although this class was presented as an introductory level class, it is at a much higher level than one would expect. I have several years of experience learning biology in the classroom and doing biology research, and I still found the course material very dense and hard to absorb at times.",
                "If you are considering a biology major or pre-med, you don't have a choice, but look forward to this course, it is fun! I do not know if placement tests will be allowed in teh future, but I would still recommend this course. It is very different from 101 with a focus on reasoning over fact. This is very powerful and I think serves as a good introduction to how you have to think to succeed in more complex biology courses because it introduces you to the handling of dozens of factors when considering problems in system. The introduction is well paced and helps you feel comfortable tackling biologic problems. For that reason, any interested in a biology major should take this course. If you are interested in biology as a general interest instead of a major, this course might be for you if you want to understand what it is like to study biology, but there is less of a focus on just general facts.",
                "Yes, if it's required, probably not if not. There were some things that were super interesting but much of the course was too tedious to take for fun.",
                "Yes, especially because it is on the bio sequence, and it is needed for many other STEM courses here.",
                "If you're already curious about the material, go for it. I feel like I got an appreciation for the way biology research works and for how damn intricate cells are, and the psets only took 2 hours a week. It's not an especially captivating class you should go out of your way to take, but it's a fine introduction to cell biology without too much work.",
                "Yes. It is a portion of the introductory biology sequence, however, I do think all biosciences students would be deeply interested in the topics presented.",
                "Because it is a big class, I would not recommend it for somebody who does not need to take it as a prerequisite for other classes. It is a lot of lecture watching and not a lot of engaging interactions. But the format and overall class was good for fulfilling requirements.",
                "If you're taking this course, it's probably because it's a pre-req.  I wouldn't recommend to anyone else but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  It's accessible even for people who haven't taken AP Bio.",
                "Anyone taking this is likely taking this as a requirement, in which case you should. Otherwise, it has a substantial workload and often covers a lot of material which seems very ground-level instead of thinking about the bigger picture. BIOL 101 seemed to promote more relevant, big-picture topics; this got so specific into the proteins and formations that I feel my understanding of the grand scheme of cellular biology is not as great as it could have been.",
                "I would only recommend this course for students that have majors that require it. This course was quite challenging and not very inter-related to other possible job opportunities outside of the medical field.",
                "For sure. It's a requirement for a lot of STEM majors, but it's not bad at all.",
                "If you have to, it's not the worst.",
                "I would recommend this course to my friends who are deciding if Bio is what they want to go into for the future. Otherwise, the material learned in this class is not nearly broad enough to be of much use in other fields. I would definitely recommend Bio 101 to people because of its broadness.",
                "NO! but I'm assuming that you're taking this course as some sort of requirement, so there's not much you can do about it.",
                "If you have to take it as a prerequisite, then yes. Otherwise, no. The topics are very in-depth and there is a lot of material that is covered. If you fall behind, you will have trouble with your PSETs. However, the TAs and professor Mooseker have many office hours that help with your PSET questions.",
                "It was fine. I didn't know anything about cell biology, and I feel like I still don't.",
                "Only if you have to take it",
                "If it is required, take it. I would not take it just to learn the basics of cell bio. To be honest, I am not leaving the course with any strong foundations in cell bio.",
                "As a biology introductory course, this is a requirement for many STEM\/Premed students. However, this course was worse than BIOL 101 in a number of ways. After watching all the lectures and doing all the assignments, I have barely taken away any useful knowledge from this course compared to what I learned in BIOL 101.",
                "No, unless it is required.",
                "If you need it, take it. The course isnt insufferable and I enjoyed learning the biology concepts.",
                "Yes! If this is a requirement, this should be a fairly manageable course. While it's more work than BIOL101, it is complete doable! If you're considering taking this, and it's not a requirement, I would only take it if you really enjoy cellular biology since it does require a fair amount of work.",
                "Yes, the content was interesting and I enjoyed the course a lot. The problem sets were stimulating and the professor made sure we had access to all the help we needed.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to any biology major, pre-med, or anyone interested in biology. It really gives you an appreciation for the field and how your body works behind the scenes. Even if it is not required for a major, it is still just an interesting class in general.",
                "Yes! Even if you're just interested in biology, this course gives you tools to understand cell processes.",
                "If you are any of the three bio majors, this course is a requirement and it is certainly not something you should dread. I believe that this course would have been much more engaging in person. The analysis skills you learn from this course will carry you far in your own research and future bio pursuits, whether it be applying research methods or reading primary literature. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants not only a solid background in bio but also how to think like a biologist.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I think this course is necessary for higher level BIO classes and is also good for introductory scientific thinking.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student who has to take it. It is much harder than BIOL 101.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student becuase the foundational biology concepts presents are very valuable and the material in presented in a way that is easy for the student to understand.",
                "Yes! I found this class to be really interesting.",
                "Yes, this is a great course that introduces students to experimental methods in cell biology.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if you are interested in biology or premed, as I am, you kind of have to take it. If not I would maybe say find a more specific course that focuses on an area of science you are particularly interest in.",
                "Yes! You probably have to take this course if you're a bio major or premed. It's not as bad as you think it will be, but just be sure to come to office hours and email peer tutors if you feel that you're beginning to struggle! Sometimes, the hardest part is simply reaching out and being brave!",
                "Pretty dry - would only recommend if it's a requirement or prereq for what you're studying. A more advanced\/specialized biology course would probably be more interesting",
                "Yes. It really helps build confidence in your scientific paper reading skills.",
                "The teachers were so engaged, kind and helpful! They loved teaching!",
                "I would recommend this class to any interested pre-med student (particularly if you're interested in exploring MCDB as a major).",
                "You probably have to take it as a prereq requirement or for premed. This class is just not a great introductory course but rather an elective for specific cell bio topics.",
                "I would take it if you need it for the major. The content itself is very interesting, the TAs are fantastic, but the lectures were very difficult to follow.",
                "I would recommend this class if a science credit is needed. I do think this class is one of those where the work is reasonable but it's also challenging enough that you aren't just doing busy work.",
                "Yes, this class was well engineered for learning",
                "Yes, I feel like this is a good foundational biology course",
                "Not if you do not have to take the course.",
                "It's a prerequisite if you're pursuing a biology major",
                "This course is an ABRUPT change from BIOL 101. BIOL 101 was far easier and honestly, more interesting. Do not expect to come into this course putting in the same amount of time that you did for BIOL 101  double it, in fact. I would recommend this course to someone only if they are a premed student or considering a major in one of the biology tracks. If you don't have to take it, I think there are far better courses that may quench your thirst for some stem knowledge. If you do wind up taking it however, I cannot emphasize how beyond important it is that you collaborate (when allowed) and go to the peer tutoring sessions  shoutout to Joe and Irene for saving me this semester. Without those, this course will be incredibly difficult. That said, despite the difficulties, it is not impossible to receive a good grade in this class. You really have to be your own engine in pushing for a good grade, and you must do everything in your power to do so. Overall, beware of the change when going from BIOL 101 --> BIOL 102. It's not impossible, but it may take some changes to your work ethic\/practices! You got this!",
                "I would not recommend this class, it was pretty discouraging for me because I never really felt like I knew what was going on in the class and there were not many resources for me to better my understanding.",
                "I would if you are pre med and have to take this as a pre requisite.",
                "Yes, this course is nice in that there is exposure to new biological concepts outside of AP Biology.",
                "I... wouldn't as of right now, only because, like I said, this course was really meant for students who learn best through auditory things... I am very bad at processing auditory things, so I really struggled. Make the course more versatile, then we'll talk.",
                "Yes!",
                "I wouldn't take this course unless it's a requirement or you know that you love biology.",
                "YES if you are interested in bio or are considering a career in it.",
                "If you are taking this course it's likely that you have to take it. However, I still would recommend it because I personally found the content to be fascinating. That said, if you can, don't take it with Mark Mooseker. He seems very knowledgeable and passionate about the material, but he is not a strong lecturer. The vocabulary that he used throughout the course was way too advanced for an introductory biology course, making it difficult to absorb the material and increasing the amount of time that I spent watching the lectures (I had to rewatch a lot). On top of this, there is a lot of assumed knowledge that is expected from you in this course that made it harder to grasp more complex concepts. It is definitely a step-up from 101 in the sense that there are some things that I felt like should have been taught in-between. However, take this with a grain of salt because I did not take AP Biology, so a lot of this assumed knowledge was actually common knowledge for a lot of students.",
                "Definitely would not recommend if you don't need it for you major. My biggest advice is to go to peer tutor hours!! You can basically get an A in this course without ever paying attention in class or taking notes as long as you go to office hours. The office hours are great because they are PSET-focused and the peer tutors are very helpful in pointing you in the right direction.",
                "Only if you need for your major.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in biology. It is a great introduction to cell biology.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about specific biological processes within animal cells as well as anyone who wants to develop a greater appreciation for the experimental techniques utilized in discovering different aspects of cell biology. I would not recommend this course to anyone who is looking for a survey course on cell biology because this course concentrated heavily on a select number of topics regarding cell biology, and I would not recommend this course to anyone who is looking to learn more about plant cell biology as this course did not cover this topic at all.",
                "Sure, as a prerequisite for many bio\/related majors, I would recommend this course. It is also nice to get a taste of cell bio even for people who are not in the major.",
                "Yes, you learn a lot and the concepts are much more in depth than previous biology classes I've taken.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in gaining a foundation in biology.",
                "Yes",
                "If you're taking this course, it's probably to fulfill a requirement; this is not a course I would recommend taking \"for fun.\" If you must take it, though, you should be able to do fairly well; many p-set questions are taken straight from the lectures, and the peer tutor sessions are extremely helpful. Definitely take advantage of them if you're struggling with a p-set.",
                "I would recommend this course because it was well taught and an interesting subject, even if you are not a STEM major.",
                "Yes, mandatory for further biology learning",
                "Yes, especially in the virtual format because there was no final exam and the structure of the course was very collaborative.",
                "Yes! At first pass, the material at times was difficult to work through, but the amount of support you receive from the professors, teaching fellows, and each other is undeniably present, and it is amazing how much you learn by the end of the semester!",
                "I would recommend this course, however there were a lot of problems with technology that I think would be minimized in an in-person format"
