                "I learned a lot of hands-on microscopy skills, including how to build a simple epi microscope, how to Kohler illuminate for light microscopy, and how to perform fluorescent, bright field, dark field, phase-contrast, and DIC microscopy. I also learned more about the physics behind these techniques as well as how two photon, SIM, confocal, TIRF, PALM/ STORM, STED, FRET, and FLIM work. Prior to taking this class, I had performed some bright field, confocal, and TIRF, but it was fascinating to learn how these techniques actually work and expand my repertoire to include other skills.",
                "I learned a LOT about light microscopy from this course, and it was AWESOME. I think the nice thing was that I got a bit of theory about how microscopes work, and I also got to work with microscopes firsthand and see everything.",
                "This was the best course I have taken at Yale. I learned all about the practical light microscopy techniques and the theory behind them. I have already used some of this knowledge in conversation regarding biological research in the lab and in my other courses.",
                "I learned a lot about the numerous different Microscopy techniques that are used on my field of interest.",
                "I learned the basics of light microscopy and important techniques that I will use moving forward in the field of biology. I also learned how to effectively use a microscope to get the best results."

            "comments": [
                "I loved the rotation of different professors and how we alternated between in-classroom and in-lab components of the class. It was fascinating to learn the theory and then immediately apply it in a more practical way. Having heavier physics theory at the beginning of the course was helpful to understanding additional concepts as they emerged. One downfall of having multiple professors was that there was a lack of clarity surrounding what material would be on exams. It would be helpful if the professors could decide on exam topics at least a week out from the test to allow more study time.",
                "There are many strengths to this course:\r\n1) The material is reviewed pretty frequently, so you end up with a really solid understanding. It's also a lot of material, so you get a good breadth and a good depth of knowledge.\r\n2) You get a lot of practical knowledge and experience using microscopes, and also learn a lot about how different microscopes operate around campus - super useful if you're doing research.\r\n3) Job Talks are a really great way to get to know how basic concepts in light microscopy apply in current research. Plus, the later modules you learn a lot about how microscopy techniques are used in research too.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n1) Would definitely like to have done another job talk.\r\n2) There is sooooo much more that can be done with optics. Especially considering that the physics labs have so much optical equipment and labs that are dedicated to polarization and interferometry, maybe with some collaboration, it could be entirely possible to make more advanced microscopy setups on the breadboards. Working with the Fourier optics kit and the epifluorescence microscope was fun, and it would be cool if we could build more microscopes. \r\n3) Building on (2), this is technically an MCDB course, but it could do with a bit more physics, because I think the intuition behind the optical elements of the course was a bit hard to grasp.",
                "Course was well taught and all of the instructors were accessible and enthusiastic about the material. The course presented material multiple times ignorer for students to fully understand and remember it. No weaknesses.",
                "It's challenging but very fun",
                "The small class size allowed for me to become more engaged with the material and have more time to become familiar with the microscopes that we were using."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Professor Wolenski put in a lot of effort to making this course interesting and memorable, and it paid off. I would not recommend that you take this course if you don't plan to actually use microscopy in your research at some point; it would still be an interesting course, but you likely wouldn't get as much out of it. If you have previous microscopy experience and/ or plan to use it in the future, 10000% take this class. It is an excellent crash course in all things light microscopy from basic bright field to superresolution techniques.",
                "1000% YES HANDS DOWN THIS IS THE AWESOMEST COURSE I'VE TAKEN AT YALE. I would even recommend it be taught in the spring too!",
                "Absolutely!!!! This is the best course I have taken here.",
                "Definitely, Professor Wolenski is such an inspiring mentor and goes above and beyond for his students to have a fun but still enriching experience in the classroom. It was a pleasure getting to learn from him and I can only hope future classes here at Yale are as interesting.",
                "If this student is at all interested in future lab work or microscopy in general, I would recommend this course."
