                "Being in an ensemble playing gamelan music was one of the highlights of my Yale experience and taught me way more about music than I could have learned from a textbook. I grew a lot as a musician and a listener-- especially in my ability to rapidly toggle between reading the music in front of me, playing it expressively, and listening to my fellow players and Darsono. Through the assignments and class discussions, I learned a surprising amount about how gamelan has developed, especially in the face of colonialism and Indonesian culture, and still want to learn more. I felt like our class became a really beautiful community by the end, and I had a lot of fun.",
                "Great introduction to the music, history, and culture of central java",
                "I learned how to play numerous instruments in the gamelan percussion ensemble. I learned about the instruments themselves and the two scales in which we play.",
                "I learned the basics of playing a few different Indonesian percussion instruments and worked on playing in a musical ensemble. I also learned a new form of musical notation, and I gained a greater appreciation for the music of Central Java.",
                "A deep familiarity with central Javanese music and instrumentation with a bit of culture",
                "This course was amazing and provided me with a very personal and practical introduction to gamelan. I had the opportunity to play several of the available instruments, and I also learned small things about the culture through the pieces we performed and conversations with Professor. Part of the course included reading about Java and the history of gamelan, watching performances, and discussing these readings as a class. This was a highlight, and it left me passionate, and with more questions!",
                "I learned how to play several instruments, how to be comfortable performing in a group, and learned about Indonesian culture.",
                "How to play the kethuk\/kempyang, gang saron, and gender. Or rather, exposure to these three instruments, which is pretty awesome."

            "comments": [
                "I might be biased as an experienced musician, but my only complaint is that I wished we could have learned even more pieces (perhaps by moving on from the first two pieces a little bit earlier)! Otherwise, Darsono was simply incredible at hearing the details in our playing and making sure that everyone knew what their individual part was supposed to be like at any given time. The pieces we learned were gorgeous, and even though we didn't get to have a normal concert, the recording session was very rewarding.",
                "Strengths: very fun, accessible to all students\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The class was mostly rehearsal and practice, I would have liked to learn a bit more about Indonesian\/Javanese cultures and music, though we did have a great lecture about this halfway through the class! \r\nThe class was incredibly fun, which you can't say about every class at Yale. I loved making music every Friday, I absolutely adore gamelan music and the best part of the class was doing that every week and improving over the semester!",
                "Very unstructured. Not much was explained.",
                "This class is a lot of fun - it's a unique chance to play gamelan music and learn from a master of the art. While in class, I was focused on the music and the ensemble vibes, so I could forget about the rest of the world for a bit. Great experience. This class could have dedicated more time to understanding the traditional cultural context of gamelan music and how that relates to us playing the music. We only spent one class talking about Java, and we didn't really learn anything about the specific songs we played or where they came from (who wrote them, how they are usually performed, etc). I think the class could also benefit from some individual time one-on-one with the professor, or at least with someone in the department who knows how to play gamelan - I had one such session with Mas Dar and it was hugely helpful, but that wasn't part of the course and it wasn't until our last day of class. However, the chill nature of the class is greatly appreciated.",
                "Strengths : No tedious work, professor is very nice and helpful, fantastic time learning the music\/instruments, great time making friends in the small environment \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The only weakness is that sometimes people were absent for a seminar session and it threw off the ensemble a little bit. If you're thinking of taking this course, commit!",
                "This was a fantastic class. Not only was playing the instruments incredibly fun, but it was great to learn some of the cultural background around gamelan in the lecture. If there was one thing I would change, it would be learning more about the music theory of gamelan.",
                "My one gripe about this course is how there was not much of a forum for interaction between my fellow classmates within the class, or that it took a while to learn any context behind the gamelan ensemble. Other than that, though, quite possibly my favorite class I've taken so far at Yale."

                "Take if you want an easy class. But if you actually want to learn about the music or culture, you might be disappointed.",
                "I had a great time in gamelan ensemble, and chances are that you would too. If you want a low-workload, hands-on, fun class, especially if you're a musician of any kind, join gamelan ensemble. This class is not a gut in that it does demand a lot of attention and participation, at least while you're in class. This class is a gut in that there is essentially no work outside of class time. Mas Dar (Professor Darsono) is a legend and is honestly better than we deserve. Maho is also incredible. Note: We didn't really talk about the music, or its cultural context, for most of the semester. We basically jammed full-time.",
                "Absolutely, please take this if you like music. As a musician and for the others with much less experience, it was no less superb. This is one of the most \"Yale courses\" you will find and it is super worthwhile to diversify your Yale experience. Super niche and cool",
                "Absolutely! This is a great introduction to musical performance as a collective and is unique in the music department for its focus on non-Western musical traditions. Anyone who is interested and willing to practice will excel and will have fun!",
                "Yes! I had no music background, and I took it for fun. It was great playing gamelan every Friday and very relaxing. I think it made me more comfortable trying new things.",
                "If you love music, absolutely! Playing the instruments is incredibly fun, especially the gong. When the whole ensemble is playing together, there is a feeling that's difficult to describe, but listening to gamelan on YouTube doesn't capture it. The one reason you might not like this class is if you are uncomfortable with not knowing what's going on. Gamelan is very different from western music in terms of rhythm, structure, timbre, and harmony, and we pretty much went straight into playing the music. It often felt like being immersed in a different language.",
                "Wholeheartedly. A unique, deeply fun opportunity to expand your horizons and engage with ethnomusicology not just as a researcher but a participant."
