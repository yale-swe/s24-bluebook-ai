                "I think it's great that it's every day because it creates a steady workflow. I think the structure of the lessons needs to be changed, though. It feels way too much like grinding through a bunch of tasks each day, whereas opportunities for informal conversation might be much more valuable. For instance, extended discussions in small groups (maybe for the entire class) would help us practice what we are learning in a conversational setting.",
                "Strengths: Sra. Alexandrov is an accessible, caring instructor, who will do her best to make the class enjoyable and worth your while. I wholeheartedly recommend her as an instructor. The course is difficult, but you will end up improving your Spanish.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Just about everything else. The way Spanish is structured at Yale, the Professor doesn't teach any content (grammar, vocabulary, anything) in class -- students are responsible for learning everything on their own through the online textbook. The Professor is just there to chaperone daily practice with the students -- which can be fun, but is more often tedious and frustrating. There's daily homework as well -- it's also graded through the online textbook. \r\n\r\nOne might think that given the amount of work the Spanish program expects students to put into the course, grading would be somewhat sympathetic. Think again. Grading is remarkably harsh; you'll lose full points on tests and homework for missing accents and misplaced pronouns, even if you get the verb and the form right. There's absolutely no curve -- despite the fact that students have to spend at least half an hour a day on homework, half an hour on lessons, and additional time on practice, you'll need a 94 for an A.",
                "I believe this course needs to force students to use their Spanish a bit more. I would suggest more speaking in class and potentially trips to different places locally to enable this use in real practice."

                "If you have the time and the discipline to commit an hour and a half each day to Spanish homework and practice --- or, if you're ok not getting an A --- then yes, go for it. The pace is fast, the grading is harsh, and no matter how understanding your professor is, they'll stick to the syllabus. You will improve your Spanish if you put in the work --- but you might work really hard and still not get an A. \r\n\r\nThe real reason to take the class is the fact that Spanish is one of the most useful and enjoyable languages to know. It's an ok reason to give up a lot of time and a bit of your gpa. \r\n\r\nI certainly recommend taking Sra. Alexandrov's section if it is available.",
