                "Strengths: instructor was amazing and made classes very engaging.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish we could have done a bit more grammar to clarify some small but important distinctions.",

                "- Giseli asks for a lot of homework to be done\r\n- very understanding teacher\r\n- I wish we would have started with more team-building exercises before diving into more individualistic ones rather than the other way around.\r\n- There should be a class-facilitated vocabulary list (online somewhere) where students write down important ones used in class\r\n- very good feedback on each piece of homework (incredible, the amount of work Giseli put in here!)\r\n- I think we should read a more advanced book together",
                "This course interacts with Portuguese language and Brazilian culture beyond what grammar textbooks can teach. It pushes students to evaluate their own places in cities and heritage and apply the language to express their thoughts in new forms.",
                "The course material is very engaging and interesting, covering a wide range of art forms such as short stories, animated short films and music. Professor Tordin is a very patient and understanding professor with a passion for teaching us about the Brazilian culture.",
                "Strengths: fast-paced class, lots of interpersonal activities, thorough feedback on assignments, caring professor, interesting assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: occasional high workload on asynchronous days, writing assignments outside of asynchronous days could take considerable time, group assignments could sometimes lead to some students taking on more work than others."

Many college students do not understand that they will acquire many skills on the go and lose them if they don't use them, but languages will never come by themselves and will play a role in your life forever once you have them.\r\n\r\nAlso, why Portuguese? It's more than Brazil and Portugal. There is Angola, Mosambique, Cape Verde, East Timur, Guinea-Bissau, Macau, Sao Tome and Principe!  Some pretty cool places there!",

                "I would highly recommend this course to any student that is interested in learning more deeply about Brazilian media and art forms such as marionette puppet shows and contemporary themes such as childhood.",
                "I would certainly recommend the course to people genuinely seeking to learn Portuguese. If someone is considering it just for a language credit (because they have experience with Spanish), I would warn that there is a lot of in-person speaking that demands your attention."
