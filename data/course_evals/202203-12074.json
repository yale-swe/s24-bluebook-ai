                "Great instructor who explained things clearly.  The mandatory one hour lab section complemented our learning well, and it was nice to see and hold the specimens.  The instructor assigned us less homework than normal partly because of this lab section, which I appreciated.  The homework was tough at points, but the quantity wasn't overwhelming by any means.  The class content was interesting and the class itself was very small, which created a nice atmosphere.  The only weakness is that the midterm and final were very hard, despite my long hours or studying.  However, there is a curve."

                "Yes! I really enjoyed this class, and you would too if you really enjoyed taking Mineralogy (EPS 220). It's not too advanced, and it gives you a solid understanding of igneous and metamorphic petrology. If you think rocks are cool, you'll really like this course.",
                "I would highly recommend it, although you're probably not looking at this course unless you're an EPS major.  If you are an EPS major, it will give you a rock solid foundation (pun intended) for future solid earth courses.  Although I am not on the solid earth track, I felt like all the information was valuable for my general knowledge.  If you're not an EPS major, you could definitely still take the course, but be warned that it is highly specific.  If you don't already have an interest in the topic, you'll probably get bored.  I actually don't think the Mineralogy prerequisite is necessary if you're prepared to do some extra studying and memorization outside of class assignments."
