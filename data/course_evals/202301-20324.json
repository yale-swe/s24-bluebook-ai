            "comments": [
                "This course is very rigorous, and the problem sets definitely ensure that students are paying attention, but sometimes I feel as though they expect a little more knowledge than we are necessarily given. Certain problem sets this year definitely required students to go to office hours simply because they didn't understand the nature of the questions. The same could be said about the pre-class quizzes. While they don't count for much of the grade in the course overall, they do not seem to be very consistent in difficulty, ranging from not needing to watch the videos or reading the book to something akin to a multiple-choice problem set question on material learned supposedly minutes before beginning the quiz. This can be a very frustrating way to go into class, spending up to an hour watching videos only to get a 20-50% with little feedback before the second attempt. I think these should be structured so that students can get a decent grade just by watching the videos. It's a lot to expect out of students who haven't even covered this material in a classroom setting where they can ask questions. In a similar vein, the jump from problem sets to midterm exams is rather extreme in certain instances.",
                "Strengths are they really teach the material well. The group work helps with this. I think this course should make the PSETS worth more. They take many hours a week and teach a lot, and its frustrating often to put in so much effort when you get little reward",
                "I appreciated the pre-class videos as a way to revisit\/relearn content thought in class, but feel like them being mandatory plus the mandatory pre-class videos was a heavy workload because the videos were also often very long. \r\n\r\nStrengths were the amount of extra resources: Xiemra videos + questions, office hours, peer tutoring, private tutoring. I liked that it was taught in smaller sections. Problem sets were very hard, but I liked that they helped you tease out kinks in your knowledge, which I thought was helpful. However, I spent a significant amount of time on psets (maybe around 6-8 hrs per week) and I feel like they should have been worth significantly more than 10% of your grade; that's also where a lot of really trying to learn the content took place. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: exams were significantly harder than the practice exams and Ximera quizes, so it was hard to gauge where you were at, which wasn't always too helpful in studying.",
                "I like the fact that there is no lecture. Instead the course is split up into smaller 20 person classes. Professor Argue is amazing and he was definitely the highlight of the course. He always comes to class with so much energy and excitement: it's hard not to enjoy the math! The peer tutors also did a very good job and I felt like there were adequate resources to learn the material. I also liked the pre-class quiz model where we are exposed to the material before class. The only weakness I can think of is that the feedback on problem sets could be a little more clear.",
                "Well taught, plenty of resources, well organized and thorough material",
                "Strengths: well-organized, clear instructions and guidelines for assignments; Weaknesses: pre-class quizzes felt redundant, psets were very long and in-depth while not counting for much or being very analogous to exams.",
                "Spending more time on examples of problems.",
                "I think this course moved very quickly and it could be improved if every class was given worksheets\/ notes.",
                "Strengths are the order in which the things in class are taught. All were given time to breathe",
                "This course is good at providing support to students in need. It is fast paced, though manageable. I believe it could be improved with the provision of more optional practice problems with answers throughout the semester or with quicker feedback on the problem sets.",
                "I don't like the pre-class video format. I felt that the videos were meant to teach us everything and then the lectures help clarify rather than the reverse.",
                "Pace could be bettered , lesson plans and ressources as well.",
                "The strengths of this course are the wide resources like Ximera they provide to allow students to get more practice outside of class.",
                "Strengths: review sessions, the organization of the material, the way it is taught (as in the home video homeworks, then psets, then class time, then midterms)"

ENAS 151 if you're doing engineering, Math 118 for social science, etc).  This class is probably better tho if you're looking to fulfill a requirement for something like econ, though.",
