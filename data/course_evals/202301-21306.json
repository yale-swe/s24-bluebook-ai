                "This course was not what I expected at first. I thought that the class would be primarily about a close analysis of literature, but our conversations ended up being quite literary theory based and we frequently talked about the politics and reception of the novel we were looking at, not just doing close reading. At first, I did not particularly like this, however, throughout the duration of the course I came to appreciate the importance of doing this sort of analysis. Having taken this course, I believe I have learnt how to read rapidly (we went through one novel/play per week) and also how to write engaging discussion posts which actually help guide discussion during class. Furthermore, I have had an incredible introduction to post-colonial literature which I was not expecting, but which I think has open my eyes up to a whole new way of thinking about literature. I also took this class alongside a course on the history of South Africa, and the pairing was incredibly intellectually productive!",
                "I learnt to better read and apply postcolonial theory. I also practiced discussing postcolonial literature sensibly and cooperatively.",
                "I learned how to read post-colonial works through academic frameworks and also how to incorporate these frameworks into my own writing.",
                "This course teaches you, first and foremost, how to evaluate the political role of English language as both a symptom and tool of global imperialism. The texts you read in the class are interesting in and of themselves, but they all tie into a unified colonial history.",
                "More than anything else, this course gave me new ways of reading (for agency, for local knowledge, for ideology, for women, etc), and invaluable insights on topics of relevance for postcolonial studies, such as orality, anglophonism, native languages, mental colonization, gender, and health. Essays and reading responses were interesting, well structured, and valuable, but most of my learning took place in our seminars, which were incredibly productive and thought provoking.",
                "Ways to best use my resources and feedback to improve my writing",
                "Studying world English literatures through a postcolonial lens, this class taught me to constantly trouble and question the power dynamics inherent in the things we read. We broke down what it means for there to be a canon, what complexities authors have towards the English language, and how English as a force and tool shapes world literature written in it. \r\n\r\nI learned so much about the historical and social underpinnings of the literature we read. This class transformed the way that I think critically about literaturecompletely unbarring forms of analysis.",

                "Strengths: fantastic seminars!!! The books were interesting in themselves but our discussions really took them to new levels. The structure for readings responses worked very well and I enjoyed both writing my own reflections and reading those of my class mates. I spent quite a lot of time on this course, but it never quite felt like work. Steph played a huge role in this, because of all the energy, curiosity, and attention to ideas that she brought into our seminars. She's amazing! Also, our guest seminar with Denise DeCaires was BRILLIANT; that woman is a genius. Lastly, the postcolonial theory we read was very valuable - I wish we would have read it even earlier during the semester. Weaknesses: none!",
                "This course was a wonderful introduction to the idea of the Anglophone tradition outside of England and the US. Professor Newell did a great job introducing new ways of engaging with our texts through supplementary theoretical texts and shorter works like fiction and essays.",

Discussions were constantly rich and always wonderful. \r\n\r\nHighlights included seminar with Abdulrazak Gurnah and brilliant guest appearance by Denise DeCaires Narain.",

Particularly Afterlives  it was so good and the author visited which was ABSOLUTELY SO COOL AND A HIGHLIGHT OF MY YEAR. Also, Denise co-taught a class with Steph and it was THE BEST. Shes wicked smart, perceptive, funny, awesome  an expert on Kincaid  and I would love her to become a guest professor here. Please please recruit her to come to Yale because she fills a gap in course offerings."
