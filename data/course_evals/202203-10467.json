If you've spent extensive time in the department, it's likely that you've been exposed (at a surface level) to some content, though expect to leave with additional conversational depth.",

Professor Armstrong is a very kind person, but the coursework was challenging and I never felt 100% confident in my abilities.  That said, I think this course made me a much stronger writer and also taught me to think about art from different views and effectively argue points.",
                "Overall good, discussion-based course. Professor Armstrong led engaging discussions and asked challenging questions that pushed us to engage further with the course materials and readings.",
                "I think the course could have more resources for students and more guidance for how to read through sources.",
                "There was a lot of reading- discussion was sometimes helpful but didnt tend to clarify topics as much as one would hope",
                "Weakness: I think the class could facilitate much better discussions and learning if the reading selections were chosen differently. As it stands, readings work like this: \r\n\r\nEx: week on feminist art history \r\nReadings: different feminist art historians and their opinions on how/why to do it, etc. \r\nDiscussions: what does author 1 say? What does author 2 say? What do you think? \r\n\r\nThe class would be much better if it were instead like this: \r\nEx: week on feminist history \r\nReadings: ONE authors approach at feminist art history, supplemented with essays by other art historians applying author Xs specific method. \r\nDiscussions: whose argument was most compelling? Why? How did they do it? \r\n\r\nIn the second case, the class would be able to discuss their opinions on the application of theory, rather than the theory itself, which unfortunately led to quite stale discussions. Of course, it comes with the caveat of exposing us to less perspectives, but I think its preferable because wed understand one perspective far more tangibly.",
                "There is a lot of reading (too much), but Professor Armstrong was helpful and told us which readings to prioritize.",
                "This course benefits from its small size, and I'd encourage that the department host two concurrent Critical Approaches seminars to facilitate additional conversation. I appreciated also the extensive feedback received though would have preferred it be delivered via email or canvas. In appreciation for the tremendous effort invested in curating a syllabus, I wonder if students would appreciate deciding amongst themselves which \"model\" to consider for a given week later in the semester (perhaps from among 2-3 options).",
                "I didn't always understand why we were doing a particular reading as opposed to others. It was also sometimes frustrating in that it didn't feel like we came to any conclusions or made any significant headway, though this might be unavoidable given the topic and scope.\r\n\r\nI liked the format of the position papers and Professor Armstrong gave clear and thorough feedback that pushed my thinking. I also appreciated that she ranked the readings in order of importance so that we knew what to prioritize."
