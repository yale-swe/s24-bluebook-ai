            "comments": [
                "No weaknesses! The strengths are the professor (Woodward has so many great anecdotes and insights to share from his decades-long career), the two assignments (the profile in particular was really fun to write), the curriculum (we covered a lot of different, interesting topics), and the readings (you get to read a lot of high-quality pieces of journalism).",
                "Strengths: It was tremendous to learn from Professor Woodward, Simone Seiver (TA), Akhil Amar, and others in this class. The students in the course are fantastic, and each contributed to discussions in their own way. It was a privilege to be in this class. \r\n\r\nThe course assignments, particularly the final paper, push you into the world to talk to new people and to dig deeper into stories. Beyond writing the paper itself, reporting on your own story is a liberating and meaningful experience that I will cherish for years to come.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: During the semester, there were two key events that colored the rest of the semester. The first was a conversation about race that was poorly run that quickly turned away from race. This was an unsatisfying conversation, and I wish that we had had a guest speaker instead. The second was during the #MeToo reporting class, which will probably be detailed in other responses. The bottom line is that there should be more guest speakers for these weeks.",
                "I wish this class had taught more about the mechanics of reporting, especially since there is no journalism major here and no other opportunity to take a journalism mechanics class. While many in the class had experience reporting, it would have been helpful for those who do not to have a quick session at the beginning of the semester about what a nut graf is, how to embed quotes, how to paraphrase, how to write a lede, etc. While we learned about examples of journalism ethics from Woodward's real life experience (which was also very useful!) just assuming that everyone knows how to report right away makes the experience a bit alienating for those who don't. However, I was able to meet many people in the journalism field at Yale who I wouldn't have gotten to know otherwise, which was cool. I don't think the class needs a TA since it is a ~14 person seminar and the TA Simone didn't add anything to the course. The auditors in the class were also distracting because they spoke for much of the class and didn't allow for as many students to share their thoughts. There were also moments throughout the semester where it seemed as though Prof. Woodward was not as well equipped to teach (the classes about race and sexual assault) and the class would have benefited from guest lecturers.",
                "Seminars depend on student discussion. There was no class period that the professor and his colleagues did not heavily mediate.",
                "Discussion felt forced at times and Professor Woodward's cold-calling on certain students was not appreciated in matters of sexual assault or race. The tones of the professor and TA felt belittling/condescending and questions that were meant to be thought-provoking came off as attacking. Aside from a sentence about a paper, there was no clear instructions on how to improve.",
                "I really liked this course, perhaps more interim check-ins as assignments are going on",

We never needed to share our screens. To submit our assignments we just emailed the professor and the teaching assignment.

He has so many interesting anecdotes and insights to share from his decades-long career. Youll learn a lot from the readings he chose. The assignments are incredibly gratifying, too.",
                "Yes. This class is a tremendous experience, even on Zoom, and taught me so much about journalism, politics, and the world. This semester with Prof. Woodward was rough around the edges, but journalism and truth-telling is so important to do and learn, and this is the key Yale class that will teach it.",
                "I would not. It may have been because Covid made the experience worse, but I would suggest that this course be taken off the the YJI certification requirements because it is not necessary to take as a journalist. I don't feel like I learned very much.",
                "No",
