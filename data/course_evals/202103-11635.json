                "strengths: focus and practice on reading and grammar \r\nweaknesses: not a lot of focus on writing in Japanese (we only had one essay writing exercise); there was a lot of homework (~5 hrs per week) but they were not the most intellectually challenging/stimulating; the class was too big with 18 students so difficult to participate and get individual attention; Stever sensei can be disorganized and often forgets to upload homework assignments on time; maybe it's just how it gets with higher-level language classes, but I can't pinpoint if/how my Japanese has improved after the class; mostly because the weekly discussion topics were kind of random for example one week on anime and another on Japanese news: there was little coherence in how they connect to each other",
                "Strength: Stever-sensei is a great teacher. She's very receptive to questions and will make sure that each student understands the readings. The course was the right amount of work. Plus, the conversation clinics/practice-sessions were really helpful for me because of their flexible nature.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I do wish we had worked a bit more on our writing and listening comprehension. I know that adding it would have felt like a lot of work, so I understand why it wasn't as robust. However, I think a few in-class exercises would have been helpful. I also think that submitting homework online through Canvas made getting feedback on assignments a lot less clear. It's hard to follow the corrections on Canvas. Half the time, the platform couldn't even process Japanese, so the corrections would just show up as wingdings or indecipherable symbols. Next year, I would really appreciate it if Stever-sensei went back to doing homework on paper.",

                "Yes, if you like learning Japanese, this is a good way to continue your skills. You get out from this class what you put in. Many of the homework materials are interesting as well, so they are fun to engage with.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is motivated to continue expanding/improving their Japanese skills. To an extent, what you get out of this course is how you choose to make of it. Homework, for one, is largely completion-based, but oftentimes I would spend time answering the questions thoughtfully while applying grammar/vocab that I recently learned; this enabled more meaningful/constructive feedback that was much more conducive to my learning than if I had put less thought in the assignment. A lot of the other marks come from the two tests (which were very fair in my opinion) and some occasional activities. In short, you have little to lose in the class, and I think that aspect allowed me and many other students to take it one step further to challenge ourselves when we had the time."
