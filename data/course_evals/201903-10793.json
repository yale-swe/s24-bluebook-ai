    "I really enjoyed learning Korean and the culture. I didn't think I would enjoy this course this much, but Professor Lim not only made learning easy but also enjoyable at the same time.",

    "I learned to read and write in Korean, as well as basic conversational skills and quite a lot of grammar.",

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are how organized it is with its lessons. Along with that, a variety of activities were employed to help us practice speaking, writing, and learning the vocabulary\/grammar. I guess in terms of improvement, there could be more emphasis on understanding sentence structure and how to translate sentences from English.",
    "The strengths of this course include the enthusiastic professor, open layout of the classroom (conducive to conversation), frequent oral dialogues, occasional quizzes, and emphasis on actual learning rather than rote memorization. No weaknesses.",
    "Amazing teacher, by far one my favorites at Yale. Very good engagement",
    "It's a course that initiates study of the language in a very successful, comprehensive way. In-class practice is very helpful and helps internalization of the language. However, I would argue that it is too slow at the beginning and too quick at the end.",
    "The class has been well organized.",
    "I loved how this course was taught. Each day we would review, learn new material, and practice using worksheets and dialogues. I don't think I would've changed or improved this course.",
    "There are many young students in the class, and they could be distracting sometimes.  I think it would be good to have more discipline in the course.",
    "Strengths - good homework and in class practice assigned\r\nWeakness- there isnt really information for if you need additional help, I learned through others that a language tutor was available, language tutor website also needs updates"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is seeking to learn a new language. The learning environment is so positive and the instructor is so supportive and helpful in every aspect.",
    "Yes, without a doubt! Not only is the Korean language so beautiful, but going to class everyday really put a smile on my face. There were such good vibes in the classroom, and it really was such a community.",
    "100% amazing teacher, extremely caring and funny.",
    "Yes. After only one semester of Korean, I can already hold basic conversations and have quite a strong grammatical understanding of the language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It was a great introductory course and I am excited to further my skills in this language in the coming semesters.",
    "Yes, it was taught very well, and I learned a lot throughout the semester."
