Throughout the semester we continuously built upon the ideas we learned and everything we did in class, whether it was having conversations, doing practices, watching music videos, etc. was extremely relevant to what we were learning.",

                "The strengths of this course start with Mansiji and the energy of acceptance of making mistakes while learning that she brings into the classroom. I love how easy she makes it available to speak our thoughts in a group discussion and to speak to her about other things as well. I liked having partner switch offs while reading, especially for people like me who were conscious about reading in front of the whole class. A possible weakness could be how quick paced I felt like the grammar was so it made it hard to retain it all, but it makes sense with the classs pace.",

I received direct feedback on all my quizzes and assignments, which helped me improve so much, and I saw the direct impact the class had on my Hindi.",
