Definitely good if you want to get used to writing funny things. I used the class to test out a whole bunch of different forms I don't usually write in, so that was fun.",

There are so many avenues to receive feedback on assignments.\r\nweaknesses: none, although grading seems a bit arbitrary at times but I think that's inevitable in a class like this",
                "Strengths: getting to practice writing. Peer workshops and feedback. some funny readings. \r\nweaknesses: some class discussions (non-workshop days) were not super exciting. there's only so much you can say about a humor piece other than \"it was funny\" or \"this part was funny\". Especially on days where I didn't love the readings. Prof. Wepler also has a very distinct sense of humor, and some grades seemed to reflect not the quality of the work, but whether or not he liked it.",
                "It's super engaging and each class teaches you something new in a fun and rigorous environment. Not many weaknesses I could call out aside from the fact that it's quite focused upon a narrow band of humor writing for the page, so if someone is looking for writing like screenplays or other formats then this isn't really the course for that.",
                "One strength is honestly the selection of the group. I dont know how it works, but the people were great. I also loved how varied the activities were as well as the assignments.",
                "Strengths: \r\nwell-organized\r\nreceive so much clear feedback in multiple formats\r\nso many opportunities to practice week to week and day to day\r\nso much fun\r\nRyan loves his job\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\npeople shouldn't be able to use their laptops, it really detracted from the classes",
                "Ryan was an amazing, attentive, smart, and thoughtful instructor. He made the course worthwhile. I think it would've been fun to do more writers-room type stuff.",
                "The course structure was phenomenal, I loved how we workshopped other students' work, if I could change anything I would have liked the opportunity to edit earlier essays for a grade."

Did I enjoy this course? Most of the time. It was a good excuse to write funny stuff every week. I befriended several people in the class. But I think it's one of those courses that sounds more fun than it actually is.",
                "I recommend this class to anyone. Anyone who is interested in being funny and willing to turn being funny less into a personality trait and more into a practice should take this class.",
                "Extremely. If you enjoy writing and stretching your creative and humorous muscle, this class is a joy. The work never really feels like work and you get to explore your own sense of humor and comedy as a whole with a fresh lens.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who likes writing and likes laughing.",
                "Absolutely! Its a very high workload class (in terms of pure amount of content you need to be outputting), but its totally worth it. Id advise not taking during a heavy semester, but its such a great class if you enjoy writing humor and want to measurably improve!",
                "yes! I had the best time. I also feel like this course can be enjoyed by people with and without experience. It is such a great way to practice and learn to appreciate writing, and also helps you focus on such specific skills, down the word and stance level of writing. I think that a lot of writing can benefit from the attention to detail this class teaches you.",
