                "This course was indispensable and not comparable to any other class I have taken. Our class discussions, readings, and analysis of neoliberalism and its relation to the marginalized, racialized, and sexualized body was extremely informative and provocative. I genuinely cannot look at this world the same again. I highly highly recommend.",
                "How to read and discuss academic writing, how to question everything about the structure of our global society, how different systems of power overlap",
                "In this course, I learned to question marriage, the family, tourism, leisure, security, food, prisons, and social activism under Neoliberalism. I learned how Neoliberalism disavows its own inequalities. Through illusions such as gay marriage, corporate diversity, and nonprofit organizations, social justice is viewed as a possibility under Neoliberalism, an \"identity politics\" independent from economics. In this class, I learned that \"identity politics\" are class politics; racialized, gendered, and sexualized inequality is class inequality.",
                "This course allowed for an evaluation of modern policies that have been instituted under neoliberalism and to apply critique on their impacts of various aspects of life, including intimate domains such as family and sexuality. The material covered is a carefully curated body of work of several thinkers that deconstruct the basis of western liberalism, and paint a novel picture on what social justice looks like under neoliberalism. It also provides a fresh approach to viewing sexuality in terms of the economic structures that regulate our interpersonal relations.",
                "Through this course, I was able to gain an in-depth, nuanced understanding of neoliberalism and its presence in the world around us. I found the course readings about the impact of neoliberalism on social welfare, security regimes, and philanthropy particularly captivating.",
                "This class was extremely helpful in teaching me how neoliberal systems affect our everyday lives.",
                "Overall, I definitely feel like my understanding of neoliberalism, capitalism, and the systems that are currently in place in America broadened over the course of this past semester. I've also become more aware of how several institutions in our country are related to one another, even if they seemingly appear not to be.",

                "I learned a significant amount about neoliberalism and the structures that form our society. My understanding of politics and government in general was vastly different by the end of the course, as I learned how intricately designed our institutions are.",
                "I've learned so much from this course; I came into this seminar having not even known what neoliberalism is and now I am able to see how this system interacts in everything we do throughout our lives. I've learned from my peers and professor on how neoliberalism plays into the many social justice issues we face in society today. The most important knowledge I gained through this course though is the power of the collective, that in order to bring real change, we need to work as unit, together.",
                "I thought that this course was a great introduction to Neoliberalism and WGSS. Broadly, we spoke about topics like individuality vs collectives/greater society/systems, labor, capitalism, activism, and the relationship of these topics to stuff like sexuality, race, and class. The atmosphere and the readings the class provided allowed for really deep and insightful analysis into these topics and I found the specificity of our discussions and the readings to be really nuanced and mind-opening. I think anyone new to these subjects and the authors we read, would be able to gain a lot from the class. And because many of the topics and the readings we do can be dense and complex, I also feel that this class helped me build the skills necessary to analyze contemporary academic papers/articles and then participate in discussions about them."

                "Strengths: \r\n- As a teacher and person, Evren is just fantastic. Class discussions felt like intellectual rants in the best way possible.\r\n- The class readings were very interesting.\r\n- The assignments were purposeful and manageable. \r\n- The syllabus and course direction was clear.\r\n- The learning persists beyond the classroom in ways one doesn't imagine them manifesting, yet they do.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The readings would be a lot sometimes and very dense.",
                "Strengths: very creative ways to approach papers and a lot of room to understand the material in the ways we know best\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of readings",
                "The readings for this course are great. My least favorite readings were from Foucault, only because they were dense. The openness of the papers is both a strength and a curse; the lack of boundaries for the assignments was well intentioned, but made me feel directionless when brainstorming for each paper.\r\n\r\nThe seminar conversations were always great.",
                "The strengths of the course are the interesting discussions on topics of social justice, and subverting mainstream liberal narratives. The course asks us to consider critically how different approaches to social justice serves to align and include more people into the neoliberal structures rather than challenging them. The readings are engaging and relevant to current issues, examining examples of major legislation and how it regulates human behavior.\r\nThe only thing I would change is having the professor take a more center stage in discussion, since she provided insightful commentary. Also, some weeks included long and many readings, where critical information in them could be easily lost in the sheer amount of information available to read.",
                "I enjoyed the unstructured structure of the in-class discussions: rather than adhering to a specific set of discussion questions, we were encouraged to talk about anything we found interesting in the readings. I also enjoyed having the opportunity to write about our own personal interests on the class blog website.",
                "I think this course did a great job of providing readings and materials to better understand neoliberalism and its present-day impacts. However, I think without any past knowledge on the subject of neoliberalism, it was difficult at times to make sense of the readings we were asked to complete.",
                "There were definitely many opportunities to participate in class through our discussions, and I also appreciated how, as a class, we were able to facilitate a non-judgmental and open environment for speaking and learning. Overall, I do not feel like there were any noteworthy weaknesses of the course.",
                "This course is EXCELLENT!!!",
                "Strengths: Very very interesting content, Evren is great and everyone in the class is engaged.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In my opinion, this is a hard class if you know little about WGSS generally, The readings can be dense and confusing, and there are lots of of ties between ideas that arent always clear. I found myself often frustrated for being unable to understand the class, as it is more abstract and some concepts are harder to grasp.",
                "I dont see any weaknesses with this course. I love the seminar structure of it because it allows for lots of discussion and I think the workload is very manageable as well.",
                "I love how Evren encouraged everyone to participate in class. She made sure that everyone was a part of the discussion, and even frequently had us go around in a circle and provide insight to ensure that everyone took part. One challenge I faced during the course was dissecting what our prompts were truly asking since they were fairly open-ended which at times confused me occasionally on things like structure.",
                "Strengths: The access to a curated list of really interesting and insightful readings that feel essential to understanding Neoliberalism and contemporary issues. The topics and readings are all super interesting and every one of them offers something valuable. Class discussions are good. A big strength of the class is the insightfulness of your classmates and the ability to hear discourse. I found the class discussion/seminar format to be inviting and friendly, and everyone is respectful of peoples inputs and various levels of familiarity with the material. Professor Savci is deeply knowledgeable and is very good at directing the discussion. She is also great at breaking down big topics and challenges us to think critically and open-minded-ly. The assignments overall are very reasonable. There are really just two short blog posts, two short papers, and one final paper/project, and also class participation. If you plan ahead, I think these assignments are definitely reasonable and not too stressful. Though, the time it takes to do the readings can be a little intense. The blog posts were a great way to make outside connections and to hear a classmates thoughts on the topics at hand. \r\nSort of Weakness: The reading can be quite dense and can frankly be a bit intimidating at first. Luckily, it definitely gets easier as the weeks go by as you get a better understanding of the material and have discussions in class. Theres usually around 3 readings each week that are each 20-30ish pages. I havent taken many other reading intensive class at Yale, so personally, I found that due to the density of some of the texts, the time demand can be a bit intense, but as long as you spread it out you should be good (I also found using a read-aloud/text-to-speech program helpful). You can somewhat get away with skimming the texts sometimes and still be able to participate in class, but with the texts, it really is a case of you get what you put into it."

                "YES!!!! If you are at all interested in critically engaging with the way we navigate the world in the age of hypercapitalism, this is the class for you. Its accessible to everyone, engaging on a moment-to-moment level, and I feel sorry for anyone who goes through Yale without spending at least one semester learning from Evren.",

You might not get everything, but its still very worth it if you want to learn more about the topics discussed",

                "Yes, if youre interested in learning what Neoliberalism is and definitely if youre interested in WGSS as a field of study. I found it very eye-opening and a really good introduction. I truly do believe that anyone could benefit from this class as it provides useful and meaningful discourse about our contemporary society, and I think it actively encourages you to think critically and analyze deeply."
