    "Social theories and their implications",
    "The course gave me a chance to deeply read the texts that I just skimmed over in former classes. I became more familiar with those theorists' thoughts and details in their demonstrations. Also, the heavy workload of reading enhanced my ability to read and comprehend quickly to some extent.",
    "The ability to read through classics in social sciences in English, and to figure out the logic of the works.",
    "Reading and discussing about the works of founders of sociology thoughts, and try to compare and synthesize their arguments. Also, to search for the influence they have on one another.",
    "By taking this course, I was able to gain knowledge into an area I had not studied before. The course improved my academic reading and writing skills and taught me how to engage in academic conversation about sociology.",
    "sociology",
    "I learned specific sociological theories from different sociologists, and also realized how should I face and explain all kinds of different social phenomena."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths : it is a great introduction for sociology and lay a solid basis in the theory part. \r\nWeaknesses: it can be more accessible if more examples can be applied",
    "Strengths: (1) the instructor tried to present overall images and backgrounds of the theorists, which can help students to put their theories in real history and get more comprehension of the connection between theories and reality.\r\n(2) the feedback of the two papers from the instructor was really helpful, which helped me to know where my weaknesses are and how to improve them.\r\nWeaknesses: (1) the \"game\" or \"discussion\" part in the course may be designed to make the class livelier and to bring students' different ideas together, but in fact it seemed not \"interesting\" enough and fail to mobilize the atmosphere in the classroom. As a result, the atmosphere might be a little tense sometimes, and attending classes was tiring occasionally.\r\n(2) The discussion part is a great way to let us think and get inspired by others' thoughts. But because it was hard for us to cover all the texts required in detail before every class, the ideas brought up by us might be incomplete and unclear sometimes. In that occasion we may need the instructor to help us consolidate and extend our ideas, to make them more orderly, logical and convincing.",
    "More background information, or the lecture part, should be involved.",
    "The strength is the reading intensity and the class discussion, however, since the primary readings are hard themselves, I wish the teacher could emphasize more on the lecture in helping us gain an even deeper understanding on the readings.  Also, the teacher can guide the discussion and involve more to make sure we aren't off the topic ;)",
    "Strenghts = Thorough insight into the foundations of social theory. Great introduction to the topic. Indepth feedback on assessment. Weaknesses = Sometimes difficult to keep up with the pace of the course and the amount of reading required.",
    "This course involved a lot of discussions and readings, which really helps to understand the content of the course and the idea of different theories; there was a large amount of reading required every day, which was overwhelming to me."

   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "Maybe, because on the one hand, it can certainly give students a general and comprehensive view on social theories, but on the other hand, it really has a heavy workload beyond expectation, which may make the students' life in summer very hard and force them to change their summer plans. The extent of the workload should be clearly notified to students before they select the course.",
    "Yes, its an experience of intellectual challenge that enable us to read many interesting yet difficult books. It also help students accumulate the knowledge important for any future social science or humanities courses.",
    "Definitely. It is a great introduction to social theory and a very rewarding course to take.",
    "yes"
