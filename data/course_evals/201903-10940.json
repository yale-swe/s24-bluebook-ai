   "comments": [
    "Improved my understanding of classical cultures and their artistry, gained insight into the transformation of western literature over its long history, and learned how to effectively write essays of medium length.",
    "This course really exposed me to the importance and beauty of the tragedy as a literary form. We tracked the development of the tragedy, starting with the The Iliad (technically an epic) and the Ancient Greek tragedies (Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides) and ended with several modern tragedies by writers such as Cesaire, Sartre, and Hansberry. We explored how writers across the ages wrestle with (often similar) issues relating to the human condition (e.g., honor and pride, natural vs. social order, power, action vs. inaction, conformity). Like any good literature class, we analyzed how the writers conveyed these issues through the use of language. The in-class discussions revolved around close-readings and really highlighted the subtleties of the text that I had glossed over when reading myself. The essays basically asked us to conduct a close-reading ourselves. Although we only had four 4-page essays (which are honestly relatively short if you have a good thesis), I think they really helped me think critically and develop my argumentative skills. Compared to high school essays (which you can somewhat BS), the professor held us to a high caliber and forced us (in a good way) to piece out the subtleties of the texts and craft a strong argument. Still, the grading was very fair and the professor gave detailed and helpful comments. Overall, this was probably my favorite class this semester and the in class discussions are highly interesting so you'll actually want to read the books.",
    "I learned a lot about tragedy as a genre, like its history, how different people define it, and how it makes you feel as a reader. I also gained more confidence speaking in class because the environment was very non-judgemental and open. I got to read some very interesting works and discuss them with a great group of people",
    "I learned how to create a close reading essay and look at tragedy as a genre that persists in contemporary literature.",
    "Critical thinking, literary analysis, writing and speaking skills. Discussed political, theoretical, and moral dilemmas through European literature.",
    "I learned about the history and development of tragedy, from the Greeks to the 20th century. I also learned about a few different theories of tragedy and the themes and formal elements that made the genre what it is.",
    "Read lots of new texts and explored the genre of tragedy across human history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The reading list was well chosen, and discussions were well curated to ensure salient themes both of individual works and of the class as a while consistently came to the fore. However, such curation sometimes directed conversation away from certain topics where students had insight or desired clarification.",
    "The reading list is fantastic, even if it begins with a whirlwind through The Iliad",
    "The in-class discussions were highly enlightening and really went beyond a surface level treatment of the text. Of course, each book could merit its own entire course, so we definitely could only discuss some of the topics each class, but the close-readings gave a pretty good glimpse at the central issues. I absolutely loved the in-class close-readings, since they really brought ought good talking points. The close-reading also kept the class tied to the text, so that the class would rarely stray into an overly abstract and somewhat nonsensical\/irrelevant discussion that I had sometimes encountered in my high school English classes. Even though some of the students in the class are way more well-versed in the text than I, Professor Ellermann fostered an environment that really enabled everyone to contribute to the discussions.",
    "A strength was that it was very engaging. I looked forward to going to every class and talking about all the interesting works that we read. I felt like it helped me learn a lot about the works and how to be an insightful reader. One weakness was that I felt a little confused my the essays. I often felt a little unclear about the prompt and was often slightly unsure what he wanted. Other than that it was a wonderful class.",
    "I felt that the heavy reading made it difficult to truly understand all that we read as we had to cover a lot of material in short period.",
    "This course was amazing. Every class professor Ellermann came prepared with 5-10 minutes of an introductory lecture and then lead discussion with good, poignant questions. Students were engaged and brought diverse opinions and ideas. Perhaps could be enriched with some theoretical texts to pair with the dramas, but I would say the only weakness is that there wasn't enough time to discuss pieces more in-depth and cover more literature.",
    "The biggest strength was the plays themselves, which included classic foundational texts alongside some lesser-known but still very strong works. I thought the discussions were also enjoyable and instructive (if a bit circuitous at times). Another strength, in my opinion, was how the paper-writing didn't encroach on the rest of the class, which has limited my enjoyment of English classes I've taken in the past.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness was probably how quickly we were forced to move from play to play, which did let us read a greater variety of works but also made me feel like I wasn't gaining a full appreciation for each individual one. Maybe removing two or three plays from the syllabus would make the schedule less strained. I also felt like it was sometimes see the big picture as we jumped between authors and time periods. This might be improved with more secondary texts, but I'm not sure.",
    "Great class, but unfortunately populated by first years who belong in intro writing seminars rather than intro literature seminars.  Great set of books, and great instructor."

   "comments": [
    "This class represents the ideal WR credit; the readings and class discussions cover a broad range of topics, and the essays allow individual exploration of specific topics which raise questions in any given student. However, a person who isnt in need of a writing intensive class might gain more from a literature seminar more focused on student insight in class discussions.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to basically everyone. Granted you must have a decent interest in the humanities. But you definitely don't need to be a literature buff to enjoy this class. I entered the class as a CS\/Econ major and I definitely haven't read nearly as much in high school as other people in the class, but gladly there is a diverse range of students. I also have always wanted to read some of the books on the syllabus so this class was a great introduction to these texts. For example, I had \"read\" Hamlet in high school, but I finally got to closely read (and appreciate) it through this class.",
    "Yes definitely. Professor Ellermann is a wonderful professor and leads really interesting and engaging discussions. The discussions are very open and non-judgemental, and made me enjoy the works even more, and I looked forward to coming to class. The workload is really high during reading week (and the week after) when we read the Illiad, but don't let that scare you away, the pace gets much more relaxed once you finish the Illiad.",
    "If you are pursuing literature or comparative literature it is essential to take courses such as these because you will be exposed to many classics, however if your extremely self disciplined you could just read these texts on your own and discuss them with your peers.",
    "Highly highly highly recommend. My favorite class and favorite professor at Yale. The literature is extremely rich and professor Ellermann knows exactly how to approach it. He leads discussion very well, by being receptive to students' ideas and building on them to further complicate and progress discussion. Every class you leave feeling all the more appreciative of the readings and intellectually inspired. Additionally, the paper topics are very clear and well chosen.",
    "I would recommend it. The readings were good and very manageable, as were the writing assignments. I don't usually love English classes, but I did like this one. My main warnings to interested students would be that the first few weeks reading the Iliad were the most difficult of the classes, and that the focus is very much on the plays themselves, so a student who's already read many of them, for example, might not get much out of the class.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, absolutely!  And if you can take it with Professor Ellermann, all the better.  He is a great teacher and is truly passionate about the plays and books read in the course, and leads interesting discussions on all of them.",
    "Absolutely! If the syllabus interests you, the class will not disappoint."
