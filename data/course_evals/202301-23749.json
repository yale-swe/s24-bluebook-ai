                "An understanding of how relationships of possession appear in many contexts and how they map, cleanly or uneasily, onto other relationships such as subject-object, causality, transcendent-worldly, obtaining and losing, desire and gratitude, and more.",
                "This class is really a class about how to think conceptually across disciplines. In doing so, you also learn some much needed academic undisciplining! The way this class is organized and taught is very different to most classes, which is a good thing.",
                "This class afforded me a holistic knowledge of its titular term, as seen through many lenses. Along the way, I also got to engage with post colonial theory, gender scholarship, political writing, film, literature, and the fascinating ideas of Dr. Khawaja, Lacey Jones, and my classmates.",
                "It is hard to capture everything i learned in this class, but broadly, it opened up my way of thinking about the world and relationships or possession. This is the type of course where you dont go super in depth about any one thing, but at the same time the concepts are thoroughly interrelated and the satisfaction of learning comes from making the connections between the topics. We touched on property, kinship, linguistics, ownership, demonic possession, literature, and identity and the self, among other things.",
                "It is tricky to say exactly but I feel the course was able to develop in me some skills in vision and special awareness while visiting the conceptual plane. It was also quite fun and interesting, very good for inciting enthusiasm and optimism/cheerful excitement about learning.",
                "I learned about how to think about different forms of possession as well as explored various approaches of defining possession. E.g: property, spiritual, the body",
                "I learned how to put a lot of different kinds of texts into conversation: anthropology, fiction, theory, and essays. I also thought more deeply about how to be a better seminar participant and to synthesize and move class discussion forward. I learned how to ask better questions of texts."

                "very exciting engaging class. discussion can sometimes feel choppy though when people dont build on each others thoughts.",
                "this was a great course and the assignments were super interesting, gave me a chance to do very untraditional and non-academic assignments that were a lot more creative and flexible",
                "It's conceptually very messy - but I can't say for sure whether that's a strength or weakness. Noreen is a wonderful professor and has put a lot of thought into crafting the course. The Canvas discussion posts from peers were also a joy to read and engage with. While it can sometimes take a while to receive feedback on written assignments, the unconventional prompts are also a strength of the course.",
                "I think that some of the readings were too long and we often weren't able to actually cover all of them since the class only meets once a week. The class never had any structure to it beyond coming in and having an open discussion, which is totally fine except that there was often too much material too cover and it was often really dense and tricky to navigate.",
                "Great readings",
                "Strengths: readings are varied (really varied) and rich. Noreen is an eccentric but warm and supportive teacher take a class with them!!!!!  and Lacey, our TA, really held the class together. Weekly office hours was helpful. Weaknesses: None, but if you like having structure or guidance, this class may be a little bit of a struggle.",
                "Each class meeting was rich and unique, as were the readings and graded assignments. I looked forward to this course throughout the week and, more saliently, found that our readings and discussions colored everything I did afterwards, from my other coursework to my social life. My only small criticism is that I felt the class used breakout groups for discussion too often. This may be a subjective take with which others would disagree, but I found the class-wide conversations much more engaging.",
                "I think this course was so special in that the assignments were unlike any assignments ive done in other classes. They were very embodied and reflective in nature, and it was nice to have a class that was somewhat theory based but the work expected from us was still somewhat creative in nature. I really appreciated this because I felt so much closer to the learning process and it felt more natural and less academic. I personally dont think this class has many weaknesses, although if youre looking for a straightforward philosophy class where you analyze theory and write argumentative papers this is not the class. There were times where I had hoped to get feedback earlier in the semester but since our assignments were different from each other it wasnt a huge barrier. Overall, the classroom environment was super engaging and interesting and I felt like i was really engaging with my peers in a meaningful way.",
                "I am not very sure, but I feel that the evident care that went into its planning and into the construction of the syllabus is a major strength as is the air of communal exploration.",
                "The course assignments are a great low-stress way to engage with the ideas presented in class. They are more like exercises to get our brains thinking about how we see possession in our day-to-day and are enjoyable to do!",
                "A strength is the assignments which allow for creativity, flexibility and deep personal investment. Another strength is teh variety of students it attracts and variety of disiplines we read from. A weakness could be the amount of reading which it felt could have been signifcantly shorter and made class more focused."

I recommend it if you're open to more creative assignments, somewhat less rigidity in overall theme, and willing to put in the effort.",
                "Yes, definitely. Because the subject matter relates to a lot of familiar topics that we don't often study in depth, this is one of those iconic Yale College courses that will be interesting and challenging to most people regardless of major.",

It is not just a class about possession, but a class about how to weave together disparate strands of meaning and being and understanding across cultures and disciplinesin a safe and supportive academic environment. This is one of those classes where the syllabus is far greater than the sum of its parts.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "Highly! This course is a unique, immersive, cross-disciplinary experience which opens so many unexpected portals. Id warn classmates about high volume, challenging readings, which comprise a large amount of the coursework. They were always worthwhile and really fascinating, though!",
                "I would 100% recommend this course. It was intellectual without being stressful of pretentious. I think the instructors made it really possible to engage with difficult material even if at times it was confusing or you werent sure about something. I thought the texts on the syllabus were also really interesting and it was cool to read a number of different genres and put them in conversation.",

                "Yes, as someone who hasn't done much humanities work in the past, this was a great way for me to get a taste of what it's like diving deep into a topic that is quite relevant in our day-to-day, while still being broad enough for everyone to think about and ponder.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. I loved how each reading felt in conversation with each other and the syllabus generally. I also think Noreen is AMAZING and the assigments are fun"
