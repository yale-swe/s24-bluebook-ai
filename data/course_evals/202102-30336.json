I learned how to work within constraints and really push my work to the next level. This is the first college course Ive ever taken because I am still in high school so it was a good experience and really pushed me out of my comfort zone to work alongside older students.",

                "The main strength is the structure of the assignments. The constraints are very helpful when starting to create designs. The main weaknesses are that no grade feedback is given so students do not know where they stand. Also, there is little helpful resources on how to use software to create designs. For an intro level class it expects aa high level knowledge of design software.",
                "Of course this course was offered over zoom so I am sure it did not meet its full potential but I think because most of our work in this class was created digitally the breakout rooms were an excellent way to share our work. Sometimes the lecture portion of the class was long but our professor did a nice job of allowing us breaks when we needed them. I think one thing this course would benefit from is more time learning adobe softwares just because it is an \"intro\" class so some introduction to common softwares would have been nice. Another critique of the course is the amount of feedback we got from the professor, throughout the class I got basic feedback from everyone but it gave me no sense really of how I was doing in the class. I would have appreciated a half-way report of some sort.",
                "hands-on approach was very good.\r\n\r\nsharing/critique wasn't always the most helpful because it depended on other students. This isn't to say any contribution wasn't valuable... it's just that some included more disparities and cognitive/design dissonance than others.",
