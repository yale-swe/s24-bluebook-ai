                "I learned about how economic thought has been developed throughout history. As an economics major, it was extremely valuable learning about the history of economics, rather than just what modern economic theory is.",
                "I have a significantly more substantial understanding of how modern economics came to be. I am confident enough to discuss the errors and opinions of key economists who come up in everyday conversations about economics.",
                "Learned about the fundamentals of economic history and the ideas behind the formulas and concepts that are taught in the core economics curriculum",
                "I learned a lot about the history of economic thought from Aristotle to the contemporary period",
                "I learned about the development of major economic theories as put forth by the great economic thinkers over the centuries. I also gained great analysis and reading skills from having to read admittedly dense texts, and having to pull out the major points and compare with other thinkers.",
                "I really didnt know any of the history of the theories we studied in Econ classes so this was very useful, as well and the insight it gave on the economic rational of the some of the history classes I took",
                "I learned more about Econ theory and its history and development. I learned to write essays quickly and work with broad prompts",
                "Ideas of economic thinkers through history, from Aristotle and the Scholastics all the way to the modern day.",
                "I learned about the development of economic thought from scholastic interpretations to modern conceptions. I developed critical thinking skills and writing skills",
                "Economics from a philosophical perspective. Very interesting and different approach to other econ courses.",
                "Read a lot of foundational texts in modern economics by important thinkers like Smith, Ricardo, Hume. Marx, Fisher, Veblen, Keynes, etc. Great information for contextualizing what you learn in other Econ Classes at Yale, which throw names like Cournot and Walras and Hicks and Marshall around without explaining who they were. This class does that.",
                "I learned about the history of economic thought beginning with pre-Smith thinkers like the scholastics and ending with contemporary thinkers.",
                "I have learned a lot about the history of the economic theories that a lot of the Yale economics major courses are based on. I also gained a lot of insight about how the discipline of economics was established and developed to its modern and still improving form.",
                "This course gave me so much insight to the dynamics between the economists. I could learn how Marx rooted from Smith and Ricardo, how Malthus began from Smith, how Keynes agreed to the Mercantilist, etc. It was very interesting to learn these line of thoughts, as it provided a completely new scope of viewing economics. \r\nMoreover, I had a great experience of writing a paper in social sciences.",

                "It is very hard to study for exams and midterms since the lecture slides are very bare and not a lot of reading or review is assigned",
                "There needs to be a discussion section. The course material was very dense, and there needs to be a format to discuss the readings.",
                "Strengths: good lecture notes, Professor Dimand is very knowledgeable about the subject and clearly cares a lot about ithe also tries to factor in humor to keep some of the more dense material interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's a long time before you get your first official grade backcould be difficult if you're concerned with add/drop.",
                "Lectures were very engaging, but I think the work wasnt segmented very well",
                "Have more weekly assignments instead of just long term midterm and finals. No reinforcement of material other than listening to lecture and reading - should be more intermittent activities",
                "Strengths: Professor knowledgable and willing to help \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture slides were probably the part that needed the most improvement. Disorganized and unclear bullet points and slides. Also, in lecture (and on the slides) lots of unnecessary and irrelevant details were mentioned which did not tie into the themes of the class.",
                "Strengths- professor Dimand is very knowledgeable and a fantastic professor, he is able to explain everything in a way that makes sense\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: feels a bit slow sometimes",
                "It covers very extensively how economic thought has changed through the years, from Aristotle onwards. Maybe classes could be slightly more discussion focused but are very fun.",
                "Strenghts: great class, good/chill professor, interesting material; teaches you a lot of useful stuff for future Econ classes|| Weaknesses: This class needs to be cross-listed with the history department, and it also needs a discussion section with a dedicated TA; a section would do wonders in allowing students to really engage with the material in a social setting and would also incentivize more students to do the readings; also maybe more assignments throughout the semester?",
                "The PowerPoint slides could be more clear, and it would be preferable if the the lectures could be recorded.",
                "The course is a very loaded content and based a lot on readings. In that, the course could be more engaging for the students to grasp and better internalize the reading heavy content",
                "Strengths: Small class, interactive (you can ask questions whenever you want), approachable professor (Prof Dimand is always super eager to talk to the students about anything), decent pace\r\nWeakness: I hope there is a discussion section where students can share there interpretations about the class materials",
                "It is the best survey class on the subject one can ask for. Prof. Dimand is extremely organized and knowledgeable about all the thinkers covered."

I found the material covered in the class to be interesting and valuable, and also really enjoyed writing a research paper for the course. It was very interesting to learn about the history of economic thought, and am grateful and thankful that I had the opportunity to take the course.",
                "Yes! If you are an economics major, you'll probably find tracing the history of economic thought from Aristotle to the current day (focusing on thought post-Smith, obviously) quite interesting. If you want to be able to discuss Keynes, Fisher, Friedman, etc. taking a class to understand their contributions to economics is absolutely the way to go.",
                "Yes, if you are willing to put in the time and the effort this course is rather enjoyable. However, there are a lot of concepts and lots of things to memorize so have to pay a lot of attention during lectures.",
                "Unless you are very interested in the history of economic thought, then I would not recommend. You are probably better off taking another history course.",
                "Yes. It puts a lot of the economic theory we take for granted into perspective, and shows the ingenuity from which it was borne. It was also just interesting to consider how economic thought has developed, and how even current economic concerns via politics seem like a regression.",
                "Yes, it was super interesting the the Professor made class engaging",
                "Yes only if passionate abt economic theory",
                "Probably not, but it is an economics credit that is not difficult if that's what you're looking for.",
                "Yes, its a great class to learn about the development of the concepts that you learn in economic theory classes",
                "Yes I would. Its a very different approach from other econ courses but equally important. It teaches you more of an argumentative type of economics. A mixture of philisophy and economics really. Very interesting.",
                "Yes! great class for Econ majors (as well as non-majors) to learn the historical development of the field and engage with foundational texts of our modern world",
                "Yes, as long as they can keep themselves motivated and engaged with the material, because the class isnt really designed to facilitate active participation with the content.",
                "Yes, if you are looking for an econ credit that is interesting and provides knowledge on a less theory based part of economics, definitely take it.",
                "100%. This is an amazing class for econ majors to view economics in a new perspective. Not too much workload, and great class atmosphere&professor.",
