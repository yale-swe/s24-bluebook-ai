    "I started from square one with Near Eastern Literature. I had never picked up any kind of book of source of the kind. I feel that I have acquired an understanding of Near Eastern civilizations, their ways of life, and their various forms of \"displacement\" through time. As the course's title suggests, we read the most interesting excerpts from a range of works, from  the earliest known epic, the Epic of Gilgamesh, to the modern graphic novel, Persepolis, by an Iranian refugee.",
    "Overview of Near Eastern Literature by following the theme of displacement.",
    "I learned how to read old texts and analyze the important elements in \"near eastern\" literatures.",
    "Learned how to better analyze and connect near eastern literature.",
    "I knew very little about the Near East before starting this course, and I came out of it with a solid sense of the canon and how it has evolved from the ancient to the modern era. During this seminar, I learned an enormous amount about displacement, heroism, and love -- and aside from that, I also significantly developed my writing skills with the weekly reading responses. Perhaps most importantly, I learned to be continually conscious as I was reading of my role as a reader and how to specifically articulate the way that the texts were eliciting reactions from me. I loved the selection and variety of texts in this course, and it was a wonderful privilege to be taught by Professor Slanski as well as the stellar guest speakers she invited in.",
    "Read texts of the region referred to as the Near East beginning with ancient mesopotamia and ending with modern graphic novels and texts. Discussed themes of displacement and whether or not the near east should be considered a single body of literature and what this means.",
    "In this seminar, we read texts of different ages and cultures in the Near East and then discussed those texts in class. I learned how to approach texts and explore what the author was trying to communicate through their language. I also practiced my writing skills through reading responses and papers.",
    "Among other things I learned about Near Eastern history, how to analyze often fragmentary literature, literary and religious translation (and their imperfections), and issues of displacement in the region.",
    "The course provides a broad overview of the literature of the Near East, from the ancient to the modern, with a good focus on exploring what it means for near eastern literature to exist as a sort of genre and\/or field."

   "comments": [
    "Very interesting discussions and readings.",
    "The content and reading materials of this course are all very well chosen and share similar themes. However there is a feeling of rushed discussion because of the number of texts we were given and it would have been nice to have more time to discuss some of the readings",
    "The strengths of this course were the engaging professor and TA, the periodic reading responses, and the guest lectures. A weakness might be that the professor's expertise is very concentrated although the guest lecturers helped.",
    "Strenghts: Many interesting and diverse texts.\r\nWeaknesses: We were always behind on the syllabus. Sometimes it felt as if the discussions dragged.",
    "I think this course was strong in pretty much all aspects -- a comfortable and rigorous learning environment, an interesting and varied syllabus, brilliant and approachable instructors, as well as really exciting guest lecturers and out-of-class excursions.",
    "Strengths: Slanski and TA John were incredibly knowledgeable in their fields and brought a lot to the class, the guest lecturers were amazing and really added depth and valuable insights to the class to supplement our learning, trips to the Babylonian collection etc. allowed students to engage with ancient texts and literature when it otherwise might seem dry or inaccessible. Really incredible literature and choices, I loved everything we read! Writing credit was not overwhelming and all of it was enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that the background and historical perspectives behind each of the texts was lacking, though that may be due to my very limited exposure to near eastern civilizations previously. Would have liked a bit more lecture or some resources to supplement, but was able to do well searching for this on my own.",
    "The conversation during the seminar was natural and never felt forced; however, sometimes we would run out of time at the end. It is probably difficult to balance natural conversation with staying within time limits. To encourage more people to speak, it might be interesting to assign a different person for every class session to give a brief summary about the reading at the beginning of class, so that everyone will speak at some point. In terms of the writing portions, I think I realized too late that I needed help improving my writing, so it might have been nice to have one-on-one check-ins with the TF to discuss our essays.",
    "The course provides a great overview of the thousands of years of history in the near east. Some of the discussions are rather brief as a result, however.",
    "The course is engaging and well-taught, but I would have appreciated a little more structure in both grading and the overall day-to-day of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Take it if you are looking for a seminar where you can develop yourself and your ideas by writing and by collaborative discussion. If you do the readings and go to class prepared, you are guaranteed to have an awesome time, discover great ideas and interpretations from your peers, and work together to truly understand the text you read and its context.",
    "Yes! The readings and discussions are very engaging.",
    "Yes, for everyone because it is a great class that introduces you to many interesting foreign texts that many people would never open.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Definitely. I loved the variety of the class -- the weekly reading responses felt low-stakes and encouraged me to take risks in my analysis, each text was new and exciting but was also linked to what had come before it, and the activities in the class (e.g. going to the Beinecke and the Peabody) were so unique and well-crafted to add a new dimension to my learning. Definitely my favourite course this semester.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who enjoys writing. We covered a variety of stories in epics, poetry, novels, and scriptures across Near Eastern history. The way we discussed each piece was both engaging and enlightening. Enough context is provided during those discussions that even someone with no knowledge of the area's history can get something out of it.",
    "Yes, great class and very manageable writing credit.",
    "If you are looking for a humanities course to take and you haven't take one before, I would recommend this class. Prof. Slanski does a great job of breaking down certain parts of the texts and leading students to discover additional meaning beyond the surface in our readings. We were given weekly reading responses based on our readings, some guided and some more relaxed. These were never unmanageable and the prompts were easy to decipher. The final project gives you a lot of freedom to choose whatever medium you'd like to tell a story. This course does a great job of surveying various Near Eastern literature while also giving an introduction to literary analysis and writing.",
    "The course is really the only one of its kind to cover the sort of literature that it does and Professor Slanski does a really great job of getting excited about and involved in the material. Highly recommend."
