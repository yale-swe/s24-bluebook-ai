   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Academic foundation of product design and entrepreneurship.",
    "How to build a speaker from scarti having no prior knowledge with circuits, laser cutting, water jets, wood working! Understanding how to create a company or product beginning with an idea in mind and developing it over the course of 6 weeks in a team.",
    "The first part of the class focused on learning how to physically make products. For regular CEID users, most of this will not be new (CAD, laser cutter, soldering etc.). Second part gives you a chance to hear from and ask questions to a variety of startup founders and the like. The final part gives you a chance to really develop a product and think about some entrepreneurship aspects that aren't present in a typical engineering design project.",
    "I got the opportunity to build something professional looking (a bluetooth speaker!) from basic materials and in the process learned how to work with so many of the CEID's incredible tools and machinery. We heard stories from some really inspiring entrepreneurs and got the chance to take a product from idea to a prototype!",
    "I learned skills ranging from using workshop machines in the CEID to what a business model entails.",
    "This course taught me a great deal about product design and entrepreneurship, giving me an immense appreciation for the products we use every day. I learned to approach solving problems through products and services in novel ways, using design thinking and lean startup methodologies. I learned a lot in my conversations with the founders & CEOs that came to talk once a week throughout the lecture series. I gained a renewed motivation to be an entrepreneur, expanding my vision of what an entrepreneur can be. In making our own Bluetooth speakers and product, I learned to hold myself to a higher standard in creating DIY products that don't look DIY. Deeply grateful for the chance to have taken this course and learned so much from it.",
    "In this class, I learned how to take a problem from idea, to solution, to implementation.",
    "I learned a lot about entrepreneurship and the steps that go into designing a functional and aesthetic product. Through the final project I also learned how difficult it is to actually devise and create and new product.",
    "This course taught me about the entrepreneurial mindset. Guest speakers shared stories of successes and failures, outlining the details of their progress. We learned about the steps needed to make a new venture successful. We engaged in two projects. The first one was an individual project, building a bluetooth speaker. Though most of the designing was done for us, this project required the use of the machine shop and learning to solder and focused on the craftsmanship of a product. Next, we had a group project in which each group worked on an idea pitched by a fellow classmate. This project involved a lot of troubleshooting and creative thinking. It culminated in a presentation of the final product to an audience of our peers at the CEID. This course taught me about what an excellent resource Yale students have at the CEID and opened me up to the possibilities of what I can do."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great organization - very well executed project-based learning",
    "This course is unbelievable! No weaknesses (except that it requires a lot of your time and energy outside of class).",
    "I think work on the final projects could begin earlier, but overall this class is great.",
    "The class has amazing, dedicated staff and Joe is one of the biggest strengths of the class. A lot of effort goes into organizing this very uniquely structured course and it allows you to learn so many skills from designing to prototyping that you would be hard pressed to find in other classes. Perhaps, it could have benefitted from a bit more time on the product development phase but with everything that is packed into the class, I understand that might be hard.",
    "This is undoubtedly one of the best courses I have taken in my time at Yale. In the first part of the semester, building our own Bluetooth speaker was a super fun and rewarding process, with the bonus of getting a beautiful and great-sounding speaker to keep. By exploring different steps of the entrepreneurial journey, both through Joe's lectures and visiting speakers, we become empowered with new skills and insights to start our own ventures. The course is overall incredibly strong. I think it could be improved in small ways to facilitate students learning new skills (a question Joe asks at the beginning of each class). I appreciate how the first part of the semester teaches us new skills in CAD, woodworking, waterjet cutting, and more, and wish that in the second half of the semester there could me optional modules that students could sign-up for to learn how to use Arduinos, code, or graphic design softwares. The resources in the CEID are phenomenal, but we have to seek them out individually and the course could easily facilitate connecting students with such learning opportunities.",
    "Overall the course is one of the best I have taken at Yale. It was very engaging and it was great to hear from so many different professionals. You also finish the class with a cool speaker and potentially a great business opportunity. The only thing I can think of to improve would be timing. It would be less stressful if we had a week or two more to work on the final project.",
    "The strengths of this course was the content (projects and lectures). There was such a wealth of knowledge and expertise to draw upon. The projects also allowed us to hone our technical skills and think more creatively. The presentation at the end was a fitting culmination of our work. It was also rewarding to see our efforts showcased. The only recommendation I have is that the schedule for the speaker project in the beginning seemed a bit disorganized."

   "comments": [
    "Yes yes yes!",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in startups, entrepreneurship, Software or hardware design, take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You learn a ton, and it's really fun. Be advised that the workload at the end of the semester is intense.",
    "YES! If you can get it, I definitely recommend taking the class! Be warned that it can be a lot of work in the second half and I do suggest that you start brainstorming project ideas early on.",
    "Yes",
    "I cannot recommend this course enough, to engineers or scientists or designers or anyone with an inkling of interest in entrepreneurship and product design. It is a unique opportunity to create a product or service in a structured course, with great resources and advice throughout the process. I have learned more applicable real world skills than perhaps any other course in my time at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It requires lots of time, but you put in what you get out.",
    "YES, YES, 100% YES. Best course of my entire Yale career.",
    "Yes, I think anybody regardless of major would have a good time in this class. Joe makes it really interesting for everybody, not only engineers. If you can get into this class, take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student that has an interest in product  design or entrepreneurship. I learned so so much from Joe as well as our guest lecturers and loved working with my team to develop our product. (Plus you get to make and bring home your own bluetooth speaker which is just so sick).",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. It is a great opportunity to get acquainted to Yale's many resources, meet entrepreneurs, and pursue your own project. The group of students in the course were driven and fun to get to know, and Professor Zinter is extremely knowledgeable and a great person to get feedback and input from."
