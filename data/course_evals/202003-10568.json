                "I was able to gain a much broader knowledge of classical and jazz music in general with the exposure to all the classic composers. Prof. Skorupa's detailed feedback on papers also significantly helped me improve my writing skills. The works we read, listened to, and watched were also incredible.",

                "This course greatly broadened my understanding of classical music and its connections with literature. Through lots of interesting readings from Ovid to Toni Morrison, combined with program music, films, lieder, and more, we explored the incredible power of music and the beautiful intermedialities between music, literature, art, and dance. The course also allowed me to improve my writing and close reading, as I received detailed feedback on each of my papers.",
                "I gained an insight into music's unmatched role in literature throughout the centuries as well as the skills to take on other literature courses at Yale.",
                "I developed new knowledge about classical music, literature, and art. After taking this course, I learned how to analyze and close read texts, music, and paintings. Through these close analysis readings, I discovered new insights about the purpose and meaning behind famous works by composers, authors, and artists. These insights led me to think more about the similarities and differences between the past and present to ultimately discover that classical work influences most of today's modern music and literature."

            "comments": [
                "One of the best qualities of this class was the interdisciplinary nature of the course. We looked at so much: from visual art, to short stories and novels, to poetry, and to orchestral music and opera. It was stimulating to look at all these mediums and analyze them in different ways. Also, the way that Professor Skorupa organizes papers (with an initial then final draft) allows you to get a ton of feedback on your writing and gives you plenty of opportunity to improve. One of the biggest weaknesses was the amount of reading. Since we read so much material in the class, there is a lot of reading, and oftentimes in class we wouldn't even get to all of it. I think if the professor had trimmed down the syllabus a bit, we could've had more detailed and fruitful discussions of the material, rather than skimming through.",
                "Prof Skorupa is one of the kindest, most accommodating professors I've had. Especially given COVID, the uncomfortable transition to online learning, and the stressful election week, she was very flexible with deadlines and always gave us as much help as we needed.",
                "I got a lot of practice with writing and received a good amount of feedback for each of my pieces. I also learned a huge amount about both music and literature from the extremely varied readings we were assigned. The essay topics are also completely open, so you can essentially write about anything that relates to the assigned readings. This can be seen as a good or bad thing depending on how well you can come up with essay topics on your own. I do not think there were too many weaknesses, except perhaps certain works we read could be discussed more, although this might take away from the variety and amount of works we read. There was also a lot of reading assigned each week (sometimes an entire book in a week), but there were also very light weeks during busy times (common midterm weeks).",
                "Strengths: The interaction that is within the course is simply unmatched in any other Yale Course. Professor Skorupa is such a fantastic professor who radiates her love for the subject to all her students. Weaknesses: None.",
                "Professor Skorupa is incredible, and her enthusiasm for music and literature inspired all of us. Class discussions were always interesting and insightful, and I felt that I was part of a wonderful community of first years with similar musical interests. However, while I enjoyed all of the readings, some of the works we looked at did not seem to be particularly relevant to the course. In addition, since there is quite a large quantity of reading, we were not able to fully discuss all of the works that we studied. Overall, I greatly enjoyed the course, and the film screenings, field trips, and class concerts were incredible experiences as well.",
                "Strengths: lively discussions, amazing teacher, just the right amount of challenging assignments, very understanding teacher, great pieces of literature, wonderful and interesting guests from YUAG, the library, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
                "The strengths of this course are that it is a small seminar so most of the discussion allows for everyone to have a chance to share their own input. Also, the course has a wide variety of learning experiences ranging from movies, music, readings, and even chances to talk to composers and art curators. There are not many weaknesses I can currently think of that need to be improved."

                "Zoom tends to lend itself surprisingly well to a discussion-style class, especially by allowing students to mute and unmute so they can speak one at a time to add input to a conversation.",
                "I think overall, this course was successful in including remote and on-campus students. Sometimes, when the on-campus students would meet outside or a few students would meet in a classroom, I (as a remote student) would feel a bit left out. This did not take away from the learning though.",
                "Zoom breakout rooms to aid smaller discussion were terrific during the Covid-19 Pandemic, it allowed students to truly speak and voice their materials that we had covered for homework or in previous classes.",
                "Although they can never compare with the live experience, the virtual film screenings and field trips were organized well and were as successful as they could have been. We also met for an in-person class once on Cross Campus, but the fact that some of our classmates were remote students made the class difficult to organize. The virtual class concert at the end of the semester was really fun and a great way to end the course.",
                "Wonderful engagement of students through Zoom that made students want to participate in class",
                "The course succeeded overall based on the the current COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the discussion from readings were able to occur over zoom easily due to the seminar and discussion format. Also, the extra film screenings were able to succeed most of the time due to the ability to screen share and for the class to watch the movie all at one time. Although the movies would lag at times, they were still functional and able to be seen without much interruption. Despite a lack of in-person contact, the zoom calls and small class allowed for the course to be engaging and for all students to get a chance to discuss their ideas. There are not many practices that need to be improved because most the issues revolve around technology errors."

Professor Skorupa is a great teacher, and she designs her curriculum in a way that will broaden your knowledge of fine art. I can't recommend this course enough.",

However, if you have absolutely no background in music or do not already appreciate classical music, some of the material may be difficult to understand and the readings and other homework may seem a bit boring by nature.",
                "If you would like to improve in writing, while focusing on the topic of music, I definitely recommend this course.

                "Yes! This would definitely be a great class for someone who is familiar with music theory or just appreciates classical and jazz music. This is a great class to take if you want to improve your writing skills while writing about something that interests you!",

In addition to lots of interesting ideas about music and literature, the course provides an incredible community of musical first years. The course is also a good choice for anyone looking to improve their writing skills.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. If you are interested or want to learn more about the topic of the course then definitely shop or take this course. The extra time spent out of class with movie screenings and activities can be a lot, but they are definitely worth it and allow for more insight and applying what you learn from the course to more modern examples outside of a book or classroom. The professor is flexible with scheduling for the class and is responsive to any questions or concerns that come up during the year. Overall, I would recommend this course!"
