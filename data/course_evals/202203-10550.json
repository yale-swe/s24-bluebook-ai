We discussed the application of these ideas to the actions taken by our armed forces. We also discussed how Yale and Yale students have been involved with the navy and served and sacrificed in multiple wars. Furthermore, we learned the history of our navy and how the navy enforced American strategies both in peacetime and war time. We delivered presentations and had discussions about these themes.",

Sometimes I got lost in the history because I'm not familiar with technical naval terminology, but that was prerequisite information that I should've learned on my own. Maybe a navy-kowledge-101 packet would've been helpful to start."

                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in naval history and war theories, grand strategy, etc.. You have to be wiling to do the reading to learn and be able to do some thick historical readings. The context of knowing the navy (ie. naval technical terminology) can add a small but manageable challenge, and sometimes learning the details of battles isn't exciting (though it really depends on your interests). However, the class itself isn't hard at all if you put in some effort and approach it with a positive attitude. We also did a joint class with Air Force ROTC led by John Lewis Gaddis, who is a legend. Capt. Withrow himself is wonderful - he is kind, understanding, positive, and helpful. Plus, taking a course with Yale's NROTC midshipmen is both an honor and a pleasure! The perspective I gained here was unmatched. I had a blast.",
