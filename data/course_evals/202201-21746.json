                "I learned a massive amount about Egyptian religion, as well as theology and ontology in general. It helped me learn how to look critically at historical art, architecture, and archealogical evidence and gain major insight into systems of thought and religion."

                "This was a great course overall and I learned a lot. However, sometimes the lectures could feel a little disjointed. It was hard to organize the material in a way that made sense in my notes. This was not as bad as it could have been because Professor Darnell was very clear about what subjects he would ask us about on tests and quizzes, which allowed us to focus on the specific things we knew would be asked, but some kind of concept map or just a clearer way to relate everything would have helped the big picture make more sense.",
                "The course is only limited by its rather broad scope in terms of the many years and beliefs it has to cover in a short semester.",
                "Strengths include Professor Darnell and the hands on lectures. Weaknesses include the pace of the course, some lectures with extra\/unimportant information, and at times unclear writing expectations.",
                "Discussions were in-depth and intriguing. We did not have time to cover everything in the syllabus, but what was covered was enjoyable.",
                "The organization of the class was a bit difficult to understand at times, but for the most part it was very easy to understand the general flow of the class."

                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Egyptology with the possible caveat that you will enjoy it much more if you already have a bit of a background in the subject. I do, but can imagine that someone who hasn't encountered Egyptology outside of children's books could be confused about some of the terminology, locations, etc. However, it's a great class with only a few exams and assignments, and Professor Darnell is an incredibly engaging and interesting lecturer, so going to class is always very fun.",
                "I would certainly recommend it to another Yale student. It is very interesting to journey through the timeline of religious belief in Ancient Egypt. The class is well organized and thought out.",
                "I would recommend this course! Professor Darnell is a wonderful lecturer and knows just about everything you could ask him. The readings are longish but interesting, and the essays are very fair. If you have an Egyptology base it will be helpful, but if you have just a general interest in Egyptology take this course!",
                "Yes, this course is a good exploration of ancient Egyptian religion.",
                "Yes, absolutely."
