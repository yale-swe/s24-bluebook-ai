                "I greatly broadened my knowledge of both the ideas of the \"community-engaged theater\" field (and learned about the limitations and contestations of that term) and became familiar with a slew of different organizations that offer different models for thinking and practicing in that field.",
                "I gained a better understanding of the history of American community engaged theater and the Boal tradition.",
                "I learned about the history of community engaged theater, how it is implemented today, and many of the pitfalls of community engaged projects. We got to speak with several theatremakers, mostly based in New Haven, about their experiences with community engaged theater. Because each student explored their own interests for the final project, I also learned about a wide variety of topics from final presentations.",
                "Introduction to community engaged theater practice and theories.",
                "This course exposes you to the works of great drama theorists and canonical texts like Augusto Boal's Theater of the Oppressed. It forces you to synthesize past and present, from the ideas of Aristotle on the Greek tragedy to that of W.E. DuBois and Black theater in order to fully understand the political power of theater to educate, empower, heal, and even indoctrinate. The course pushes you out of your comfort zone with different exercises, it challenges you to think in new ways about how you approach both theater-making and theater-consumption.",
                "I learned about the history, practice, and forms of community-engaged theater and performance. I gained a lot of insight into the space of performance as an intersection of different forces (performer, creator, audience, society), and had a great opportunity to interrogate my own practices and goals in theater.",

                "Strengths: Shilarna!! Really interesting and relevant material, flexible syllabus, final project that lets you study whatever interests you. Weaknesses: None? The syllabus kinda got thrown out a month in, but I think we were all okay with that.",
                "It is hard to answer this question because we did not follow the syllabus at all. Sometimes, it felt like we were not taking the class but that we were just meeting once a week to discuss some themes of community engaged theater. I wish there was more structure, and that even if assignments changed, we received more information and guidance.",
                "Professor Stokes's teaching is a core strength of the course; she's rigorous, generous, and deeply thoughtful about how her students are engaging with the course. If I had to name areas for improvement, I might suggest more opportunities to engage with the work of the visiting artists/companies. If we could watch videos of their performances before the class, for example, it might deepen the discussion.",
                "The content was really interesting and led me to think critically about the ways I engage with theater, at Yale and in the future. Shilarna was deeply invested in each students' interest and gave us a lot of feedback and engagement with our work, particularly our final projects. The course was not very organized however, much of which was due to COVID leading to guest speakers cancelling last minute. We would often get our reading assignments the night before class, which made it challenging to balance with other coursework.",
                "Strengths: Shilarna. Shilarna is an absolutely incredible instructor and an amazing person; her teaching of this class convinced me to remain involved with theater at Yale, just with a new direction. The guest speakers. We had a zoom call with the Palestinian Freedom Theatre and it was hands down the most impactful classroom experience I've had in my time at Yale to date. The assignments. The assigned readings were always super interesting and thought-provoking, offering new information you wouldn't likely encounter in any other context. The recorded group discussions allowed for bonding with other classmates, the final project really allowed you to tap into your creativity and tackle subjects that matter to you most.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "I think it is true to say that this course is covering content that is being taught nowhere else in TAPS, perhaps in all of Yale. That is a shame because CETP is one of the most important subjects I have engaged with. For improvements, I think this course could have benefited from more class time. We were able to have a lot of conversation and practice a few techniques, but I think with more time in class we really could have developed some of the techniques we discussed.",
                "Loved everything about the course. Would perhaps have liked for a more hands on aspect in regards to some of the methods we read about."

                "Yes - there is not another class at Yale like this. Community engaged theater is an intersection of performance and politics that doesn't get talked about enough, and the class was composed of a great group of people that sparked a lot of interesting discussions. It never felt like a \"super serious\" Yale class despite the serious subject material, and I learned so much in that environment.",
                "If this class were more structured, I think Professor Stokes has a lot to share on the subject, but in the way the class was taught this semester, I did not get anything out of it.",
                "Absolutely. I think it offers a lot (particularly, a generous and caring community in which to discuss!) to anyone who wants to learn about the subject.",
                "I recommend this course to any student interested in understanding contemporary performance work in communities.",
                "If you are looking to change your perspective on who theater should serve and how to ethically engage with communities using the arts, this is a great place to learn about those things and discuss challenging questions. Especially if you are looking to learn more about the arts and community work in New Haven, this course exposes you to projects that Yale students would likely not know about.",
                "absolutely! whether or not you are a theater major, the course is an excellent way to learn about community theater both through the professor and allows for students to share independent interests/ideas with the class",
                "Absolutely. It was the one class this semester that I was able to look forward to every week. Shilarna cultivates a really safe, warm environment and somehow manages to make 2+ hours feel like 2 minutes.",
                "YES! This class changed how I think about theater. It changed how I think about community. It changed how I think about the world. Shilarna is incredible, and the content of this course is essential. Sometimes it could be a little chaotic, but always in ways that resulted in us doing less work to focus on what was meaningful. If you're at all interested in making theater, take this course!!!",
                "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in producing a creative project that is rooted in some way in a community/culture. But really I would recommend it to anyone who is producing any kind of project."
