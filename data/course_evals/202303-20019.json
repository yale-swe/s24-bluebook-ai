Additionally, you delve into intriguing questions of what constitutes a frontier, ethnicity, and nation. Overall, it was a step towards understanding a critically overlooked area.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Gyatso is as kind as he is funny as he is brilliant. He is so knowledgeable within his field and so compassionate to his students, especially including those who don't necessarily have a background in Tibetanology or East Asian Studies. The readings were interesting and brilliantly written, even if slightly long and usually extremely dense.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is an upper-level course. I would not recommend it to anyone lacking knowledge of Chinese history and\/or culture. As someone without this background, I was often lost during class discussions as they often veered away from the reading into complex topics relatively inaccessible to people without out-of-class knowledge. Grading was also slightly opaque, with feedback sometimes being slightly difficult to follow.",
                "Strengths: diverse topics, interesting readings, student-led discussions, manageable workload, passionate professor\r\nWeaknesses: A condensed overview of the history\/location\/culture discussed in each week's readings the week before\/at the start of the session would've helped to contextualize. It felt like we dived right into extremely specific tribes\/regions\/kingdoms\/leaders when most of the class had zero prior knowledge of Tibet\/Xinjiang\/Mongolia so it was easy to get lost\/overwhelmed by unfamiliar names.",
                "Stengths: A very comprehensive overview of the various ethnic groups and subgroups within these regions, instructor is extremely knowledgeable about the topic\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Material can be hard to understand sometimes",
                "The only weakness' in the course were mine. The strengths were the Professors excellent communication and kind demeanor. Asking a question, no matter how simple, was easy and encouraged. Professor Gyatso's knowledge of the region and its various cultures and their histories is expansive. His organization of the course was excellent and he responded quickly to any questions or issues, This was a class I looked very much forward to every week.",
                "The readings of the course were well selected and exposed students to literature from a different part of the world than is typically studied in Yale social studies classes. Discussions allowed for free thought in a supportive environment. One weakness is that sometimes the class discussions were unstructured, so it might help to have planned questions to guide conversations and avoid tangents."

                "If you have a cultural or academic background in China\/East Asia, yes. If not, take at least a EAST course before taking this class, you'll get much more out of it that way.",
                "Yes! This is one of the only classes, to my knowledge, specifically on the Chinese frontier that Yale has offered. It is an incredibly fascinating area on the brink of great change in the next few years. Every student should be learning about these populations\/countries that are at increasing risk of erasure. Plus, the associated cultures are rich with tradition. Gyatso is a fantastic professor with an enormous well of knowledge on the subject. The readings are interesting to read and the discussions raise potent questions about nationhood. It was great to see artifacts and witness the stories mentioned in class come to life during the field trip to the Met and Rubin in NYC.",
                "Yes. This class does very important work in highlighting the richness of the histories of these subgroups in China, and compel you to think critically about the narratives that you see today.",
                "I would most certainly recommend this course, or any other taught by Professor Gyatso. The information I digested was exceptionally useful in framing my relatively ignorant view of the region.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in thinking critically and thoughtfully about China, Xinjiang, and Tibet and their religious and ethnic dynamics more than just what we read in the news today. The course is very eyeopening and while the papers can be challenging given their depth, it is a rewarding class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if they are interesting in learning more about ethnic conflicts, through the lens of Chinese history."
