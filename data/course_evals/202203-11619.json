                "Historical films are a surprisingly complex beast! I came into this class knowing that these films existed, and now understand the pitfalls and choices directors have to make along the way in order to find a balance between a fun story and being historically accurate. This course thrived on in class discussion, which was usually split 50/50 readings and the movie we watched. I also was exposed to historical films that were NOT us-focused, which was a nice change of pace and allowed me to broaden my horizons.",
                "Greater understanding of film, history, and historical films.",
                "i learned several arguments and types of analysis of historical films and how history is told through movies.",
                "This course covered film theory and debates in historiography as seen through films. The main \"skill\" was learning how to essentially \"close-read\" scenes from a movie or directorial choices.",
                "I learned not only how to critically analyze film, but also to put vastly different periods and historical events in conversation through discussing different films. Each person in the class had different takeaways from each movie we watched, and talking about similarities we saw in the events covered or how to movie was shot, written, or paced allowed me to see how narrative filmmaking can both add to and complicate history. It is a newer medium for portraying stories, so learning how to analyze film with my classmates helped me understand the content better, too.",

                "The course format was very good, and I liked having the longer form discussions (a few even would be mentioned in my three papers!).\r\nWeakness: paper turn around time could drag on, but we did get them before the two major academic deadlines (drop/c-d-f).",
                "This course covered a wide variety of histories, making it very interesting and exciting.",
                "I think the main strengths are the ways in which the texts we read work with the readings. They all allow us to interrogate what we're watching andlook at specific elements of certain films in order to analyze how they are portraying hsitory.",
                "Strengths: Syllabus was wide-ranging and thoughtfully constructed; professor was very accessible and gave dedicated feedback\r\nWeaknesses: Discussions tended to be all over the place; course could have included more films covering non-European history",
                "I felt that this course was full of strengths. One of my favorite things was the inclusion of \"La Jete\" in the syllabus, which gave the students a chance to draw distinction between historical and non-historical film. I also like how the course was not organized chronologically in terms of the content of the movies we watched, but instead by filmmaking technique such as anachronism or documentary.",

                "Yes! If you are a history student, this is a fun way to diversify your course load while still learning about history. If you are a film student, this is a fantastic way to expand your historical knowledge about film/learn more about films based on historical moments.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone new to film analysis and/or interested in exploring the \"philosophy of history\" / debates in historiography through a different medium from other history courses which have heavy reading loads",
                "I have already recommended this course to some of my friends. It is great for those interested in history to look at a newer form of communicating history, that most classes don't focus on as much, and also looks more at how we record, translate, and share history, as opposed to the chronological and contingent storytelling of many courses. Its more of a historiography class, which I really enjoyed, and feel that most history majors could benefit from. It is also really fun to bring our own favorite media and film into conversation with the pieces we saw, and I feel I got to know my classmates better through what they brought up in class.",
