                "I expanded my abilities in the Chinese language-- in particular, my writing and reading skills were greatly improved. As someone who has heard a lot of Chinese from my parents, my listening/comprehension skills were far better than my reading/writing skills as I entered the class, so there was inherently more room for improvement in those areas. Going into the class, I couldn't even recognize some of the most fundamental characters, but towards the end of the semester, I was able to read long passages while understanding around 80-90% of the characters, which was a significant improvement. I was also able to handwrite a much wider range of characters-- I was surprised by my ability to remember how to handwrite the majority of the characters during the writing portion of the test, which I could never have even come close to doing before taking this course.",
                "I increased my Chinese vocabulary, knowledge of the culture, and learned some new study habits.",

                "The course was structured well and was very organized, so it was clear what the assignments and course schedule was for each day. I thought the workload was just the right amount and the exams were very fair as well. The exams and homework helped to build upon concepts taught in class. I think one way the course could be improved is to have a student's speaking ability count within the examination score, perhaps through a separate oral exam/presentation, as the current exams emphasize listening, reading, and writing the most.",
                "I really like how much variety the course has-- whether it's reading exercises, essay projects, presentations, and more, there are so many different avenues to improving my Chinese ability, which always keeps my brain engaged. I also really appreciated Professor Xu's teaching style, as she gets everyone engaged during class time. For example, her randomly calling on students helped me stay focused during class time, as I always had to be ready to answer a question if prompted to do so-- this made it impossible to \"tune out\" the class, like I would be able to in other classes that don't involve as much participation. In addition, the highlighting of vocabulary and structural words in her presentations also helped me recognize and notice specific grammatical structures in the readings, which I otherwise may have overlooked. \r\n\r\nA weakness was that much of the work still felt like \"manual labor\" (particularly writing practice) due to the repetitive nature of memorizing characters-- however, I don't think this is necessarily the result of how the class was taught, and rather the general rule when it comes to learning languages.  Finally, it was a little hard to tell exactly where I stood in the class, given the wide variety of assignments-- in other classes, it was very easy to calculate my current grade/standings, because they were largely dependent on a few large tests, but in Chinese, it was hard to know exactly where I was. It may have helped if there was some way to \"check in\" regarding my general grade/standing, so I could know exactly how well I was doing.",

If you want to improve your Chinese skills, definitely take this course. I felt like each lesson built upon the next well and I enjoyed the class discussions as well. The class was very interactive.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to learn a language-- while it was certainly rigorous, I felt that I learned significant amounts of Chinese as well, and the value was worth the amount of work I had to put in. It would depend on how dedicated/passionate the student is about learning, however, as I feel that a lot of the value comes from the student's end.",
