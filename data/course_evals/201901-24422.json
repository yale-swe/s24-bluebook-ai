    "Developed an understanding of the complexities of advanced Spanish grammar, practiced reading, writing, some listening, and some speaking in Spanish and developed these skills through a variety of methods, including through long and short compositions on a variety of interesting culture, literature, and contemporary subjects, through reading and comprehension assignments and rote review worksheets, through watching movies with authentic Spanish, and more."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Because there are so many assignments and so many different ways to practice grammar, the course does a good job of helping you see measurable results and improvement in your command of Spanish grammar. The instructor, T. Seymour was amazing and incredibly understanding and helpful, and she was great at conveying the complexities of Spanish grammar effectively. Although grammar can get repetitive, this is the only Spanish class I've taken where I've remained engaged and excited because of the variety of methods of learning as well as because of the great instructor.\r\nWeaknesses: The course has a lot of small assignments and it can be easy to get them done without putting in a lot of effort, but you can really get a lot more out of the class if you do the reading and take a bit more time to do the assignments thoroughly and make sure you understand. Other weaknesses are that ultimately the course is what it is, a grammar course, and it's just not going to be the most interesting class you'll take by a long shot, but it does a really great job for what it is, which I really appreciated and enjoyed. Another weakness -- there was very very little focus on vocabulary, which is something I would have liked more of."

    "I would highly recommend this course if grammar is your weak spot when it comes to Spanish and you want to get a lot of practice and improvement in that area. There was no really big focus on vocabulary, so if you're looking to expand your vocabulary you may need to work on that outside of this course. Overall, though, I would recommend this as a good L5 course -- i personally already fulfilled my L5 requirement before taking this course but chose to take another L5 because I didn't feel as though I had the command of the language that I wanted, and I'm really glad I chose to take this course because I learned a lot and enjoyed it as well."
