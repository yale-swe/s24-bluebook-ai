                "I think there could be a better introduction to R and how to use it at the beginning of the course, but everything beyond an intro was explained very well.",
                "I enjoyed the course! I learned a lot from it. I think that it was sometimes difficult to focus during 3+ hour lectures, but that definitely wasn't the fault of the instructor.",
                "Weaknesses- No R taught in lecture. Tests were not directly about the material covered so one did not need to study the course material much. Few psets to check progress and understanding.",
                "The instructor seemed to actively discourage students getting feedback. The homeworks, while nominally graded, were actually just spot checked for completeness. Since they have a policy of dropping the lowest homework grade, I submitted only half of the assignment on the final problem set but still received a 100% - nice for me, but clearly indicates a problem on the instructor's end. With the quizzes, they avoided telling us which questions we got right or wrong, and instead only released our quiz scores.\r\n\r\nThe midterm was slightly more difficult than anticipated, and the final dramatically more difficult. They covered topics that were never discussed in class in the name of \"learning something new\". But the exams are not the time to learn something new - that's much more appropriate for the actual lectures. The exams were also overly verbose and sometimes unclear, adding to the difficulty without actually testing understanding.",
                "Strengths: Vitor is a great professor\r\nWeaknesses: 3 hour fifteen minute online lectures were too long and combining 2-3 lectures per class wasnt the best breakdown",
                "I really enjoyed how this course was taught using real-world applications of the methods we learned in class. They both enhanced my understanding by showing me how economists use statistical tools and also taught me a thing or two about each specific topic we examined. I thought the pace of the course was perfectly fine, but I would have liked to see more R instruction in class. While the essential commands were for the most part covered in lecture, we were mostly left to learn how to code on our own. Although I was always able to figure it out in the end using the internet (and I gather that this is how coding often goes), it could at times be frustrating.",
                "The grading distribution can be approved. You had to get a 100 to get an A which is not fair",
                "Strengths: Vitor was a fantastic instructor. Clearly cared about his students and was eager to help whenever and however possible. Weaknesses: Shorter lectures spread out across the week instead of having two, three-hour lectures per week would have probably improved engagement and comprehension. The material felt a little overwhelming at times, though at no fault of the instructor.",
                "Not have take home tests for 48 hours, maybe just do it the normal way and test you on the material at hand.",
                "ummI think it should give more exercises",
                "Some strengths were learning a lot of topics in a short time span and getting accustomed to self-learning new concepts. One weakness was that the curve was extremely harsh."
