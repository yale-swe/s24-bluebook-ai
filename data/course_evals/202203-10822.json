The videos put on the website are the saving grace, and the Ximera modules are super helpful. The problem sets are also so different than the actual exams and take so long to do and are weighed so little to the point where it is frustrating. Even the peer tutors said they remember how difficult this class was when it doesn't have to be. The psets could be weighed a bit more because they genuinely take a really long time to do and be tailored to be more similar to the actual practice exams. I understand it is a really big blanket prerequisite for so many majors but it was just frustrating because it was a poorly taught and designed classes.\r\n\r\nStrengths: the additional videos, the practice modules on Ximera, and the peer tutors (esp. Emily--she's incredible and better at explaining than my teacher).",
