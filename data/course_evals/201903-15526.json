    "Everything about Black feminism is so important, and it now informs my thinking.",
    "We learned about the history of Black Feminist Theory in an intentionally intersectional and transnational approach.",
    "This course gives a very strong overview of works that are foundational to black feminism as we know it today.",
    "I learned a lot about the genealogy of black feminist theory. Skill-wise, I developed the skill of summarizing texts rather than just critiquing them, which changed the way I read in order to really understand how each author was making their argument.",
    "This course taught me the framework and attributes of Black Feminist Theory. It helped me improve my close reading skills, my writing skills, and the ability to make connections between seemingly different aspects of the universe.",
    "A new method for reading and discussing readings.\r\n\r\nAn introduction to Black feminist theory that showed its essential nature to good praxis.",
    "So many new (to me) ways of being in the world. How interlocking systems of oppression work, what they have to do with my life, what my life has to do with other lives, how we might work together to build something better."

   "comments": [
    "The class was great. Roderick Ferguson knew what he was doing and helped everyone understand the texts for what they were. Gavriel was also a great presence in the class.",
    "Rod is amazing at facilitating discussions. The readings and comparison papers are useful exercises in seeing how the different topics we're discussing come together.",
    "strengths: the instructor, the readings \r\nweakness: none",
    "The only weakness was that there was not prompt or super helpful responses to our assignments. Sometimes we didn't get any responses at all. With that said, the assignments really helped me better understand the material.",
    "The readings were designed to be manageable, the assignments to be personally useful, and the seminars to be thoroughly text-based and inclusive. I have nothing to complain about."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this class to another student. Black feminist theory is so important, so much more important than the western canon of political philosophy.",
    "Omg yes! You will learn so much, and learn how to think creatively and critically. Rod's white hat\/yellow hate\/green hat\/black hat system is helpful in understanding difficult texts, but also how we can apply these ideas and methodologies to other content areas. There's a lot of space for creativity in this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in wgss or just social movements in general.",
    "Yes! It is so important I think.",
    "Yes! The readings are great and Ferguson is a wonderful professor.",
    "TAKE ANY AND EVERY COURSE WITH PROFESSOR FERGUSON THAT YOU CAN!  I took this course because after the first meeting I knew it would be vital not just for my Yale years but for my life. This has proven truer than I could have imagined. Taking this course was like seeing for the first time.",
    "Absolute would recommend this course, particularly to women of color who rarely have the opportunity to take a course in which their writings and sights are centered and critically engaged with in such an illuminating way. No other class I have taken in my first three years at Yale featured as many WOC writers and it really made such a difference in my learning that I am really grateful for.",
    "Yes, especially if you are Black.",
    "Absolutely. 100%. Yes.",
    "I love this course and Rod Ferguson so much."
