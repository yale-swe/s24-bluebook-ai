                "I learned about the sustainability of international aid, Haiti's history, and we read two great literary pieces on the country.",

                "I learned how to express my thoughts in a discussion-type setting. I also learned about how Haiti's socioeconomic landscapes have changed and been influenced by many different factors, such as international relations and natural disasters.",
                "I learned a lot about Haiti and all the culture there.",
                "I learned to read carefully and piece large topics together in preparation for cumulative discussions. I also learned to confidently present and lead my classmates without using technology or the professor as a crutch. Lastly, I learned to write confidently about the things that interest me and to see my writing as a process of constant improvement.",

                "I gained insights into the history and culture of Haiti. Moreover, this course challenged me to write a research paper where I was able to seek the intersectionality between game theory and natural resource management, specific to the case study of Haiti's rural communities.",
                "I developed a comprehensive perspective on Haiti, a country that I knew almost nothing about before taking this course. I learned about, researched, and discussed the complex and diverse approaches to sustainable development.",

                "Given that this was my first semester at Yale, this course introduced me to college education. The manageable readings gave me the ability to learn how to manage my school work. Also, Gordon did well in each class at ensuring we were engaging in instructive seminar discussion. Further, the final paper taught me what not to do in terms of time management because I procrastinated an entire 12 page paper to a couple of days."

                "A weakness would be that a lot of the courses were dictated by one student and it felt like it was just a lot of answering questions and not really that much free flowing conversation.\r\nStrengths are that there is so much to learn.",
                "I loved learning ,in depth, about the many environment and cultural difficulties facing Haiti.",

                "I really liked the design of this course.",
                "This course relied a lot on self-learning outside the classroom, which was difficult to navigate at first. I believe more in-class instruction will be useful.",
                "I liked the seminar aspect of this course.",
                "I think the varied materials and seminar presentation style of this course are very strong. I think it encourages students to take an active role in their learning. That being said, I think sometimes the discussions fell a little bit silent because of the student led format. Yet, silence is not always a bad thing and it taught me to pivot and be more creative to engage with my peers.",
                "I really enjoyed the guest speaker who came to one of our classes. Bringing in more Haitian guests could be beneficial.",
                "Some strengths are that the course allows you to learn about a variety of topics and you get to pick what you learn.",
                "One thing I would improve is a little more guidance on how to write a college level paper.",
                "Strengths: Professor's attention to detail and investment in each student's growth and success, ability to cover a breadth of topics in a short period of time, engagement\r\n\r\nAreas of Improvement: More curricular connection to current events in Haiti",
                "This course is very engaging and collaborative in which students took on major roles in teaching their peers about their \"expertise topic\" and research findings.",
                "My strengths for this class was my writing however, I lack class participation.",
                "Strengths: It has a very manageable course load. Most of the readings are assigned by the students and the seminars are led by student lectures each class so the material is not hard at all. The professor is very kind and understanding when it comes to constructive criticism and leeway on deadlines. The assignments are VERY manageable and the material itself is very intriguing if you engage with it fully. You truly get what you put into this course though\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Student engagement is not always the best. I think a lot of students (me included at times) considered this class a gut and did not put there most effort into the readings. This resulted in discussions that weren't always the most constructive or colorful because students were just saying things for participation credit."

Gordon taught us many of the foundational skills of a Yale College education like close reading, creative and analytical writing, and discussion and presentation, through the nuanced lens of Haiti, its history, and its future. I feel thoroughly prepared to attack my future courses with the academic and interpersonal skills I learned in this course. It was a perfect way to start my Yale career.",

                "I would HIGHLY recommend this course to another student. The material is very interesting and never gets dull. You essentially view Haiti through all aspects of its development and get to learn so much about the nation. The workload of the course is not difficult and I would even go as far as saying easy because of how enjoyable it was. Although, I cannot stress enough that the benefits of this course resides in the effort you put in. You can choose to see this course as an easy A and coast through. But if you do you won't get the benefits of truly learning about Haiti gain the benefit of applying what you learned to better understand other sustainable development issues in the world."
