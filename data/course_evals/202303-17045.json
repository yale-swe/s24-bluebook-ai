                "Topics related to imperialism, capitalism, colonialism, and biocolonialism",
                "I felt like most of this class was independent study so most of what I learned came from my own personal research for my final project.

                "Though my engagement with the course was high, a good portion of the classroom's engagement was relatively low -- this is nothing against them, but definitely speaks to how to better facilitate discussion in a seminar setting. Seminars are meant to be vibrant discussions, and it is tough when the same few people speak up because nobody else is. \r\n\r\nStrengths included the breadth of information and the hugely diverse array of global and historical perspectives we get to engage with from new lenses.",
                "strength: readings are interesting for the most part, prof okihiro is lovely and cultivates a pretty warm seminar vibe\r\nweakness: readings are long and can be pretty dense and academic (non-humanities perspective)",
                "Strengths - lots of great reading and carefully curated content\r\nWeaknesses - a lot of people didn't attend class regularly or engage in discussion which made it hard to feel like discussions were productive",
                "The way the syllabus is structured is amazing. Every week had a slew of interesting readings that allowed me to stay engaged in the course.",
                "strength  Professor, readings",
                "Strengths: most readings/material was very interesting, Professor Okihiro is very knowledgeable and supportive\r\nWeaknesses: readings were very dense/difficult to understand sometimes, class discussion felt unstructured at times",
                "The readings are very interesting, but a lot to get through in a week. Prof. Okihiros short lectures at the beginning of class were great. Sometimes the discussion felt a little directionless.",
                "Strengths are that the Prof is very kind and considerate in terms of communication and that if you are really interested in the topics of this course you have an opportunity to delve deep into your own research for the entire semester. Weaknesses were that class time was not spent learning much material but discussing independent work or outside material with other students. Lectures were often very cyclical and returned to similar topics weekly with different readings."

                "I would, but beware the weekly reading load. If you really want to get anything out of this class, you will need to engage with the readings and the discussions. There are plenty who sit back and choose not to do the readings or speak in class, and there is no shame in that, but if you really want to take as much out of the course as possible (which you should want to!! it is so interesting!!) it takes a lot of work.",
                "yes definitely! as a non-humanities person, this class was pretty difficult, but i learned a lot and it made me question stuff about the world i hadn't before. the seminar can be a bit one-sided in its leftism (not sure exactly how to word this), but i don't think it hurt the discussions.",

                "Id recommend it. Professor Okihiro is a master in the field and you learn a lot from him",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in learning more about imperialism, land, labor, and fruits.",
                "Yes, but make sure you are motivated to do the readings and engage with the class or you might not learn as much as you hope.",
                "Only if they know they are particularly interested in the topics of this course and have an idea or tentative ideas about independent work that they would like to do related to these topics."
