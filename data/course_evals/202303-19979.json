Craig did a great job of teaching us how to identify what the writers that we were reading were doing well and how to integrate these techniques into our own writing. I also ended up learning a lot about how to write humor effectively which I had never done before and was incredibly fun.",

One way this course could be improved is if there was an upperclassmen seminar. The required revisions are great. They really force you to improve your writing and Craig gives great feedback. As a Junior, I felt like I was approaching the course from a very different perspective than many of my classmates who were just coming out of high school. A lot of english 120 is about processing your life through writing and I feel like my experience could have improved if I had been with a group that I felt was at the same stage of college/life. Also I just has way more writing experience than anybody else, so my starting point was different.",
