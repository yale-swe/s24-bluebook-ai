                "This course helped to develop my knowledge and understanding of developing research projects. I feel equipped to engage in research projects as a primary experimenter. I also learned a great deal about primate ecology.",
                "How to think critically as a scientist. Additionally, the professors include stories abut current practices or challenges in their field and in science in general -- they want to teach all students critical thinking and how to question scientific knowledge and think of their own questions, regardless of their background. Also, by being incredibly open about their own experience as researchers and professors I gained a sense of what it is actually like to work in academia, and how to navigate unspoken aspects of networking and finding opportunities.",
                "I learned so much about what it means to be a scientist in this course. In past Yale science classes I have never been encouraged to truly think about what it means to carry out research.",
                "I learned so much more than what you can capture from the course title. While we did cover many techniques field researchers use to study animal behavior (telemetry, actimetry, census\/surveys, etc.), we discussed and analyzed every step that one must take before using them. By doing so, we covered the fundamentals of experimental design and scientific reasoning. While I thought I had a firm grasp on this subject, the way we discussed them shifted the way I read literature and consider experimental design. Through the readings and class discussions, we go into considerable depth regarding the Owl Monkey Project, the activity patterns and social behavior of owl monkeys themselves, and the fauna of the Humid Chaco region of Argentina.",

                "I thought that this course was really wonderful. I think the assignments were all useful in the culminating final assignment, and I thought the emphasis on student wellbeing and learning were really valuable.",
                "The strengths are: fascinating content, and investigated and engaged professors. The weaknesses are that occasionally the course was disorganized, and the professors spent a little too much time lecturing as opposed to facilitating discussion.",
                "I can think of no weaknesses at this time",
                "The only weakness I can call to mind would be that I wish we met for more than once a week. I felt that the ideas from the readings became far more clear once we began discussing them so another opportunity to do so would have been great. There were also many valuable perspectives and ideas that we mentioned in class alone so there would have likely been some more of this with more class time. Other than that, class ran smoothly with creative, meaningful activities and assignments. Grading was always fair and feedback was quick and useful. The greatest strength of this course was how we were never given any answers, but encouraged to look at the information provided to us, stop working, and start thinking about the proper way to tackle our challenges.",
                "Strengths - course culminates nicely into forming a decent research proposal assuming no prior experience, ideally allowing you to conduct it someday. Two professors gives a second set of eyes to everything. Expectations laid out clearly for each assignment. Hands-on work in observing and measuring behavior with video, telemetry. Work is fairly consistent with 2-3 hours of reading with assignments getting weightier as the semester progresses.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - somewhat misleading course description since essentially the class is dedicated to forming a research proposal regarding owl monkeys at the Argentine Chaco, starting from actually how to observe and measure behavior but then turning essentially into a research tutorial course."

The course questions the mainstream habits of those applying the scientific method and ensures that you are not making the same errors. Beyond this, the course offers valuable practice and points to consider while writing a research proposal along with excellent feedback. For those who are considering wildlife behavioral studies or field studies in general, the methods the class covers can be applied to any organism or environment and introduces students to an interesting ecosystem.",
