    "I about the balance of power historically, and I learned how to apply a balance of power framework to thinking about the world.",
    "In the past, I could never imagine myself writing four 4-page essays within 5 weeks. Now, this course gives me an opportunity to learn that writing essay is not that fearful and it turns out I did progress a lot from the 1st essay to the 4th one. I have never taken any politics class before, so this course really impressed me by elaborating on some basic principles of how Balance of Power influence the international politics and how it can be applied since WWI to current day. I have some very close friends that talk about China's politics all day but I used to lack the capability of commenting cause I really have no idea of whether it is true or not. This course enabled me to think rationally and logically. Instead of being pessimistic about China's rising, I learned that it is more of a system trying to balance. China has no reason to be aggressive and start conquering other country, rather they are trying to use their power to respond to other country's movement, such as the United States.",
    "how the balance of power contributed to the world wars and the cold war",
    "Firstly, we analyze the balance of power from a historical perspective. We follow the timeline of World War I, World War II, Cold War, Post Cold War period. we analyze the shift of balance of power, different school in the study of the balance of power.\r\nSecondly, the assignments of the course require us to think critically. This helps us think a lot during the preparation of the sessions. We do not just receive knowledge, but we also need to have the ability to question the theory and think them from different aspects. This kind of capability is very important for our research and study. \r\nFinally, in this course, we have students from different countries, so we could share different ideas about the same issue. This could broaden our thoughts and study an issue comprehensively.",
    "I gained tools to better learn why states do the things they do and about the intricacies of the international system.",
    "I learned a lot about theorizing and strategy as well as the reasons and logic behind statecraft.",
    "A wider perspective on BoP, with a much better understanding of how military power still plays a huge role in calculations.",
    "This course gave me a comprehensive understanding of the great power history of the twentieth century, as well as of balance of power theory. It also served as a good introduction to international relations, as I had not taken a course in this field before.",
    "A fairly thorough overview of international policy approaches before, during, and after the Cold War that give insight into the concepts of hegemony, balance of power, and international power dynamics in the modern world.",
    "I developed knowledge in regards to the overall impact of how the realist (in regards to international politics) mode of thinking affects decisions of leaders and other relevant government officials in terms of deciding whether or not to go to war, and why countries feel pressured to become involved in wars. I developed insights in regards to political and diplomatic strategies that officials use in order to avoid (or instigate) conflict, and how they utilize alliances to navigate their quest for power and self-interests."

   "comments": [
    "This was a fantastic course. There was less discussion than perhaps might be expected in a seminar, but that was certainly not a bad thing.",
    "This class did a really good job applying some basic principles to actual events. However, it spends a considerable amount of time on explaining World War I and WWII. I feel the most influential period that shapes current situation is post Cold War era so I would really like to spend more time on discussing how current international affairs can be analyzed based on the basic principles.",
    "strengths is that it is very informative and you learn. lot in a short period of time weakness is that sometimes the readings were not mentioned in class",
    "Strengths:\r\nFirstly, the professor uses the method of lecture+seminar. The lectures could help us gain a general idea of the topic and the seminar could let us apply what we have learned and share ideas from different aspects.\r\nSecondly, the professor and Tutor are really glad to help the students. We could reserve office hour to have a deeper discussion and thinking about the issues. And the feedback from the professor and the tutor is always specific and helpful.\r\nThirdly, the assignments are great. The request of the professor cultivates the capability of critical thinking which would help us in future research and study.",
    "I thought the course was very strong and I learned a lot from it, even in the condensed summer form.  A bit more structure around the first paper would be helpful for students who are new to political science.",
    "Most of the course is taught from a western perspective and it could be fruitful to look at how the balance of power impacts and influences non western states",
    "Great lectures, but the questions asked and discussions had were often centered on very simple facts and other things that could be answered by a quick Google search. I would have appreciated discussions focused a bit more on the readings assigned. The professor is very engaging.",
    "This course was amazing! Professor Monteiro is an amazing lecturer and is very knowledgeable about the topics covered. The lectures were interesting and engaging, and both him and our TF Carlos were always available outside of class to ask questions.",
    "My only regret is that I wish we had more time so that we could go more in depth with each week's topics, but overall the course was incredibly well balanced and covered fairly far ground in the time we did have. Course discussions were always engaging, in addition to the excellent selection of readings that made you think critically.",
    "Strengths of the course include the very engaging\/ inspiring professor, who had tremendous knowledge about the course topic and was always willing to engage deeply with students' questions. Weaknesses of the course include that there wasn't enough emphasis on the assigned readings in terms of classroom discussion (we wrote essays about them, but only briefly discussed them in class). The course could have been improved by greater synthesis of the assigned readings with the lecture material. Another way to facilitate improvement would to place less emphasis on past \"balance of power\" examples and more emphasis on modern ones (not just the US\/ China, but also perhaps in the Middle East, in Europe, in Latin America); much of the course was focused on the past rather than the present."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Anyone with any interest in the world around them (and that should be everyone) should take this course. It provides an interesting and important framework for thinking about international relations.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. First, it does not require any background study of political science, which means what you are learning can be immediately used to generate your own thoughts. Secondly, students are coming from all kinds of background. This is to say, you can encounter students that are not only from political science major. You can feel the difference and the depth of thinking other students are generating and then reflect on yourself. It really helps me to improve my own logic. Thirdly, the material that we need to read is not tedious at all. It is very intriguing and reflecting.",
    "yes professor Monteiro is amazing and so smart and really wants you to understand what he is saying",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.\r\nFirstly, the course is a good step for students who want to study politics in the future to have a general idea about it. The course goes through the important history and analyzes it from political aspects.\r\nSecondly, the materials of the course offered by the professor are great. Through these materials, we could get both general and specific knowledge of this major.\r\nThirdly, the class involves students from different countries so it is a perfect opportunity to hear about other's opinion and this would definitely broaden your horizon and thoughts, offering you a deeper thinking direction.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student, regardless of their major, as it really adds a level of understanding of how the world works.  It is very easy to apply what was learned in this course to current events.",
    "Yes I learned a lot of important analytical skills and feel more informed not only about historical events but present day political situations.",
    "Yes. Professor Monteiro is a great instructor and the subject matter is very interesting. You will learn a lot about how the world operates.",
    "The professor is great. The readings are generally interesting. The student energy was negligible--vibe was very different than regular Yale College courses.",
    "Yes! The instruction is great and the topic is very interesting. I am a political science major so I was particularly interested in the material, but other students in the class with different majors also enjoyed it a lot.",
    "Of course, Monteiro is a top-notch professor and the TA, Carlos, was also amazing when it came to office hours and feedback. The course is incredibly engaging, and the material is always relevant and very interesting.",
    "Yes! The professor was quite engaging and the material was extremely interesting\/ relevant to the modern world (especially fascinating was the focus on the US-China relationship now)."
