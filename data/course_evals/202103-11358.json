                "I learned so much in this class -- we read interesting scholarly sources and a few examples of relevant fictional pieces, and our class discussions added new dimensions to what I'd gotten from the readings. Methods-wise, this was by far the most helpful class that I've taken at Yale. We received guidance every step of the way as we kept a fieldnotes journal, conducted a literature review, and ultimately compiled our own data into a mini-ethnography of an online community. At the beginning of the semester, I could have never imagined completing the final ethnography project, much less feeling so proud and in control of my work and ethnographic analysis.",
                "this was my first anthro class so i learned a lot about the field and framework in general! i gained a really unique perspective for thinking about different technologies, what \"technology\" means, and whether there is really a line between technology and culture. this isn't a class to just learn about what new AI is doing; it is a class to think really critically about tech and examine the foundational principles of new inventions.",
                "A wide range of knowledges and skills. This class is a wonderful class for anyone interested in STS/Science and Technology Studies, and gives you the opportunity to explore technology from a variety of angles and spheres (individual relationships to technology, sociotechnical systems, culture, Silicon valley, imagining a tech \"otherwise\", and more). I also learned a LOT about the history and culture and inner workings of Silicon valley from our TA Michelle.",
                "Gained a full view of the impacts of the tech industry. While some of the criticisms of the tech industry felt slightly exaggerated, there is some grain of truth to them.",
                "This course provided a solid introduction to thinking through the vast interconnectedness of technology and culture. The readings are an accessible introduction into using anthropology to dissect these connections. Each class we took a very specific lens to focus our analysis on, which made the class feel structured and \"easy\" to approach."

                "I think the specifics of what kind of writing was to be expected should have been discussed much earlier on.",
                "So many strengths -- engaging readings and discussions, topical (if somewhat terrifying) content about the role of technology in the world today that will linger well beyond the course, excellent professor and TA, thoughtful feedback on assignments, and a great group of peers. No weaknesses are coming to mind except for 8pm deadlines; I would've preferred 11:59pm!",
                "strengths: professor messeri and michelle were super supportive and understanding teachers. they listened attentively to students and treated each student equally regardless of experience with anthropology. having supportive instructors made me want to engage with the class even more.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: not really a weakness but the writing prompts can be kind of abstract and open ended so it took some time to understand what i was supposed to write",
                "strengths: Amazing readings, amazing professor, amazing TA. The readings cover a wide range of case studies of different technologies and their politics, wider systems, or cultural connections. There is a range of anthropological, historical, sociological writing in addition to science-/speculative fiction and mixed media texts. Professor Messeri is very engaging, knowledgeable and enthusiastic, and a good facilitator of discussion. The TA Michelle is very very knowledgeable about Silicon Valley and also gave a great guest lecture. The assessment rubrics are very clear and straightforward, and assessment feedback was very detailed and constructive. I also enjoyed getting to learn more about digital ethnography and ethnographic writing more generally as this was my first anthropology class. weaknesses: Not a weakness per se but because the range of opinions within this class can range from aggressively pro-technology to a very critical perspective, it was sometimes difficult to get to a point in discussion where we were able to really attend to more advanced or detailed critiques of technology because people's starting perspectives were so different. This is understandable and maybe even a strength, but did mean that SOME discussions were a little more generalized. Also, Canvas organization was top tier and readings were very easy to find and access.",
                "There were some really good readings and class discussions. I especially enjoyed the readings on accessibility and the ethnography pieces. Some classes ended up being a lot more lecture-heavy and didn't end up touching on our readings for that week. But on weeks when students were allowed to discuss and bounce ideas off of each other, it was a lot more enjoyable of a class with a lot more personal takeaways.\r\n\r\nI wished there were clearer examples or more explicit descriptions of what meets full marks (or partial marks) for the writing grading rubrics. At times, the point deductions seemed arbitrarily decided on mid grading and didn't align between professor and TF across assignments. There should be a set number of point deductions for specific things that a writing piece might be missing and that should be clearly communicated to students before, not after, the assignment is turned in.",
                "The strengths are the great discussions we had in class. Weaknesses were some of the readings felt unprofessional and very biased. The class material doesn't hesitate to show it political inclinations. I thought the purpose of this class was to gain an understanding of how technology affects culture, however much of this class just feels like an attack on technology. The readings could be more balanced to give students the option to choose how they feel about technology's relationship with culture.",
                "Strengths: Really set up well pedagogically, clear flow of ideas and goals from each class. You could see what Prof. Messeri wanted the class to be engaging with clearly. Prof. messeri is the biggest strength, definitely take a class with her if you can. The assignments are clear, interesting, and honestly fun to do and you get great feedback along the way.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes, I felt that discussions stayed at a higher level than I'd have liked, again that's a factor of the people in the class. Prof. Messeri is good at pushing people to think further."

                "Yes, yes, yes, and yes! Prof. Messeri and Michelle were fantastic and gave thoughtful feedback on even the smallest assignments. I know that our conversations about surveillance, online community formation, challenges of assigning blame and responsibility, and so many other big questions in developing and using technology will stay with me well beyond this class. I'm not an anthropology major, nor do I plan to enter the tech industry -- this class was incredible even with very little prior knowledge/context!",
                "yes!",
                "Absolutely, definitely recommend, ESPECIALLY for people interested in working in tech/Silicon valley/CS. This class gives you a lot of really important critical tools to think about technology and technologies as artefacts and how they relate to people who use them and produce them. Whether you are gung-ho about Facebook and the metaverse or if you think it is a nightmare, you should definitely take this class. I also really recommend this for anyone interested in STS. This is not a class that really requires any experience in anthropology, as Professor Messeri and Michelle gave us a good introduction on some fundamental techniques like coding qualitative ethnographic data and writing fieldwork journals.",
                "The course was a fun way to look at the different ways in which culture and technology interact to shape how we navigate the world. Would recommend for the interesting readings and discussions in class.",
                "The class material is mostly critiques of the tech industry. While some of these critiques can be quite far-fetched, many of them are valid. If you're looking for a class to familiarize yourself with flaws of the tech industry, this is for you.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It's an exciting opportunity to look at the intersection of tech and culture. The class is filled with people from lots of backgrounds which made discussions diverse. I will say that at times analysis felt superficial, and would've liked to go a little deeper into our analysis, but that is a factor of the people in the class. Prof Messeri is passionate about creating a welcoming, engaging classroom and she leads discussions deftly showing her vast knowledge of the topics we discuss. My favorite parts of the class were when we'd hear her own engagement with the subject material. The assignments provided were also unique, it was my first chance to take on a \"traditional\" ethnography and it was a great exercise for me and everyone who would be interested in this. Def take the course"
