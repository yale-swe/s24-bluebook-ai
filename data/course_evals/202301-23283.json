I guess we started with imperial politics, went through the Maoist period - though much of the reading was from historians and not from political scientists - kept going chronologically, talked about political selection and censorship, and ended with some cursory talk on foreign investment and BRI. I learned the most from my own presentation day and the visit with Melanie Manion which is to say I learned from things that were not ostensibly course material - how China evaluates local officials, promotes, and scores them. Unclear on the rest, hard to say really."

                "STRONG: students in the class, feedback was detailed even though it took a really long time to get, class speakers were cool occasionally. WEAK: Peng's attitude. I don't think it reflects well on a professor when 25+ people show up on the first day super excited (seriously, we needed extra chairs) and the following week we have 8 in the class... from the get go, I knew there was some weird disconnect when a student mentioned he was majoring in BME and she said rather bluntly \"then why are you taking this class??\" The student, other students, and I were all taken aback by this comment, which only signaled more of the odd behavior to come in the class, but I'll save that for the other question. Peng's assignments just didn't make any sense. It is simply lazy teaching and horrendous pedagogy to make student lead an entire 2 HOUR seminar THEMSELVES and not prepare ~anything~ in advance in the case of that student not being able to make it. The first scheduled presenter was sick and Peng told them \"I haven't prepared anything, you still have to come to class\" what the actual??? How does that make any sense? The following week, two students asked if there were any guidelines for the presentation and Peng's answer was \"no.\" We were to be the professor for the day. With no grading rubric or instructions. Midterm paper was like that as well - no guidelines, no rubric, no anything. Just \"midterm.\" Luckily she was an easy grader. Just overall a really poorly taught and poorly managed class, Yale should really have senior pedagogues sit in on postdocs' classes before letting them teach because this one was just really, really poorly executed."

                "Nope. Peng approached teaching with very little enthusiasm, came to class unprepared, made the students do most of the work that she should be doing, and scheduled a series of four guest speaker sessions - which in effect reduced her teaching load to 9 out of 13 weeks, but out of those, students led about 6 of those weeks... so I'm pretty sure Peng only ended up \"teaching\" if you can call it that, 3 actual classes. That's pretty pathetic honestly, and even when she did teach, she'd only actually give relevant information when nobody was speaking up. She was also the most inaccessible person at this school - sure, you could talk to her after class and she'd answer emails, but outside of her single office hour on Friday, \"all other hours of the week are reserved for my research.\" I'm sorry, what? You can't even ~zoom~ with me for ten minutes on another afternoon?? How does that make sense? Completely inflexible if we could not make her office hours, but seemingly available for meals. A student was going to an event in another state and asked for a different meeting time and she refused. Ridiculous. Peng just got her PhD. She is not a tenure-track professor, let alone a junior scholar - she's a postdoc. She's simply not important enough to be incapable of meeting students outside of her scheduled time because \"I am doing research.\" As for the class itself, her attitude was just not it. She didn't come to class excited. She always acted really tired, yawned, reclined in her chair, and failed to show students respect in the way any scholar should. Discussion was free form and based on discussion posts - that students had to aggregate into their own ppt presentations and then somehow TEACH class ~for her~ since she could not be bothered to actually put some effort in. She was also completely incapable of imagining that students who did not study hard political science were in the class and needed help understanding how polisci academics make their arguments, to the extent that it felt like she disrespected other disciplines with her disdain. Look, I did well in this course, I know what grade I got, but I was not excited to go to this course, nor was she, and everyone could tell. It was frankly a bit miserable to get through and I'm glad it is over.",
