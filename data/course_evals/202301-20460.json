I can say that I definitely improved my speaking skills, including pronunciation and enunciation. Studying different forms of Brazilian art, including music, dance, literature, and visual art, helped me appreciate the beauty and complexity of Brazilian culture.",

This definitely gave me a unique opportunity to learn from someone who had firsthand experiences of growing up in Brazil and was able to offer insights into the culture and society that I would not have otherwise had access to.",

                "Strengths - the assignments were always manageable, the course content was interesting, we got to explore multiple mediums of Brazilian art, the asynch day allowed us to do independent learning and return to group learning on Thursday and Friday. Weaknesses - the only weakness I can think of is that there could've been more lessons dealing with grammar, but I think grammar is generally something less focused on after L2 Portuguese.",
