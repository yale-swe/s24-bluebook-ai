                "This course left me with a new appreciation of the importance of small details, specific action, and precise description in poetry. It also gave me some particular strategies for achieving these things (Louise Glck's advice was more particular than any I have received in a creative writing course: one could describe it as piercing and revelatory) and encouraged me to consider the peril of creating work that approaches convention as something that must be obeyed, not employed.",
                "I improved my poetry writing and my ability to participate in workshops, both as a writer and as a critic.",
                "I grew in many, many ways as a poet, measurable and immeasurable. Coming out of the Iseman, I feel I am a better reader\/critic of poetry as well as a better writer of it. One of the particular insights I gained from this course was learning to set aside what Prof. Glck called \"sincerity\" in constructing a lyric \"I\" and allowing each poem to make its own demands on my voice, vocabulary, tone, register, etc.",
                "I learned a ton about the revising and reading of poetry, and came to know my peers and their work very well."

                "The evident, core strength of this course was Louise Glck. She had a generosity toward and belief in us (for to be exacting, as she was, is to believe in someone's potential to reach a certain standard) that touched me and thrilled me. She died halfway through the course: the world lost her, and we did, too. I am very grateful to Richard Deming, who took over teaching the seminar, for his steadying hand and his dedication to our continued gathering and learning. And I am grateful to the other students, who were all wonderful poets and, more importantly, good people.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Glck (RIP), Prof. Deming, community fostered among students in workshop, rigor, frequency of feedback (written\/oral)\r\nWeaknesses: With Prof. Deming, too much of the class given to non-workshop activities like discussing readings, reading professional poets' poems, and going over assignments",
                "The course provided great feedback for student writing and also introduced us to new fascinating texts."

                "This course will never again exist in the same way, for the course reflected the singular will and character of Louise Glck, who is now dead. As recommending an absent thing can invoke only grief, I will not do it here. I will say, however, the obvious: she was an inimitable poet and an exceptional teacher; I am grateful to have brushed up against her intellect and character, which both seemed to burn until the end.",
                "Absolutely. Working with other advanced poets and especially with an excellent professor is bound to help you improve.",
                "If you are serious about writing poetry and learning how to write better, absolutely. Of course, the quality of the course in the future will depend in large part on the professor.",
                "Absolutely. It was a refreshing opportunity to indulge in creative work and exchange writing with other talented writers."
