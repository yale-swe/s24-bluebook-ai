   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "The knowledge and insights I gained were primarily from doing the assigned reading. One thing that did become more clear in class was the nuance of history and politics, and the way in which historians\/political philosophers contradict themselves.",
    "This class taught me how to properly contextualize history and how to use the knowledge of past events to inform the present.",
    "I got much better at interpreting and understanding difficult historical and politic texts without any real context or introduction. In DS we hop from one text to the next, drawing only cursory connections between them. Essentially, if I wanted to get anything out of a text before discussing it in class I had to form an interpretation that was entirely my own, which, in a text like Aristotle's Politics, can be quite difficult.",
    "I thought this course provided me with several historical perspectives on political thought that still apply today."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: like any DS class, reading things chronologically gives you the unique opportunity to understand the way in which ideas develop over time. Plus, the reading were very interesting for the most part.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As someone who did not have any sort of class on government or politics in high school, I was very lost at times. The course definitely favors students with foreknowledge about political theory.",
    "Virtually all weaknesses I can think of for this course were linked to the instructor (William Klein), who seems like a wonderful person but clearly lacks the experience\/confidence to lead a Directed Studies section. Discussions were virtually never guided in a helpful manner, and he tends to talk himself into far too many digressions.",
    "As Professor Klein was new to Yale this fall, there will obviously be a learning\/adjustment curve at the beginning of the semester. After the first couple of classes, we started getting into the rhythm of things and the course moved smoothly. The great strength of this course is the conversations held between the class during section. Another strength is the fact that we tie the past into the present, a concept that most DS professors gloss over. While it's fun and all to study Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Politics, there should be a way to tie them into our present-day. Professor Klein made sure we did that.",
    "I really appreciated Bill's approach to H\/P. He takes the text as it is, with little concern for the standard interpretations, and encourages his students to do the same. This encourages ernest, unpretentious, and enlightening discussion. I suppose the only weakness is also a result of this approach. Without a large-scale picture of the text it can be difficult to wrap your mind around it or to fit each passage into a larger framework. But I think the benefits of examining the texts without any preconceptions far outweigh any drawbacks.",
    "Maybe more structure and historical context.",
    "A definite strength of this course was how applicable it continues to be to students outside of the context of the class; I often applied different thoughts and perspectives from the thinkers we discussed to other areas of my political and personal life. I thought a weakness was the often disjointed readings that made the works difficult to understand; I would rather read large sections of text (even if that means more reading) or have more support and context provided about the parts we did not read."

   "comments": [
    "Not if taught by William Klein.",
    "Absolutely. This course gives you a great introduction to the historical and political thinkers of the western tradition and helps you develop important analysis skills.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. You have to get used to Bill's style of teaching, which is relaxed and extremely unpretentious, but he's incredibly knowledgeable and sensitive to the nuances of the texts we read. He provides a great example of how to read historical and political texts and form your ideas about them, an essential skill for original thinking and writing.",
    "I feel like this course has a lot of potential to be incredibly interesting and valuable and because it is part of the DS curriculum that I highly value, I would recommend it to other students. However, I think this course could really be improved through a focus on how political thought evolved over time and how that relates to politics today. The most valuable discussions we had were ones that used the text to extrapolate ideas about values, and I wish the class focused on those conversations more."
