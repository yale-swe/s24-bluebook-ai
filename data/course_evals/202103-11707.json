                "Strengths are definitely the wide range in activities that you do throughout the semester. The first couple of weeks are more about the museum and getting tours, while the remaining weeks of the course involve your own personal research project. The professor is definitely a strength. The weakness I see in this class is that I barely got to know everyone in the class besides those who I previously knew or worked with on my project because after the first couple weeks, you really only meet once or twice a month in class. The other days designated as \"class\" involves you working on your project so you are not physically in the classroom with the other students. This is a good and bad thing sometimes. The other weakness is I have no clue what my grade will be because the final two grades (presentation and final write-up) is at the end of the term (after Credit/D/fail is an option).",
                "Strengths: independent-research with a mentor\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "A strength of the course was its interactivity, with the class being centered around a research project where we conduct research on really interesting topics using technology and machines I had never heard of before. Other activities included catching bugs in Farnam Memorial Garden or taking a field trip to Horse Island. A weakness of the class would be that if you didnt really like your project topic or started to find it boring after beginning it, you were still stuck with the project and had to see it through.",
                "The strengths to this class are the real-life experiences with material that most classes do not have. I was able to work on a daily basis with a mentor in the museum and make connections with the staff. The weaknesses of the course are the unclear rubrics for assignments and the inability to interact with the other students because most of the time is one-on-one with the Peabody mentors. Another weakness is that I spent significant hours outside of class working on research (ex: 6-8 hours weekly) and the final project took 20+ hours to complete.",
                "Strengths: Amazing mentorship (very independent but help was given when needed)\r\nWeaknesses: Definitely needs more time studying the Peabody and less time doing research. A couple of \"wow\" moments about the Peabody at the beginning but none after the first three weeks."

            "comments": [
                "Yes, if you are interested in science at want to have a cool \"different\" class. Your way of learning in this class involves more of mentorship in a project rather than lectures, so a great way to have a different type of class if that is what you are looking for.",
                "Absolutely. This class is by far the best way to get into research for anyone considering EPS/EVST/Archaeology. Not only will it set you up really well for your future in those departments, but the research you conduct is also simply SO COOL and really engaging. TAKE IT if you are into paleontology, archaeology, earth and planetary science, or environmental science! Or if you enjoy museums at all! Or if you like going on fun field trips! You won't regret it!!!!",
                "Yes! This has been my favorite class at Yale so far. As someone who considers himself more humanities focused, I was able to conduct research on a science topic that I am interested in. I now want to pursue something relating to the environment.",
                "I think I would recommend this course to a student with little exposure to the scientific research process, for even if you arent super interested in the topic you choose, you can still learn more about how research is conducted, how to present research, and how to write a research report for a unique discipline.  Some of the content for the research topics was a bit difficult to grasp in the time span, especially when jumping right into research. For students who have experience in scientific research or are interested in the natural sciences, I might recommend looking for a first-year seminar that is a little more different than anything you had done before or will do. Regardless, the in-class activities are fun, and the variety of topics to choose from really highlights the variety within the natural sciences.",
                "Yes, this course was so much fun!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who would like to gain practical research experience during their first-year. Many students from the course now have job opportunities and research prospects at the Peabody. However, the student should know that they will be spending a significant time outside of the class session working on their project.",
                "Yes - it was really, really fun and I was able to make connections that landed me a student job second semester.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in research at Yale. It is a RESEARCH class, not a seminar. Don't take this class to learn about natural history or the Peabody Museum, or to meet other first-years. It is a class solely about doing research for the museum, which obviously opens up future opportunities to do research, as you make an excellent connection with your mentor."
