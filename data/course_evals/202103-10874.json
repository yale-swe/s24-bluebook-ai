                "Less emphasis on two major assignments",
                "The structure and the content of the labs was great. There could be more questions on specific lab procedures rather than only conceptual questions. Interpreting IR spectra was a challenge, more help on that would be appreciated.",
                "The course is a decent lab class. The labs are interesting and I felt well prepared for them. While EPs could be a little tedious, I felt they actually prepared me well for experimentation. There was much less busy work than gen chem lab, although I felt the quizzes were a bit random and did not really help my learning.",
                "The strengths of this course are the manageable workload, thoughtful assignments, and understandable yet challenging experiments in the laboratory. There are no major weaknesses of this course.",
                "I thought the course was formatted great!",
                "The online content, especially the videos or study guides are extremely helpful in better understanding how to complete the experiment and what each step we are doing accomplish. The mix of the textbook, guided videos, and course packet are very well-rounded course materials that work together and build an understanding of the course very thoroughly. The environment of the class is also very peaceful and relaxing, where mistakes are never criticized. The only weakness is sometimes guidelines or examples provided for EP's or post-labs do not quite match TA expectations from my experience but it is easy to learn how to improve.",
                "Strengths are that the labs were fun and engaging. Also, while you have till 5pm each day, it was nice that none of the labs every took till 5pm.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness that needs improved is that the quizzes are too hard in my opinion and not that relevant to the labs.",
                "This course is definitely a lot of work for only counting for 0.5 credits. I often found myself spending several hours drawing chemical structures in ChemDraw, writing up the experimental plan, or studying for lab quizzes (approximately 8 hours per week, in addition to the actual time spent in the lab). One of the reasons why I spent so much time on this course is due to the relatively meticulous/harsh grading of the TAs. Missing a date or a single step would often mean a 5% deduction from the assignment, and I felt like I spent more time making sure my lab report was perfect rather than actually trying to understand the concepts. Thus, writing the experimental plan became busywork, and I often conducted experiments by knowing the steps rather than actually understanding the theory behind these steps. This could be improved by placing more emphasis on comprehension. For example, I often couldn't even really think through the quiz questions because we only had 5-10 minutes to take each one. I also could never find the time to do all of the textbook readings because I was so focused on perfecting my experimental plan. Thus, the course could be improved by reducing the amount of unnecessary point deductions and increasing the time we have to take quizzes. With less busywork, I would have had the time to read the chapters and understand the theory underlying the experiment better.",
                "It is an extremely well organized course.",
                "This course was very engaging and it felt like enjoyable to work in the lab. The lab quizzes, however, sometimes did not line up with the things we were learning in organic chemistry lecture, so it felt like we were forced to guess.",
                "Strengths: This course was very well structured. The lab packet is very organized and helps you prepare in advance for the experiments performed in lab. The teaching team is very helpful and is very willing to answer any questions you may have. Weaknesses: None",
                "Good teaching and great learning environment",
                "Strengths: Professor DiMeglio is a very understanding instructor - the most understanding instructor I have encountered in bio or chem at Yale. She strives to make a learning environment that is productive, accepting, and comfortable and she achieves that goal. It is so refreshing to be able to safely take risks, make mistakes, and ask for help. I love how the techniques build upon each other throughout the semester, and I can confidently say that I have come away from the lab course with a solid foundation in organic chemistry lab techniques.\r\nWeaknesses: The lab quizzes became increasingly challenging throughout the semester. I did not like that they were multiple-choice; if you missed one question out of 7 or 8, your entire grade would tank as there was no partial credit. Perhaps adding short answer questions to \"explain your reasoning\" could help make each question less high stakes.",
                "Well organized and has prelab videos that make it a lot easier to get into lab and get going.",

Dr. DiMeglio did a great job of making sure everything was easily accessible. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course sometimes felt like too much work, especially for a 0.5 credit class.",
                "This course really provided no individual help when students were struggling with quizzes or lab-based assignments.",
                "This course is very time-intensive for a 0.5 credit course. I often spent the same amount of time, if not more, on work and class time than my other 1 or 1.5 credit courses. The work is important, of course, but I wonder if it could be made to be worth more.",
                "Strengths: no lab reports \r\n\r\nWeakness: the experimental plans are very tedious to complete",
                "Strengths: friendly professor, TAs and staff, many resources to help you prepare lab assignments including very accessible TA, and everyone did their best to efficiently run the experiments so we could get out of SCL before dark.\r\nWeaknesses: especially at the beginning of the year, some of the resources like the example EP were incongruous with the TA/professor expectations.",
                "The course became much better as the term progressed. Since the assignments are weekly and announced in advance, it is easy to develop a nice routine. The instructor and TAs were very helpful and always provided feedback and advice. As we went on, the techniques were building up on each other so I felt like I could apply my knowledge.",
                "The teaching staff was very nice and helpful. I appreciated that the assignments all seemed to have an actual purpose and were to-the-point, there wasn't a lot of busy work.",
                "Professor DiMeglio is one of the most caring professors in STEM. It might seem like it is less structured than other labs, as there are many assignments, but in the end everything makes so much sense. Sometimes it might not be super clear what the expectations are for the assignments, and I also feel like grading depends a lot on the section (if you are in a section with people scoring really high, your chances of getting an A are way lower than if you are in a section with people who are doing generally worse). The sample size of a section is not wide enough in my opinion for it to be curved. But still, if you work on the assignments and ask for help, you can do well in the class!",
                "Compared to general chemistry labs at Yale, orgo lab was much more enjoyable and I felt like I genuinely learned a lot from the course. There were quite a lot of assignments, but they were all pretty reasonable and helped me better understand the material.",
                "One of the biggest strengths of this class was its staff. First and foremost, I had an AMAZING TA. Olivia made this class enjoyable and fulfilling, and her patience/willingness to answer our many questions definitely increased my confidence as an experimentalist. I've heard good things about the other TAs as well. Additionally, Dr. DiMeglio is kind, understanding, and knowledgeable (and also the only person I've ever seen actually use the emergency eyewash on themself in a safety video--lots of respect for that), and the course packet that we work out of is comprehensive--you can read the packet and have a very clear understanding of how to proceed in the lab. The video series that acts as a companion to the packet sections is helpful for any lingering confusion. I also really enjoyed the concepts we were learning and the hands-on experimental nature of it all, but I'm also a chemistry major, so take that with however much salt you deem necessary. The one downside to the class was the workload. Spending anywhere from ~4-5 hours per experimental plan and 4 hours in lab for a half credit class is a lot, definitely comparable to the other 1 credit classes I took this semester.",
                "Strengths: really self-guided. Great progression of learning \r\nCons: pre-lab assignments take a lot of time. Hate the makeup policy since so much time passes between quiz time and final period.",
                "Strengths: posted lab videos were quite helpful\r\nWeaknesses: labs should be ONE credit for the amount of work invested, course packet ocassionally inacurrate or inconsistent with course video",
                "This course is very well organized and has a clear progression of experiments and topics to facilitate student learning. If possible, it would be even more helpful if the lab course could line up more with the corresponding lecture classes.",
                "A weakness is that if you have a dean's excuse to miss a quiz the course circumvents it by giving everyone ONE redo at the end of the semester. This is unfair to the people with a dean's excuse for obvious reasons they may have wanted to retake another quiz had they had an equal opportunity as everyone else in the class. Grading can get pretty harsh and as a result, discouraging.",
                "The strengths of this course was definitely how organized it was. However, the course could be improved by the TAs having similar grading policies.",
                "There are lots of resources to turn to for help",
                "I have no complaints, other than making the quizzes easier.",
                "Strengths:\r\nCompared to the general chemistry lab, this lab required less time, which I think is appropriate for a half-credit class.\r\nQuizzes are given only every other week (thank you!)\r\nOption to re-do one quiz\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNone",
                "I can't think of any weaknesses, it was really well designed and I enjoyed it.",
                "I thought this course had many strengths. I appreciated how organized and structured the course was. Dr. Dimeglio would post pre-lab videos that proved to be extremely helpful and the course manual was a great resource to have throughout the semester.",
                "really hands-on, and you get to synthesize cool stuff",
                "Overall, the course was very interesting. I enjoyed most of the labs, but I felt that some of the labs at the beginning (the technique ones) could have been condensed to leave more time for more interesting labs. The grading seemed fair within each section but more uniformity across the sections would make it more fair.",
                "A weakness of this course was the amount of pre-class to post-class work. I appreciated not doing formal lab reports, as I already committed as much time to this course as I did my full credit classes based on EPs and quizzes, but it seemed that there was not as much of an emphasis on how to apply what we learned. In other words, the class focused more on doing the lab and knowing the procedure before hand than actually understanding the reactions and their real-life applications, which made it rather tedious and took some of the fun out of it.",
                "Strengths: I think this complements the lecture course very well. It is leaps and bounds better than gen chem lab and the grading is absolutely fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: EPs can be tedious but there isn't really that great of a workload.",
                "Should not be worth 1/2 a credit for the amount of time it takes (in lab and doing reports, EPs, and analysis). The course helped develop important lab skills and taught us how to think about and prepare for experiments.",
                "Weakness: many of the lab techs were unapproachable and at times mean\r\nStrengths: my TF was amazing and so fun to be in lab with. Our lab felt like a little family.",
                "The work was not consistent week by week and it was difficult to remember due dates. Prefab material was extremely useful in preparing students to do well in the lab.",
                "The course was well organized and the expectations were clear, but it was confusing a couple times when the lab was ahead of the chem 220 class.",
                "A strength of the course is the clarity of the labs to be conducted in class and the organization of the course. It would be difficult to get lost, and the course packet and the videos provided all the information needed to complete the experimental plans. A weakness of the course might be the quizzes in that they were really short compared to the actual labs yet started to be weighted heavily toward the end of the class. The content of the quizzes also seemed to vary a bit from what I expected based on the course packet.",
                "Strengths: Dr. DiMeglio! She is so incredibly kind, gets to know all the students in lab by name, and very very helpful. A HUGE step up from gen chem lab. The course itself isn't too strenuous either, with only two major assignments, some quizzes, and a weekly procedure due.\r\nWeaknesses: The quizzes didn't always adhere to the study questions we were provided, so they could be a bit tricky.",
                "The strengths was that the course work was fairly manageable and the teaching staff (especially Professor DiMeglio) are really great and really want you to learn and succeed so the lab time is usually not that stressful and a lot of fun. The weaknesses is that sometimes the lab quizzes tested on concepts that hadn't yet been covered in lecture and not covered that thoroughly during the pre-lab work so they could be tricky but they still were reasonable.",
                "strengths: lovely teaching staff!\r\nweaknesses: quizzes were harder than expected",
                "The labs were manageable and fun to do. It was also nice that some of the labs built upon each other, as we were introduced to certain techniques individually at first, then put them together toward the end. Dr. DiMeglio's video tutorials were very helpful as well. A weakness is that grading could seem arbitrary at times, and the workload may feel heavier depending on the TA's expectations.",
                "This course was really well structured. I really liked how the instructions on every experimental procedure were really clear and how the EP explained the actual science behind the experiments we did. However, I do feel that assignments sometimes got repetitive, especially since we needed to read the EP handout, rewrite the procedure for our on EPs, and then \"copy\" the procedure again into our lab notebooks on the assigned lab day.",
                "Ochem lab was quite fun! The videos that Dr. DiMeglio made to walk through the experiment before lab were very helpful. I felt like the labs also somewhat mirrored what we were doing in lecture, which felt helpful in actually putting into practice the synthetic techniques we were discussing.",
                "The teaching staff was really supportive and the assignments were very reasonable!",
                "This class felt like a 0.5 credit class. CHEM 134L and 136L had so much work outside of the physical lab time that I was annoyed they were only 0.5 credit classes. The workload for CHEM 222L felt appropriate for its weighting. Christine and my TA also made it very clear that we would never be penalized for poor results or mistakes in the labthey would be treated as learning opportunities and chances to improve. The culture of organic lab, at least to me, was much better than that of general chem lab.",
                "This course is a good introduction to laboratory techniques in the discipline of organic chemistry as well as a good introduction to the basics of laboratory safety. And this was all accomplished without the overload of work assigned in CHEM 134L + 136L. All of the assigned labs were able to finished comfortably within the given time frame, and the inclusion of pre-recorded run-throughs of the experiment were extremely beneficial in figuring out how to apply each experimental procedure to reality and showing how new experimental techniques should be performed. This course was definitely organized more for our learning without having the stress of grades being a deciding factor. That being said, the course was largely not intellectually stimulating. Most of the experimental protocols were explained before we used them in lab, but there were a few, including reflux and extraction, where the purpose and their mode-of-action was not immediately clear from the start. For these experimental methods, we were just instructed to do them without considering whether they could be optimized. Instead, if the experimental result/yield was less than optimal, these methods and possible error in their execution would be considered. However, I don't think this is an optimal learning strategy, and I believe that it would be better for all experimental methodologies/techniques to be gone over in their entirety, especially at the molecular level, before applying them in experiments. Additionally, the two post-lab assignments throughout the semester largely involved rehashing/rationalizing experimental results and reinforcing lab safety principles. While these exercises were beneficial, other questions/exercises (perhaps some about experimental design) would perhaps have added a critical thinking element to the post-lab assignments.",

                "organized, efficient",

                "strengths: the teaching staff were amazing and always there to help",
                "The course was very organized and the lab procedures were very informative. I enjoyed how hands on each lab was, it felt a lot more personal even with a TA there to help when needed.",

                "The lab had plenty of equipment, but there should have been more interaction at the beginning",
                "This class is all strengths. It's one of the few .5 credit courses that understands that it's .5 credits. I spent maybe 4 hours outside of lab on this class every week. Plus, this work was intentional. By that I mean, for every assignment it was clear to me that thought had been put into the design of the assignment, how much time it would take, and we were never asked to spend time on arbitrary things. If it was assigned, I knew I would only be expected to spend as much time as it took to learn the content and the grading would be completely fair and focus on whether I had learned the material. We weren't graded on arbitrary things like the format of graphs or sig figs. And, in class itself, the work is fun. I think the way the class builds on itself works beautifully. I was never overwhelmed or unsure because my TA was incredibly helpful, the pre-lab work was thorough and clear, and most importantly techniques were introduced gradually over the course of the semester. So, by the end, you could come in and only need at the t few words to understand the set-up of the experiment. You could list a step just as TLC 80/20 or melt point or IR or recrystallize with this and this and--because the techniques had been taught clearly and slowly--I could easily do whatever was required of me. I honestly cannot praise this course enough. \r\n\r\nThis class honestly has no weaknesses from my perspective.",
                "This was a pretty good course to learn organic chemistry techniques, especially if the student does not have much experience. The grading is super picky though and I wish it was more focused on learning and not just points here and there. The quizzes also were not the most related to the actual laboratory work and seemed really unnecessary.",
                "Strengths: Resources to help.\r\nWeaknesses: Quizzes didn't seem to reflect what we learned in-lab.",
                "This course was a really fun lab! It was very engaging, and I can't say enough great things about Dr. DiMeglio! She was constantly encoring and would stop and speak to ever student about things that interest them.",
                "Strengths: workload compared with gen chem lab\r\nWeaknesses: lab concepts sometimes difficult to fully grab",
                "Strengths\r\n- I had never done lab before, so the techniques we learned in lab were very interesting and novel, as well as applicable\r\n- Great TA who explained the chemistry behind every reaction we were carrying out \r\nWeaknesses\r\n- The amount of work you have to do and time you have to put in for this course is disproportionate to the 0.5 credit value (i.e. it is sometimes more work than a 1.5 credit course)\r\n- There is little in-class guidance for any of the assignments posted, only written-up instructions",
                "I liked the course when I was in person, but when you account for the time I spent in class and preparing for the class I believe it was equal in workload to my other courses and should be worth a whole credit. A lot of the work in the class felt like busy work as well. For example, a lot of the information in our weekly EP assignments was totally useless to us in our lab. The post lab quizzes were also really difficult and the aid of them being open note is completely negated by the extremely short time limit on them. You don't have time to think through your answers.",
                "Everything was well organized and planned out. There were even videos that went through the entire lab.",
                "- grading was fair\r\n- lab environment was positive",
                "Strengths: you learn a lot of lab skills\r\nWeaknesses: some lab days a super long",
                "I think effort was rewarded in this class, which is something I really appreciate. The expectations for assignments and for lab were really clearly communicated, and I felt like there were lots of resources on Canvas to help with assignments and understanding. Christine is also a huge strength of the class -- she is a really caring, empathetic, and understanding professor, and it's clear she cares about her students' success. The workload was pretty reasonable for a lab course.",
                "My TA and Dr. DiMeglio were both very helpful and supportive. The pre-lab lectures ensured that I understood the purpose of each step of the experiment, and the labs were always really interesting, relevant to Organic Chemistry lecture, and fun to complete.",
                "tons of variety in the experiments! overall, i loved it! maybe a hot take, but i liked that the quizzes were short and sweet - all of them were 10 min or less. i also loved how well-organized the course was. dr. dimeglio sent straightforward emails and the course packet was also straightforward (and filled with lovely diagrams!) as someone who is terrified by giant blocks of text, this was an extremely comforting thing to see in a class.",
                "Very interesting in lab if you know what youre doing. I hear much much better than gen chem lab. Only weakness is EPs are quite annoying and tedious to construct, but do help you understand the concepts.",
                "The course is very well timed with chem 220 and builds upon concepts introduced in that class. All the lab procedues are carefully outlined and safety is emphasized. The one thing I wish the course provided more was examples or templates for written assignments (specifically EPs), since they were graded strictly and an ideal format was not immediately given.",
                "The strengths of this class were that it provided a nice introduction to organic lab procedures and often the skills taught in lab aligned with the content taught in the organic chemistry lecture. The weaknesses of this class was that the assignments and preparing for the lab are often time-consuming for a 0.5 credit course. In addition the grading was often inconsistent.",
                "Dr. DiMeglio is DEFINITELY a strength. She's honestly a gem and makes lab so much more bearable. She's a teacher and a mentor if I've ever seen one. I initially didn't like lab, but she made it make sense and worthwhile. Weaknesses come from the TA's sometimes. Some of them definitely know the material but are not teachers. As a first-year, I had no prior experience in Yale labs, and they oftentimes forgot this. The workload was also that of a two-credit course; it definitely didn't match up to the half-credit this was supposed to be. Definitely a lot and a shock during the first semester of college.",
                "While the course taught how to do multiple techniques, I feel like it did not cover how to apply those techniques. For example, I would know how to distill a mixture of compounds, but I would not know when a mixture would need to be distilled in the future. It would be useful to maybe have a PostLab assignment where we create our own procedure that incorporates multiple techniques from multiple labs. The EPs also became very repetitive, and I feel like we did not learn more by writing them. Some parts of the EP, like the densities of compounds, felt irrelevant to include. Other aspects of the EPs felt more like tedious busywork rather than tasks that actually increased our learning of chemistry techniques.",
                "I thought this course was taught very well. The Experimental Plans seemed rather long and tedious though.",
                "It was so much fun! I hated gen chem lab, but Professor DiMeglio makes this difficult course a lot of fun. It felt well-organized and conducive to learning.",
                "Strengths -  Overall, orgo lab emphasizes conceptual understanding of procedures and reactions, making it a rare lab course where I feel like I actually learned a lot! The reactions and the rationale behind procedures was explained very well, so I actually understood why I was doing what I was doing in lab! Also, big plus, the workload of this course is very fair -  actually commensurate with a half-credit course (unlike gen chem, where I was drowning in work.) Submitting experimental plans was also helpful because they helped reinforce what I would be doing in lab that week, which helped me prepare for each experiment. Quizzes were only every other week (weekly quizzes are very stressful!). No lab reports were required; instead we only had two major assignments called post-lab assignments, which emphasized conceptual understanding of course material rather than simply repeating the procedure and doing calculations (like the lab reports from gen chem, which I honestly didn't learn a lot from).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - submitting lab notes (not really a weakness, just tedious and time-consuming).",
                "well structured",
                "Weaknesses: The labs were definitely on the longer side, so after being in SCL for a while, it got a little draining. Keeping a lab notebook and writing down all of the procedure when you are following exactly what you already wrote in the EP was a little excessive, in my opinion. That said, I understand the importance of developing good note-taking skills.\r\nStrengths: This course was far more relaxed than CHEM 134L/136L, so that was a huge relief. I think Dr. DiMeglio was also a huge perk of this course  she was truly one of the sweetest and most genuine people I've come across at Yale. The experiments were also really interesting, and it was great to develop skills in a relaxed and encouraging environment.",
                "The quizzing is very difficult and seemed to include many questions that tried to trick you instead of testing what you really knew. Students should also be given more time on these quizzes. Otherwise, the labs were very well organized and interesting. The teaching team is very passionate and knowledgable.",
                "Good course- quizzes a bit difficult",
                "Strengths: Demonstration videos of experiment were very helpful.Techniques are relevant to topics from chem lecture and easy to understand. Course is relatively low stakes and forgiving to mistakes like lab errors. Good pacing (heavily graded tasks like quizzes and post labs are less frequent and there is ample time to complete them).\r\nWeaknesses: Introductory lab class is not generally that useful as the skills are not developed or applicable in an actual project. Ambiguous gradings across TAs and discontinuities between rubric in syllabus compared to standards of TA. Graded assignments do not accurately reflect an understanding or competence of lab knowledge (feels like busy work). Amount of work is worth more than 0.5 credits.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the pre-lab videos and the instructors and TF's themselves that help create an atmosphere that is all about truly understanding the intent of the lab's purpose and chemistry. I would say a weakness would be the intense focus on the weekly pre-lab assignments as they didn't exactly correlate and might've even taken away from time spent understanding the lab's fundamental chemistry framework.",
                "The short lectures before each lab were helpful in understanding the fundamental chemistry behind what we were doing. The course packet and videos that taught us how to do each lab were clear and effective. I liked how the techniques we learned in the first labs were combined in the later labs for more complex experiments.\r\n\r\nI think this course could be improved if we were given a grading rubric for all of our assignments, especially the experimental plans. I feel like we would get points off because we missed certain elements that we did not even know needed to be included. I also think that the quizzes were unnecessarily difficult and did not always reflect what we were taught during the labs. I also think that the quizzes contributed too much to our grade in comparison to the experimental plans (which would take much longer).",
                "Strengths: follows a consistent format each week (EP, pre-lab video, lab notes, biweekly quiz), supportive lab environment, manageable workload\r\nWeaknesses: grading varies greatly across TFs, assignments don't always receive weight proportional to the time/effort required to complete them (e.g. EPs have very little impact on grade), no rubric for grading (and they sometimes dock points for formatting/rules that aren't specified in the assignment)"

                "I would recommend this course to another student. Although many take this course as a prerequisite class for medical school or one of the STEM majors, the class is a really great experience for anyone who is interested in a laboratory class and has satisfied the general chemistry prerequisites. The experiments are very engaging, the structure of the class is very well thought-out. Both the TAs and instructor are excellent teachers, and the assignments are not overwhelming.",
                "Yes! For me it was a requirement, but I still very much enjoyed it.",
                "I would highly recommend the lab course, it can be a very peaceful environment and friendly people. You also learn a lot just by doing all the experiments and is a nice supplement to some of the lecture material in organic chemistry. The advice on assignments or in the lab is also always very helpful so it is easy to improve throughout one's time in the class and become comfortable while performing experiments. Chemistry itself is hardly perfect and the TA's and professors know and will only offer helpful advice to mistakes and help out students, they are never criticized.",

                "I would recommend this course only to people seriously interested in majoring in chemistry or pursuing chemistry research work. It involves a lot of work and focuses too little on comprehension of the material and too much on writing a flawless experimental plan. TA deductions can be harsh and unnecessary. It involved very little intellectual challenge and was not very interesting to me personally.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students interested in chemistry or just simply filling a requirement. It's unfortunate that this class requires organic chemistry lecture, because I feel it should be offered as an introduction to lab work to those who don't want to commit to the strenuous workload of the lecture.",
                "Yes! It is very well organized and introduces you to many laboratory techniques. It allows you to apply organic chemistry concepts in a hands-on fashion. The teaching team is very supportive and provides a low-stress environment for you to carry out new experiments.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student, it is a well-run lab course.",
                "I think it is actually a fun lab to take, although I guess that if you are reading this you might just have to as a requirement. Dont worry, its so much better than the gen chem lab! Im sure youll enjoy it if you end up taking it. Everyone was so encouraging. Lab technicians, TAs and the professor were always there with a smile if you needed help, if you made a mistake or you broke a piece of glassware.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in organic chemistry, although most people end up taking this class because they have to anyways.",
                "I think that most folks who are taking this class are taking it because of a requirement, but I'll add that it was very fun to learn the various techniques throughout the semester and especially rewarding to put them all together in the final labs. Be prepared for the EP workload and the post-labs when they happen (I'd say this class has the same workload as an average/slightly below average 1-credit class) and you'll do just fine.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, if required for major or pre-med",
                "Yes.",
                "Be prepared to once again do 1 credit worth of work for a .5 credit class",
                "Yes, I would. The course is very organized, so it was not hard to understand what we were doing in a given lab week.",
                "Yes, this is one of the most enjoyable labs I've ever taken at Yale. The whole course was organized to both extremely informative and enjoyable.",
                "Yes, both Dr. DiMeglio and my TA were supportive and cared about student success.",
                "If you're taking organic chemistry, I would recommend this class even if it's not required because it is a much better lab than general chemistry laboratory. You learn a lot and it lines up well with what you learn in orgo lecture.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in furthering their knowledge of organic chemistry.",
                "yes. the labs are fun to perform and you learn a lot of techniques. it complements orgo lecture well too. it's a lot of work for a half-credit course though.",
                "I would definitely recommend this if you are already taking orgo. Fun and not too much work, just don't start the post labs last minute. Do not take orgo just for this lab, the lab is great but it's not worth it.",
                "Only if required. It was not a bad class but only for those with an interest in Organic Chemistry or biology in general, others may find procedures tedious.",
                "Yes, this is a great complementary lab to the orgo lecture class. If you took gen chem lab, you will absolutely love orgo lab and Dr. DiMeglio because it is so much more conducive to student learning.",
                "Yes, it teaches you important skills and the lab work is pretty fun.",
                "Only if you must take it, which I imagine you must.",
                "Yes. Super necessary course to anyone going into chem, bio, or medical fields and plans to use their hands.",
                "I would only recommend this course if it is a requirement for a major/pre-med",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course because doing the laboratory techniques was actually kind of fun, and they built on one another each lab so that it never felt too overwhelming. The grading wasnt too harsh, which is good since so much of the learning is practice-based anyway. The labs tended to be longer and more complicated than the general chemistry labs, but if you want to skip two semesters of lab, starting here isnt bad at all.",
                "Yes absolutely! Dr. DiMeglio is incredible, the lab work itself is pretty fun, and the assignments aren't too bad at all.",
                "I'm sure most people taking this course are required to because of major or medical school pre-reqs so they don't really have an option but as far as lab courses go this semester has definitely been my favorite because I felt like I was learning lab technique in an enjoyable manner and the course work felt like it was for a 0.5 credit class which sometimes doesn't happen in a lot of lab classes.",
                "yes, if it is for your major or if you're actually interested in doing orgo research... the techniques are only helpful in those two situations",
                "Yes, especially since it's a requirement for most chem/bio majors and pre-med students. If time and schedule space permit, I would recommend taking this lab concurrently with the organic chemistry lecturenot necessarily because the content is aligned, but because it's manageable to do so and nice to get them both over with.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is potentially interested in doing any sort of lab work in the future. Orgo lab gave more independence than genchem lab, allowing students to learn how to improvise when their experiments may not go as expected, which is helpful for working in any lab in the future.",
                "Yes! Great lab.",
                "If you are premed/chem major, for sure! It is a lot better than general chemistry lab and truly an enjoyable experience!",
                "Yes! The concepts in organic lab are exactly the same as in organic lecture, so unlike in gen chem lab, it doesn't feel like you're learning different chemistry in lab and in lecture. The lab faculty are all so kind and helpful, and they are very good at explaining how the techniques you learn in lab will be used real labs.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who has had no previous experience in the laboratory techniques commonly used in the discipline of organic chemistry and is looking for a smooth, well-paced introductory course. I would also recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about laboratory safety. To anyone else not looking for those two things in particular, I wouldn't really recommend this course.",
                "yes - if they want to learn some fun techniques in the lab!",
                "Yes, it is very good to have in person, hands-on experience in the lab at this basic level to start building up your skills as a scientific experimentalist. Not to mention it is also a requirement!",
                "If premed then yes",
                "Yes, it's necessary for many majors and you learn lots of useful techniques.",
                "This course goes hand and hand with Orgo, and I do not suggest Orgo. Which stinks, because this lab and Professor DiMeglio are absolutely wonderful.",
                "Yes. This course is focused more on understanding than testing your methodical ability to measure and weight products. I think this course was very beneficial to my understanding of organic chemistry.",
                "if they need it",
                "yes, if you have to take it for premed\r\nno, if you don't have to",
                "yes, honestly might be a better way to approach orgo than the class",
                "Yes, I found it very interesting! I think it was best paired with the organic chemistry lecture. I would encourage anyone who is taking organic chemistry to take this course.",
                "Yes, Dr. Dimeglio was very kind always.",
                "Yes, this would help any student become experienced enough to work in any lab for research",
                "As long as Dr. DiMeglio is teaching it, I highly recommend the course. It's truly an informative and insightful class that also manages to be fun. I'm not someone who particularly enjoys working in a lab setting; I'm quite clumsy and my results are almost never the expected ones. But this class made me love lab, so much so that I'm taking the second semester of Organic Chem Lab even though it's not required by my major. I've already recommended the class to friends whose majors don't require it but I know they would still appreciate and learn a lot from the class. Seriously, if you're at all interested in STEM (or even if you're not), take the class. I think you're expected to take the class concurrently with Organic Chem lecture, which is a shame because I think this lab made me more patient, more careful, and a better scientist, and it's worth taking even without Organic Chem lecture.",
                "Yes, it's a relatively good laboratory course. It's also necessary for many majors and professional schools.",
                "Yes, if needed.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. It was very engaging! I enjoyed putting concepts learned lecture to practice in lab! Additionally, the course pace was perfect to align with lecture.",
                "Yes if you need it. Much less work and stress than gen chem lab.",
                "Yes, and you should take it with CHEM 220/CHEM 174 concurrently. The in-lab part of this course is fascinating, however the most challenging part (and the highest workload one) is all the at-home work you need to do, without much guidance. It takes several hours and a lot of improvements, but once you get the hang of how the grading and expectations work a few weeks in, the work becomes worth it.",
                "I think this class doesn't really follow the lecture course like it did in general chemistry, but I've been told it will next semester. I would recommend it if they are interested in lab work but warn them that the quizzes are rather challenging.",
                "Only if you have to take it. The class workload is relatively light compared to gen chem lab and Professor DiMeglio is super nice",
                "Yes! If you're already in orgo lecture, you should absolutely take the lab. Reinforces and applies lecture content. And synthesis is fun!",
                "Yes! It can be a bit overwhelming at first but if you prepare well then it should go smoothly and you will learn a lot of lab techniques with clear applications.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class! Christine is great, it's not that stressful, and I learned a lot of important and useful organic lab techniques.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wants to gain hands-on experience with lab protocols and techniques.",
                "absolutely!! the course is extremely well-organized, and i felt that dr. dimeglio and all the TAs were extremely approachable.",
                "Yes absolutely its not a huge amount of work but also very nice lab",
                "I would definitely reccomend this course over gen chem lab and would not hesitate to recommend it to any student also taking organic chemistry.",
                "I would recommend this class if this is a required pre-requisite for an intended major and would like learn introductorily organic lab procedures and skills.",
                "I would because the feeling of completing such a challenging course is awesome. It complemented the lecture well and was wayyy cooler than any lab I'd ever done in high school.",
                "Yes. It's enjoyable and teaches skills that might be useful for future chemistry labs.",
                "Yes, the teaching team was great and the lab was a great learning environment.",
                "Yep.",
                "Yes, it was a great course! You learn a lot, the workload is very fair and you actually understand why you are doing what you are doing in lab!",
                "Yes, good introductory lab course",
                "Yes, absolutely! This course was really awesome. I always felt really good leaving lab, and it was nice to work on some of the concepts that we discussed in lecture in real-life settings. I had an amazing TF, so that added to the levity of the lab itself, so I think it does depend on if you're lucky in that \"arena.\" The experiments were interesting, and some of the chemicals that we used were pretty expensive, so it was nice to have some responsibility as well. Overall, this course was MILES better than general chemistry lab.",
                "Yes if needed - better than gen chem lab",
                "Yes absolutely",
                "I recommend the course if you need to fulfill the lab requirement for your major or pre-med. It's relatively low-stress and manageable for any first-year.",
                "Yes, this course is essential to learning real-life applications of chemistry concepts.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they need the credit. It does a good job of showing you the basics of how organic chemistry is applied experimentally. The labs themselves are not difficult if you watched the video on how to correctly perform them. The experimental plans are extremely detailed and take a lot of time to complete, but you do end up getting faster at them by the end. I think the midterm and final reports for this class are very manageable and reflect what we have learned. The hardest part of this class were the quizzes.",
                "Only because there's no comparable alternative. If you're just looking around for a science credit (?!?), this is not it."
