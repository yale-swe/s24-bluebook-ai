The class structure also helped me improve my speaking skills since it was a complete immersion into Chinese.",

                "I thought that with all the reading and essays we did, our abilities to read and write improved drastically. I like how the classes aren't 5 days a week like L1/L3 courses. I felt like it was enough where I was routinely practicing my Chinese, but not overwhelmed.",
                "Strengths: Very easy-to-follow textbook, with lots of examples and exercises. Professor was very encouraging and knowledgeable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could have benefitted from a wider variety of topics",
                "The structure of each class was really consistent, so I knew what to expect when I came to class. I enjoyed how interactive it was and how our professor made sure we were engaging and working with the vocabulary.",
                "Have more opportunities for just conversational speaking",
                "The work was tedious but fine. I think it would have been nice to set up in-person conversation groups within the class. I don't think I learned like, most people's English names. Also, a lot of things were not mandatory which made them easy to skip."
