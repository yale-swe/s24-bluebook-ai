                "strength: writing and reading (also kinda crazy reading your classmates work and being like DANG they can write) \r\n\r\nprofessor riley is kind and knowledgeable but also keeps the class somewhat more professional\r\n\r\nweakness: our class was a little dry at times, and I feel like the way professor riley handled some discussions concerning race felt kinda off-color in our class? we read some diverse works but they sometimes felt like tokens instead of just generally a diverse syllabus",
                "Strength: All the readings were very interesting and was a great introduction to the English department. A good amount for each week that was reasonable to finish reading and evaluate. \r\nWeakness: Hard to facilitate a natural and inclusive group conversation over zoom.",
                "Strength: professor, class structure, assignments\r\nWeakness: n\/a (I wish the classes were longer so we would have time to discuss all the readings).",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that for each essay, we received feedback on a rough draft from Professor Riley, and then we had another week to apply that feedback and improve it before submitting the final draft. This system of turning in an essay nearly every week and alternating between rough drafts and final drafts, really helped me learn what worked and what didn't in my writing and also in my writing process. Another strength of this course is Professor Riley! She provides great feedback, is very good at facilitating discussion in class and is endlessly helpful!",
                "Strengths: Professor Riley was amazing; she was so kind and caring. I also liked the format of having a first draft, comments, then revised version for each essay. Weaknesses: I felt the essays could have been better paced throughout the semester, as it felt like the last 3\/5 essays were a little crammed into the last weeks of the semester."

It was hard to feel connected to classmates, and zoom made discussion difficult, but we still managed to have great conversations in class. We were asked to keep our mics to make people feel like they could just jump in, but I don't think it helped very much.  Breakout rooms take a lot of time out of class, but it was nice to meet classmates during that time. I wonder if there could be student collaboration outside of class."

If you are interested in creative writing, it might be good to also look at other courses (engl 123, etc.)",
