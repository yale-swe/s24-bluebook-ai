You also engage with many perspectives--including that of perpetrators and even \"fake\" victims. For a crime that is so horrible, this class tries to understand it without imposing a grand framework. That's what makes this worthwhile.",
                "I came away with a skillset through which to understand the process of historicization and the role of testimony in creating a historical archive. I also have a much more nuanced understanding of the Holocaust, which has quite frankly transformed the way that I not only understand Jewish history but also the world.",
                "I learned about the distinct periods of thought\/modes of analysis in the history of holocaust studies. I was challenged to think critically about topics I had not been previously exposed tothe sacralization of survivors, the role of testimony in research, the notion of the Holocaust as paradigmatic of genocide."

                "Strengths: Professor Dean is just excellent. She is an excellent discussion leader and has a gift for remembering each student's contributions (it's actually incredible how she can remember a comment you made even weeks ago). She also will make a concerted effort to meet with you for office hours. She's brilliant. I was also lucky to have a fantastic group of classmates in the seminar. It's clear everyone is engaged and is prepared to engage in the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is excellent, but there's one change I would consider for the syllabus: I wish we could have started with the historical context of European genocides, instead of ending with it. That historical context would've likely shaped a lot of future conversations.",
                "The readings and discussions were definitely the biggest strength of this course. I thoroughly enjoyed each reading, and while the reading load was quite heavy, it all came together very nicely. I wish that we had more assignments throughout the course, however. The only assignments were 2 papers and a brief set of discussion questions, which were all very enriching but did not facilitate consistent feedback.",
                "Strengths: the diversity of course readings, the length of class blocks, the freedom to chose the focus of papers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: n\/a"
