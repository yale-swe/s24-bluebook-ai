I also learned a lot about various aspects of Chinese culture and history that I didn't think about before.",
                "My character writing and speaking skills improved greatly, and my knowledge of vocabulary and grammar has increased. I feel more comfortable speaking in Chinese and also am able to read and write more sentences than before.",
                "As a heritage speaker who had experience with speaking and reading but practically zero experience with pinyin and writing Chinese characters, at first I was nervous about whether I would be able to catch up (I tested into the course). Looking back, I learned so much from this courseand made up for my weaker areas in just a semester.",

                "The strengths of this course was the quality of the professor and the content of the course. Most if not all of the faculty in the Chinese department are highly regarded for good reason, and the lessons and vocab that they teach us are usually useful and relevant. The work assigned in the class also is productive towards learning and improving your Chinese.",
                "The course is great, very organized and there is good correlation between your grade and actual learning.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it is very structured and I know what to expect every day when I walk into class. There is a great variety of reading, writing, speaking, and listening exercises, and I like the addition of the asynchronous day. I think the course could be improved through more group and partner activities\/work to create a stronger class bond.",
                "Strength: I like how the class was taught in units, which made it very easy to digest. Unit tests as opposed to midterms\/finals were also helpful. Chen Laoshi is also so supportive! It's a course where if you really put in the effort, you will succeed.  \r\nWeakness: I was surprised by the lack of opportunities for collaboration\/class interaction in the first half of the semester. The final project at the end of the semester was great and seemed to really connect our class, but I wish there had been more collaborative projects\/opportunities earlier on in the semester.",
                "strengths: consistency, workload\r\n\r\nweakness: constantly changing schedule is disruptive, especially the quizzes. \r\nI found the tutoring sessions outside of class to be redundant and pointless, especially considering all the resources that are alrdy available. I didnt feel that it added to my learning, rather just increased the workload and wasted time. I would recommend making tutoring optional for those who need it.",
                "This class was very engaging. I was provided with a lot of opportunities to improve my Chinese skills both during and outside of class.",
                "Very clear structure and well-organized format. Good pacing and conducive to learning Chinese."

                "Yes, Chinese is a really useful language to learn. It is definitely a class where the amount of work you put in directly translates to results in both grades and in learning.",

                "Yes! I never thought I'd like language learning (there goes 4 years of Spanish) until I took this course. Chen Laoshi is the bestsupportive, understanding, kind, and passionate. 10\/10 would recommend this class, especially if Chen Laoshi is teaching it.",
                "yes because it is intensive",
                "Yes, if you want to significantly improve your Chinese skills, this is a great class to take.",
                "Absolutely! Learned so so much, so quickly, in such a supportive learning environment.",
                "Absolutely, if you're on the heritage Chinese track."
