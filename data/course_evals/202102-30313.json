The workload is just perfect and lecture notes are easy to follow and clear enough even under online teaching mode.\r\n\r\nweakness: the first two exams do not match the lesson schedule exactly. For example, the last class we take before the exam1 would not appear in exam2 but actually in exam2, this may cause confusion when reviewing the lecture notes. I think it is better to schedule the exam right after the period of first part and then second part.",

Good textbook.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Recorded lectures were sometimes confusing. Class time spent going over lectures felt like an inefficient use of time. Latter half of course seems only relevant to physics majors."
