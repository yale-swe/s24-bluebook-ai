                "Strengths: A lot of freedom, very enjoyable class discussion (you play games!), and fun assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Some people might struggle because the assignments are generally very open ended and leave room for a lot of creative freedom",
                "Strengths of this course come from its flexibility. The professors were very understanding and flexible with due dates. Furthermore, the interactive nature of the course itself allowed students to have fun playing games but also provided time to engage in critical discussions which I thought was well balanced."

                "Not really, an easy course in which you don't learn much.",
                "No. Perhaps this course was better in past semesters (based on the reviews I read before beginning the class) but I often found myself disappointed. I didnt learn much about gaming software or games at all. We learned a bit of html and css and some twine, but even that I mostly had to look up and teach myself.  I enjoyed game demos, but I wish we had had more time to learn about games in class other than just discussing game demos.",
                "Its an incredible way to explore games and game design - or just a creative art in general - so Id 100% recommend taking it even if you havent been involved in these domains.",
                "Absolutely. Amazing course and a great way to get yourself motivated to start doing game development.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any first-year student interested in analyzing a wide range of games and who are interested in making their own, (even those without any gaming experience). The class was extremely fun and engaging and opens up your eyes to what goes into designing a game and what constitutes as a game."
