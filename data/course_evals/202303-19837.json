                "I learned how to speak fluently and confidently in spanish. I learned grammar and vocabulary skills. I learned how to have analytical conversations in spanish about academic, political and cultural topics.",

                "In this course I learned how to synthesize vocabulary and grammar to have conversations about engaging and relevant topics. It forced me to speak and write more organically and though making lots of mistakes, I also was able to produce new sentences and ideas instead of falling back on comfortable vocabulary and grammar."

                "One strength of this course is that it is project-based instead of exam-based (there are no exams). I really enjoyed this because doing the projects helped me to learn the language better and engage with it in a new way. Another strength is that we learned about the language in many different mediums (articles, animations, tiktoks, etc.) This helped to make it engaging.",

                "I appreciated that this course did not rely on exams to tests students' fluency in spanish. This helped de-stress the classroom environment and increased students participation because there was less fear of being wrong. the workload was heavy at times, because of the daily meeting times but I thought the topics were very interesting. I wished we did not read a long story during the last week of class. This was a stressful time for students and I wanted to engagement with the text more than I could.",
                "I think that the course was great overall. The professor is fantastic and the coursework is really interesting. The only thing I would change is the last unit. Even though the story was pretty short, the chapters were really dense and felt like a lot, especially as we neared the end of the semester and work\/finals prep in other classes began to pile up.",
                "It demands participation, and everyone bought in",
                "I think the big assignments and class discussions worked really well for the course because they were really flexible and conducive to creative learning. I think the nightly homework could possibly be altered a little bit to be more engaging and less like busy work."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to others as I feel I came out of the semester with an exponential improvement on my language skills and the classroom experience was overall fun and encouraging without the stress of constant assessments.",
                "Yes, Noelia really cares about her students and wants them to feel comfortable speaking spanish",
                "yes!! especially with Profe Snchez Walker!! I learned so much during this class, I appreciated the non-stressful environment of the classroom and the lack of exams. It helped me gain confidence in speaking in spanish in and out of class. We discussed really interesting topics. I not only learned spanish but also engaged with new academic topics.",
                "This course was pretty interesting. The materials exposed us to a lot of art and works of literature that I found engaging and otherwise would have never discovered. And Professor Snchez-Walker is great.",
                "Yes, especially with Noellia",
                "Yes! It was such a comfortable space to make mistakes and grow in, and I was able to have lots of conversations in groups and as a whole class."
