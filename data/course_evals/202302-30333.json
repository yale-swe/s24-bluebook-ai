                "There are weekly quizzes for the course so it is helpful for us to review the content leanred, the instructor will take us to observe the Sun using telescope  and to the observatory to see the night sky. I do admire the practical part of the course because it is hard for me, a not astronomical major student to have those chances. However, because we have to attend the class everyday, so the workload may be too much to handle with two homework each contains 20-40 calcutating problems, and I do spend a lot of time doing the homework.",
                "Strengths: professor zinn, the ta's, problem sets were the right level of difficulty to help with quizzes and exam but they were definitely do-able\r\nWeaknesses: i think posting the lectures for class beforehand would help students prepare questions they might have",
                "The course was engaging and interesting, a lot of content is taught in the span of 5-weeks. The trip to the observatory was a great opportunity to really get to see the astronomical objects. However, I believe the course would improve it is was more interactive.",
                "This course had a clear structure and a good pace. It could have been improved if the slides were posted slightly earlier.",
                "My strengths are calculation and analysis.\r\nMy weakness is remembering all those cosmology parts.",
                "I would hope the final evaluation to be more than an exam, such as a project on specific topics.",
                "Pros: covers a wide and deep range of knowledge.\r\nCons: Less connected to the real world."

                "I will definitely recommend the course. Actually I've already recommended it to my friends and they are all interested in it. As I mentioned above, it is hard for us to get the chance to see the telescope and go to the observatory, so the practical teaching mode of the instructor makes it possible for everyone to experience the beauty of the sky. Meanwhile, the instructor and teaching assistants are all friendly, they are warm-hearted to answer questions and offer helps. Also the content of the course is absolutely suitable for students who are keen on astronomy but do not major in it, since it offers much basic and general information to lead us into the gate.",

                "This course is an interesting course, but keep in mind that Astronomy courses are just Math courses.",
                "I would recommend it to another student if they were interested in learning more about astronomy, but weren't interested in math or physics. It provided a good overview of what the universe is made up of, but the math was very basic and a lot of time was spent on it.",
                "Yes. if he or she is also interested in physics and astronomy, I will recommend this course. It is fascinating.",
                "Yes. This course covers a large amount of knowledge and is ideal for students with an interest in astronomy. However, this course requires a high level of math and physics as a foundation."
