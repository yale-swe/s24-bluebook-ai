                "Pretty loosely structured class. Most days, we would go out and paint on site. We also did other painting exercises and workshops like figure painting and canvas stretching. It's a pretty fun experience (when it's not too dark or cold). I like that the majority of the class is spent on actually painting rather than talking about work. We did spend time on critiques, but it never felt draining. I don't really have any negatives for the class.",
                "This is an excellent course. It is very fun and engaging, but keep in mind that it is a serious commitment. You will spend quite a few hours painting every week (both in class and for homework).",
                "Strengths: All of our live sessions were so fun. I liked that you were able to focus on your own work and everyone was super passionate in the class. The assignments were fun and not too restricting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more crits! I really enjoyed the last two weeks of final crits. The time of the class was really inconvenient and should not be done again. The class ran through the entirety of dinner so people often struggled finding time to eat. Towards the last half of the semester, it got dark too early and the rest of the class felt entirely useless because we didn't have other plans.",
                "Strengths: we each got a portable easel for the semester and were able to paint on-site at a variety of places on or around campus. The atmosphere was relaxed and creative. I felt there was room to experiment and very little pressure to perform a certain way. Weaknesses: That said, I wish I had received more critical feedback that would have pushed me to do my best. The class was at times disorganized.",
                "Lots of time spent painting! I enjoyed the long studio but I wish the class was earlier in the day. Lack of sun, cold, general tiredness pass 5:30 seemed to really affect the class. I wish the class was earlier in the day, or split over two seminars.",
                "I loved the teaching and the adventurous on-site nature of the course. In a perfect world, the class would either be shorter or split up into two chunks of time. If the length of each class is integral to the course, however, it would be great if the class were earlier in the day.",
                "Strengths are that we were thrown right into the subject matter. By week two we were painting outside. This was also a weakness. I would've preferred more in class demonstrations",
                "This course is great in that it is very flexible. It could be improved by providing more instruction."

                "Yes! Sophy is a great teacher and well-liked. The course itself is super fun and gives you the opportunity to paint which is exactly what I wanted. I loved that we got to go onsite to different locations. I wish I could take it again!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone even marginally interested in painting. Observational painting is challenging but rewarding--it has a certain life to it that painting from a photo reference doesn't. It's a long class period but it doesn't amount to much when you include travel to site, set-up, clean-up, etc. The final project allows for much more freedom than the earlier assignments of the semester, so you can use the observational skills and apply them to the style of painting you prefer or specialize in.",
                "I would recommend this class to all Yale students, art majors and non-art majors alike. The class was great and Sophy was very insightful and obviously brilliant.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is passionate about art and who is willing to dedicate quite a few numbers a week to painting outside of class."
