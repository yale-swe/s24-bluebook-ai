This course helps me to form my original idea about history and politics and what I want to do for my vision. Professor Garsten also provides very helpful feedback on paper!",
                "Writing skills, thoughhtful class participation, close readings",
                "I learned a ton about western political thought, a body of work that I find deeply fascinating and essential for understanding our modern world. I learned to interact closely with text and to parse out incredibly difficult thinkers - we would often try to sift through the works to identify the most pertinent pieces, and I loved that. I also appreciated Professor Garsten's emphasis on connecting our learning to our lives and belief systems; it felt like every day, I was learning something that really mattered to me, and I was always excited to be in class and discuss.",

                "This course allowed me to develop critical skills for engaging with and understanding the progression of political projects across history.",
                "I have developed much of my close reading, comprehension and analytical skills. I have learnt to read a text closely and pose questions to aid in my understanding of the text and to challenge the author on their views. I have learnt to engage with the texts studied in a classroom environment, practicing listening and participating in argumentative discussion in a non-dominating and respectful manner. The assigned essays have allowed me to work on my HP writing skills and challenge myself, finally producing a piece of work in HP where I was satisfied with the finished product of one of my essays and proud of its reception.",
                "I felt that the rigors of this course built my ability to understand how texts interpret and utilize history and politics. I learned the thoughts and theories of a broad range of Western writers, and the process of the application of those thoughts and questions over history to the present. The density of reading also trained me in the method of rapid absorption and analysis of text.",
                "I learned about modern political and historical thought in the Western canon and gained a background of highly influential thinkers who directly laid much of the groundwork for political thought of the ages leading to modernity and modernity itself. I learned how to critically assess an author's work and write meaningful papers taking an author and formulating a thoughtful argument. I also learned how to participate in meaningful and balanced class discussion."

                "As someone who wasn't totally on board with directed studies first semester, this class was actually a great way to reel me back in -- we went over a lot of topics that really interested me and engaged in some thoughtful discussions. However, I think in general H&P is a class that requires a lot of care in its subjects, and while Garsten was good with mediating that, DS is a space where sometimes dangerous conversations can be held because students are left unchecked, such as in discussions on class religion or race.",
                "Strengths: Professor provided very helpful feedback and was kind and encouragingly constructive during office hours",
                "Strength: every book is so insightful and I could only hope we have more time reading and discussing them. Professor Garsten is a huge strength!!! extremely kind and knowledgeable professor that inspires you. you will grow so much from this course if you are willing to put some efforts into it.\r\nWeakness: not particularly about this class but just hope we have more time to read and discuss, but I'm sure ds has tried its best.",
                "class discussion was always very dynamic and engaging, the questions were perfectly in between abstract ideas and application to real world",
                "I thought this course was near-perfect - I might cut some thinkers that I particularly disliked, but in terms of how the course was run, I could not have asked for anything more.",
                "Primary text focused, small group discussions accompanied by weekly lectures, integrated curriculum, phenomenal faculty.",
                "I think this is a super strong class; I have very little to say in terms of weaknesses. I think our class discussions were structured very well, which really helped facilitate my understanding of the texts, which were often difficult to dissect alone.",
                "This course was very strong in allowing students to look closely at central questions and to expand upon their areas of interest. At times, it may have been useful to start with a slightly broader introduction when the texts and their contexts were particularly unfamiliar.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- covers a broad range of historical and political works from the western canon \r\n- gives a substantial platform for reading and discussing HP further in a modern context\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- sometimes the speed at which the course is covered sacrifices depth for breadth \r\n- despite the broad syllabus, at times certain thinkers felt significant to western thought but were not studied or others were covered too quickly",
                "DS moves at an incredibly fast pace. I think this can be considered both a strength and a weakness of the course. While we do cover a lot of material within the course, at times it does feel difficult to keep up with the overall workload. However, the reading list was enjoyable.",
                "The strength of the course is the discussion. All of the conversations were highly analytical, probing, and focused, making intelligent use of the text(s) of the day. I thought that as a whole the readings were fantastic and fascinating, though I agree with other students who question the curriculum. Some writers, due to the build of the curriculum, got less attention, which made their concepts a little more difficult to follow."

However, you get to stick with a great group of people who all know what you've been through and I think that's the most special thing.",
                "Yes, the professor is amazing and the readings are amazing",
                "YESSSSSS!!!!!! TAKE DS AND TAKE ANY CLASS WITH PROFESSOR GARSTEN!!!!!!!!",
                "definitely the best discussion section for ds i had in either semesters",
                "I cannot recommend this course highly enough - it is the best class I have taken at Yale, and if that is the case when I graduate as a senior, I will not be upset. I was intellectually stimulated and challenged each day coming to class, I was pushed to my limits with the papers (in the best way), and Professor Garsten knew exactly how to bring out the best in our class with the discussion topics and facilitation.",
                "yes if you enjoy talking about history and politics",
                "I would highly recommend DS, and H&P in particular, because the questions asked are incredibly relevant and challenge us to wrestle with our own intuitions regarding moral and political thought.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Its part of DS obviously, so Id recommend the program as a whole to those who love to read and are interested in texts that have defined western thought.",
                "Absolutely. As always, whether you should take this course is dependent upon what value you are hoping to derive from it. If you are looking for an intellectually stimulating class taught by an excellent professor and with classmates who will push you to understand the subject matter in new ways, then I can wholly recommend this class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend Directed Studies to another student who I feel could fit the program well and would enjoy its structure and content. I thoroughly enjoyed DS, especially the H&P tract, but I would not recommend it to any student wishing to take the three disciplines. Taking Directed Studies and combining them in this way is very particular and does demand a slightly different degree of motivation and interest. I would strongly recommend the HP tract to students interested in politics or history, but I do think that to do Directed Studies they must be interested in all three disciplines.",
                "I would absolutely recommend DS to any incoming student who is interested in receiving a broad overview of the western canon.",
                "I would recommend this course to any incoming first-year (given they can handle the readings). The ability to provoke thought and consideration over so many theories and writings is unique to Directed Studies overall. Historical and Political Thought offers a particular position of study as well, toggling many lines of analysis, from deep reading to historical citations to comparisons to modern day.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if their first semester of Directed Studies went well and their interest in Western historical and political thought also expands in modern times, which I found to be more useful and directly applicable to the political theatre of today's world. For this reason, I found the class highly enjoyable and useful.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the humanities and big questions of humanity. Among all three courses of DS, H&P gets closests to dealing with the human condition. What is human nature? What is the government? What is the role of religion in human history? Is there progress at all? In this course, I learned about what we have thought of, what we have tried, how we have failed, and what we can still hope for. No matter what you do in the future, these questions are worth pondering on at least once in your lifetime as a human living in society. Although I might enjoy DS literature the most content-wise, I have gained the most personal growth in H&P. It has inspired me to explore why I should care, what I believe, and what I can do. Although far from getting a definitive answer, at least I'm thinking. The value of this course is beyond reading the books themselves. It's not just about what has come before, but also about what is yet to come."
