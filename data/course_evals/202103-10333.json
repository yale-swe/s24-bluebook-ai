                "I feel as if I grasped a far more fluent knowledge of the fashion industry through this course. Additionally, my writing was refined immensely through Professor Krawetz's feedback and instruction. This course was challenging but offered a level of growth and development with my craft and knowledge that I am incredibly grateful for.",
                "I learned how to properly articulate my arguments in a concise way.",
                "-while i was aware of close reading before this course, i really do think that because of it, i am now able to better analyze texts at a deeper level and develop my own opinions, instead of just taking in information as fact",
                "Throughout this course, I greatly developed my academic writing. I learned how to criticize pieces of academic literature and and analyze various styles of dress in a very insightful way",
                "ENG 114 helped me develop the skill of writing academic papers, something which I hadn't been introduced to in high school (I'm international.) The class touched upon a variety of different varieties of academic writing, beginning with close-reading and lens analysis before culminating with a ten-page research paper. Aside from the course's theme, we discussed strategies for argumentation and revision, before applying them in workshops throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nAs for the course's theme itself, I learnt quite a bit about fashion, pop music, and the possibility of \"close-reading\" both of them.",
                "This course helped to transform my writing from a lower high school level to a much higher university writing standard. I developed skills of communication and insightful discussion through constant practice with my peers. Furthermore, because of the specific nature of the courses focus, I learned more about topics of fashion, identity, and authenticity than I had ever known before.",
                "I learned how to write an academic paper in the style of American universities and cite in Chicago style, which was useful for me as an international student. I also learned how to think critically about fashion and music and articulate complex thoughts in class and in my papers.",
                "Definitely learned a lot from the world of fashion, but also learned necessary researching skills needed to write a paper at Yale."

                "I think this course was extremely successful, maybe put music and fashion more in direct conversation with one another.",
                "As a seminar course, it absolutely requires a student to be actively engaged with the content to succeed. There is so much literature and content that you consume as a scholar in this course that you leave it feeling a sense of improvement in your own abilities as well as an increase in knowledge. This course had a level of rigor to it that would be a lot more intimidating if you are not interested in the subject. It's an incredibly lenient course, although grading was certainly a bit stressful. I think that I was fortunate going into the course with a really solid foundation in writing, but I can imagine that not having a particularly strong foundation in writing would make it much harder to feel successful.",
                "This class was amazing! The readings are super interesting and always relevant (we talked about Olivia Rodrigo, Lady Gaga, BTS, Taylor Swift). Class discussions are fun and welcoming. High recommend!",
                "strength: since it was a seminar format, i learned so much from listening to my classmates\r\nweakness: the format of each class was pretty similar, and sometimes the discussions faltered (but not too much), and most of what i learned/took away from the class was from the other students (but the prof did a great job of guiding the discussions)",
                "The strength of this course lies in the structured progression of assignments, both in terms of the actual assignments and the development of these assignments. The former followed a nice growth in difficulty and page count from a short 5-page paper to a 10-page research paper (which was divided into several smaller assignments over several weeks to make it easier. That being said, all assignments were graded with about the same general scale, so poor performance in the first assignment could put you in a hole that you'd have to dig yourself out of. Aside from that, we had several workshops and discussions within small groups in the class for 0-15 minutes on various different parts of assignments such as ideation, argumentation, and structure to help us out with approaching completion. \r\n\r\nWhile the content of the class was interesting on a surface level, I found the reading assignments to be a little disconnected from what preceded occasionally. The content was, however, organized exceptionally well from a classroom discussion standpoint.",
                "A major strength of the course was the engagement of the Professor with the students. Specifically, I attended office hours appointments weekly to aid in my understanding of the standards for the writing assignments. Another strength was how we constantly had many discussions in different sized groups which helped with peer discussions. One weakness was I would say not enough small group discussions.",
                "Strengths - the readings were very engaging and well-chosen and the themes of the class were personally very engaging to me. I also enjoyed the freedom we had to write about topics that were of personal interest. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the course moved painfully slowly in the beginning in particular and felt very patronizing at times, particularly because the readings about writing just stated the obvious and were generally unhelpful. It would have been more useful just to expose us to more examples of academic writing about fashion and music instead. Maybe this was by nature of the course being an English seminar and not an Art/Fashion/Music History class, but I felt that a lot of our arguments were grounded in our opinons/the opinions of academics fairly removed from the fashion industry itself; gaining more material literacy and learning more about fashion history really would have helped improve the level of rigor in our arguments.",
                "Strengths: Great Discussions took place every class, and classroom environment was optimal in which everyone felt comfortable adding to the Discussion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Deadlines for papers come up quick, and I felt like more should have been done to send our first paper in terms of workshopping."

                "Absolutely! I think that it definitely helps if you are interested in the subject because I can imagine that not having a particular passion for the topic can make this course a lot harder to enjoy. Professor Krawetz is an amazing professor and loves interacting with students and suggesting further avenues of research that relate to our particular interests and gears the course content to a very expansive direction in which students are able to take liberties in the particular direction of interest that they have.",
                "HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Always looked forward to this class and the discussions.",
                "yes, especially if they are interested at all in fashion and music, because you are able to develop your writing skills while going in depth about different artists.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I felt very comfortable sharing my ideas in the environment of Professor Krawetz classroom and the content of the course was highly relevant and interesting. I was asked to think about fashion, dress and music in ways that I had never even thought about before and I feel much more confident in my writing and analytical abilities.",
                "People who are interested in fashion and fashion studies may enjoy the content of the course, as it covers a lot of different eras of fashion as well as academic work in the area such as Susan Sontag's Notes on Camp. There's also a bit of a discussion on the interplay of fashion through music and music videos from artists like Lady Gaga, Bowie, and BTS, but I would say fashion was the primary focus. The course culminates with a \"fashion pitch,\" where we had to create a mood-board for our own fashion collection and write about a thousand words describing it (as a review or from the POV of a designer.) If you are someone who loves to design, draw, or make fashion, this might be perfect for you; a lot of people in my class made exceptionally creative fashion pitches which blew me away. That being said, however, the fashion aspect of the class can be a little bit of a double-edged sword if you aren't someone super interested in fashion prior to the class; I personally found the material interesting, but it could get a little abstract. \r\n\r\nI would recommend this class with certainty to someone who wants to explore the interplay of fashion and music while also developing their writing in a creative environment, as we had quite a bit of freedom with the choice of topic for all of our assignments before culminating in the fashion pitch with avenues for digital art and design. I would advise people with no special interest in fashion to take a different ENG 114 class, as some of the other instructors may be a bit more experienced with regard to developing your writing ability.",
                "Yes. If a student is interested in building upon their writing skills especially as a freshman, I would recommend this course. Additionally, if one has interest in topics of fashion or music, this might be a very interesting course for them.",
                "I'd only recommend it if you're really interested in the topic of choice - especially if you're a very confident writer, the course can feel very patronizing at times and it was less intellectually challenging than my high school English class. That said, the readings are fantastic and the papers are a great way to make the class more challenging/engaging because you can really make them as complex as you want to.",
                "Definitely! Professor Krawetz is awesome and is apparent that she is interested in not only teaching her students about fashion but helping us become better writers."
