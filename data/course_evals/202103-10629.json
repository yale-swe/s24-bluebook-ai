                "Philosophical essay writing, seminar style class discussion and a lot about games and Go!! The opportunity to meet someone from DeepMind. I also think the philosophy of games is a slightly niche but very very interesting field and actually pretty broad.",
                "I learned about Philosophical concepts in a very relaxed environment. It's a great first introduction to philosophy (especially if you're weaker in the humanities). We read papers, made criticisms, engaged in Socratic dialogue, presented interpretations of the text, and suggested solutions to problems in the text that we saw.",
                "Reading philosophical papers, critically discussing their ideas and developing original papers",
                "A good introduction to philosophical thinking in general. I had no concept of how to create philosophical knowledge before this class, but I feel much more prepared to jump into a more tradition philosophy class after this.",
                "Learned how to write a philosophy paper and engage in philosophical discussions. Also, how to speed read a reading.",
                "I learned how to write a philosophy paper and think philosophically. This class introduced a unique approach to tearing apart an authors work that I have not quite experienced before. I look at games, especially the video games I play, in a completely new light. I was also made aware of other perspectives regarding games.",
                "The class helped me with reasoning and my ability to organize thoughts for a philosophy paper. I also really enjoyed listening to other peoples comments, as they brought up new ways to interpret what we were discussing.",
                "I learned how to write a philosophy paper, developed a better understanding of how to analyze and refute author's theses, and now understand how asking many questions about a particular subject can give us a better understanding of it.",
                "Generally, I learned to read and write philosophy papers and to consider and develop my own philosophical arguments. More specifically, I gained a really sturdy and exciting framework for thinking about all kinds of activities and why I do them, for thinking about what society values and what our \"ideal society\" would be, and insights into topics ranging from rule systems to justice to rationality to intrinsic and instrumental value, all from the launching point of games. I developed mastery of Bernard Suits' framework for understanding games and activities in general which is pretty niche but super cool and surprisingly generalizable. I also gained really cool and fascinating insights from the other students every class.\r\nMost importantly, I found this class to be a really exciting and helpful introduction to philosophical discussion and writing. Professor Maxwell is excellent at facilitating this; he elevates each students' arguments to their most refined form in class without overwhelming the conversation space, and he gives helpful and guiding feedback both in comments on the midterm paper and in one-on-one meetings in preparation for the final paper. I learned to think in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, hypotheticals, and philosophical trial and error, all of which can be terrific tools for evaluating or analyzing basically anything in the world.\r\nWe were assigned one or two papers (or chapters of The Grasshopper by Bernard Suits) for reading before each class, and Professor Maxwell did an excellent job at walking us through the arguments we had read and making sure we understood what we were discussing before we really dived into it, again without ever pushing his interpretation or taking up a large amount of space in the discussion.\r\nThe class deals with anything you can think of that fits in the category of \"playing a game\" (in fact, we spend lots of time considering if this category exists and what falls inside or outside of it). This includes computer games, board games, sports, playground games, anything. We try to figure out what these have in common and what they don't and come to some very interesting and impressively relevant conclusions about activities, good, and society writ large.",
                "As a first-year, this course helped me get my feet wet with seminar-style classes, as well as philosophy in general. I learned how to be a critical thinker\/reader and reader. Communicating your thoughts both on paper and with your peers are crucial to this class, and invaluable skills you will inevitably learn through enrollment.",
                "Listening and reading comprehension for philosophical papers; writing philosophical papers, debate",
                "Close analysis of philosophy papers, developing arguments, and basic understanding of logic problems."

                "Occasionally some of the discussion was a little cyclical and although The Grasshopper was a brilliant book to read, sometimes talking about it was a little less engaging. I wish we played more games! It would have been good to have a group work project as I think that these are effective ways to bond the class. I also wish I had been more confident in expressing my ideas in class as I would have gotten more out of it.",
                "Strengths: really fascinating topics, very different from what you might expect the course was about, but in a good way\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that come to mind",
                "It might sound strange, but I think it was a pretty good intro philosophy course. It's not the kind of course that will teach you the works of famous philosophers, but more so allow you to do what they do using a subject matter that seems obscure but is actually rich philosophically.",
                "Strengths: the collective discussions, getting to talk about games, the professor is very down to earth and expressive, little pressure on contribution and the reading responses, a whole lot of feedback on the midterm paper\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: felt lost regarding how the reading responses are evaluated, would have appreciated if there was a smaller philosophy paper to write before the midterm as a form of practice, some readings were overly complicated which led to seminars being lacking but the professor takes control quite effectively",
                "I really enjoyed the format of the class, with a reading and reading response due before each class, along with two papers. The reading responses were really low pressure and not stressful, but they helped me keep up with the material. (I also loved the guest speaker from Google.)\r\n\r\nAs for what could be improved, Id have to say more games! I really enjoyed when we played games and analyzed our experience afterwards. I also would have loved to spend more time on game theory in the class.",
                "Reading assignments are very manageable and taken from interesting works, and the in class discussions flowed smoothly.",
                "I'm inclined to say that this class was all strengths. Professor Maxwell is very excited to engage in and facilitate discussion of this material, and he does a terrific job of bringing out the best insights and arguments every student has to offer. In some ways, it feels like the topic of games could be substituted out for any kind of category that allows for in-depth philosophical analysis, but I think that because every student has extensive personal experience with games and game-playing, everyone feels like and is an expert with truly valuable insights to offer once we are sitting down and discussing it. Additionally, the blend of low stakes and deep meaning that comes in games specifically allowed us to have truly deep and powerful conversations about justice, value, ideal societies, and a lot of stuff that come close to the meaning of life without anyone feeling unqualified our out of their depth.\r\nI felt that the class strikes a truly impressive balance between depth and breadth, allowing for a full and sturdy understanding of The Grasshopper, the book that serves as our main text throughout the semester, while also allowing us to have meaningful discussions of constitutive rules, gamification, and the slightest bit of game theory, along with every other notable definition of games or game-playing that exists within and outside of the world of philosophy. I think some students felt like our conversations became a little repetitive around the middle of the semester when we were mostly dealing with The Grasshopper, though I generally felt fulfilled and excited by every class. Nonetheless, it could have been energizing and effective if we had actually played more games, either in class or in optional out-of-class meetups organized by the Professor, especially around the middle of the semester. In addition to being fun and bonding, these common game-playing experiences can and did allow for specific points to reference and play with in in-class discussions.\r\nOne last potential field for improvementthe class, as it is now, allows for a really wonderful atmosphere between students and a kind of collaborative, fun, and deep basis for friendships through class conversations. However, this potential could be fully taken advantage of if we had done just a bit more of getting to know one another (even just our names and where we are from, etc.) in the first few classes.",
                "Strengths: Professor is engaged and involved in the writing process, participation is valued, students lead class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The topic gets redundant by the end of the semester, but that is to be expected",
                "The reading responses seemed mostly pointless. Also we only got grades for the 2 papers so there is virtually no indication of success in the class. It was a very interesting course though.",
                "It was an interesting topic and each reading challenged you to look in different ways. It was difficult to have speaking time in class."

                "I would - but ensure that they are aware this focuses on the philosophy of games, not game theory or sociology of games. The course delves into so many interesting aspects of games and the essays are very broad for the most part. I also learnt how to play Go which is a game I have always wanted to play and really loved the Movie screening of Go. Professor Maxwell creates an inclusive class environment and helped facilitate good class discussion.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in the topics you will find the niche discussions and readings very enjoyable",
                "Absolutely it is a frat first year seminar that is very manageable and interesting.",
                "Yes. Professor Maxwell is an extraordinarily interesting guy, and it is clear that he truly enjoys teaching the class (it wouldn't be a first year seminar otherwise). I even think this a good class for STEM kids to try out the humanities because the subject matter lends itself to be logical and technical at times.",
                "I highly recommend this class to students who already appreciate games. This class is much more enjoyable if you have some sort of background in games, whether it be sports, video games, or board games. The professor is a huge  gaming nerd himself so you never feel as if you are overextending when sharing your thoughts. Feel free to share personal experiences regarding games.",
                "Yes! Id preface that by saying it isnt a game theory class, focusing less on strategy and more on what it means for something to be a game.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to take a course in philosophy, especially those who have not studied philosophy in the past.",
                "100% yes. Especially if you are a person who enjoys having deep, specific conversations with friends and playing with different ideas and models for thinking about stuff, this is THE class. It was the highlight of every week and often I would find myself telling all my friends outside of the class what we had been discussing or getting lunch with other students from the class afterward and continuing discussions of the class material then.\r\nThe class is best when you listen intently to classmates and aren't afraid to offer your own opinion. Professor Maxwell is, in addition to being a terrific educator overall, a great role model for being a good listener and a careful philosophical thinker. \r\nOne notethis class does not really deal with game theory and is less mathematical than one might expect. Still, there were lots of STEMy kids in the class who (I believe) enjoyed it a lot.\r\nI wish every class at Yale felt like this one did to me in terms of rich intellectual content, joyful conversation and disagreement, careful guidance and framing from the faculty, and no busywork or unnecessary and irrelevant metrics of success.\r\nIf you like learning through in-depth conversation, consideration of various models and viewpoints, and developing arguments with examples and counterexamples, this class is awesome.\r\nGames are cool, philosophy is cool, this class is cool. Yes.",
                "Yes - if you're interested in philosophy or just looking for a fun first-year seminar this course is great!",
                "Yes because the workload was very manageable and the classes were always on different interesting topics and all of the content could be related to yourself.",
                "Yes. Discussions in class were always fruitful and helped you see different ways of thinking."
