                "I learned SO much in this course. Most importantly, I learned the reasons why women's reproductive health evolved in the way it did over the last 300 years or so. Many of the reasons surprised me; they were extremely different from the forces changing women's reproductive health today. \r\n\r\nI also learned how to write effective introductory paragraphs for history papers, which is something that none of my history professors had taught until Prof. Eisenberg!",
                "I learned so much about reproductive history, especially about pregnancy, childbirth, and abortion in the 19th and 20th centuries until Roe v. Wade. Also learned about contraceptives, reproductive technologies, eugenics, and feminism in the 20th and 21st centuries.",
                "In this class I learned so much about first person sources and how to research in them at Yale. I also learned a huge amount about the topic, obviously.",
                "I learned so so much about reproductive health in this class. I have learned relatively extensively about this topic in previous courses, but Professor Eisenberg is incredible at challenging what you think you know and fostering critical analyses. I also developed a lot of writing skills.",
                "Wow this class was amazing. Please please take it if you are at all interested in womens health. You will learn so much history and context that has been missing from conversations around reproductive health that are crucial.",
                "I learned how all politics is reproductive politics and vice versa. I learned about how intricate yet basic the power dynamics are that govern humans and how universal they are and deep into all areas of life.",
                "Best course I've taken at yale. Take it",
                "Rich knowledge and understanding of reproductive health history in the United States. I really loved the emphasis put on challenging our preconceptions and engaging critically with the material."

                "Strengths: This is easily the best course I have taken at Yale. Amazing selection of readings and videos assigned each week, book club project, primary source group project. I'm glad reading responses are required, because this keeps everyone accountable and means everyone knows enough to contribute to class discussions. I really like that the reading responses can be informal bullet points. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only thing I can think of is that we might spend a little too much time watching videos in class. Those videos are certainly important and they get us to think, but maybe some of them could be assigned as viewing prior to the class, so we can spend more class time talking.",
                "Strengths: Ziv is awesome! Very knowledgeable about the topics. Also, I really enjoyed the cohort assignments, especially the book club. It was such a great opportunity to read two great books I would've most likely never read otherwise. Also, all the other readings for each week were very carefully selected and were incredibly informative. Weaknesses: sometimes seminar could lean more towards lecture but other than that, no weaknesses",
                "Professor Eisenberg is such a caring and passionate instructor. This is shown in the effort he puts into our discussions and the amount of comments he makes on our writing. Only criticism I would have is maybe having the final essay prompt be less open ended, but at the same time I did ultimately really like the primary source aspect of this paper and other assignments in class.",
                "Sometimes awkward because people wouldn't speak in class.",
                "This class is great, the book clubs let you really dive into one area that seems interesting to you, and the final paper also lets you pick what you want to learn about, so it is actually engaging. The weekly readings were very well chosen, and the responses for them were not stressful. Pr",
                "The readings are very well selected, Professor Eisenberg is incredibly knowledgable and kind, and the class sessions are well organized and engaging. There is no major weakness in this course. I always left this class grappling with things we had discussed, which is I think one of the most rewarding experiences you can have in a course.",
                "Strengths: the engagement and conversations with my peers as facilitated by the professor \r\nWeaknesses: it felt like all the readings said exactly the same thing",
                "Honestly, Im struggling to think of any weaknesses. Im pretty obsessed with this class.\r\n\r\nStrengths: critical thinking, great discussions, fascinating readings that are pretty manageable to complete,"

                "Absolutely! This was the best course I have ever taken at Yale, and I expect interest will only increase next year due to the Roe v. Wade leak. I know it's not being offered next year, but I really hope Professor Eisenberg reconsiders! I know it's such a hard class to teach and the topics are very heavy, but it's an amazing and important course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! Especially if you are pre-med or want to go into the health field, it is so important to learn about the historical legacies of reproductive health. Especially now with debates over abortion, learning about the history of abortion from the 19th century to now was so helpful. I also really enjoyed our discussion of reproductive technologies; it totally changed the way I view pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and fetal technologies. Also, Ziv is such a great and kind professor. I really enjoyed his presentations about the various topics and the funny video clips he would include as well. The workload isn't too bad too.",

                "YES. it is beyond worth it to take",

                "Yes",
                "I have not stopped talking about this class since the first day, and would recommend it to literally any Yale student. It is truly fascinating, both in and outside of class. All of my friends know how obsessed I am with this class and theyre all planning on trying to take it after hearing me talk about it all semester. My favorite class ive taken in my time at Yale and truly a must!!!"
