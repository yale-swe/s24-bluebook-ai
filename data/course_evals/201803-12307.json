    "I learned nothing because I had Pham Quang-Lam. Pham has many weaknesses and no strengths, unless you include the ability to confuse you until you want to rip out your hair as a strength-- that's the only thing going for him. I want to start by saying that his class had about 15 students at one point. Then it dropped to 10 people, and in the end, only 6 were left to suffer his expressionless face and monotone voice. One student didn't bother to come to class and honestly I wish I did that too because I learned nothing from Pham. I can learn more from banging my head with Stewart's Multi Calculus textbook. By the end of Pham's class, I lost 20 IQ points. He is the worst instructor; if you think I'm exaggerating, I'm not. Ask others from different sections, and they will tell you the same thing. He has an arrogant and condescending tone: once he told me that tenth graders can do this problem in a few minutes, so I should be able to do it in a couple seconds. If you have the unfortunate luck to be stuck with Pham, I beg you to save your soul and switch out of the class. Anyone, and I truly mean anyone, is a better instructor than Pham. He sets up a problem and refuses to finish it, even if you ask him to. He will tell you \"the rest is easy, and it's just basic math.\" Or he will confuse you further until you simply give up. Despite having three Master's degrees, he can't teach because he doesn't know how to.  Many times I thought out leaving through the open windows. In conclusion, if you're in his class, drop it immediately. And. Run. Away.",

    "The Gas can be more forthcoming about the midterms and final",
    "Taking Math 120 with Lam Pham made me realize how much I took math teachers in high school for granted. Lams weakness is his inability to effectively teach a class. Over half the class had stopped attending lectures because of Lam. I would leave more confused after class than I was at the start. The Ximera modules and the textbook were lifesavers for me.",
    "I think the class does a good job in providing the information we need to know and helping us review and sum up all of the information. The weakness is the disparity between the quality of the teachers. It seemed to me that some classes had an advantage because they had a different teacher.",
    "I thought that there was too much material for one course. It would be better if this course was split in two - one course on the first half semester and one course on the second half. This way, more time could be devoted to subject material. Instead, we skimmed material in class, and were forced to learn most of it outside of class.",
    "Thd material is studied thororughly although the speed seems to be too high at times",
    "Ximera is a really good component of the course. The course has a lot of bad teachers, and I feel mid semester evalutaions on teachers given by students are not addressed in any way. If a teacher is seen not to be teaching well, I think the department should talk to him about changing his method of teaching to suit student needs and that teacher should be supervised when delivering lessons until this need is met. That's just a suggestion."

    "Only take this course if you absolutely need to. Or else do not take this class. Math 120 is the most poorly-taught math class at Yale.",
    "Yes, it is a good class to take if you want to expand on a highschool math.",
    "Take Math 120 with anyone other than Lam Pham.",
    "I would recommend this course only if it was required of them for their major.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. This course teaches too much, and forces students to learn on their own time.",
    "Yes, as it is valuable for a lot of different fields.",
    "If you get to take this class with Sudesh, go ahead and take it! He is amazing! I learned more at his review sessions than I did in class. If you don't get his section, run- fast. From what I gathered from my peers in other sections, I can make an informed judgment that there are very few good instructors in the course. Most of them are really smart and know the material but have poor methods of delivering lessons. My instructor was Lam Pham. Please know this name and avoid his section at all costs. He is the worst instructor I have ever come across in my entire life. He explains the simplest of topics in complex theoretical ways that are far beyond the scope of the course. From his attitude, he cares very little about doing what students are comfortable with to facilitate learning. Even when we informed him of the measures and materials other instructors are using in other sections to improve content understanding, he was unwilling to do the same for us. Lam Pham is the WORST math teacher to walk this earth and if you have to take a math class with him, kindly accept my deepest condolences to your final grade."
