                "Much more knowledgable about the toxicity of our environment and green chemistry alternatives.",
                "Learned a ton about toxicology, green chemistry, PFAS, environment impact on animal, ecological and human health; learned about environmental injustices, which I did not realize were so pervasive.",
                "I got a deeper understanding of harms in our world, and how chemicals can be modified to prevent harm.",
                "This course was a great introduction to the field - it covered a breadth of topics with just enough to gain familiarity and understand the field.  The lectures, and particularly, discussion sections helped me understand different perspectives.",
                "An awareness of green chemistry\r\nAn appreciation for the complexity of toxic chemicals and the hazards posed by exposure",
                "Loved this class. Every aspect. I had a really busy summer at work so just wish I could have put more time into it because I could have added more value to the discussions and probably enriched my own experience.",
                "Besides Sten's course, this was absolutely the best course I've taken so far. Interesting and challenging.",
                "I really knew nothing about green chemistry so that was fascinating and fun to learn. I had a general knowledge of some of these topics but it was great to do these deeper dives.",
                "I developed an understanding of chemical compounds toxicology and their capacity to be either designed in a green way or to replace the compound with a greener compound.",
                "Ignorance was bliss before taking this course! I'm looking at everything with a critical eye now. But I'm also feeling more empowered by the Green Chemistry aspects of the course."
