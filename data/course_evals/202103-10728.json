Through our assignments6 reading reports, a book review, and contributions to the study fieldI refined my skills in academic writing as well as close\/critical reading.

                "Strengths: Online recorded lectures\r\nWeakness: Very large class",
                "Strengths: The content was interesting and I thought it was good that we focused on learning a wide range of topics rather than going in depth into just a few, since this was an intro course.\r\nWeaknesses: The book report was unnecessary and was an absurd amount of work for something that barely even related to what we were learning.",
                "Strengths: the material is really interesting, the class is structured in a way that is very conducive to actually learning the material Weaknesses: I think the book review assignment could be modified to be a little more useful to students",
                "Strengths: no final exam, non-cumulative exams, manageable workload, and relative ease with which you can relate the content to your daily life\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes very long textbook readings",
                "The strength was in the content and the lectures. They were extremely interesting and informational.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging and interesting subject matter; lab component provided fascinating insight into psychology research; enjoyed the book report\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was not very well structured; it seemed as if each day, the instructor would draw a random topic\/subfield of psychology from a hat to discuss. I ended up with a very piecemeal understanding of psychology, without a good sense of the underlying tenets that make up the field. Additionally, lectures were unbelievably shallow; each class consisted of going over a few vocabulary terms, glazing over a few case studies, and watching a few video clips on the various topics. Although this is an introductory class, I would have preferred if the instructor picked fewer topics and went more in-depth on each during class. Also, the course readings were largely pointless--textbook reading were exorbitantly long, assigned articles and videos were loosely connected to the course material, and none of the readings appeared to factor into exams\/assessments. Likewise the reading summaries we were asked to write were effectively busywork and could be done without reading a single page.",
                "Taught by a bad professor. There was a book report assignment that was really just busy work.",
                "The first strength of the class is that the exams were non-cumulative and the final was before reading week. These two things made the stress level in the class much lower. Additionally, the reading responses were very straightforward and easy. The lab participation component was fun! Additionally, Professor Holmes was extremely kind and engaging with students. He would talk to any student that wanted to talk whether that be before class, after class, or even in passing on the street.\r\nI wish that the lab participation component counted as a grade as well. I also wish that the book report had a couple more options for the books that you could read.",
                "N\/A",
                "This course is strong in that it is an easily digestible course that is straightforward; there is no ambiguity as to what is expected of you or how things should be completed. The content is well-organized and exams offered few surprises. Weaknesses are that the course isn't very engaging and it is really on you to study; the first exam really is an exercise in figuring out what the exams look like (hint: memorize the lecture slides and practice exams!). It's your standard big lecture, content heavy course; I should also note that there isn't much of a community beyond the class (ie. no study group, section, etc.)",
                "Strengths: the lectures were fascinating  and I felt like I learned something interesting and new each class. Weaknesses: the lack of discussion sections or opportunities to engage with the course other than the one paper\/reading responses made me often feel alone and lost in the course. I never knew how to study for the exams and felt like the exams did not accurately reflect my learning as I would get full credit for the long and short responses, and then get plowed by the multiple choice",
                "This course was, unfortunately, very difficult to feel engaged in. Perhaps, it is because I took a similar course in high school in a much smaller group, but I was generally disconnected from the course. Professor Holmes included lots fun examples and videos in his slides, but it was still hard to pay attention! I also struggled with the reading responses; the feedback for them was very little, and even after emailing my TF for insights, I found that I didn't know how to improve.",
                "Very good course",
                "There could be a few more interesting topics but overall it was great. No weaknesses! Loved the course.",
                "Professor Holmes was a great lecturer, the examples from lecture were very relatable and useful for understanding definitions. There could have incorporated more modern psychology research paper readings instead of having so much from out of the textbook to minimize overlap between lectures and the textbook",
                "Strengths was that everything that was on the tests were taught in lectures. It could be improved if there were discussion sections but I understand that is not always possible due to large enrollment. Weakness was that after lecture I would forget most things that were talked about. I remembered everything by writing out my notes over and over again. TFs provided great feedback on response questions. Practice exams significantly helped.",
                "more guest lectures could be cool",
                "Strengths: very engaging topics and everything is explained clearly",
                "Strengths of the course are the topics discussed and weaknesses are that the exams seemed to only test memory of the information.",
                "The course material was interesting, however, the assignments were not very relevant and I did feel very engaged with the course.",
                "I like the format and grading format.",
                "I did not love the way mental illnesses were taught in this class. The professor basically had us just watch videos of people talk about their debilitating mental illnesses and how they dropped out of college or had to give up on their dreams because of them which wasn't super fun if you suffer from any of them and are worried about this.",
                "Strengths: Holmes is an engaging lecturer and he does a good job of contextualizing the content in day-to-day life. Some of the topics are also quite interesting, and the diversity of themes keeps the class fresh. \r\nWeaknesses: This class doesn't require much critical thought, and as a result ends up being mostly busy work. The majority of your time will be spent memorizing terms for the exams or writing weekly reading responses, both of which are time consuming activities. The final paper is also unnecessarily long, and the mandatory 5 hours of research time feels excessive.",
                "One of the strengths of the course is that the assignments in the course really focus on application and taking what you learn in the class and applying in the real world. One weakness, though not significant, is that lectures are slightly rushed. The class is supposed to be 1 hour and 15 minutes, but Professor Holmes would often end the class in 1 hour. I wish that maybe he could slow down and lecture for the entire period.",
                "The strengths are the lectures, the weakness are the tests which involve memorizing all of the content from every lecture.",
                "Strengths: the course was very well-organized. For each of the assignments and tests in the course, we were provided with very clear guidelines on what to expect and how to best tackle the assignment\/test. Overall, the support provided for this introductory class was great. The assignments and tests were also very straightforward and easy; I don't think I spent more than 1 hour on any particular reading response and more than 2 days studying for any particular test. To study for the tests, you basically had to rewatch the lectures and memorize the key terms and concepts for the exam; it was more of an exercise in recalling the lecture material during the exam than thinking about it abstractly and applying it. You can also get away with not reading the textbook in this course, since the exam barely asks about experiments\/key concepts from the textbook and you can just write your reading responses on the outside readings assigned in the syllabus. (The textbook readings are very long, so halfway through the semester, I just stopped reading it).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought the summary part of the book report was an unnecessary component of the book report that just felt like busy work; the books were so long and contained so much material that it was impossible to adequately summarize everything with the level of detail that the rubric requires. I ended up skipping over 3 entire chapters of my book in my summary just to stay within the word limit. I felt that the reading responses suffered the same issue: the level of detail required conflicts with the required word limit. I often had to cut out a lot of the meat in my reading responses because it could not fit within 250 words. I recommend that the word limit be extended to 350 words to remedy this issue.",
                "I think that weekly discussions with TFs would be beneficial. I feel that there was little communication in this class and think that discussions would help greatly",
                "The syllabus is completely accurate, so it's easy to know what to catch up on if you miss a class. The lectures are pretty concise, and the professor is an engaging lecturer.",
                "I appreciated the taped lectures",
                "This class was well taught and interesting except sometimes it felt like we were doing a lot of busy work and couldn't really enjoy the material.",
                "Great introductory course. I wish some concepts could have been covered in more detail, but it is an intro course. The book report seemed a bit random, and not much guidance was given in lecture or from TAs so this could be revised.",
                "The course was very well organized and taught in a way that was very easy to learn, understand and apply. However, the course could have been a bit more engaging.",
                "Strengths: I'm really glad the class was recorded. I learn better and feel more engaged by watching the recordings, and I felt like the course format allowed me to learn in the way that best fits me. I also really liked Avram. Despite being a large lecture, I felt like Avram took the time to get to know me, always answered my questions via email or office hours, and genuinely cared about his students. The practice exams were very helpful in preparing for exams and the workload was very reasonable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The practice tests often had sections that were not covered in that specific section of the course, making it harder to study appropriately. My TA never provided comments on my reading responses despite taking off points each time.",
                "My strength in the class was my engagement in the lecture, but my weakness was my way of studying. I learned that just reviewing the lecture notes and doing research is the best way to study for this class.",
                "Strengths: The topics themselves were generally interesting. Professor Holmes did a fairly good job of trying to keep the material engaging, by including an array of activities\/videos\/visuals.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not expect the class to be so memory based. I thought it would be more applicational, but typically we were just tested on definitions and concepts. Also, I believe some of the assignments did not facilitate any academic engagement - the reading responses were not engaging and the application part of the Book Report did not seem useful or helpful in any way. The teaching fellows also did not really aid in my learning. When we had exams, we would only receive the score and no feedback\/no papers given back. I understand that the class is large but I never knew what I got wrong on the tests. That was my biggest concern. Also, during the review sessions, sometimes the TA's did not know answers to the questions or only gave vague descriptions.",
                "Strengths: This course was very organized with the lessons\/ homeworks matching the syllabus perfectly. \r\nWeaknesses: I do not know if it was the timing of the course or location in an auditorium with cushioned seats, but many of us felt very sleepy during lectures. The content was interesting but it was not a very engaging course.",
                "strengths:\r\n- clear lecturer - delivered information well\r\nweaknesses: \r\nno rounding or curve\r\n- not direct small group aspects\r\n- never saw old tests to get feedback on",
                "Strengths: lectures were recorded, grading was easy, instructor was personable. Weaknesses: exams depended on rote memorization, TFs were mildly involved (if that), and review sessions were unhelpful. The book review was okay but overall, the entire class lacked guidance.",
                "It was what I expected for introductory psych. You get out as much as you put in.",
                "Cons- Large class size makes getting to know the professor hard\r\n\r\n- Wide variety of information to go over \r\n\r\nPros- Assignments give you lots of time",
                "It was very helpful that the lectures were recorded for later access, especially when studying for exams or in amending notes from lecture. Also, practice midterms \/ exams were very useful study tools. \r\n\r\nIn general, there would always be a bit of a disconnect between the textbook readings and the lecture content; I think that a greater emphasis on the relevance of the textbook readings (as well as shorter but more germane readings) would make for a better class experience.",
                "The lab\/study requirements seem most beneficial for students planning to pursue psychology as a major, so switching course policy so that 5 labs\/study credits are only required for those prospective students may be a move to consider in the future",
                "Strengths: good overview, easy-to-understand content, exams are adequately challenging but very feasible to ace. \r\nWeaknesses: partly out of necessity, very surface level understanding of every topic\/lacked nuance, the textbook readings essentially overlapped the lecture so were not super necessary",
                "The structure of the class was great. The exams were based very heavily on memorization, and I feel that it would have enhanced our learning and understanding of the content if we were examined more on applications of the material we learnt.",
                "Strengths- professor Holmes is a great lecturer! He was relatable and very chill to interact with. Im glad I took the course with him. \r\n\r\nWeakness- the final book paper was pointless and graded poorly. It added nothing to my understanding of psychology and was overall a big waste of time over my thanksgiving break.",
                "Strengths - the class was not too difficult to study for during midterm season.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the format for the class as a lecture may not be the best format.",
                "I liked the professor, and the content was very interesting.",
                "I thought it was taught very well",
                "The information often became overwhelming, and I found it difficult to study all the material when it came to exams. Potentially creating a study guide for students could allow them to focus on certain concepts would prove helpful.",
                "This course was very detached from staff. There wasnt any section or engagement beyond the lecture.",
                "It was well taught and the lectures were engaging, but maybe more help and input from the TAs could have been nice.",
                "Strengths psychology in general is very cool and it was taught pretty well.\r\nWeaknesses course structure. Too much textbook reading and not enough like actually scholarly or generally interesting articles about psychology. Tests were just memorization games. Book review was a meh assignment.",
                "Its a large course so it's hard to maintain constant engagement and a lack of thoughtful assignments is apparent. Maybe some 1 on 1 TA sessions?",
                "Sections can be introduced for more engagements with teaching assistants.",
                "strengths: logical progression of topics,  relevant readings\r\nweakness: tests were too specific",
                "Very well organized class with slides and recordings posted after every class.",
                "The lecture slides were comprehensive and additional helpful resources were given to prepare for exams, etc. I think more interaction with the TFs would have been beneficial (not a discussion section, but maybe check-ins?). I also think weighing the first exam less would have been beneficial to many students as I saw my own performance improve significantly between the exams.",
                "I think we should have discussion sections, and not just lectures.",
                "My biggest critique of this course is that it needs to have a lot more critical thinking. I don't think the premise of memorizing the names of a bunch of theories and studies and regurgitating them on a test is engaging for many people. I think some ways to achieve this are to ask more questions that get students thinking, even if they are just rhetorical. Like: \"how do you think babies learn?\" And invite students to really think this through for a moment before diving into the lecture. Also shift the content from being just memorizable stuff to more complex critical thinking material.",
                "I learned a lot of how to learn in a lecture setting",
                "The course was interesting and very well organized. The readings for each lecture prepares you for the lectures. The powerpoint didn't have much text on them so you need to rely on your notes, and the slides don't tell you what to focus on when studying.",
                "A strength of this course was the class engagement, a weakness was the speed at which the instructor spoke.",
                "Great professor and helpful TAs.",
                "Strengths: the material is easy, the expectations are clear, and the workload is pretty manageable \r\nWeaknesses: I found the book review to be a pretty useless assignment, and the exams could be oddly specific at times (although always fine if you put in the work studying)",
                "The strengths of the course is the amount of help available from the professor and the teaching fellows. Also how well structured the lessons were. The slides were posted every class as well as a live recording of the lecture. One weakness was the amount of detail needed for exams. At some points, especially in the beginning for the first exam it was a little overwhelming to study for them.",
                "The lectures are the strength. Professor Holmes does an incredible job. The textbook is probably the weakest part. It is unnecessary.",
                "The strengths are in that I feel I learned a lot; the weaknesses are that the course covers a large breadth of material and I found parts of it boring.",
                "A strength would be the lectures and engaging slides and awesome professor, a weakness would be the grading on the reading responses.",
                "I switched to the psych major going into my junior year but still needed this class for the major. I had taken a bunch of other intro level social science courses so I was familiar with most of the material. Given that, my level of engagement was still surprisingly decent. The material for intro psych is inherently interesting, but it's still possible to mess that up with dry lecturing, but the material was well-presented. The exams are not bad at all. Reading responses are also pretty harmless.\r\n\r\nOnly thing that I did *not* like was the book review assignment. First, I'll cover what I did like about it: It forced me to read a really interesting book that I otherwise wouldn't have read, and the things I learned from that book will definitely stick with me. That's the end of the positives, though. \r\n\r\nThings I did not like about it: The timing. It was due the TUESDAY AFTER November break. I know the assignment was available all semester. That doesn't mean anything though -- people have other assignments to do at other points in the semester, and very very very few people are going to start on this more than a week before it's due. That week is November break. No assignment should force people to give up part of their well-deserved break to focus on school. That's not what a break is for. The due date needs to be moved -- one week later, or before the break.\r\n\r\nSecond thing: The mismatch between the assignment prompt and the rubric. You should know everything you need to do for an assignment from reading the prompt, plain and simple. That's not the case with this one. The rubric specifies ENTIRELY NEW SECTIONS of the paper that are not mentioned in the prompt. And that's not to mention the little things. Every single section of the rubric mentions things that are not mentioned in the prompt. If you do not read it before starting your assignment, you better be ready to do some significant rewriting (and if you did not read it at all...oof). Do some things go without saying? Yes. Obviously, they want a paper that flows well and is free of proofing errors. Other things, though, not so much: describing a book's value\/contribution to the field in your intro (the prompt does not even mention an intro), placing the book within its context in the broader field of psych in your argument section (this is completely out of place in this section, also not mentioned in the prompt), and I could go on. The prompt needs to be updated so that students can know everything they need to do without cross-referencing the rubric.\r\n\r\nSaved this for last because I think it's pretty unlikely to change: the summary portion. Your summary has to be 1000 WORDS. This is excessive. The last time I had to summarize a book at length like this was middle school. It was tedious, monotonous, and despite all of the fuss they make in the rubric about \"doing college-level work,\" this did not feel like a college assignment. Any student here can give you the main arguments of a book in a paragraph. I can see the argument for this: requiring such a long summary makes it more likely that people have to actually read the book to complete the assignment. Fair enough, but I don't think this is necessary. The argument portion of the essay, where the student has to give their own original thoughts and use critical thinking, is far more interesting. If this were made more in-depth and the summary section was greatly shortened, I'm sure who read and who did not would still show up in how nuanced the student's argument or application is, and would still distinguish low\/med\/high quality essays.",
                "Can be made more interactive",
                "A strength of the course was how each midterm tested the same amount of material since they werent cumulative. I feel that teaching the course in order of the textbook chapters instead of jumping around would be helpful.",
                "The course is very well structured and documented, therefore it is easy to look back through the material and revise. I really enjoyed the lectures, the pace kept me motivated and focused. Each lecture was supposed to last 75 minutes and we usually finished in an hour. Sometimes, i would prefer to pace the class a little slower as few lectures had a lot of content for only 60 minutes.",
                "Strengths: Professor Holmes makes lectures interesting and fun with his slides. He also tries really hard to make them entertaining. Weaknesses: the book review assignment was definitely a grade booster, but it seemed trivial and not super helpful. It was interesting to read the book, but I could have done without the summary portion of it (and just write an essay about the application). It also could have been better articulated what was on the tests in lectures v. the textbook. Also, I received absolutely no feedback on the reading responses which could have helped. I never knew what I did wrong, and meeting with TAs was not always easy.",
                "The strength of this course is that it provides much breadth to the topics covered in psychology; however, its weakness is that there is not much interaction that students have with the class. This could possibly be achieved with sections where students could discuss readings.",
                "This is a lecture course. There is little opportunity to participate, but professor holmes always makes himself available for office hours. The expectations are very clear, and the exam reviews are so so helpful. The syllabus is followed precisely, and if anything, Professor Holmes will extend deadlines rather than push them back. The tests are clear cut and the reading responses give you an easy way to keep up with the readings and boost your grade. Some of my friends said it was boring occasionally, but it depends on your engagement with the topic and if you vibe with holmes' teaching style.",
                "I really liked the story-like way in which we learnt about studies and experiments, and the interactive demonstrations- it kept me engaged. I think that having example tests was really important for me to be able to do well in terms of learning how to study- I think every class should have example tests. In the learning chapter in our textbook we learnt that having information reinforced through testing helps us retain information- so why would we not have the opportunity to take a test by yourself to learn what it will look like and help test yourself on the information. I hope that next semester my econ course will have that but I doubt it will.",
                "Book review and very general",
                "For a large lecture class, it was very well\r\norganized. The lectures were thorough and supplemented by external reading assignments. The exams were comprehensive but not too hard. I especially enjoyed the book report assignment. My only complaint would be not enough feedback on my performance in the course.",
                "The course was well structured but could perhaps rely less on memorization.",
                "A big strength was the engagement of the lectures. They were all very well structured and it was easy to understand concepts by going to lecture. A weakness that was kind of unavoidable was that every topic was relatively general because we had to cover so many, and the amount and variety of content was sometimes difficult to manage, but that is just part of an introductory course I think.",
                "Strengths:\r\nGood teacher\r\nGood Times\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nTo many people\r\nBad teacher fellows",
                "The course involved definitely a lot of wrote memorization, and it would have been nice to go more in-depth in certain areas so it would feel like there is a reason to learning what you learn. Although, it is introduction to psychology so it does make sense that a broad overview is necessary. It is cool to see how the information you learn is applicable in the world around you and your day to day interactions though.",
                "Strengths: this course is exactly what it says it is, an introduction to the all the fields of psychology. Prof Holmes' lectures are excellent - engaging (despite class size), interesting, and clear. Most TAs are helpful and accessible too. Weaknesses: I wish the TAs could have provided more feedback and comments for reading responses or at least a reason for giving us the grade we got.",
                "More guidance on how to study for exams",
                "I think a huge strength of the course was offering recordings of the lectures. i think a weakness was how little engagement we had with our TAs.",
                "Strength: exams are a good reflection of the material taught in the course, great professor, accessible TAs\r\nWeaknesses: While I did certainly enjoy the book, I also felt that the assignment itself was a bit unnecessary when placed on top of three exams. With the paper and exam placed so close together, it was difficult to manage the course towards the end.",
                "A huge strength of this course is the impressively large amount of material that is covered in only a single term. Furthermore, for an intro class, the plethora of information can only help to give a crystal clear preview for what's to come if you do indeed decide to go forth with the psychology major. Another strength, although not as significant, is the fact that all the lectures are recorded and posted on the Canvas page for the class which allows students flexibility if they can't attend class for any reason. With all that being said, the class' biggest strength can also double as its greatest weakness. With all the information that is covered in a very short amount of time, it's quite difficult to retain a significant amount of information and as such, tests can be quite difficult at times.",
                "It was super helpful to have the lectures streamed and recorded (in good quality), practice tests, and review sessions. The material was engaging as well, and Professor Holmes made us feel welcome to seek our guidance or help. I was a little unclear on grading\/how I could improve my grades for my reading responses, though, as (understandably), we only received comments on the first response.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that we learned new material every week, so it was engaging, and you we got to learn about a broad variety of topics. One of the weaknesses is that it was not always clear what the expectations were for the weekly reading responses, and you were not told what you got docked points for. However, as long as long as you make connections between different parts of the readings, these are not graded too harshly.",
                "strengths: individual tf's was nice and the reading responses were an easy, good way for grades.\r\nweaknesses: the professor's voice was always pretty low and it was a little hard to feel engaged.",
                "Good breadth in all areas of the subject and a great lecture style. No complaints at all.",
                "Strengths: The learning objectives, student expectations, and intent of the information provided in the lectures are clear. The course information is interesting and efficiently organized. \r\nWeaknesses: The time spent completing the assigned readings is not equivalently evaluated on exams in comparison to the lecture material.",
                "Professor homes made this course very interesting through his lectures, but the class was not very interactive. Although he showed many videos, there were not many opportunities to answer questions or talk to peers about the material. I thought the class was very well organized.",
                "I think the weakness of this course is that it is not very engaging. It's more just listening to someone talk rather than engaging with the material which could be a bit boring. Also, there's not a lot of feedback given in this course on assignments. I don't learn about how I can do things better in this course, I more or less just got the grade. This could be improved by having a more engaging structure or way that the students can interact more with the material or teaching assistants or professor. There is also so much reading in this class that gives little time between classes to complete at times. A way to improve could be to possibly introduce methods to read the chapters that could be best for the class. A strength of this course is that it covers a lot of material which helps get introduced to different parts of Psychology so a student can figure out what they are most interested in.",
                "I liked the organization of the class. The schedule on the syllabus was clear and useful, and the teacher always clarified due dates in class. The posted slides were very useful, and there were always fun pictures and videos to explain the topic. The class was fast pace since there was so much material to cover, but as a result, we learned a lot - just not in depth.",
                "half of test was not explicitly covered in lecture",
                "I dont think that the book review really builds on any of the other skills in the course or is necessary.",
                "I think the strengths are the material and that the topics were very engaging and Professor Holmes did a good job engaging such a large lecture and I think the weakness of the class was the lecture format because students can't ask questions or as the professor to repeat something if it didn't make sense or wasn't clear.",
                "Great lecture format and accommodations.",
                "Prof. Holmes was generally engaging, and I enjoyed the book review final assignment. My TF, Hanna Hillman, gave very useful feedback on this assignment. The reading responses were not as useful to learning and often felt frivolous.",
                "Strengths: Holmes is a good professor, interesting topics presented in usually fun and interesting ways, no exam during finals period. Weaknesses: test grading was a little all over the place--sometimes you would get marked down for not writing down information that was not even asked in the question. I think this comes down to more communication needed between TAs and the professor. The grading on reading responses also felt all over the place (terrible grades when I actually tried hard, great grades when I put in no effort), and in general, I don't think having to do the reading responses really added anything to the class.",
                "I think the professor should be more confident in his lectures.",
                "This course met my expectations for a lecture intro course. Professor Holmes was a great lecturer, even if the material he was covering was dry at times. Some of the studies we covered in class were really fascinating and revealed a lot about what it means to be human; however, these studies weren't the focus of the exams, which were mostly memorization based. The rest of the grade came from writing assignments which, in my opinion, were not useful for my learning. At the end of the day, I felt that I learned a lot about the field of psychology from this course without a big workload. But the things I was graded on were not the things that I learned.",
                "One strength of this course are its method of examination, which included both paragraph, short answer, and multiple choice questions. If one studied and did their work, the exam was straightforward and sufficiently challenging. Other strengths of this course was how helpful and accessible the professor, Avram Holmes, was to students; the overall pacing of the course; and, lastly, the amount of work was fair. The most notable weakeness of the course was that, at times, the lecture weren't very engaging of students.",
                "We went fast but otherwise it was well structured.",
                "I enjoyed having a guest speaker. I think the review sessions and practice tests were very helpful. It could be helpful to have review sessions more often about the course material. I wish things were graded faster. More specifically, I wish the reading assignments were graded before you wrote the next one, so you knew what to fix for the future ones.",

                "Strengths: the vast array of topics covered that managed to dive in\r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish there were optional sections so we could discuss the topics more easily, lack of ability to see tests afterwards",
                "It's a lecture course so it's pretty straightforward. I really loved having the recorded lectures available online and I hope this continues post-pandemic because being able to review what was said in lecture word-for-word before exams was a huge asset. There are a lot of deadlines which cannot be extended without a Dean's Excuse which is really limiting. Everyone has a bad day, and if a little more lenience were afforded for deadlines, especially when students take the initiative to request extensions with advanced notice, I believe it would contribute to a much stronger classroom atmosphere. I also wish we could have signed up for some sort of optional weekly discussion section.",
                "I think this is a really strong course. The instructor is great and was always very engaging during lecture. The material is very interesting as well.",
                "Lecture was too big",
                "The strengths of this class was Professor Holmes and his lectures. Everything you needed to know to do well on the exams Professor Holmes taught in his lectures. The weaknesses was the lecture slides. Though enjoyable with all of the fun animations and pictures, I wish they would've done a little better job outlining the important points of the lecture. Nonetheless, this was an amazing course overall."

                "Maybe, depends on how interested in psych they are",

                "I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in psychology. It lays a good foundation if you are interested in the subject and if you follow the structure of the course it's easy to understand the material and do well on the exams.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in psychology and have no background, or if you need a manageable social credit",
                "If you are interested in learning more about the human brain or have a general curiosity, I do recommend taking this.",
                "If you are looking for a thorough introduction to psychology--no. If you are looking to complete a major\/distributional\/pre-med requirement--yes.",
                "Only if you're interested in the Psych major.",
                "Yes! Professor Holmes is an amazing professor who genuinely cares about the field of psychology and the well-being of his students. The topics you cover are engaging and interesting and the grading was fair the whole time.",
                "Yes, it is very interesting and you learn a lot of cool stuff",
                "This is a good gateway course to Psychology. If you are interested in Psychology or Psychology related majors then you should take this class. If you want to take a PSYC class for the sake of taking a PSYC class, take an elective that is more directed to your specific interests instead.",
                "This is a standard, run-of the mill survey intro psych course. There wasn't much exciting here, but I would recommend it if you're looking for a broad baseline understanding of psych and need a class that is straightforward and of a relatively low workload. I wouldn't recommend if you've already taken psych in high school or if you already have a vested interest in psychology; this course fulfilled the pre-med psych requirement for me and was a gut course for many other students.",
                "Yes, the lectures and topics were interesting but the course was not well organized for student engagement.",
                "This course did well covering a topic that is very broad and complex, so I would definitely recommend it. It's also needed to take many other awesome psychology classes!",
                "Yes, gut and if you need to.",
                "Yes! Super interesting, great professor and low workload.",
                "Yes, it's a pretty light and accessible intro level course that will prepare you for more psych classes and has applications in everyday life",
                "Yeah I would recommend it to students who want a brief overview of psychology or want an easy class. Very low work, but a lot of memorization for tests.",
                "its intro psych, take it if you are interested in psych. idk",
                "Yes, even though I took IB Psychology and a neuroscience class in high school I feel that this class completely changed how I view the mind. I learned a lot about myself and people in general.",
                "I would recommend the course a survey of psychology and to learn the key terms associated with each psychology domain.",
                "I would recommend this course because I thought it was interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they have never taken any psychology course before (even in high school) because if they have, there will probably be not a lot of new information. If they are just taking the course to fulfill a requirement for a psychology course, I would choose a different one.",
                "Yes, this is a good interesting course with a fair grading policy.",
                "Yes, especially with Professor Holmes",
                "It's a ton of work and hard to get a good grade overall. Take intro psych with another professor",
                "This is not a gut. If you are a pre-med in need of a psych credit, I would recommend looking elsewhere. Doing well in this class requires you to spend large amounts of time memorizing information for the exams. This is time which you should be investing in your other STEM courses. You should also know that the class is not curved, so you need to score highly on the exams to do well. Unfortunately, the tests often have a few confusing questions which derail students and can make it difficult to hit the higher percentages needed for an A. There is also minimal feedback on your performance on these tests, so understanding what you did wrong can be difficult.",
                "Yes I would strongly recommend this course to other students. Psychology is a must learn subject because the things you will learn in class will apply to your life. Professor Holmes is an excellent and engaging lecturer who really cares about his students. The TAs for the course are also phenomenal. I like that all of the assignments are not geared towards simply regurgitating material from lecture, but actually applying concepts from class to the real world. The lab requirement, reading responses, and book report all showed me just how powerful psychology is in the everyday world.",
                "If you are really interested in psychology and are good at route memorization this is a class for you. If you are looking for a gut class, dont take this class unless it's pass fail.",
                "Yes, intro psych is generally a subject that is fascinating to learn",
                "Yes I would if they are interested in psychology",
                "If you're interested in getting a basic overview of psychology, then yes I would take it. It's an intro course with lots of other students, so don't expect much one-on-one engagement.",
                "Yes I think Avram is a great professor and very interesting topics are covered in this course. It is a very straightforward course in the sense that if you put in the work, you will get a good grade. However, with its current format of 3 exams, a paper, 6 reading responses, having to read a book, and participate in 10 studies, this course was not as \"chill\" as I would expect an intro course to be-- it was in fact a lot of work.",
                "Yes, good introduction to the field to see if people like it.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I think most students should take this course as it feels more generally applicable to life than just one specific area",
                "Yes. I enjoyed this course and feel it was far better designed than most large introductory lectures at Yale.",
                "Yes i would, because the class was very interesting, and the workload was light compared to other classes.",
                "I would stand neutral here. If you have never taken a psychology course, I would potentially recommend it. However, if you took a Psych course in high school like AP Psych, we cover a lot of the same material. Thus, I wish I took a more niche psych class. Many of the lectures are interesting, but others are not as engaging. If you enjoy memory based learning, then this may be a class for you, but if you prefer real world application class, then you may want to reconsider.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but maybe a different time slot\/ professor. The content is great but lectures could get boring at times.",

                "If you need this course for your major, then you have no choice. Otherwise, try to find a course that is more interesting to you. If you're taking this course as a premed req, you can find a better option that will fulfill the requirements - try HSHM.",

                "100%",
                "Learning about to human brain throughout development",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in psychology but with little to no knowledge beforehand. I do not know if I could recommend this course to a student who is already knowledgeable about psychology (and wants to learn more), as I did not find the lecture format of the course as engaging as a seminar.",
                "Yes, the course provides a broad overview of all the major psychology fields. Good if youre considering psychology as a major or if you want an interesting and relatively low workload class as a 4\/5th credit",
                "Yes. Especially if Dr. Holmes teaches. Hes funny and relatable. I thought the class grading was very fair as well.",
                "Yes; it is a good social science credit.",
                "Yes! It was an enjoyable class where I learned a lot.",
                "Yes it was very interesting",
                "Yes. The course overall was very relaxed. There weren't a lot of heavy assignments, but be prepared to study extremely hard for exams. Although it is primarily memorization based there is A LOT of information.",
                "Not unless you have to take it. Its only memorization.",
                "Yes definitely because it is super interesting and engaging. If you want to try out psychology, this is the perfect course for you.",
                "Yea its really good to be introduced to psych and this is a solid introduction.",
                "Yeah, it's a relatively interesting course that opens up one's mind to humanity.",
                "Yes, its detailed and provides a lot of necessary info for psychological majors",
                "Yes! I found the topics to be very interesting and I also liked how students get to hone in on the things they find interesting through reading responses and the book review assignment. Prof Holmes was great and the course materials were helpful.",
                "Yes. A good introductory course for potential psychology major, and really in rightful for no-psych majors as well.",
                "yes! it is relatively easy and super informative",
                "Yes, I think the course gave a very broad introduction to psychology, and I gained a lot of knowledge and understanding of the field. It definitely motivated me to potentially pursue psychology as a major.",
                "If they want to learn more about psychology as a field, then yes I would recommend this course.",
                "I took this course thinking I wanted to be a psych major and unfortunately I don't want to anymore. The course teaches you things you could learn in a TED talk and doesn't make you stretch your brain to understand complex concepts. I really didn't like the super memorizing heavy nature of the exams. I wish we were incentivized to engage with the material more and have exam questions like \"offer a critique of this theory...\" or provide an example that might disprove this theory\" that would incentivize us to stretch our minds a little more instead of just regurgitate what was said in lecture. It was super disheartening and pretty unmotivating to study for. \r\n\r\nProf Holmes is kind and offers to help  - but unlike many of my other classes there isn't anything to \"get help with\" really in office hours. The material is just straight memorization and there's nothing to understand. Like you just listen to the lectures and make a quizlet for the exam. \r\n\r\nI also don't like how you don't get the exams back to see where you made mistakes. How are we supposed to improve or learn otherwise?\r\n\r\nI did learn some cool things though which I will use in my life, but overall I wouldn't take this course if I could go back in time.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, this course gives a fantastic overview of many different topic in psychology, and Professor Holmes teaches it in an interesting and fun way.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed sitting in this class and learning about psychology.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Holmes was great",
                "Yes, PSYC 110 is an amazing course that gives students a strong basic knowledge of psychology. It covers many areas of the subject (e.g., social psych, developmental psych, etc.), which allows students to figure out whether they would like to continue improving their skills and knowledge in the field of psychology.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interesting in learning a survey of psychology.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students, especially if they are interested in topics of psychology, development or medicine. This course is very interesting and engaging to a lot of people, so I would definitely recommend it.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course! I think it is necessary for most students to understand the world around them.",
                "This class was okay. It covers a lot of material and is not always the most interesting. The book report was a pain, and the tests require a decent bit of studying. But overall not a bad class and I felt I took something out of it.",
                "Yes, even if you aren't interested in majoring in Psychology I highly recommend this course because it dives into information that is relevant to our world today that everyone should have some level of understanding in.",
                "Sure. A great way to see if any of the areas in psychology might be of interest to you.",
                "Yes, it is good for a basic understanding of the field and the exams are very logical.",
                "I would recommend the course to another student. Overall the material learned in the class is engaging and interesting. I also thought the professor was very nice.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Even if you don't want to pursue psychology, the class is understandable for everyone and very manageable. I thought it was one of the most engaging subjects I had so far.",
                "Not really unless youre interested in the major or want to take higher level courses. It isnt a gut, especially because so many people have already taken a psychology course before.",
                "Yes! I am considering being an interdisc. political science and psych major because of this class. Easier way to fulfill a requirement and learn about baseline topics in psychology (and life), especially for first-years",
                "Yes, I liked it and I felt like I knew how to work and do well in the course.",
                "Not likely",
                "Definitely. This is a wonderful way to gain exposure to psychology and see if it's something you enjoy.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning basic psychological concepts.",
                "I would. I think it provides a good basis for students interested in psychology and it handles the wide span of content it needs to cover pretty well.",
                "Work hard for the first exam.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in continuing on the psychology path or want to learn a surface level amount of psychology related information. I might recommend a different more specific or niche psych class if a student is interested in taking a psychology class but doesn't want to major in it.",
                "I absolutely recommend this course to everyone, it's a great gut course but also engaging for people who are interested in psychology.",
                "Yes, it was interesting and has good readings",
                "yes i think it is a very good introductory class",
                "I would recommend",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. If you have any interest in psychology this is a great course to get exposed to many of its fundamental subfields.",
                "I honestly would only recommend this course to Yale students that are very interested in psychology and possibly want to major in it. From my own experience, that being of someone who is not interested in psychology, but was just slightly curious about it and needed a social sciences credit, the class, at times, took my attention away from my major-specific classes, as upcoming psychology tests, book reports, and weekly book responses piled up. It is not easy to do well in this class if you don't regularly attend lecture, at least scan the textbook readings, and start preparing a few days in advance of the tests. This means that you have to be somewhat invested in the class to a degree which may take some of your time away from classes you might deem more important.",
                "Yes! Even if youre not interested in psych, this is a fantastic course, and Professor Holmes is amazing!",
                "Yes! Even if you're not interested in going into Psychology as a field, this is a fun course that allows you to learn about a cool variety of topics with real-word applicability. Additionally, there is relatively low workload, and Professor Holmes is very accommodating!",
                "Absolutely, more than anything this is a very interesting course and the fact every lesson covers a different topic of psychology.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I learned a lot about the actual material, as well as ways to effectively study  for a big lecture class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it covers really interesting topics and it is a decent introductory course that everyone should take and learn about in order to get a basic understand of the human world.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to those who want an overview of psychology, to see what specific topic they are Interested in. Its also a relatively easy course load, so its great to take this course if the rest of your courses are difficult. i found that the course is interesting, but intuitive  but that is expected for intro to psychology.",
                "Yes, Dr. Holmes is an entertaining lecturer.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because I learned a lot and I there are a lot of important things you can learn from this class to help you get a better understanding of other humans.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who has a remote interest in psychology. It was great to got o lecture and there was a broad spectrum of topics.",
                "Yes, it is genuinely interesting for the most part and doesn't require much work other than studying (nothing more than making a quick quizlet or something) for midterms. There isn't a formal final exam either, which is great.",
                "If you don't need it as a prereq, you still might enjoy this class. Professor Holmes is great, and you will enjoy the content if you have a passing interest in psychology.",
                "I would recommend this course because it will reveal some things other people think that you thought only you thought!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the field of the psychology and wants a broad overview of the subject.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. Overall, I feel that the workload is balanced, the professor and teaching staff was helpful and responsive, and the course material is crucial to moving forward in psychology.",
                "Yes, it is very interesting and generally just an enjoyable class.",
                "not really",
                "I would! It is a fun class wirh a manageable workload.",
                "Yes this course was very interesting. I now think I want to be a psych major. The workload was the perfect amount. I liked the assessments we were given in this course.",
                "yes",
                "Yes! Professor Holmes is great and engaging",
                "Yes! a great course that had wonderful people",
                "Yes, I took this course to decide whether I wanted to pursue the psych major, and though I wont, Professor Holmes was great and I learned a ton.",
                "Yes. even if it does not directly pertain to your major, it is a very interesting course with useful information in any career.",
                "Yes it was interesting",
                "Yes, 100%. If you think you have any interest whatsoever in psychology, this is such a great class to take to get a really good overview of the most important aspects of psychology. The course does go very fast and does not go super in depth with much specifics, but it introduces you to so many areas of psych that you can then do further study in the areas that interested you the most. Plus, it is a very manageable class, especially with Professor Holmes as the professor. 3 non-cumulative exams (non-cumulative for a reason - there's a lot of information to know for each exam but still manageable) and 6 reading responses."
