It was pretty simple to figure out what might be on the exam, and Prof. Cooper was extremely kind presented material clearly and efficiently. I honestly wouldn't change anything about this course  it was exactly what a gen chem course should be, and there were no surprises.",

The final exam had problems we had never encountered how to do but wanted you to apply concepts to figure it out even though it was not something we covered in class. It was difficult to study too because the tests were all so different from the class. Frustrating situation for a student whos never taken chemistry and is studying what we did in class only to be blind sided by an exam.",

The assignments were very conducive to developing understanding and the format of them online through Achieve I enjoyed very much. I also think that the discussion section outlines were very helpful to guiding discussion sections and future studying.",

There were many ways (adaptive quizzes, section review, homework, pre-section quizzes, etc.) to learn content.\r\nWeaknesses: Online homework was relatively easy to answer without much thought by using a few of the allotted attempts, which made it possible to go without truly absorbing content until directly studying for tests, and this became overwhelming. Section was not organized to make students work together on the assignments, and it felt relatively easy to slip through the cracks on learning content if you were busy with other classes. Content is quite hard if you have not had a strong background in chemistry and tests cover content in new ways that are hard to conceptualize if you have not seen the information before."

Professor Cooper is accessible and open, and explains content pretty clearly, but the amount of information to learn and the speed of lectures can make it hard to absorb. The content, which is largely based around equations and rules but also delves into the conceptual basis for these generalities, is pretty interesting, which helps with the workload. Each midterm tested content in ways that felt relatively unfamiliar and each homework took several hours, in addition to other assignments for the class."
