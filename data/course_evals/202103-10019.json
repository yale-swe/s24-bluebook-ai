                "I learned so much history that I didn't know before. I started thinking about concepts like migration, labor, and foreign policy in new ways. I also learned how to do an oral history for our final project.",
                "I learned a lot of history I hadn't known anything about before in this class. It deepened my understandings of things I already expected to learn about, like the Gold Rush, the Vietnam War, overall migration patterns etc. but it also taught me about whole parts of Asian American history I was unaware even existed. It definitely gave me a better understanding of US history overall and allowed me to question certain assumptions about current race relations in the US or about other parts of US history.",
                "An overall introduction to Asian American history, racial formation of both white and Asian Americans, citizenship and belonging and exclusion, and US imperialism's impact on Asian migration trends to the US.",

                "Asian american historical analysis",
                "I learned about how people decide what counts as history, Asian American history, and how to conduct oral history interviews.",
                "Asian American history in high school curricula is often boiled down to the California gold rush, Chinese exclusion, and Japanese American internment. While these are all important facets of Asian American history, the story goes much deeper than those three major events. As an Asian American, I gained a deeper understanding of and appreciation for the history of how this community emerged in the US and the obstacles it faced along the way.",
                "I didn't really gain knew skills from this class, as a senior history major",
                "Skills of contextualization, historical thought, thematic recognition across time, nuance and continuity in within historical themes, similarity and difference among historical themes, complex question and response skills, information translation into discussion.",
                "Fascinating subject knowledge about Asian American history; oral history interview skills, writing about history skills, critical thinking skills; greater perspective and a critical lens on American history and policies; as an Asian immigrant, this course also helped me understand how issues in Asian American history emerged and the ways in which these issues and historical themes still exist today",
                "This class was great for learning a comprehensive history of Asian Americans throughout American history. Professor Lui emphasized key themes throughout the course, which she came back to at the beginning and end of every lecture.",
                "History of the migration of various Asian groups, how they lived in America, and the geopolitics/economics involved in determining whether Asians were included or excluded. There were many poignant moments in the course! If you are Asian American yourself, I highly highly recommend this course. It definitely helped me understand many personal relationships better. The Oral history project is also a richly educational endeavor. This class made me feel whole.",
                "This course taught me a lot about Asian American history in the U.S. that I didn't know before.",
                "1) Learnt how to conduct historical interviews 2) critical thinking: look at arts/news from a critical standpoint using background knowledge of model minority myth/orientalism. 3) skim readings and get the essence of it.",
                "I learned a lot of history (dates, laws, patterns, etc.) and worked on thinking in a more nuanced way about what it means to be Asian American.",
                "This course supplemented my coursework in ER&M and my chosen track in Asian/Asian American Studies perfectly and contextualized much of the learning Ive done over my Yale career.",
                "This class gave an introduction to Asian American history and the methods used to study them, including primary source analysis and oral histories.",
                "I learned how to interpret and synthesize historical information in a succinct way through my writing.",
                "I learned about the legal doctrines, court cases, migration patterns, and movements that made, and continue to influence, Asian America.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of how Asian American communities were formed in the United States.",
                "I learned foundational histories of Asia and Asian Americans.",
                "I was able to contextualize my family history in the larger history of Asian Americans in the US. I gained new insights about the racial formation of Asians and how the model minority myth does not only harm Asians, but is also used to put down other minorities.",
                "Analyzing Asian American history",
                "I loved taking this course! I learned so much about Asian American history and how it pertains to my life today. It was interesting learning about complex patterns of racialization and how white supremacy is integrated at every level of the US.",
                "A great understanding of Asian American history.",
                "I learned a lot about analyzing historical information, especially in the context of specific themes. In this class, I also learned how to recontextualize what I was already taught about American history within the lens of Asian America.",
                "I learned an overview of Asian American history and it was really expansive",
                "Much more nuanced understanding of Asian-American history and racial formation, as well as skills to question the American history that we've been taught before.",
                "I gained a foundational understanding of Asian American history, with emphasis on such topics as Chinese Exclusion, U.S. imperialism, migration, racial formation, and modes of resistance.",
                "So, so, so much. We went through a lot of material; although it says from 1800, we start much before that in order to provide context. A lot of time is spent on understanding the changes in how Asian Americans were viewedfrom curious anomalies to \"aliens ineligible to citizenship\" to the myth of the model minorityand on understanding the construction of America as an actively anti-Asian state. There's a lot of contextualization given to a lot of different areaspop culture, legal cases, military actions, the whole gamut. There's a lot going on in this course, and it was really important.",
                "More insight on general US History as it pertains to Asian American which provided insight on the personal history of my family which was interesting",
                "Through this course, I learned more about the different components of Asian American history - from immigration to community formation, activism and labor. I gained more insight into how changing geopolitical conditions affected migration and labor patterns, as well as how societal attitudes shaped the opportunities or barriers that Asian Americans have faced.",
                "A more comprehensive and indepth look at Asian American history",
                "I learnt a lot about Asian American communities, both alone and in relation to other more widely-taught American history in the 20th century.  I found the course eye-opening, and it shed a lot of light on an under-explored field of history through many forms of media and writing.",
                "Learned a lot about Asian American history and the similarities and differences between experiences of different Asian groups",
                "I learned a lot about Asian American history.",
                "I learned about important landmark legislation in Asian American history, as well as gained a greater understanding of my identity as an Asian American.",
                "I learned about the storied history of Asian in America, piecing together how different events in history affected the perception of Asians throughout history. We don't often learn about the legislation and treatment of Asian Americans, so this class gave me a better insight on how Asians have been silently discriminated against in the United States. This class was really instructive on looking past words in legislation and placing emphasis on how Asians were truly perceived from other racial groups.",
                "I learned about immigration policies and the economic, social, and racial influences underlying my Asian-American background.",
                "This was my first ever history course, so I developed my analysis of historical documents and literature focusing on understanding the language and context of the time period I was reading from.",

                "A mnoexge of Asian American history. How to conduct an oral history interview.",
                "I learned so much about Asian American history! Starting with labor migration to the political solidification of Asian American-ness, I gained a better understanding of race formation and imperial white supremacy in the United States.",
                "I learned both a great deal about the material of the courseAsian American historyitself. I also think the oral history project was a valuable lesson in learning how to tell someone else's story.",
                "This class teaches you so much about Asian American history, its a great foundational course that takes you through Asian history intertwined with American history. It was a lot more extensive than I thought and covered a lot of unknown history.",
                "This was a pretty sweeping survey, starting in the ~1850s and ending with the 2000s. It teaches you the context behind the 'model minority' stereotype, but along the way you also learn about really interesting people who had to deal with violence, legal exclusion, housing discrimination, etc., yet found ways to survive and build community.",
                "I learned a lot about pretty broad themes in Asian American history; even with the themes being broad, we followed them throughout history and learned about them in a very meaningful way. I felt like there was a lot more information on Chinese and Japanese groups, followed by Filipino, and then Vietnamese, Indian, and Korean history in the U.S. Nonetheless I learned about each group's unique (but interconnected) history with and in the U.S. and found that to be very valuable.",
                "Asian American history was never a significant part of my education and I never even considered it something that could be studied because I was not introduced to it. This course taught me the deep importance of my identity and all of the people and events that made things possible for me today and I am so grateful.",
                "Specific historical analysis, broader contextualization of historical patterns.",
                "Broad survey of Asian American history, themes, and key dates. Prof. Lui tended to center our understanding of Asian American history around the formation of Asian Americans as a legal category and the resulting impact on the social, economic, and racial identity.",
                "I learned about the history of Asian immigrants who came to America, and their lives here.",
                "I learned history often overlooked.",
                "Served as a good introduction to Asian American History, unpacking exclusion, containment, and resistance within the community, and recognizing the continuous legacy of racism in this country apparent in urban renewal",

            "comments": [
                "I loved the lectures but felt that discussions about the readings in section were not all that fruitful. I never left feeling like I'd learned much, and I don't think the prompts encouraged the most interesting discussions that they could.\r\nThe reading list was varied and excellent! I also enjoyed the variety of assignments. I didn't love the primary source assignment and wish it had maybe been more flexible. Additionally, it would be great if the four assignments could have been more spread out.",
                "Strengths: Many really great and interesting lectures, good use of specific life narratives to illustrate the broader histories, interesting readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some lectures felt a little rushed. I also felt like the oral history project at the end of the course was a really interesting assignment but I felt somewhat uncomfortable with writing someone else's life story, particularly in the first person, and also particularly as a white person myself writing about the life and experiences with racism and colonialism of an Asian person as if it were my own. That being said I still thought it was a cool project and enjoyed doing outside research to contextualize my subject's specific life experiences. I also think having two midterm and two final assignments felt like a bit much. If anything the four assignments could have been spaced out more.",
                "Strengths: If you know nothing about Asian American history at all, then this is the course for you. Weaknesses: I wish there was more emphasis on South/South East Asians. I felt (as a Chinese American) that we spent so much of the course talking about East Asians and frankly, we take up too much space in Asian American discourse as it is. It felt like a disservice to the other groups of Asian Americans to have just squished the Vietnam War and modern US in the last two weeks.",
                "Professor Lui is a great lecturer and the discussion sections were engaging. The course could have left a bit more time at the end for much more recent late 20th and current 21st century readings and discussions",
                "Great overview",
                "strengths:\r\n- class handout\r\n- great lectures\r\n- engaging readings that are not just nonfiction and from a textbook. also includes fiction, comics, etc. goes over topics and material that is not covered in lecture\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- asian american history is too broad a course to be condensed to 14 weeks, and i feel like there was a lot more that could have been covered about cross-racial solidarity and overlapping power movements.",
                "Strengths: good mixture of sources, narrative style made the material coherent \r\nWeaknesses: too much reading, rarely ever did all of it.",
                "The lectures are incredibly engaging and interesting, and the readings are all very relevant. There are not many weaknesses that come to mind, except perhaps that some of the assigned readings during weeks in which we had essays/exams due in this class made it difficult to actually engage with the readings in section.",
                "This course had far too much reading for a history lecture, as well as both a paper and an exam for the midterm and a paper and an exam for the final. This meant that many students came to section having done little of the reading",
                "This course faces the tremendous task of covering over two hundred years of history in 13 weeks. The preliminary lectures that frame \"asian american history\" through global imperialism set a strong foundation for understanding the scope of the content. However, that sense of international framing and grounding dramatically fluctuated throughout the semester. Especially when discussing the many contradictions of Asian racialization within US Law, comparing Asian to European immigration, and Asian Americans within US popular culture, I felt ill-equipped to have rigorous, historically grounded analyses. More can be done on behalf of the lecturer to consider the overall framing of the course and the transitions between the content from one week to another. I would have benefitted from clearer pedagogical emphases on key takeaway themes from lecture.",
                "The content of the class was definitely a strength, it was quite an interesting course. I liked the source examination in the syllabus, was helpful in obtaining primary & secondary source analysis skills. Liked the diversity of delivery methods in lecture, audio and video clips were very nice to stay engaged and more of that could definitely be helpful. \r\n\r\nAmount of reading attached to class content sometimes convoluted the most important themes to retain for future units.",
                "strengths: Mary Lui is an amazing lecturer and person (go to her office hours to connect more!); course readings are dense but absolutely fascinating; the course is a lot of reading and writing but all the assignments (especially the oral history project) were super interesting and enjoyable to do; just the amount of perspective and critique you gain on American history and politics is rewarding \r\nweaknesses: none",
                "Lectures were engaging and fascinating and I loved listening to Professor Lui lecture. She incorporates historical arguments throughout her lectures so she isn't just going through people and events but connecting them to thematic trends and arguments about the importance of different events.\r\n\r\nFor an introductory course in history, there was way too much reading in this class. If there had been less reading in this course I would have done much more of it, but so much reading was assigned every week that I just wouldn't even start. Sections were very split between people who did all of the readings and people who did none of the readings, which was awkward. It felt like there was little in-between.",
                "Strengths: I've never met a lecturer as good as Mary Lui. The lectures flow so well and are so intriguing. I never once felt sleepy! There are so many quotes from her that I wrote down verbatim. \r\nWeaknesses: the reading load can get heavy VERY quickly (e.g. if you are a prospective student, check the weeks when you're expected to read a book and start the week before!).",
                "This course has a lot of writing assignments for it to not count as a writing course.",
                "strength: assignments are well-structured for learning and readings are super interesting.\r\nweakness: n/a",
                "Strengths: This class packs A LOT of content into one semester - I left the class feeling like I'd learned a lot of cold hard facts. There is also plenty of room for personal involvement / family histories, which is constructive and necessary in a class like this. \r\nWeaknesses: There is too much content to cover in a 50-minute discussion section. We were expected to do A LOT of reading before section, so instead of discussing the lecture content (which we all had notes on) or a couple of cool+short readings, it became \"who skimmed the reading and what can we get out of skimming 200 pages.\" Also, not a single mention of Jeremy Lin, which is, frankly, embarrassing.",
                "This course was a great overview of Asian American history. I learned about a lot of events and people I didn't know about through AP US history. The course was constructed so that the themes were clear and it was easy to understand how various common threads connected.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was hard at times to understand what events happened before/after other events. The midterm required us to know the dates of various terms used throughout the lectures, but it was difficult to study for the test because the lectures jumped around a bit chronologically as we discussed different topics like immigration, economic exclusion, family formation, popular culture, etc. Secondly, I think we could have spent more time talking about modern-day issues. Thirdly, some of the essay prompts could have used more clarification. For example, it was difficult to understand what an \"argument\" looks like in the context of oral history. Also, I completed all of the requirements on the prompt for the midterm essay, but I got points taken off because I wasn't detailed enough. Also, the final essay asked us to connect five things (historical, cultural, social significance, and themes of migration and community formation) and I was confused what that was supposed to look like. I would have appreciated more clear and simple prompts for papers and/or examples for how to do what is asked of us.",
                "I wish there were recorded lectures! There was so much information that it was difficult to ensure I was internalizing everything I was learning.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mary Lui is incredibly passionate about what she teaches and has so much knowledge and insight to share Weaknesses: the lectures aren't recorded and slides aren't posted, a heavy workload",
                "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far!! Amazing professor and wonderful TAs! The readings aren't too bad and even then don't require much more than a quick skim. The oral history project was also a unique way to incorporate personal Asian American history into the course. \r\n\r\nProfessor Lui generally doesn't record lecture or post slides. This wasn't a problem for me since I usually came to class (and her lecturing is quite engaging) but I could see how one might appreciate these.",
                "This course was extremely engaging and interesting at every lecture. Discussion sections were lively and prompted well formed arguments and introduced many perspectives and ideas. I have no critiques for this course.",
                "Mary Lui is an incredibly eloquent lecturer and had very well organized lectures. I especially appreciated how she had lecture notes available before each meeting; it made keeping up with her lectures much easier, since she taught Pecha Kucha style. The class is notorious for having a very heavy reading load, but I personally thought the page count was doable so long as you plan and start early. I could say that the broadness of the course is a weakness (the lectures don't go into incredibly detail on every important event/figure/movement), but I suppose that is expected since this is a huge lecture.",
                "The course is poorly organized, with many questions as to relevant content and coherent chronology within and throughout lectures. The content, however, is quite interesting and thought-provoking.",
                "I learned how to think critically about Asian American history in order to understand anti-Asian legislation, the Eurocentric history that's taught in textbooks (which excludes Asian history or talks about it in a whitewashed way), the scope of how the label of \"model minority\" directed at Asians is racist and anti-Black, and issues of xenophobia and anti-Asian hate that persist to this day. It was fascinating to learn about the role that Asians and Asian Americans have played in U.S. history and their unique position. \r\n\r\nThere were a lot more essays in this course than I expected to write. The take home exam, for example, is actually an essay. It seemed unnecessary and too much work to assign a ten page oral history and then a week later assign a final essay as the take home exam. I feel like a creative assignment would have been more engaging and rewarding. Also, the readings could be shortened and be more focused. Sometimes we were assigned to read an entire book every week. I think I would have benefited more from reading short excerpts.",
                "The strengths of this course was the informative lectures and knowledgeable TFs that facilitated discussion sections.",
                "This course was very interesting because there were a lot of important histories and pieces of information. It is rare to get to learn about Asia American history at Yale so it was definitely a great opportunity. However, I think it was a bit too basic and diluted at times. Its just almost impossible to indepthly cover so much. Ethnic groups are left out, histories arent looked at as complexly or through an intersectional lens. I think this course should be broken up and more focused on specific histories or a period of time.",
                "The lecture content was relevant and engaging. It also felt like a special class community to be a part of. For an intro-level lecture course, the workload including readings and exams felt overdone. Course readings and assignments felt perhaps better suited for a seminar-style class and not adjusted for lecture-style learning. I also think a more comparative and relational framework would have been useful. For example, we learned almost none about the history of Latinx immigration and while this was an Asian American History course, learning Asian American immigration without at least a brief understanding the broader scope of immigration felt incomplete.",
                "Very well organized, well taught, Prof. Lui is amazing",
                "Strengths: very engaging and interesting\r\nWeaknesses: too east asian centric",
                "The class was great. Genuinely cant think of weaknesses.",
                "This course gives a good overview of major events and themes within Asian American history. However, because of the scope of knowledge it is hard to get a lot of depth in any specific area.",
                "Course was not very accommodating to the various illnesses experienced over the course of the semester. I really wished there were lecture slides posted at least",
                "Mary Lui is awesome and the course is well organized!",
                "Lectures were very organized",
                "Professor Lui was a fantastic lecturer, and each one of her lectures felt more like she was telling a story rather than teaching history. The discussion sections were super helpful for reviewing and discussing content, and I loved the way that we were able to bring our own familial and cultural experiences into the classroom. My only critique is that there were a lot of big assignments stacked up on top of each other  for instance, papers and exams within a week of each other, and I'd hope that in the future they could be refined or more spread out to make it more manageable.",
                "Prof. Lui is a fantastic instructor who delivers captivating and engaging lectures. The TFs are all helpful and extremely knowledgeable, and the assignments, while challenging, really do deepen your understanding of the course's themes.",
                "The course is well balanced and paced. Remains strong in material and consistent in coursework throughout. Oral history project was an exciting and unique capstone to the semester.",
                "Strengths: Highly, highly engaging. Every time I would go to lecture, I was always thunderstruck over Professor Lui's way of weaving a story together about Asian histories. There's a lot of content to cover, and Professor Lui did a very admirable job of collating that altogether, threading a clear, cohesive understanding of the US and the Asian Americans who live there. I also thought the readings were generally quite interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Unfortunately, I don't think there was enough time to really cover as much as I wanted. I don't think enough space was really given to understand how South and Central Asian Americans fit into the overall picture of Asian American (or perhaps how they don't), and I don't think there was enough time spent on how Black Americans and Asian Americans co-exist. Furthermore, although I was really interested in many of the readings, there were simply too many to really be fully engaged in each and every one of them.",
                "Perhaps more aids better ways to review past lectures and tie them together.",
                "The strengths of this class are the lectures, unit themes, and the reading selections. Professor Lui consistently presented engaging lectures - balancing providing overall historical analyses with detailed narratives on specific case studies. While the class was taught in chronological order with regard to the historical record, the topics that were highlighted in a given week were always excellent and gave students the opportunity to learn a diverse history while being able to make connections to previous units. The reading selections were excellent as well, presenting both first-person narrative accounts of specific events or life histories, as well as presenting overall history. The only point for improvement for this course would be to spend some time guiding students through forming historical analyses. For students who do not have previous experience with history courses, the coursework for this class could prove challenging without that foundation.",
                "Loved the lectures",
                "Sections could be more engaging; conversations often seemed repetitive",
                "The course workload was pretty heavy for me. It was rewarding, but also in the future, assignments could be made clearer by having example papers and oral history projects we could follow along with.",
                "I wish the lecture slides were shared after the lectures because they were very interesting and insightful.",
                "Gave a great survey on important events in Asian American history. I thought the course can be broken up into smaller chunks, but really liked the assignments especially the oral history project.",
                "Lectures and readings were organized and interesting. TA's were great at leading section and gave good feedback. Recording lectures would be incredibly helpful. There were times during the semester where I was either too sick to come to class or wanted to watch over a lecture I attended again and couldn't.",
                "This class was extremely great at piecing together different events in history and was well organized for student learning. Prof. Lui was an amazing lecturer who skillfully put together her slides and materials to paint a cohesive story. A small wish I had was to give more opportunities for students to act upon the feedback they received in the class. Nonetheless, I believe this class is a must take.",
                "Strengths - lectures were organized, readings were interesting, and assignments bolstered my understanding\r\n\r\nWeakness - sometimes the lectures used colonial rhetoric (there was one lecture where Professor Lui said \"Jap\" when internment camps during World War II. I think this is a part of history that we should learn but would have wished Professor Lui to caveat that this is a harmful/derogatory term); the assignments piled up at the end (Oral history and the final exam paper felt like a lot)",
                "The strengths were that the course material was interestingmaking it was easy for me to engage with the materialand the papers had broad enough topics for me to really get to explore a facet of Asian American history that interested me. A weakness was the brevity of Asian American history covered post 1975, it left the ending of the class material feeling abrupt.",
                "Course was taught by a great professor and teaching staff. Lectures were clear and were told as engaging stories with themes. Readings could be modified to be less heavy especially around midterm",
                "The content was very interesting, but it was hard to follow along during lectures at times. It would have been helpful if the slides had some information, instead of only pictures. It was very easy to miss dates during lecture, especially because the material was not taught completely in chronological order.",
                "Strengths included lectures and section.",
                "Strengths: broad overview, assortment of sources, images, and documents to pull from, genuine curiosity from classmates, profs, and TAs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough context about groups outside of Asians, which leaves the content feeling hollow, unclear and transparent analyses of material, and could use more diversity in Asianness",
                "I think almost everything about the course is great. The only thing I wish could be improved is if slides were shared with the class and we could go back to look at visuals from lecture presentations etc.",
                "Mary Lui is the strength! She is an amazing lecturer and I learned so much because of how engaging she was. Sometimes, I wish that the course was able to cover all Asian American groups but we definitely would not have enough time. Overall, the course does a great job of not just focusing on East Asians, but on South Asians and Southeast Asians as well.",
                "Some of the lectures at the end were a bit fast and hard to take notes from, so it could be improved by slowing down the lectures after the midterm a bit. South Asian histories were also limited compared to East and Southeast Asians and could be more present in next years version",
                "The strengths were definitely the readingsgreat selection and breadth. Mary Lui is also a great lecturer, but I wish that the final lecture had been more focused instead of attempting to summarize broad themes. I also wish that we spent more time talking about Asian American as a term, and terminology in general. For weaknesses, people in section weren't always very engaged, which was frustrating and made it sometimes feel pointless to be there.",
                "Strengths: professor is very knowledgeable and passionate, my TF was amazing (the best TF I have had so far!), assignments (although not always easy) are really fun to do and make you really engage with the course material, and the broad themes were connected to real experiences and people which helped understand them historically. This has been my favorite history course at Yale. \r\nWeaknesses: none; TFs and professor are always willing to help, go over your grades/assignments with you, and everyone is more than willing to understand circumstances and obstacles you may be facing, so just communicate with them.",
                "This is an amazing and in-depth look into Asian American history, especially East Asian in origin. Lots of care is taken in discussing the journeys and histories of Chinese and Japanese Americans. More coverage of the Asian diaspora, specifically of South Asian and more Southeast Asian American populations would make this class feel more thorough in its syllabus.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lui is a wonderful lecturer and the material itself is so interesting. It doesn't feel like a repetition of past history classes because I was never taught this material in prior education. Professor Lui covers so much Asian American history and so many different aspects of it as well -- different Asian populations, laws, representation in media, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: There was too much work. We had a midterm paper and an in-class midterm and a project paper and a final paper, but all of these assignments were not necessary. The assignments should be combined to just be one midterm and one final project -- we didn't need the extras. We could have demonstrated understanding of the material in fewer assignments. This course was also a bit East Asian-centric and Southeast Asian-centric. I definitely understand that she can only cover so much material in a semester so she has to choose what to include, but I think it would have been great to include more in variety.",
                "The subject matter and the lectures are pretty good. For how broad the course hopes to be, the sheer volume of primary source readings make it a frustratingly inaccessible to engage while entertaining any other coursework. The workload is assigned as if it is the only course a student should be taking (approx. 350-400 pages of dense reading per week, two midterms, and two final assessments). While insisting that students should not come to class if they feel ill, there is no infrastructure in place to make that easy. The professor refuses to share lecture notes and doesn't share lecture slides (because they \"wouldn't be helpful\"). The volume of material covered in each lecture makes it difficult to fit any review content in the lectures, so if one has a legitimate inability to come to class they are immediately behind.",
                "I thought that the course was accessible across disciplines and that the general themes were valid. However, there are a few qualms that I had with the course. In terms of course structure, I felt that there were far too many readings and assignments/assessments with surface level expectations of how deeply we understood the content. Lectures provided a broad overview of the history during a certain time period, and sections were intended for discussing the readings. And yet, the readings were so disparate and plentiful that we rarely discussed them in depth and I often left section not feeling as though there was a concrete piece I had learned. In terms of assessments, the midterm exam felt like a memorization assessment rather than a genuine reflection of our learning. And the final take-home \"exam\" was really a 6-8 page essay that we were expected to complete in a few days, with a prompt that unrealistically asked us to both analyze primary sources and provide a general argument about Asian American history across several decades within the suggested page amount.",
                "The course was really interesting and Dr. Lui is a fantastic lecturer. Overall it was a great class but at some times was overbearing, with a midterm and midterm paper right at the same time, and 6-page final and final paper also close together in due dates.",
                "The content of the course was incredibly engaging the first few weeks. I loved Professor Lui's lectures and how they guided us through not only Asian American historical events, but the historical trends leading to those events which predated even America's founding. However, the workload made this class unbearable. I'm sorry, but for a class that most people are taking as an extra class out of interest or passion for the subject, the amount of readings and back to back exams/assignments made this class difficult to appreciate. A real shame.",
                "Would have appreciated more sources on South Asians and other often dismissed groups within Asia. Specifically, would have appreciated more sources on South Asians written by South Asians themselves instead of being from the colonizers' and imperialists' perspectives. Appreciated the range of sources otherwise from personal narratives to diary entries to movies."

                "Yes, definitely! I was one of 3 non-Asian Americans in my section and felt it was such an important class for me to take. Some seniors and others took it credit/D/F and were less engaged, but as a History major who focused on this class I feel like I got a ton out of it.",
                "Yes!! Interesting lectures, interesting and relevant readings including some really cool primary sources, and great professor and TFs.",
                "Yes, if you've never taken Asian American history/studies before and want a broad overview. I personally came into the course with a much more in depth background and was looking for a course that not only taught me more about Asian American groups that I didn't really know about but also politically; this course is left leaning but for me it wasn't left leaning enough (lol). That being said, the lectures are interesting and so are the readings, though there are definitely lots of readings.",
                "Yes, it's a very accessible intro-level history course for anyone to take and the takeaways are very important and relevant today.",
                "The workload of this course is extremely backloaded. The material is interesting but the readings are a little much so be prepared",
                "Yes",
                "yes absolutely! i think asian american history should be a recommended course for everyone because you learn so much about the structures of imperialism, colonialism, race formation, and immigration.",
                "Yes! It's so important to learn about minority histories. Whether you are a history/er+m major or not, this course is important to take as a citizen of this country or just as someone curious in learning about sociological patterns.",
                "Absolutely. Regardless of what your major is or you stake in Asian American history, this is an incredibly relevant course that covers parts of history that we do not usually talk or know about. I learned so much about how Asian American history interacts with the greater American narrative, and I feel that this is extremely valuable information given the state of our nation today.",
                "The content was interesting, but I would recommend an ER&M class if you're interested in racial formation or another history lecture instead if you're just looking to take history. I was warned this class had a lot of reading but I thought people were exaggerating or hadn't taken other history classes. It was upwards of 150 pages a week, with lots of primary sources and a very dry textbook (but some more interesting readings)",
                "While I would recommend this course to all students, I do so with the added caveat that this course is not the only one about racial formation and critical history that the student engages with. There is so much to be gained from this course that students have likely never learned in previous forms of education. Yet at the same time, I do not think this was the most intellectually rigorous class through which to be first introduced or continue engagement with thinking about race, Asian Americans, or American history.",
                "If the student were looking for an engaging and challenging history course, I would definitely recommend the course. But to a STEM-oriented student looking to get an easier history credit, I likely wouldn't because of the workload.",
                "BEST CLASS. Mary Lui is an amazing professor. I kept thinking about the lectures and readings all the time even outside of class because they are just so relevant and worth reflecting on. I decided to major in history after taking this class. Asian American history is not just about Asian American, it's about being American. Asian American history should not only be learned by Asian Americans but everyone, especially future policymakers.",
                "I would recommend this course because the learning is fantastic and Prof Lui is great. However, beware of the workload. Either cred/d this class, prepare yourself to devote hours every week to reading, or just know that you won't do much of the reading and it will be fine. Also, beware that there is a midterm paper AND exam and a final paper AND exam. This class is an unnecessary amount of work if all you wanted was to learn about Asian American history. If you're excited about doing all this work, great, you'll get a lot out of this class. Otherwise, consider cred/d-ing the class so you can just enjoy lecture without having to worry about the workload.",
                "Yes, but beware that there are a few things you should (for the sake of your mental health) start early on: books that are assigned as reading and the oral history project. Since this class has both a final paper (the oral history project) AND a final exam (take-home essay exam), you must get the first one out of the way early. It was exhausting to juggle two major assignments for this class in the last few weeks of the course. I'd highly suggest completing the oral history project BEFORE you get back from November break if possible. I wish I'd done that. But overall I don't regret taking this class at all. It's a soul-feeding class.",
                "I wouldn't recommend taking this course unless you're really interested in Asian American history.",
                "yes, please. You'll learn a lot.",
                "Yes! This class covers A LOT of (important!) content. Prof Lui is a solid lecturer: clear, efficient, super knowledgeable, and she cares about her students too! BUT be ready to do a lot of reading or credit/d/chill.",
                "Yes. This course is basically AP US History through the lens of Asian American history. As an Asian American, I learned a LOT about the way that Asians have been treated in the US over the last 150-200 years. Because of this, the course had personal relevance to me. The oral history project at the end was a bunch of work, but I really enjoyed interviewing my uncle and hearing his story. \r\n\r\nTL;DR of the course: the US is a gatekeeping nation, where Asians have been excluded from immigration, citizenship, economic life, and social life. And when Asians make gains, it's usually because of convenience for White America (eg. in 1943, the Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed and Chinese Americans gained the right to become naturalized citizens because the US needed to keep China as an ally during WWII).",
                "Yes! All Asian/American Studies majors, ER&M majors, and those interested in the material would definitely enjoy the course!",
                "YES! This is the kind of class that you go to Yale for. Professor Lui and the TAs do an amazing job situating the history of Asian Americans among both domestic and national contexts. I generally don't pay attention to lectures in other classes, but Professor Lui is a very engaging storyteller, interrogating assumptions about Asian Americans and encouraging us to craft our own narratives. The assignments, such as the oral history and primary source analysis, developed my skills as a historian and allowed me to tie in my personal histories with the greater themes of the course.",
                "This course is a must take for every Asian American student and everyone interested in Asian American history.",
                "Yes! You learn SO much about Asian American history, racial discrimination, and the law. Although this course doesn't go into incredible detail about every single movement/event/person in Asian American history, this class does equip you with the authors, the doctrines, and the dates that you need to look into those details on your own, should they interest you.",
                "I wish I could recommend this course, as I was so looking forward to this class, but I was disappointed by the way things were taught. Certain themes and topics could have been dealt with more tact, and it was difficult to follow the lectures, which seemed to mainly consist of the professor reading from a pre-written script, offering up facts/names/dates too quickly to write down or process. Further, the professor did not make any accommodations (for sickness, injury, etc.) for her lectures and was unsympathetic to almost all concerns, which I found jarring and disheartening during a time when so many others were giving grace.",
                "Maybe, if you're okay with the surprisingly big workload. And if you're willing to overlook the lack of discussion about the intersection of Asian identities. Also, most of the history is focused on the past, and not the present (and more east-Asian centric than not).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students who are interested in learning more about Asian American history.",
                "I would recommend it others because it does have interesting and foundational histories. However with the understanding that the information could be taught through a more intersectional/radical lens and in line with other histories. Furthermore, some asian american ethnic groups will rarely if at all be discussed.",
                "Without a doubt, yes.",
                "Yes definitely if you want to learn about Asian American history",
                "Yes 100%",
                "yes! this class is great, especially if you are interested in history or the Asian American experience.",

                "100%. This was one of the best humanities classes that I've taken at Yale, and I took away so much from each lecture and section that we had. The class completely changed my outlook on the way American history is taught and Asians' role in building the U.S.",
                "Absolutely! It was dynamic, interesting, challenging, and fun. Asian American history is essential to understanding the U.S.'s trajectory, and I feel privileged to have taken the course. If you're willing to put in the work, you'll get a lot out of the class.",
                "Yep, totally accomplishes its goal of being an introductory course in Asian American history. Fun, often revelatory, lots to learn. Totally solid.",
                "Yes, yes, and yes. While this might be a very workload-heavy course, it's highly worth it. You learn so much, and feel so empowered by what you've learned.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to any student. This course not only provides a comprehensive review of Asian American history, but also presents themes that relate to other historical and cultural events in the United States and around the world. Through this course, students will understand the events that facilitated Asian migration to the United States, and the socioeconomic and political conditions that affected Asian American community formation for over a century.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if you have little knowledge/background in Asian American history or deep interest in the subject!  It gives a very good comprehensive overview of the topic and was a deeply moving and fascinating exploration of Asian communities in the US.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! You learn a lot about US history and Asian Americans in the US.",
                "Yes, this course was great and I'd highly recommend.",
                "Yes! Please take this course. We don't have many opportunities to look at Asian American history due to the white-washing of America's backstory. So this class really opened my eyes to the historically-poor treatment of Asians in America. After reflecting on how Asians have been treated during times of COVID, and given the new information this class has taught me, I know that we must do more to yearn for true equality for everyone in this country.",
                "Yes, I think this course gives a very thorough overview of Asian American history.",
                "I would 100% recommend! Its a good history course thats broad enough in topic where there will be something that would interest you, and the course material is easy to grasp. There is a heavy reading load, but it is manageable.",
                "Highly recommend to anyone interested in learning about Asian American history",
                "Yes! Mary Lui is a treasure.",
                "Yes! It's a good baseline class where people from all different political places can learn together and grow toward an idea of a liberated Asian American identity.",
                "Yes--there's so much history that goes into the Asian American experience today, and I think this course really helps to expand your worldview and understanding of the environment we live in.",
                "Yes! Absolutely take this course  if you are at all interested. Youll learn so much and have a great experience with Professor Lui",
                "Absolutely, take this course if you enjoy history and/or would like to know about Asian American history",
                "Would recommend if you want a solid introduction to Asian American history, and want to learn how to analyze and connect important themes (such as labor, exclusion, etc) across many events. The oral history project was really really fun and meaningful but this class has SO MUCH WORK  two big assignments during midterms and finals that were only a week apart at most  (midterm = paper and exam; final = oral history and paper). Lastly, it became very East Asian centered about 2 weeks/4 lectures in, so you might be frustrated by the lack of South and Southeast Asian representation (like there were definitely moments in lecture and with the readings that could have used examples of other ethnic groups beyond Chinese, Japanese, and Korean  which not to invalidate those histories, but the content could have been more balanced)",
                "Yes. The readings are amazing, and the long timescale (1850s to 2000s) mean that by the end you feel like you have real insight into the arc of Asian American communities' roots and formation. There are several book-a-week assignments, but overall workload wasn't terrible. And it's satisfying to actually apply the history you've learned to the oral history projectall of the readings and section conversations culminate in the ability to talk to someone about their life and contextualize it with them, which feels good!",
                "Yes, take it, especially if you did not learn about Asian American history in school up to this point. You learn a lot, trace themes through history, and the Oral History project is really fun.",
                "As a first-generation college student who is of Chinese descent, an astounding yes. This class taught me history that isn't taught in the typical APUSH or AP  World history class. Professor Liu's lectures forces students to think how about the treatment of Asian Americans throughout American history has ties to  global events, racism, as well as actions that oppress minority groups. I am walking out of this class with an appreciation for history that matters to me, for the first time as a student (and yes this is coming from a Yalie). \r\n\r\nIf anything, Cr/D/F this class. This is honestly a \"cannot miss\" class and one that I will take with me after graduating from Yale. Professor Liu's class forced me to deeply consider how negative attitudes towards Asians today can be traced back to deleterious motions in the past.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to ALL students, not only Asian American students. Everyone would benefit from learning about this history that isn't often included in mainstream media. This kind of history continues to unfold today and Asian American history continues to be erased by people, so it is of the utmost importance that we continue talking about these topics and studying them. Every single Yale students needs to take a course like this, if not this course. The material is also objectively interesting and sometimes it can be heavy, but with good reason. Asian Americans have been through a lot, like every other non-white group in America.",
                "Not for a grade. I took this class Credit/D/Fail and it still ended up being one of the more stressful classes I took this semester, purely because the workload of the class so exceeded its quality and the level of intellectual interest it stirred in me. The \"take home final exam\" listed on the syllabus was in reality a research paper for which we received the prompt 3 days before it was due.",
                "I would recommend this course because it is extremely interesting and teaches about a history that not a lot of people talk about.",
                "I would, but go into it with a grain of salt, as I would highly recommend Credit/Ding the course and trying not to let the workload overwhelm your other classes.",
                "Serves as a good introduction. Would have appreciated more sources on South Asians and other often dismissed groups within Asia. Specifically, would have appreciated more sources on South Asians written by South Asians themselves instead of being from the colonizers' and imperialists' perspectives. Appreciated the range of sources otherwise from personal narratives to diary entries to movies.",
