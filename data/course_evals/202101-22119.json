The books all relate to one another, and even though the reading load looks really heavy, Professor Dudley encourages students to read only the parts that interest them (even if that's not the entire book and only ~100 pages).\r\n\r\n2. Professor Dudley creates her own story and builds themes throughout the course while guiding discussion in a way that's very organic and student-focused (instead of the professor very clearly saying \"here's what you have to know\"). She takes what we takeaway and moves the discussion along and ties all the books and discussions together very nicely.\r\n\r\n3. Professor Dudley herself is a very kind and understanding professor who acknowledges that students are humans. Her insight is always spot-on. Professor Dudley not only doesn't discourage but actually encourages students to use personal voice (and to experiment with modes of sharing/writing). You will be pushed outside of your comfort zone and confront aspects of your life that may not be the best for the world, but I think everyone in the course came out of this course learning more about how we interact with the beings around us and how we can be better stewards to the world.",
                "I really enjoyed our class discussions because the class was really centered on what we wanted to talk about. I also appreciate how we were not expected to finish the books that were assigned each week, but instead got to choose which parts interested us the most. While that did make it a little more confusing in discussion, I think it gave a lot of flexibility and allowed us to engage deeper with the parts we did choose to read."

I feel like there are a lot of things that we are taught in science classes that do come from a biased perspective and are never challenged, and this class helped me be more open-minded and willing to see some of these assumptions. I would definitely recommend it to someone studying animals or E&EB/ related sciences because of this, and would also just recommend it to anyone in general because it was really interesting.",
