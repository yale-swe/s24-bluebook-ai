                "Frankly I think prof svolik did a really poor job designing this course this semester. He told us at the first class meeting that he anticipates discussion over zoom to be worse than in person, and would give us additional assignments to make up for this. Giving more assignments than usual when students are living through what is probably the most stressful time in their life is ridiculous. The original syllabus had 6 5-page papers and a 15 page final paper, which he reduced to 4 5-page papers and the final paper once we were halfway through the semester and he realized that there was no way to reasonably distribute 6 assignments. He claimed that he expected these papers to take us about an hour... in what world does a 5 page paper take an hour? It frequently seemed that he was so disconnected from the realities of being a student. The due dates for these four assignments were also poorly planned out, and we ended up having 2 5-page papers and the final paper due all in the last month of the semester. One of these papers was due over Thanksgiving break, which was incredibly unfair considering that students had not had a break for 12 weeks, and another paper was due the week after. In spite of anticipating that discussion over zoom would be worse than in person, prof svolik made no effort to facilitate discussion and class meetings were awkward and not engaging.",

                "No. I would not recommend taking a course with prof svolik in an online format. This class was by far more stressful than any other political science course I've taken, the readings were dense and pretty much all written by white men, class discussion was not interesting, the amount of assignments was absurd, and prof svolik was very unorganized and unresponsive. Even though I found the readings interesting, I think there are far better courses with better instructors to take at Yale and I honestly dreaded going to this class every week.",
                "Yes, this is such a great course to learn about democratic backsliding and Professor Svolik is very insightful with all his discussion and comments. The material is very interesting and very relevant to today's world with the rise in populism."
