    "The course was good.",
    "I would have appreciated slowing down the math. There was not enough exam time. The coursework, homework, and participation should hold more weight for the final grade.",
    "I think that the class sessions could have been shorter--they were helpful in reviewing the videos but sometimes redundant. I wish that the class were organized so the homework was understanding the concepts and the class sessions were maybe an hour of numerical examples and review.",
    "it was very well organized, our professor deeply cared for us, and was available to us. there was ample review material and the problems in class matched our exams so we were well prepared.",
    "A lot was taught over the course of five weeks. In some instances, it was a little tough to get through the material. \r\n\r\nProfessor was extremely entertaining and good at breaking down what I thought was tough material."

    "Absolutely. I believe that every student, regardless of major or interest, should take this class, as it teaches skills and lessons that are applicable in any field and in life in general.",
    "Yes, it is well organized and provides a strong foundation for students interested in economics. It is also very practical and will give students strong financial decision-making skills. Take this course!",
    "Yes, I think this course was a great way to understand a core part of our society and world--the economic system. Tolga makes the classes very engaging and Marianne, the TA, makes sure that people do well on the problem set. However, you have to be very self motivated in this class and engage with the material on your own time as well and spend the time to learn it.",

    "Yes. It teaches you things that are applicable to everyday life as well as Econ.",
