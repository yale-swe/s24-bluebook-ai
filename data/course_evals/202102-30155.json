                "I wish the reading discussions were more student lead.",
                "I think the strengths of the course was the workload not being too much and every piece of homework served a purpose. I think a weakness is that the turn around time on essays were very quick and I felt like I had a day to write my first draft.",
                "This is a great writing course! I liked the pacing of it for a summer class -- there are writing assignments due every week, but they're fairly manageable and you get a LOT of useful feedback on each one. The reading list is great, although class discussions do depend on student participation, so don't be afraid to speak up. Dean Hill and Prof. McGowan are amazing teachers and are incredibly enthusiastic about their work.",
                "The seminar format and weekly workshops in the course made it very engaging, and having feedback for drafts before the final submission is very helpful for finding strength and weaknesses in the drafts. The pacing is pretty quick so it can be hard to get enough revisions in to make it exactly to one's liking, but it is certainly manageable.",
                "Well organized\r\nHigh student engagement\r\nGreat professors\r\n\r\nCould improve: readings could be all in the same pdf format and easier to access"
