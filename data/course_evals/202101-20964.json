                "This course was wonderful! Dr. Debs facilitated a wonderful course that examined education systems across the world with an international perspective. She also emphasized mindfulness, wellbeing, and critical thinking throughout our courses, and encouraged us to work collaboratively, which not many professors do. That greatly aided my understandings in the course and helped me to feel like I was learning within a community!",
                "I learned to take in a broader perspective to education! An international one.",
                "I learned quite a lot about global education systems. I learned how education can build nationalism, be altered to promote a certain history, be decolonized.",
                "Most of my education classes have been US oriented, so it was fun to talk about education models in Singapore, India, Finland, China, etc. You'll learn about education in the context of language, power, colonialism, indigenous communities, policy, philanthropy, etc.",
                "I learned about education for nation building in many different countries and learned how to effectively write about data.",
                "This course provides a broad survey into thinking about different international education systems/structures. We learn about histories, traumas, and nationalism influence different national systems of education. We discuss different relevant areas like languages (particularly as English has become the dominant worldwide language), Indigenous education, and refugee education. Throughout this course, we have learned how to write rigorous research papers and how to debate/weight different models of education.",
                "Basic understanding of other countries' education systems and their challenges",
                "This course expanded my understanding of the complicated nature behind establishing education systems (motives, politics, history or trauma, etc.) It also challenged my preconceived notions of education making the effort to highlight alternative methods as well. We learned about education around the world and across time. We also learned to incorporate data presentation with education.",
                "In this class, I learned about the educational structure of various countries and groups of peoples through a variety of case study readings/videos. It is also amazing that Dr. Debs takes the time to teach us about data visualizations to incorporate into our assignments.",
                "A wide range of knowledge and skills about pedagogies, school systems, contexts and policies about education systems in Finland, China, Singapore, Rwanda, India/Pakistan, and more. We also covered some ideas about decolonising education, as well as global philanthropy. This class gave me helpful insights to understand what education might or should look like at a broader scale. It also made me interested in exploring pedagogies developed elsewhere in the world."

                "This course has all strengths and no weaknesses! Dr. Debs was particularly mindful about how to create a classroom community on the Zoom format, and all of the discussions were very thoughtful. I loved this course!!!",
                "The strength was the format Dr. Debs used to divide us into reading groups and have class structured with different activities. She really did an amazing job of facilitating the classtime by optimizing the class structure.",
                "Strength: A very comprehensive discussion of education in the context of nation building and policy making. The people in the class are very engaged, so the discussions will often leave you wanting more. Professor Debs does a really great job prioritizing wellness and inclusivity, so it was a very safe environment to learn. \r\n\r\nWeakness: More multimedia in the classrooms. I also liked the guest speaker  I wonder if it would be possible to bring in someone for just 15 minutes to talk about their respected country.",
                "The course managed to cover a lot of material, but as usual, there were so many readings that I felt like I only got a vague idea of everything I learned about (and there was never nearly enough time to discuss everything). I would rather dive deeply into only a reading or two each week.",
                "The community element (small breakout rooms, partner projects) was amazing and kept me sane. The reflections after assignments were really helpful and added a degree of closure to assignments that I otherwise would have needed to get from grades. Dr. Debs was fantastic and super open to student ideas/suggestions and really prioritized us as people during a difficult semester. In terms of improvement, I would make the class smaller and reorient discussions. Often, at times, I felt like the discussion was yes, but (disagreement) rather than yes, and (recognizing the inherently contradictory nature of educationeverything is a weighing of different values). The discussion about Indigenous education felt a bit confusing. I would also have the discussions engage more critically with specific things rather than asking a barrage of questions and only getting more vague, broad answers. Starting discussions with What did you find interesting from the readings this week? Or What policies/practices confused/surprised you?",
                "I really enjoyed this course. It was very well run and engaging. The assignments and readings taught me a great deal. The instructor also encouraged class presentation and went out of her way to meet with students to provide guidance.",
                "Dr. Debs is the best. The readings were very interesting and the workload was perfect and fair. Assignments were fun and beneficial. It would have been nice to spend one class talking more about the logistics of policy making. Otherwise, no weaknesses.",
                "STRENGTHS: Dr. Debs is a great teachershe did an excellent job making a two hour seminar fly by; it was dynamic and not just discussing the readings. We listened to songs, we discussed the readings, we took turns co-facilitating discussions, we had mini lectures, we did collaborative Google Slides activities, and more. It was clear that Dr Debs is not just a professor, she is also a teacher who knows how to teacha skill that is somewhat lacking in some professors, sometimes. \r\nWEAKNESSES: None! There were some things that maybe needed tweaking, but because Dr Debs is so receptive to course feedback, she adjusted the course to the class's needs as we went."

                "The moments of calm were amazing and helped me stay grounded. The reading group breakout rooms (in which we met with the same 4 people to discuss readings over several weeks) was an excellent way to build community/relationships. I felt that the class was too big for a zoom formatin a smaller class, I think we could have gone deeper into specific policies and ideas. The option to work with partners was lovely and amazing and the option for creative/alternative assignments with the final project was so cool!",
                "I loved this course. The instructor did an excellent job being mindful of students and our wellbeing. It was really moving to see. From a research perspective when students are going through trauma its impossible to learn the same this instructor was so kind and even introduced mindfulness practices to start each seminar. Her style and active course adjustments and genuine care for students should be used as a model.",
                "The work load was very fair - I loved meeting only once a week because it gave more time to complete readings and less screen time. Dr. Debs had moments of meditation and a lot of time to reflect and engage in class which was extremely beneficial to everyone's mental health",
                "The Canvas page is definitely the best, most conveniently organized Canvas page I have had for any class over two semesters of virtual learning. All readings are provided. Dr Debs also started off each class with a moment of calm, which really helped us get into a focused, calm state ready for learning as opposed to suddenly being on Zoom at 9.25am."
