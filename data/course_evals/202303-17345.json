Rasheed facilitated such a wonderful environment for learning, was flexible to student needs, and was just so pleasant. it was so nice to \r\nlisten to a piece of African diasporic music in class that students brought in because it allowed us to learn more about the breadth of the diaspora and the people in our class",

                "The course was incredibly interesting and used a variety of medias to teach, we listened to a large deal of music from artists across the diaspora in addition to reading novels, plays, and watching a film. Our class discussions were always engaging and passionate, and Rasheed fostered an incredible environment for collaboration and discussion in the course. The course was also very helpful in developing writing skills using a variety of assignments, with Rasheed providing detailed, insightful feedback and many opportunities to receive 1-on-1 feedback and workshopping."

Rasheed is an incredible professor who creates an engaging and comfortable class environment, and this course has been one of my favorite courses that I've taken at Yale."
