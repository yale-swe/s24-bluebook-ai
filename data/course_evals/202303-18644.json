This class reflects his values and is a great engaging experience for all. I liked the clear feedback he always gave and how he considered every view point.",
                "great and manageable readings, lively class discussions, and amir is such a gem. he has the ability to explain complex theories into simple words that anyone could understand. he alone is worth it to take the class",
                "The strengths of this course were the workload. Readings and assignments felt manageable. \r\n\r\nThis course's readings were largely outdated, which made it difficult to draw relevant conclusions about our political system today. I don't think our discussions were always as targeted or focused as they could have been. We spent a lot of time talking about the media and polarization even those two topics were not on our syllabus. I think there could have been a way to better tailor the syllabus to our contemporary political system. That might have made discussions more focused and animated.",
                "Strengths: interesting topics and readings that connect to each other from week to week, and lively weekly discussions facilitated by Professor Fairdosi\r\nWeaknesses: at time a bit disorganized but not to a fault",
                "This was a great course with a great professor. All love for professor Fairdosi.",
                "The strengths of this course is that it provides a broad though in depth survey of representative government and constituent-legislator relationships in America. Another strength is that Professor Fairdosi provides a lecture prior to the seminar discussion, which clarifies and supplements the course readings and themes. Professor Fairdosi also provides clear expectations and feedback to optimize student success in the course. (i.e. outlining ways to structure an academic paper and thesis statement)."

If you are looking for a rigorous course to get lots out of, I would take a different class. However, I enjoyed going to class each week and would recommend this course if you need something lighter and interesting.",

This course provided me with greater insights into the study of political representation and Professor Fairdosi's lectures expanded my knowledge on representative democracy and associated political science scholarship."
