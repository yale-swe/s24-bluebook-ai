                "As a freshman, this was a great class to take to help me reflect on my move! It was a really delightful class where I learned a lot about myself, the writing process, the importance of noticing, embracing short sentences.",
                "More concise and effective writing, editing skills, peer review and communication skills. Also learned new ways to approach the creative writing process, such as taking a walk and speaking out ideas via voice memo, or the graveyard technique",
                "Improved my writing skills, specifically with creative nonfiction. Learned to hone my writing, develop strong endings, and use shorter sentences to convey the same meaning. Learned a lot about myself and about people in my class, just due to the nature of all the topics being about different aspects of our lives.",
                "Not only do you learn to write in English 120, but you learn to think like a writer! I learned so many techniques to write as precisely and honestly as possible, and I think the way I navigate the world has possibly been fundamentally shaped by the discussions we had in this class. More than just writing, though, I think English 120 (or at least Rachel's section!) did a fantastic job of making me look for significance in and reflect upon the world around me in new ways.",
                "In-depth look into writing as craft, with emphasis on sentence-level writing. The variety in essay prompts allowed me to explore different styles and forms of writing throughout the semester.",
                "I learned how to be a better writer and editor of my work and the work of others.",
                "RKN is fantastic at guiding students to analyze different writing styles\/techniques and helping one find their own voice.",
                "Writing skills, thinking skills, reading skills. Best English class I've ever taken.",
                "Writing coherently and avoiding adjectives\/adverbs to propel sincere narratives. Playing with English conventions but nothing convoluted.",
                "I learned how to be clear and direct with my writing as well as the importance of editing."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: not a high workload, no final, short and insightful readings, course layout, very rewarding, lots of feedback\r\nWeakness: the course is very dependent on your professor, in my case I loved the readings she chose for us and her editing style and comments, so it was perfect!",
                "Strengths: great and effective structure, fosters class bonding\/collaboration, good access to instructor feedback, consistent deadlines\r\nWeaknesses: would prefer a bit more small group work (pairs, trios) to get more personalized feedback on things",
                "I absolutely loved this class! Was definitely my favorite class of the semester. I think the best part of ENGL 120 is how you really get to know everyone else in your class in a way that you wouldn't normally get to know people because of the subject matter. If you love writing, this is the class for you. The five essays were manageable and I liked how it was set up so that we had a first draft and then graded revised draft.",
                "I can't think of any weaknesses. The readings are fun and you learn a lot about so many different subjects from them; our in-class discussions were really awesome, especially because everyone was always so eager and willing to participate so seriously, and we're given all the tools we need to write really powerful pieces that we can be proud of. Rachel was very understanding with extensions and workload, and the classroom environment was a very safe space where we were able to be vulnerable in our writing and discussions.",
                "Really loved the variety of readings. Rachel did a great job of fostering classroom discussions and providing interesting and fun writing exercises.",
                "This course had no weaknesses. I think a major strength was how quickly the class became more of an informal, collaborative writing workshop. Of all the classes I took this semester it had the most community and I loved getting to know my classmates through their writing. RKN's feedback on essays was always very thorough and led to a much improved second draft. I think another strength of the class was the author visits which helped to communicate the strategies of multiple published authors.",
                "Strengths: engagement with peers in every class, workshopping sessions are very productive, the reading material chosen was both highly enjoyable and pertinent to our goals\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, none I can think of.",
                "No weaknesses. The design of the class is perfect. All essays are submitted in two drafts, the first of which is ungraded. The readings are fabulous (and short). The writing is genuinely fun.",
                "Strengths: The field trips, the personal attention, the bonds, the energy, the editing process, the workshops, the feedback, the peer support, the office hours, beautiful selection of readings, flexibility, the workload.\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of. Maybe the class meeting time, but again it's beyond anyone's control I believe.",
                "Strengths: Professor Nalebuff was incredibly understanding and engaging. She offered useful feedback and was always available.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None"

                "Yes! I had a lovely time, thought a lot about writing on a sentence-level, and read a variety of interesting essays. There was a lot of room for experimentation in each essay, and I received detailed and helpful feedback on each draft.",
                "I will forever and always recommend this course, specifically with RKN if you can get her.",
                "Yes, and with no reservations. Most remarkable learning experience of my life.",
                "Absolutely. For students pursuing non-writing majors, it is the perfect opportunity to hone creative writing skills through collaboration and without compromising the joys of intellectual exploration. Being in Professor Nalebuff's tutelage was a pleasure.",
                "Absolutely. For students who enjoy reading\/writing, this course is incredibly fun. I looked forward to coming to each class. While the workload (in terms of how much writing and revision is involved) may be high in theory, it did not feel burdensome."
