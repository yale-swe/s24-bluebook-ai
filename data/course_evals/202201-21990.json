I learned how to conduct an effective comparative analysis of texts side by side, how to analyze primary source biblical texts, and how to engage critically with primary source material. I was fascinated to learn how the bible existed in its ancient near eastern setting and how Assyrian and Mesopotamian texts influence biblical texts.",

                "The experiential learning aspects of this course were memorable and something that I personally looked forward to. It was so cool to see the Gilgamesh tablet in Sterling Memorial Library and to handle some of those ancient artifacts. I also enjoyed the class presentations that we all did on one text. I appreciated how these presentations were more informal and laid back- they made me feel comfortable familiarizing myself with a text that interested me and because of their informal nature I was able to focus more on understanding the content I was analyzing rather than on just trying to go above and beyond to get a good grade. The course overall challenged me to look beyond my personal beliefs and analyze the bible in a historical context. I learned so much. The balance of assignments was also great. Again, the nature and the focus on reading as part of our assignments made me more motivated to actually understand and sit with the texts we were studying. I appreciated how we only had two papers and didn't have to do unnecessary external work like post on discussion forums on Canvas.\r\n\r\nThis may seem basic, but I wish we spent the first class or two going over dates and how things are being dated (ex: how the BC system of dating works). There were times when I got confused with the dates presented in materials and during class lectures.",
                "In person class",
                "Very interesting and well taught.",
                "More discussion could be fun, but overall the lecture component and student presentations worked well! The class was organized in a way that made sense.",
                "This course needs work in its branding. It isn't really a seminar. It is more of a lecture, with powerpoints and a sprinkling of student comments. I also criticize this course because its framework was unchanging. That is beneficial in some ways but more detrimental in my point of view. We came into every lecture with two stories, one from the Torah and one from an ancient near eastern source. Good. I like this symmetry. But... the professor's take on every single comparison was the exact same: The Torah gets most elements from Babylonian/Assyrian sources and because it does this what does it say about others. Rather than letting the students figure out these connections themselves, the professor kind of rams this narrative down their throats."
