   "comments": [
    "Questions were clearly addressed and the pace of the material was manageable. However, there were limited and artificial settings to speak. They were all heavily facilitated and did not prepare the students for Russia.",
    "lots of work meant we learned a lot quickly",
    "It was pretty well run - a lot of work but that is expected and helps to actually make sure material sticks. The fast past was very refreshing. I wish I could always learn russian at such a quick pace.",
    "Very thorough, wish there was more of an emphasis on conversational speaking and common uses (such as ordering food etc)",
    "Good focus on grammar and in general great class, but perhaps could include more opportunities to practice speaking about situations other than what we did the previous day."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly reccommend this class. It was an amazing opportunity to better my Russian and focus on the grammar needed to form complez sentences and ideas.",
    "While the workload for the summer course was incredibly high, at least 4 days of homework in the workbook everyday, it forced me to stay engaged with the course. The homework is a lot, but really manageable considering that it's over the summer and your only other work is the readings for the culture course. I would definitely recommend over taking L3\/L4 during the school year. Being able to focus all your efforts on Russian makes it so much better.",
    "yeah, I think spreading this material over an entire year would have been boring",
    "Absolutely! Such a fantastic course in which you really feel like you are learning the language",
    "Yes! Great summer program",
    "Certainly, it is a very important next step for Russian."
