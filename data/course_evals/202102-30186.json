                "The strengths of the course are in part Prof. Joormann and Ashleigh. They were both really nice and facilitated good discussions. The biggest weakness was the sheer amount of time all the homework took. I personally take pretty thorough notes on the textbook readings, so those would sometimes take me basically a full to do, then hours of videos on top of it. I get summer classes have to be fast paced; it was just very tedious.",
