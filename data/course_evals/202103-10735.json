                "Strengths: Stephanie Lazzaro is one of the kindest and most passionate professors Ive had the pleasure of having at Yale. She cares deeply about her students wellbeing and ability to learn. She welcomes discussion during class and lectures in a very engaging manner. She is readily available to meet with students and is very organized (posts powerpoints and assignments on Canvas, returns grades with feedback quickly, etc).\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Overall this course was a good way to fulfill the lab requirement for neuroscience, but I wish that the final research proposal assignment was incorporated more into the course itself. The last class period was the first time we talked about the 12 page final paper, which was a little jarring. I wish the last couple of assignments would have been focused on choosing topics and writing the first sections so that the amount of work required after the end of classes was  not as high. Additionally, I wish we spent more time learning about research methods outside of just IATs and fMRI.",
                "The reaction papers were very clear in criteria and easy to follow and handle. I think the structure of the course was very well thought out and put together.",
                "Very low-key, no pressure environment, which is quite extraordinary to have at Yale! I appreciated this aspect the most.\r\nVery clear structure of lectures throughout the semester, made it easy to follow. \r\nSuper cool projects (building electric hand, clay brain, prism goggles, ...) in class to get first-hand experience in research methods. Definitely consolidated my knowledge.",
                "Strengths: The course was structured to provide students with numerous opportunities to practice the material we learn in class. The workload was perfect - not so little that course content went in one ear and out the other, and not so much that it became a burden. Furthermore, feedback was timely and instructive.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course faces the challenge of being attended by students with diverse backgrounds in psychological and neuroscientific methods. As it stands, I had to wait until about halfway through the semester before starting to learn anything.",
                "Overall great course",

                "If you're taking it with Professor Lazzaro, I would highly recommend this course regardless of what your major is. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking to get into cognitive neuroscience, this course is an absolute must. Even if you're not, I would highly recommend taking it just to gain a greater appreciation of related methods so that you can become a more informed consumer of such research. Also, it only meets once a week, so that's nice.",
                "YES! This course taught me a lot about scientific writing and the various methodologies open to neuroscientists and psychologists. The professor and TF were always available and willing to talk about my career beyond the class. Overall a great entry point into the world of fMRI, neuroscience and writing scientific papers",
                "Yes. Very good course.",
                "Yes, especially if you're a neuroscience major looking to fulfill their neuroscience lab credit. It's a full credit, and the Professor is incredibly kind."
