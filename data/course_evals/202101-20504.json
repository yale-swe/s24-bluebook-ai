                "I got a lot better at reading and writing complicated texts in Russian. The class is centered around reading about 19th-century Russian history (particularly the reign of Nicholas I and Alexander II), and every day for homework we read pretty dense history chapters and wrote summaries. By the end of the course, it felt almost natural to read in Russian without a dictionary, and I felt more comfortable formulating my ideas in writing. There is not a whole lot of speaking practice in this course, other than the presentations, but I still think that my speaking skills improved somewhat over the course of the semester. The course is taught in Russian, and by the end of the course, I could understand about 95% of what Constantine said.",

                "The main strength of the course is Constantine as the instructor; it is evident from the way that he teaches that he is genuinely excited about the material, and he was willing to provide ample assistance outside of class when needed. He really goes above and beyond for his students, and you should take any opportunity that you can to take a class with him. Constantine provides the most in-depth homework feedback out of any professor that I know; if you look at his corrections in-depth, you will really become much better at writing. The only weakness of the course is its routine; every day of the class was more or less the same (which in a way was nice because the workload was predictable and manageable), but by the end of the course, it might have been nice to have a few different activities sprinkled throughout to break up the history readings\/discussions.",

Make sure that you like history, though.
