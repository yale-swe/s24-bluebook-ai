    "all the things from readings and interesting documentaries.",
    "How to debate",
    "I learned how various social issues, like gender and race inequality can be related to environmental problems. We read a lot of articles concerning this question, and watched movies that provided us with real examples and helped us to understand the content of course better. We also did discussions and debate which expanded my horizon by knowing opinions of other people form different part of the world.",
    "This course helped me improve my writing skills, as well as to develop the way I express my ideas and points of views in a more inclusive and thoughtful way.",
    "I learned how to think more critically and truly understand each concept to apply it to my own original thinking. The assignments kept me on my toes and helped me dive deeper and more thoroughly into each and every idea\/topic. I learned not only what to think but how to think. The course was amazing as I learned such a variety of topics in such a short amount of time from ecofeminism to toxic dangers.\r\n\r\nI learned how to keep up with college work and it was challenging but so rewarding.",
    "I learned a lot about how the environment influences the society. We talked about gender and race equality, which broaden and deepen my understanding of environmental problems. The reading materials and lectures by Sigma were very useful. Also, we had a lot of discussions and debate in class. It helped me practice my expression and my logic thinking. I also heard many interesting opinions from my classmates and got careful feedback from Sigma. I appreciate this course very much."

   "comments": [
    "Discussion is inefficient and lack of deep thinking. Time control can be improved.",
    "Too much reading",
    "From my point of view the course is very engaging, the profesor did an excellent job on how she directed the subject, always encouraging every student to participate.",
    "I believe that a strength of this course is the interactive component of the material. One day our class made a trip to the Beinecke library to analyze and discuss Rachel Carsons manuscripts. It was truly an amazing experience that this course helped facilitate. I also believe that the balance between discussion and lecture aspects was perfect as we had time to soak up knowledge and also test out this knowledge to my fellow classmates. Coming from different parts of the world, my classmates and I learned from each other about our own personal experiences living in different countries on environmental issues. One weakness I would say for the course is that we watch many films. The films were amazing and encapsulated our learning, but sometimes, they seemed a little bit irrelevant. They took up much of class time and I think this time would have been better soent discussing or learning new things.",
    "Strengths: rich information, a lot of interaction\r\nCould be improved: Maybe the rule of our debate could be made some adjustments? The debate went on a little bit laggard."

    "Not really cause the topic might not be interesting to everyone",
    "Yes. Now most people ignore the social issue caused or aggravated by environmental problems, as they rarely appear in medias or daily conversations. This course really help students to get a better perspective about this question.",
    "I would strongly recommend taking this course. It will broaden your horizons and make you see the world development in a new perspective.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow classmates because of the engagement and interesting nature of the course. Learning about something other than climate change and learning how it directly affects so many people indirectly really grabbed my attention. I am so grateful I took this course because I can now more clearly see the connections between environmental damage and social justice issues all across the globe.",
    "Yes, of course.\r\nThis course helped me learn many things as I explained in the former questions. Also, I had an awesome time on this course with the excellent professor and nice classmates. I definitely would recommend this course to other students. I believe they will enjoy it!"
