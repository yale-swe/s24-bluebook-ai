                "Strengths: Guest professors are excellent and teaching team is great - I love how teachers are really part of our learning community and it is not a top down lecture model of any kind, great material, so glad this class counts towards the MB&B Major since this is really important\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much - sometimes hard to come up with solutions given the readings but honestly I'm not sure this is a problem and I don't have any suggestions in this area - I think the intervention projects and Op-Ed are already there to help with this.",
                "I loved that the course was project-based and didnt have exams! There was a lot of discussion both virtually and in-person so the class was very accessible. The types of assignments were varied as well which kept us busy but engaging with the material.",
                "The class was well organized and allowed people to feel comfortable sharing their experiences. I really enjoyed the conversations and how they addressed issues in STEM in a holistic manner.",
                "I think it could be improved by having more activities in class.",
                "This class was set up very well for student learning. To be honest, my only complaint is that I wish we could have a longer class period for discussion. I really enjoyed the community we formed and I hope to use what we learned regarding issues in STEM to propel change within my field.",
