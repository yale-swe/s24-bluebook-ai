    "This class is an awesome perspective on a topic that is frequently ignored. Professor Harms is an amazing professor. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "I gained knowledge about slavery as an institution in Africa, as well as the Middle Passage.",
    "I learnt how to analyze unpublished and published primary sources which I hadn't extensively done up until this class. It was also great to get an insight into Slavery and Slave Trade in Africa independent from the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Every time slavery is mentioned as an institution, this is the first thought that would come to many people's minds and this class definitely expanded that and showed just how complex slavery actually was and how it was different in various 'civilizations'. I also learnt to take a lot of things into perspective while doing a reading and have grown my ability to be more objective while doing readings or learning about such topics that I would personally identify with. There are readings that  I would end up re-reading because of how profound certain statements were. There are even times I had to stop myself from doing the really long readings because of how interesting they were and I actually wanted to get some sleep. Other times I would just be in utter shock at the extent of white supremacy. But there were definitely some readings that made me reflect a lot on the legacies of slavery today and I think that's what I loved about the class. One quote from a book stuck with me and I guess it just reflects what in the class had the biggest impression on me.  \"When African labor paid for the rest of the world to be propelled into the modern era, the African continent suffered arrested development.\" (Nick Hazelwood).",
    "A lot of information about slave trade from the perspective of Africa",
    "This was an amazing course which covered slavery and slave trade in Africa a topic that isnt often covered",
    "I definitely strengthened my ability to make effective arguments in my writing",
    "I gained insights on slavery and slave trade in Africa.",
    "A nice overview of the slave trade in Africa and many of the academic frameworks\/theories proposed to explain this trade (along with some of the flaws in those frameworks). You will also have an opportunity to read many texts (both primary and secondary) that present factual narratives on the topic."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Class covers a breadth of topics, readings are curated, and professor Harms is a legend. \r\nCons: The discussions can feel kind of meandering would love to hear more from Professor Harms.",
    "This class only met once a week, which made the high volume of reading manageable if you spaced it out. However, the class was long and it was obvious that many students would not do the readings, making it very awkwardly silent at times in discussion.",
    "Professor Harms is very knowledgable about the subject matter and his insight during discussions would always be amazing. The readings were also a great part of the class. However, there's a lot you can actually get away with from the class which is actually quite unfortunate because of how important the topic is. I didn't have to do all the readings because the class structure didn't necessarily encourage too much discussion. The class is based on oral presentations (that you sign up for at the beginning of the semester) which could be great on some weeks and a bit boring on others. It was always interesting to listen to other student's perspectives but there were times when I would feel disengaged from the content and would use this time to get work from other classes done which is actually quite sad. Overall, I'm glad I took this class which was a good break from my intensive STEM classes.",
    "Strengths: open discussion allowed us to have meaningful conversation",
    "The class had great readings",
    "I think there can be more work to keep students engaged in weeks when they don't have discussion papers",
    "Very interesting material and very competent professor.",
    "A great course if you are interested in the topic! Professor Harms is very knowledgeable and friendly and I found the material very different from the other courses I have taken at Yale. The structure of the papers and readings is very reasonable as well."

   "comments": [
    "Yes if purely for Professor Harms! He's great.",
    "Yes- it is not a very high workload (4 5-page papers throughout the semester, and you can choose when 2 of them are due), and Prof. Harms is a really knowledgeable guy. Hearing his stories was always really interesting. However, the class could be difficult to get through sometimes since it was clear that many of the students would not do the readings.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Do you need a chill writing credit with great content? Do you want a class that only meets once a week? Do you like a class that is mostly structured around student discussions? If you answered yes to any or all of these questions, TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Yes, take it. Professor Harms is an expert in this field and I enjoyed learning first hand about some of his research in parts of Africa. The workload in this course is very fair and you're given plenty of time to do your work. A very good writing credit.",
    "Yes, the course gives you more information about Africans and their involvement in the slave trade",
    "Highly recommend this course. Its a good class to take where if you put in the effort you are guaranteed good grades",
    "Yes! Robert Harms knows what he's talking about, and the readings are interesting!!",
    "Yes, it's a relatively calm class and a good writing credit.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course if you want to learn about African slave history and be around Professor Harms, who is really an expert on the matter. The class is very fair in terms of workload too (although writing the 4 papers well does take a bit of work)."
