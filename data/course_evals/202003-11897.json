The problem sets are very helpful with the material and are a good idea of what the exams may look like. I do think the class could have benefitted from having more practice questions or having a practice exam, and getting answer keys to problem sets sooner so that we could have studied those.",
                "Strengths: the applications to biology definitely made the course material more tangible and relevant; Professor Ganim made himself available after every class to answer questions; we were given the opportunity to submit corrections for our exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the textbook was very hard to understand, the problem sets were also very difficult, the exams sometimes presented new material. In general, I had a hard time understanding the concepts, and I didn't find all of the explanations given in lecture particularly clear or effective. Lectures sometimes went too fast.",

It was biology based while the professor barely mentioned any applied pchem during the course. Also the psets were pretty difficult and the class did not prepare us for that, we barely did any problems in class and even TA had trouble and she did not have the answers."

Professor Ganim is the heart of the course and is a wonderful professor to have, and will work with his students to make sure they understand the concepts taught. That being said, physical chemistry is notoriously difficult so if you dont need to take it, dont take it for your sanity.",
                "I don't really know how this course compares to the alternative for MB&B majors, CHEM 332. The small class size and the availability of the professor were definite plusses in this class. However, there were no peer tutors. The material was incredibly difficult and hard to understand, although I imagine the same holds for CHEM 332. At times, this class felt disorganized and the statistical mechanical model was sometimes difficult to use due to the challenge of enumerating all possible states.  Throughout the course, but more towards the end, it was rewarding to see biological applications of the material we learned (ex. ligand binding, protein unfolding, etc.) I would recommend shopping both classes.",
