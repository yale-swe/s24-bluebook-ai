                "The course is really really interesting. I loved the class. I liked the opportunity to prepare a seminar; I loved the two books assigned for reading; and I found Dr. Geballe to be really cordial. He cares about his students. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course include: a lack of clarity on grades and having the student teach for the entire 1 hour 15 minute seminar is not as constructive as having a discussion planned for part of the seminar by the professor. The class could be improved if Dr. Geballe prepared at least half of the day's seminar and if he was much much clearer on grading.",
                "There is extensive and helpful feedback for writing assignments. A number of seminars are run by students, which is very valuable but can also mean that how much you learn about each topic isn't always consistent. It's a very good class for learning about how to recognize and understand good information about Haiti online, in the libraries and so on.",
                "A strength of this course are the discussions amongst students. The student-led presentations are informative, and many times I learned the most from my classmates' ideas. I also found the chosen textbooks and literature to be very helpful. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to talk to more people who currently live in Haiti.",
                "Through the course, I learned a lot about Haiti and I appreciated the time put towards thinking critically as a group about sustainable policies that could benefit Haiti. Overall, the structure was engaging and helpful.",
                "This course provided lots of information from both the professor and through each student's research. The class was occasionally repetitive when each student would present on a different topic each class.",
                "The feedback is weak.",
                "Professor Geballe was highly engaging and my class mates provided a lot of insight to Haiti's situation, past and present. The reading material chosen was perfect for the course and the structure was fantastic in that it kept me on schedule the entire semester, all in preparation for the final project.\r\nThere was a lot of material and the way the assignments were scheduled helped tremendously with time management.",
                "One of the strengths of this course was the size. With around 18 people, discussion was always possible and inputting your own ideas was easy. The professor was capable of truly getting to know at least a bit about each of the students.",
                "I really appreciated the meetings after each paper submission",
                "Weakness was the grades and how they were given was not explained to the class at all.",

It's an interesting and valuable topic to learn about, and the class helps you develop writing and research skills.",
                "Yes, I think it not only provides you with a background knowledge of Haiti's history and challenges you to think about how to manage NGO's, how to create clean water solutions, and how to solve other problems facing many societies today, but it is also a great introduction to Yale courses in general due to Professor Geballe's thoughtful guidance.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The topics covered along with the skills learned are well worth your time if you are at all interested in the environment or in just becoming a better writer.",

Professor Geballe is caring and supportive, and the class was well-structured to introduce students to Yale. You will improve your writing, public speaking, organizational skills, and even learn how to lead a class.",
