                "I learned an incredible amount about text analysis and how to work with designers. I learned a lot about the process of Analysis through Action as well.",

                "I developed a genuinely useful method for approaching and analyzing the text of any play I happen to work on in the future. Also, I developed an appreciation for improv-based analysis through action, which will undoubtedly prove beneficial to me as a performer.",
                "Gained insight in to a very unique but very useful method of script analysis and rehearsal structure. Though I may not employ it to the fullest extent in the future, I will take components of it with me in every project from here on.",
                "I learned about Analysis Through Action and how to apply it to my work as a director. I feel more confident leading a rehearsal room. This course gave me the theoretical foundations for some of the directing techniques that feel intuitive to me, empowering me to follow my instincts as a director.",
                "I learned a lot about this history of acting technique, directing, Russian theater, and especially the Analysis Through Action technique. I feel much more confident to approach future directing projects with a process that will be fun and produce deep artistic results."

                "Strengths: incredibly knowledgeable professor, wonderful in-class feedback, collaborative space that fosters creativity and experimentation. It was a lot of fun to be able to apply the extensive knowledge we gained in the first half of the semester to the second half. That being said, this was double the workload of any other class I've taken in the theater department, or at Yale in general. Weaknesses: little-to-no feedback on written assignments which are quite extensive. There are no grades given during the semester.",
                "Overall, I really loved this course. Professor Chambers is wonderful and I learned so much from him. We were a little hindered by the 2 weeks of online classes, which made the second half of the semester very condensed. I would spend more time on our own personal projects than the full-class work on The Cherry Orchard.",
                "Strengths Professor Chambers is an incredible source of knowledge on Directing he made this class what it is. He did a good job blending theoretical and practical advice for directing. The deep focus on The Cherry Orchard was also very effective in teaching the technique; as was the field trip!\r\nWeaknesses almost too much information to cram into a class especially the second half of the course, the personal project, felt too rushed to teach the way that the deep dive into cherry orchard did. I'd rather this be split into two classes  D&T I focusing on one or two plays; D&T II a personal project."

                "Absolutely! If you're only familiar with the standard and unfulfilling process of sitting down to do table work before intellectually creating blocking, come find a new way to work.",
                "If you're willing to put in the hours, this course is well worth it. Don't take it in a 5 credit semester, you will regret it. I hope that it is always taught with a TF\/ULA because having Mikaela there was really wonderful and made both the classroom space and materials more comfortable. Also, be ready to get on your feet and work! I was really apprehensive coming into a room full of artists I respect so much but didn't know very well, and by the end of the semester it felt like a truly collaborative ensemble space. In short, take it, but know that it will require your full and passionate engagement.",
                "Yes! If you want to grow as a director, especially if you are interested in more avant garde theater, this is the course for you. The four hours tended to pass very quickly, especially when we were working on etudes in class.",
                "Yes  if you want to learn more about directing and aren't afraid to try something strange."
