                "This course definitely allowed me a chance to gain familiarity with the rigor of Yale's more challenging courses. H&P really helped me grasp a greater understanding of my writing skills and Professor Schillinger's advice allowed me to improve in ways I could've never imagined. In addition to this, DS H&P taught me how to read books at a pace that is acceptable for such a fast paced course.",
                "This course helped me develop numerous skills. Due to Professor Schillinger's tutelage, I feel that I greatly advanced my analytical abilities along with the fluency of my writing.",
                "Custom is king",
                "I learned how to read beyond the mundane. Professor Schillinger always provided insightful analysis when needed, and pushed us to get to form our own interpretations of the text.",
                "I will elaborate on Prof. Schillinger a little later, but I want to take this space to talk about Directed Studies, and more specifically the Historical and Political Thought track. In short, though, my message is this: take DS. There is simply no other way to find as much academic and personal fulfillment as taking a semester of Directed Studies, and H&P (my favorite track) is a core reason why. You learn so much in this course, from historiographical philosophies, to Greek/Roman history, to the foundations of political philosophy. If you want to understand how the world works in a course that also happens to be wonderfully fun, H&P is that. As a larger idea, though, DS H&P also incredibly improved my writing, close reading, and analysis skills. By writing papers so often, I got so much better at writing, and analyzing so much text in class has allowed me to better pull important themes from works. No matter how great you think you are, DS will make you better.",
                "Reading Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius, Livy, Plutarch, and Tacitus in H&P this semester provided me with a foundation in ancient Greek and Roman history. I also emerged from H&P with a strong understanding of how the various historians we read understand the value of history as a discipline and went about crafting their histories, and where the most prominent classical thinkers in the Western tradition stood on the fundamental questions of political philosophy. These questions included: What is the best regime? Is man naturally political? What constitutes a just society? What is the relationship between political and religious life?",
                "A deeper appreciation for and knowledge of the history of human politics in the West, refined textual analysis and writing abilities, and much higher proficiency in discussion and thought both inside and outside the seminar room."

            "comments": [
                "This course is rich in intellectual conversation and academic insight. Not only does H&P allow you the chance to look at such a broad and interactive span of history through the books we read, but H&P's discussions really invite you to be a part of the course. Why does Thucydides have so much credit when he practically states that he is saying what he thinks people said, not what they actually did? Is custom truly king? These are the questions that will be answered during this course are are among the many lists of strengths this class has to offer. As for weaknesses, all I really have to say is I wish I had more time for it. The readings are very thick and sometimes there really just isn't enough time to interact with the text as much as you'd like to.",
                "Without hyperbole, I can state that this course has no weaknesses. The discussions are greatly elevated by Professor Schillinger's comments -- and he does a fantastic job at ensuring that students participate fully. The \"starter questions\" are a fantastic addition that distinguished our section from my other DS classes. Furthermore, Professor Schillinger has a breath and depth of knowledge that stands out -- even among the DS faculty.",
                "The greatest strengths of DS H&P are the reading list, the professors, and the lectures. You read a ton of amazingly interesting things, have 8 incredibly brilliant and accomplished people teaching you about them, and have a weekly lecture from one of those people that is often earth-shattering. Its awesome. Prof. Schillinger, my professor, is especially a strength.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness is the workload. It is a lot of reading, and H&P readings are often both longer than Phil and more complex than Lit. However, thats what youre signing up for, and theyre not actually that bad! Besides, the readings are the core of the course, so DO THEM, and theyre also generally enjoyable and necessary for the course to function. Honestly, we read too little (theres so much more cool stuff that we dont read), but reading any more would be untenable and onerous.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- On the whole, amazing texts  this is true across all three DS tracks, but the texts in H&P were generally super interesting and thought-provoking. If nothing else, H&P is great because it affords you the opportunity to read many amazing, seminal texts.\r\n- Professor Schillinger  Prof. Schillinger is phenomenal, and he made H&P this past semester that much better. He comes to class with introductions to each thinker prepared, which were all deeply insightful and helped frame our class discussions. Prof. Schillinger does a great job at ensuring everyone's ideas are valued in class discussions. His feedback on essays is some of the most thorough and thoughtful I've ever received. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- H&P identity crisis  H&P, as a DS first-semester track, I think, experienced an identity crisis on two fronts. First, the historical thought vs. political thought fault line. We went back and forth between reading works of history and works of political philosophy in the first semester. The class effectively illustrated the connections between the historians and the connections between the political philosophers, but not the connections between the two groups. Second, with respect to methodology. Not only did it sometimes feel jarring going back and forth between reading historical texts and philosophical texts, which require vastly different approaches, but I dont think I was ever entirely clear on what constitutes valuable analysis in H&P in general. Unlike in DS literature and philosophy, the way we discussed texts varied. Sometimes we took a more literary approach, close reading passages, discussing the texts characterization of historical figures, and reasoning associatively. Other times we took a more philosophical approach, endeavoring to fully unpack a thinkers position on an issue in more precise terms. Other times still our approach to texts resembled neither the literary approach nor the philosophical approach. It was often difficult to predict which approach to texts we would pursue, which sometimes made the class feel like a moving target.",
                "A notable strength of this course was the texts; I found them to be the most interesting of the three DS tracks.  That said, the curriculum is not perfect, and towards the end of the course you have to work hard to contextualize and understand texts that become more isolated and spread out over history.  That said, for the breadth of time and the genre of content that it covers, the curriculum is extremely high-quality and will prepare you to engage in conversations of historical political theory and philosophy."

                "If you are in any way interested in what the Directed Studies syllabus has to offer, I'd highly recommend this course. The texts are very interesting and the discussions are incredibly enlightening, but if you have any inkling that you may have a hard time speaking in such a strong academic environment or you have any doubts about not being able to keep up with the course load, I would advise that you reconsider. People aren't lying when they say DS is a very large workload. That being said, Professor Schillinger is an incredible professor (and lecturer) and if you're looking to give DS a chance, he's the one to do it with. The grading is fairly reasonable. You don't understand how happy the transition from an 83 to an 88 is until you take a Directed Studies course. I owe a lot of my improvement to H&P and Professor Schillinger.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to other students. Professor Schillinger demonstrates both a mastery of the 10+ works we read and deft management of classroom dynamics.",
                "H&P was my favorite track in DS. One gets the opportunity to read the most important ideas that have ever been thought, and that is a true blessing.",
                "YES! Having summarized why you should take DS in the first place (its the best), I now want to talk about why you should take it with Prof. Schillinger. Simply put, he is an astoundingly good seminar leader, one of the most brilliant people I have ever met, and also an all-around nice guy. Our seminars were always excellent, with lots of people making really insightful text-based points and Prof. Schillinger inserting himself tactfully to clear things up or make a point of his own. The time flew by in his classroom as the discussion was just so engaging, and Prof. Schillingers wonderful seminar leadership was a big reason why. Oftentimes, however, affable seminar leaders may lack when it comes to lecturing, but Prof. Schillinger may have been even better. He is simply brilliant and his lectures were some of my favorites of the semester. Hes willing to engage with you intellectually, though, and is not demeaning in the slightestit is not his way or the highway. You feel a personal connection with him, and he seems to be able to relate to every person in the class.\r\n\r\nEven further, office hours with Prof. Schillinger are amazing, as he offers interesting suggestions by building off of your ideas. He invites students to meet with him and I did so for every essay, which helped me become a much better writer and thinker. I think I did my best work in his class because of the counsel he gave me. Feedback was also swift and incredibly detailed, and you could always meet with him to discuss it. Im not sure what else I can say, but Prof. Schillinger is just great.",
                "If you're set on doing DS, you don't have much of a choice about whether or not you take H&P. But you do have some degree of choice about which H&P professor you get, and I could not recommend Professor Schillinger more highly!",
                "Without a doubt.  If you want to begin to contextualize your place in human history and the human experience, sign up.  And do as much of the reading as you can; pages read is oftentimes directly proportional to the value that you get out of the text."
