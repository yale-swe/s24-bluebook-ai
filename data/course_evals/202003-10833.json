                "I learned how to analyze primary sources, read effectively, and write college-level essays. I learned about the work that gender, sexuality, and race do to advance the U.S. empire, from Theodore Roosevelt's rugged masculinity to 20th century European-American global feminism.",
                "How to analyze sources and apply the concepts to other texts.",
                "I learned a LOT about how expressions of gender, sexuality, race, and culture do the work of American imperialism, both in fictional depictions and in real-life movements and events. This class was incredibly insightful and opened up a whole new sphere of understanding for me, and it gave me the tools necessary to evaluate the world around me with a critical anti-imperialist lens, drawing stark connections between history and modernity and showing me how the dynamics of U.S. empire play out in the world today. I also improved my writing considerably; Professor TZB made sure to take us through the essentials of college writing alongside our class content, and taught us how to approach Yale prompts and writing assignments with clarity.",
                "I gained knowledge on how gender and sexuality have influenced US policy and culture. After having taken this course, I now have the tools to analyze the world around me through a different lens (influences of gender\/sexuality and the way they've been manipulated)",
                "This course quite literally taught me a different way of thinking. As we analyzed various aspects of U.S. culture and foreign policy throughout the semester, I learned how pervasive gendered and racialized messaging is in the media we consume as well as how great of an impact this messaging has on our ideology and worldview. I'm now more fully aware of how closely intertwined white supremacy and Americanism are, the military's role in perpetuating and institutionalizing homophobia, the myriad ways in which gender propelled imperialism, and so many other events\/trends which have been foundational in the formation of today's America.",
                "This class absolutely shifted my world perspective. It's the perfect First-Year Seminar to unlearn 12 years worth of washed-down American history and replace it with a critical understanding of the United States at the domestic and global level through the 20th and 21st century. The class helped me improve my writing significantly, and provided me with the toolkit to understand American affairs through gender and sexuality. Taught me a lot about American imperialism and the role it plays in much of the media we consume.",
                "I learned how to be concise with my writing and still convey complex messages. I truly honed in on my writing skills in this class.",
                "I learned soooo much about our countrys history in ways that were just glossed over in high school. Prof. Tzb did a great job of teaching us the basics of how to write different types of college essays, how to conduct research, and how to read and analyze effectively. AMAZING COURSE! Taught me how to be an effective learner in college and how to take time to care for myself.",
                "I learned a lot about the masculinity, imperialism, etc that America presented both domestically and internationally. The class consisted of three papers and Professor TZB was really easy to work with. My writing improved a lot throughout the course.",
                "I gained significant knowledge on American history reviewed in the context of gender and sexuality. From learning about the US military's sentiments towards homosexuality to American exceptionalism deeply integrated into various media outlets, this class delves into the most interesting conversations and reconstructed my view about the US empire.",
                "This course taught me how to analyze primary and secondary sources, draw connections between several sources, and build a strong argument. The course taught me about how various political and social structures and standards were constructed throughout American history. It effectively connected these historical concepts to modern events and U.S. politics."

                "Strengths: the content was incredibly engaging and TZB is so understanding and helpful. She really helps you understand the text better.",
                "Strengths: PROFESSOR ZEMACH-BERSIN (or Professor TZB, as we knew her!)\r\nShe is one of the kindest, most considerate, and most helpful teachers I've ever had in any subject, and she made my transition to Yale so much better because of all that I got out of her class. She is incredibly knowledgeable and insightful, and puts in maximum effort to make sure we're all on the same page as her (in terms of class content, expectations, mutual respect, and comprehension). Her syllabus was well-organized, and her reading assignments always served us in drawing clear conclusions about the topic in question; at times when I felt confused or unsure about the readings, her in-class analysis helped immensely. Additionally, her feedback on our papers was super helpful, constructive, and not negative in any way -- she always wanted us to learn from our mistakes and grow for the purposes of our career at Yale, not just for her class. She was able to create a really safe, comfortable, and informal learning environment (on Zoom!) and I always looked forward to AMST 032.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings were pretty long, and took a while to reach their main point. We would always debrief them in class, so I was still able to get a lot out of them, but I sometimes felt unprepared before the next class because I hadn't fully understood that day's reading. (Please note that this is the ONLY weakness.)",
                "Strengths: professor, teaching style, course structure, class discussion\r\nWeaknesses: readings could be trimmed to just have essential information",
                "STRENGTHS: Absolutely everything. For starters, the professor: TZB is everything you could ask for in an instructor and more. She created a relaxed and comfortable learning environment, managed to give us insightful feedback while simultaneously putting all of the emphasis on learning rather than grades, frequently checked in on how we were doing as people rather than just students, and made us feel less alone during this virtual semester. Another strength would be the small class size; this not only made us feel comfortable participating in seminar discussions, but also facilitated a community which has been increasingly difficult to find anywhere else during the pandemic. The curriculum was also above and beyond anything I was expecting; not only do I feel more comfortable with academic writing, but I gained an entirely new perspective on so many integral elements of American culture and policy. The secondary source readings and the analyses of cultural objects were incredible and eye-opening. I truly feel like this course has been transformative, and that I would not be the person I am today had I not taken it.\r\nWEAKNESSES: N\/A. If I had to name one, I would say that there were a lot of readings, but I'm just a slow reader. And besides, I didn't mind because each and every one was carefully picked and enlightening.",
                "Strengths: Prof. TZB!!! Not only is she the most caring and understanding professor I've met so far, but she is also great at teaching the content of the course. The seminar discussions are engaging and Prof. TZB is always open to commentary and\/or questions. In addition, the assignments for the course were varied (three essays but each one was fairly different from the last) and honestly fun to complete. Course carried over very well to the virtual format.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can't particularly think of any. However, the readings were long but super interesting (so not a weakness but if you don't like reading then you might have a tough time on that front).",
                "I enjoyed taking this course because it felt lively and the course content was extremely interesting and engaging for me.",
                "Strengths: Professor TZB is an absolutely amazing human being let alone teacher. She takes the time to make sure each student fully understands the materials, not just for essays and discussions, but for real life applications. \r\nWeaknesses: None, pls take this course.",
                "I liked the course structure. We had weekly readings with reading responses, and three papers. Professor TZB was really easy to work with and understanding of everything going on.",
                "Strength: Readings extremely engaging, topics for papers were very open and the timeline of the material was very fluid to be able to make your own connections as the course progressed.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is the professor. Professor TZB is one of the kindest teachers I've ever had. She was always understanding and helpful throughout the entire term, especially with the conditions of the pandemic and the election. The material covered in the course is incredibly interesting. I loved learning about the various political, cultural, and social formations that we explored. The course did well to investigate the intersections between race, gender, sexuality, etc. Prof. TZB also did a great job of making the in-class discussions of the material interesting and engaging. She created a class atmosphere where everyone could feel comfortable. There weren't many weaknesses to the class."

                "Yes. This is hands-down the best first-year seminar. This is my favorite class so far, the class that made me want to log onto Zoom a couple minutes early so we could get started right on time. This is the class that, despite all odds, succeeded in forging friendships across the digital divide. Also, the reading we did for this class was just fascinating. I could now tell you about the persecution against queer soldiers in the army, the difference between traditional orientalism and the sentimental mode, how domesticity is not only a concept that anchors the home but furthers the aims of U.S. empire by domesticating the foreign. Every class was a roller coaster ride where we felt windswept and enthralled at the end. If I could take this class again, I would.",
                "Yes!!! TZB is such a pleasure and I learned so much in this class. 10\/10 would take again.",
                "YES. TZB is a phenomenal professor, and you will build so many great connections with your classmates even if you end up being online. This is a terrific FYS for so many reasons and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in history, U.S. foreign policy, gender\/sexuality studies, or popular culture -- you will learn so much about the way our world works and you'll build so many incredible skills for learning and for life.",
                "Absolutely, I thoroughly enjoyed this course and felt that I learned how to write better, engage with material, and learned a large amount about the topic all while fostering a collaborative and welcoming environment with my classmates",
                "YES YES YES. THIS CLASS IS A MUST-TAKE. I think about the world in a completely different way because of this class, and I would not be the person I am today without having taken it. I honestly think that no course I take in the future will be able to compare to this one. Professor TZB is absolutely incredible  kind, understanding, funny, truly cares about her students, and creates a learning environment where grades are entirely de-emphasized and participation is completely comfortable. Every reading and discussion was fascinating, and papers were something to look forward to rather than a chore to complete. I entered college as a prospective STEM major, and this class has made me very seriously consider American studies. The things you learn in this class are so crucial to understanding American culture and foreign policy, and if you have the opportunity to take this class with TZB you should not turn it down.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Professor TZB is amazing and the course will change how you view the world (and a lot of American historical figures). The readings are super engaging and the seminar discussions go over them thoroughly to assure you understand them fully. It was my favorite class of my first semester!",
                "I would recommend this course to students because the content is truly extremely eye-opening and it has changed the way I view my actions. It has given me a better way to think about the implications of my actions and how I can better them to be an active member of my community.",
                "Yes! This was a great class to take first semester at Yale. The readings were very interesting and most of what we talked about was never mentioned in my high school classes.",
                "Yes, yes, yes !!! This is a life changing experience! This course really taught me about how our world works and about how I work. Its an amazing course especially as a first year seminar. You wont regret taking this class.",

The course helped me improve my writing and become a better critical thinker. Prof. TZB is also an amazing, understanding, and kind professor who prioritizes students' mental health. I learned so much from this course about construction of white patriarchal structures that continue to shape American society. The readings are fascinating and not overwhelming in length. The essay topics are all interesting and give you the freedom to explore your ideas. Take this course!"
