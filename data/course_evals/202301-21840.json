Some collaborative assignments also would not have been missed."

It is up to you what you make of this course-- I would recommend going outside of your comfort zone and taking advantage of your weekly lessons by always having a good amount of new content to go over!",
                "Yes, but with some hesitations. You can look at it in two ways.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, I got to get credit for composing and get free weekly private lessons, and get to hear some of the leading composers of today talk about their music. Both of these are incredible opportunities and its a privilege to have them! There really isnt much work other than your main piece. And it is very accepting of different styles, classical and otherwise! You wont be forced to write a kind of music you dont like. So it feels like you may as well take the class if you already enjoy composing.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the class is very, very unstructured. The course description made me think there would be smaller assignments that might target some specific skill, but basically the only assignment in the class was to work on your main piece. At times I felt like I could have gotten more specific feedback in my lessons. Often the Thursday class felt long and not the most engaging. And while I love the diversity of students preferred genres, it sometimes feels wrong to try to force people only interested in music production to learn about classical music and vice versa; because of this I often felt like I had no clue what was being discussed because I lacked the basic background knowledge. And dont expect this class to force you out of your comfort zoneyou have to motivate yourself.\r\n\r\nSo yes, but dont expect it to be much more than self-directed composition lessons."
