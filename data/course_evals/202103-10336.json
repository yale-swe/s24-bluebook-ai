                "In the seminar, I learned how to think critically about the media--in particular, how the media selects and portrays the pain and how that links to power dynamics. I've also learned how to come up with a strong claim, use resources to conduct research, and write more effectively using the five elements of an essay. \r\n\r\nMost of all, I loved all the essays we were assigned to write. With each essay, I grew in terms of my knowledge, research skills, and communication skills.",

                "I think that something overall that was difficult in this course was trying to unpack the change in terminology. A claim, problem, warrant, and motives were not the terms that I used for any fo my education previously, so getting comfortable with those terms was definitely challenging at times. The strengths of this course was definitely my professor. She cultivated an environment of growth and comfortability.",
                "Strength \r\n- The course is very well structured and introduces college students to college-level writing very well. \r\n- The units are divided in such a way that students can practice in steps: close reading, synthesize two sources, research paper, and a video project. \r\n- The professor was amazing--Sara was so prepared and understanding all throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nWeakness \r\n- Sometimes, I felt like the discussions often deviated from the class topics.\r\n- At first, I disliked having to learn the technical terms in an essay",
                "Definitely targeted at people who have less of a background in academic writing. As someone coming from a high school that really focused on learning how to write, some of the content felt pretty basic. I think overall, though, there was plenty of helpful material.",
                "Strengths: Forces students to read high levels texts at a relatively fast pace\r\nWeaknesses: The focus on how to become a better writer could be strenghtened",
                "Strengths: Sara! She is very great professor overall and she gives feedback that is clear and helps improve your writing. The readings are very insightful and makes you rethink what you know about pain. Also, the workload is manageable. No weaknesses",
                "I personally wished that later in the course when we read a lot of different pieces about different ways pain and politics connect that we had dove deeper into one to two rather than looking more broadly in addition to our own research paper explorations.",
                "The strengths of this course was that the content was very interesting and the professor guided us extremely well. The weakness would be the workload, because there were a lot of readings and papers due.",
                "I do not have any weaknesses to list. This class was absolutely fantastic. Sara created an environment based on reflection, support, and open communication. I felt closer to my classmates in this class than all my others, felt more comfortable asking Sara for help, and felt more comfortable expressing my ideas and reflections in discussion. Likewise, Sara provided consistent, in-depth feedback on all of our assignments; with this, I felt I had the ability to improve with every new paper. Sara created such a wonderful environment for my first semester of college, and I think this class best equipped me for academic writing during the rest of my college career.",
                "In terms of strengths, I think the prompts were very well-developed and really challenged the students intellectually. However, I think it would be helpful to add another essay or two into the curriculum. The essays we did taught me a lot, but more practice would have been helpful for me. Even though I already submitted my last essay for the course, I feel like there's still some things about my writing that need to be addressed and improved, and I feel like I could have finally reached that point of truly being confident with my writing if we had gotten more writing practice. The kind of assignments included in this course were very helpful, but I just think the workload needs to be increased a bit so that students can get as much as possible out of the class. However, considering writing is one of my stronger subjects, I do recognize that my opinion towards the difficulty of the course may differ from others'."

All throughout your career in college, you will have to write research essays with minimal prompts, and Engl 114 will prepare you to have the skills to write those essays: from constructing your own claim to synthesizing your own research into your words. \r\nIf you're interested in politics and different kinds of pain, Politics of Pain is also perfect for you.",

Sara is an amazing and organized professor so you will definitely enjoy!",

                "Absolutely!!! I cannot recommend this course and Sara Misgen enough! This class was definitely a highlight of my first semester, and I hope it can be for an incoming first-year too. When I came to Yale, I had a really hard time accepting that I belong here; Sara made sure that feeling did not last. She asked us from day 1 to reflect on what goals we are hoping to accomplish, and she helped us achieve them. She showed me that even at Yale, I can be a success and accomplish whatever I set my mind to! Sara helped me realize that I, too, have a success story here at Yale. Regarding the course specifically, it was a great way to be introduced to college writing. The course offers enough instruction and practice so that we come out feeling confident in our abilities to write college essays.",
