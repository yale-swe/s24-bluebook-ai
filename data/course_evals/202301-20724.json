                "I was expecting more tedium as an art major, but actually really enjoyed the structure and assignments.",

                "Learned how to bring creative ideas into different mediums of art (printmaking, charcoal drawings, film animation)",
                "I learned a lot about the different mediums in art, including drawing, printmaking, and animation. I also gained knowledge on how to speak about art and how to see works through different lenses.",
                "Knowledge of unique means of visual representation - cyanotype, 16mm film, charcoal drawing, print making",
                "I developed an understanding of multiple mediums across Art history that I'd, in the past, never fully acknowledged such as cyanotype and press-print making.",
                "we were taught how to see, how to translate what we see using lines, and carving out images from black space. we worked with drawing, cyanotype, printmaking, and film. we were assigned readings on the history of these mediums and their socio-political context. we critiqued one another's artwork and developed a language to discuss visual art.",
                "The ability to critically think about art and what it means to be an artist. The four areas consisted of drawing, cyanotype photography, printmaking, and film. We developed a plethora of technical skills as well as honed our ability to think in visual terms and with visual vocabulary. Excellent!",
                "General introduction to various disciplines, including printmaking, drawing, and analog film. Developed understanding of the relationship between these mediums, and flexibility of class allowed for experimentation.",
                "A wide range of technical foundations in different art backgrounds including drawing, cyanotypes, ekphrasis, print-making, and animation."

                "Strengths: laidback environment, nice exposure to different mediums of art",
                "I thought this course was incredible - I loved all the projects we worked on and I felt like Hasabie did a fantastic job leading us through the many different areas of art that we explored.",
                "It was a great introduction to multiple mediums without feeling overly rushed or pressured in each project! In my opinion, the course weakness would probably be the timing of certain projects with undergraduate breaks such as spring break for this Spring semester in the case of midterm project presentations.",
                "strengths - hasabie was a kind, incredibly smart, communicative, and thoughtful teacher. many friends told me not to take this course when it was taught by other professors, but I took the shot when I saw hasabie would be teaching it. she wrote interesting prompts for each assignment, offered clear feedback, and radiated an appreciation for art that the whole class could feel. I also liked our tf, Maria. great readings, great assignments (loved the prompts and manageable deadlines). great mediums to explore.\r\n\r\nweaknesses - I can't think of any right now",
                "Professor Kidanu is such an incredible professor and the course was very well organized. We received insightful lectures, demonstrations, and feedback that helped us improve throughout the semester. No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Brief introduction across various disciplines may be helpful for people unsure of what kind of mediums they are interested in and want to gently explore. Flexibility of course allows a lot of room for experimentation and freedom to combine different mediums. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Introductory structure of the class may make it difficult to delve into and gain solid technique in any one medium; more time in class spent talking about the medium rather than applying it.",
                "strengths: getting to explore a diverse range of art making (especially with access to the print shop and being able to visit the film archive and art gallery); the course was designed extremely well in introducing different ways to make, write, see, and think about art (great for anyone with any level of experience)!"

                "Highly recommend for an enjoyable time, you might learn new things about yourself and perhaps come to appreciate art more",

                "YES!!!! especially if it is taught by hasabie",
                "Yes, yes, yes!!! This was such an amazing opportunity as a non-art major, and this was genuinely one of my favorite classes at Yale. You learn so much and the studio time doesn't feel like 'homework' compared to essays or PSETs. 100% would recommend.",
                "I'd recommend this course to a student interested in gaining a brief introduction across various disciplines, especially if they are unsure of what kind of mediums they are interested in and want to gently explore. Flexibility of course allows a lot of room for experimentation and freedom to combine different mediums.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student. It was great to explore different ways to make art- not only by getting hands on and making art with all the different mediums but also by visiting the art gallery and film archive and getting a deeper understanding of the history and stories behind artists. It was also very beginner friendly and welcoming to students of any background experience since each unit basically felt like a crash course into print-making, photography, and animation."
