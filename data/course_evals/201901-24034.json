   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Wonderful topic, pheneomenal professor, interesting students.\r\nThe assignment structure and workload level of the class was perfect  weekly readings, one research term paper on a topic of your choice, one low-key presentation on a topic of your choice, and a very fair take-home final.\r\nWeakness: The actual class time was a lot of lectures (by Sigga and by students), which can be difficult for a 1h50 seminar period. Some more discussion based classes may be helpful even if it is only a few times over the semester. Maybe a mock debate or conference of regulators\/supervisors would be a fun and interactive class towards the end of the semester.",
    "Strengths- Leaving this class, I feel very comfortable to go into finance. Gives a really god foundational knowledge of the industry. Very practical",
    "Strengths - Will definitely help me as I enter my job in finance. I had never taken a class on this topic nor understood what all the financial risk buzz words meant. \r\n\r\nWeakness - none. couldnt have asked for a better senior year econ seminar.",
    "Sigga is amazing. She is super smart and passionate about what she does."

    "YES!!! A wonderful class with important content taught by the BEST professor. Sigga is a brilliant researcher, accomplished economist, wonderful professor, DUS of Global Affairs. The list goes on and on. If for nothing else, take this class for Sigga. She is a role model and an aspiration to us all. Moreover, you learn a lot without an intense workload. Sigga has very reasonable expectations for her students; she just wants us to learn.",
    "Lots of flexibility that allows you to take ownership of your learning",
    "YES. you will NOT regret taking this class with Sigga. even if the topic is only mildly interesting to you, you will walk away having learned so much and the opportunity to ben in the presence of Sigga & learn from her is amazing. you wont regret it!!!",
    "Absolutely! Sigga is a great teacher."
