                "Strengths: Professor Homans! Her knowledge of the material and subjects made for such enriching discussions that left me thinking long after class about what it means to write from the past or for the past to be present in literature. Her ability to connect texts, authors, and ideas pushed different ways of reading to see where authors diverged, aligned, and worked through - and alongside - one another to construct or depict race and gender. On this note another strong point was the combination of texts with theory. We read Edwidge Danticat with a lens to Jane Eyre and also read different theories (e.g. Cristina Sharpe's theories of annotation and redaction, Saidiya Hartman's Venus in Two Acts) that provided a foundation with which we could ask and answer questions about transatlantic literature. In addition to class content and reading, I felt my writing got much stronger especially with crafting (not just building) arguments from texts because of Professor Homans' feedback and insights. \r\nWeaknesses: Seminar sometimes took a little bit to pick up, but I believe that stemmed more from students not doing the readings (and the reading load is well paced! Not overwhelming in my opinion)"

She will read all of your essay drafts and actually provide thorough feedback on how to improve your writing! I did very well in the course and it's really easy to do well as long as you ask for help! She's amazing at guidance!",
                "Yes! It has some echoes of ENGL 127 for any English majors only in that some of the texts are similar. I found returning to the texts (e.g. Harriet Jacobs and Zitkala a) rewarding and reading them alongside new texts allowed me to see new connections. The smaller size of the seminar made it possible to voice ideas - sometimes loosely formed ones that were later changed and this allowed class to feel dynamic. I could tell my thinking shifted with the insight of my peers and their readings and I also found myself feeling much more confident in my assertions in my writing."
