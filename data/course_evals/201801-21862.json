   "comments": [
    "I had never taken statistics before! I learned how to conduct approximately 10 tests and look critically about statistics in the world around me",
    "I am much more equipped to understand the stats that is in psychology papers.",
    "Developed a thorough knowledge of statistics and a knowledge of how\/when to apply what I have learned. I utilized what I have learned for this class in many of my other classes.",
    "I learned how to follow instructions regarding APA.",
    "I gained understanding about how to formulate research and how to analyze that research with statistical analysis.",
    "Learned how to use SPSS in great detail, learned how to use different statistical tests in different situations",
    "a lot of stuff man",
    "I learned so much about how to analyze data using SPSS and how to write up the results in APA format, which is incredibly useful for future psychology research.",
    "I learned a great deal about the foundations and basics of statistics, along with how to apply statistical principles to the real world. I feel that I learned genuine uses for practically utilizing statistics in every day life and in any field.",
    "I learned a lot about interpreting and reporting data, using SPSS, and writing APA style papers. The course was also helpful in showing us how we might evaluate other statistical claims (like in newspapers, for example)",
    "Learned an array of statistical tests that I can now apply to quantitatively draw conclusions surrounding a set of data.",
    "I gained a working knowledge of SPSS and the ability to interpret psychological research from a statistical perspective.",
    "I learned how to better understand statistical research and use SPSS.",
    "I came in with no experience or knowledge of statistics, and learned a lot about the different statistical analyses you can use and when, and how to use software to handle data.",
    "I learned how to interact with statistics and even how to question and challenge them. I also learned what goes into a psychological study and how to evaluate research questions and their results.",
    "statistical analyses",
    "I learned different statistical tests and when to apply them. Also learned how to use SPSS.",
    "I learned how to think critically and how to decide what statistical tests to run\r\nI felt confident in my skills enough at the end of the class to even apply them to another of my classes",
    "Basic tests to run",
    "I learned how to actually conduct statistical tests and writing a scientific paper in reporting a study.",
    "This class is excellent for people of a wide variety of interests: psychology, cognitive science, political science, public health, sports analysis, journalism, etc. No matter what knowledge of statistics you start with (I started with none), you'll finish off knowing how to evaluate statistical claims, collect data ethically and sensibly, sift through the data in many ways to look for \"signals\" of interests, and present your findings in a way that situates them meaningfully in the broader context of the questions you're asking. Practically speaking, the broad concrete skills you learn include t-tests (independent samples, paired, and one-sample), one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, t-scores, z-scores, correlation, and regression. You'll also learn how to convey relevant information about your data in APA format, both numerically and verbally. Also, you'll learn how to use SPSS, which is a statistical analysis software. Don't let that scare you: No computer programming experience is required, and the teaching team for this class ROCKS. (I am terrified of computers and had no difficulty learning this program.) You'll eventually get to the point where the assignments will ask you to \"tell a story\" about the data, and you'll be able to. That's really, really satisfying.",
    "Good intro statistics class, workload is very manageable and material is interesting. Highly recommend",
    "This course made me more aware of the what statistics truly mean in different contexts and how to interpret them efficiently.",
    "Basic statistics.  How to format a lab report.  Hypothesis testing.",
    "you learn how to run statistical tests to learn how to evaluate data sets and relate them to see significant effects\/differences.",
    "I learned about several different statistical tests and when I would use specific tests to be able to make important discoveries about data sets.",
    "Basic statistics skills, APA format",
    "I developed knowledge on how to use SPSS, and I really like the guided approach we took in class to learn statistical techniques. I learned a lot about several fundamental statistics theories and practical applications of them, such as in our midterm, final, and paper assignments. All of these helped me gain an increased understanding of various statistical techniques.",
    "Before taking this course I had literally zero knowledge about statistics; I had never taken a statistics course before or read a book on this subject. I learned how to look at statistical data with an analytical eye, asking about base rates before offering an opinion and how to run different statistical tests and interpret them.",
    "How to use SPSS, how to read data, how to interpret data",
    "Use of SPSS software, understanding of statistical science, ability to write a statistical report, ability to assess and understand what statistical tests communicate and which ones are appropriate.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of the basics of statistics with a focus on applications in psychology. Learning and using SPSS was instrumental in understanding what was taught in class.",
    "In this course, I learned about how to properly use SPSS to conduct statistical tests, especially in (but not limited to) the social sciences. This course was helpful for learning which test to use when, as well as a cursory background in statistical concepts. However, the brunt of the work is assessing the ability to use SPSS properly (and a LOT of focus on APA format).",
    "I loved this course! I learned so much about statistics and everyone on the teaching team was so incredibly helpful.",
    "Literally none.  I'm a stats major and should not have taken this course.",
    "How to use SPSS, stats basics, not much about psychology.",
    "I took AP statistics in high school, and I will say that the first half of the course is a review of that material. I found this really nice, because I needed a quantitative reasoning credit and didnt want to take anything that was going to be too difficult as a fifth class.  That being said, I did learn new material after the midterm but served me well. As someone potentially going into psychology, I found this course very helpful. I feel as though Im going to incorporate what I learned into many papers that I write in the future.",
    "SPSS analysis, super helpful on statistical tests that I hadn't covered before (in high school stats)",
    "So people say this class is a gut. Professor Gee knows that, and knows that people aren't investing as much time in this as they should. The way this class is formatted simply lends itself to putting in minimum efforts (ie. fill-in-the-blank lab writeups, <10 question psets, etc.) Despite all of this, I felt like even though I wasn't that invested in this class, I learned the ins and outs of SPSS very well. Unlike most other classes, I came out with an applicable skill, that I may potentially use in life. So while I might not remember the specifics of statistics that we covered in lecture, at least I feel well versed in SPSS.",
    "This course teaches the introductory statistical tests needed to test hypotheses. It also teaches APA format.",
    "How to use spss, statistical terms and tests and when to use them",
    "How to use SPSS, how to analyze data, how to run tests that are especially relevant to psych studies, etc.",
    "I learned how to interpret and analyze statistical data and run statistical tests.",
    "SPSS basics needed to do psyc experimental studies",
    "I had previously taken AP Statistics in high school so much of the information taught in this class was from then, but I still learned far more about applying the information from statistics and tests in analytical ways. This allows me to use the material taught in my lab and in future work.",
    "I didn't really think I learned anything all semester until I got to the final and I was like, \"WOAH, I can write up a whole report about any psych study properly formatted.\"",
    "I knew nothing about statistics coming into this course and learned so much. It was an excellent course all around.",
    "How to look at data better",
    "This class provided a useful foundation for understanding statistics and running statistical tests using SPSS.  This will be useful for my thesis research, for understanding psychology studies, and for understanding statistical claims in the media more broadly.",
    "Some general stuff about statistics and a lot about APA format",
    "We learned the basics of statistical analyses, and specifically how to conduct these analyses on SPSS. I now have a good enough understanding of statistics to interpret results when they appear in empirical papers. I am also able to conduct my own analyses on SPSS.",
    "I learned the basics of statistical analysis and how to use SPSS. I also feel more confident reading APA studies and am more confident in critically analyzing articles including what could be misleading statistical data.",
    "Lots of tests to run, how to use SPSS, stats basics!!",
    "I learned numerous statistical analyses and how to directly apply them to data sets, which I found much more fulfilling and useful than just learning the information and rules on how to do statistical analyses but not actually conducting them. The application part of this course, with both the lab section and homework assignments, made the course material much easier to digest and understand. I also learned how to critically understand statistical reports in the context of news and in scientific papers, which has been very useful in reading psychological papers for other classes and for my lab.",
    "I greatly honed my skills regarding ways to apply statistics to various real-life situations, especially in terms of psychological research. I also learned how to use SPSS, which has been incredibly useful in more cases than just the class.",
    "I learned about practical applications of statistics to the world of psychology. I learned basic statistic tests and how to use SPSS to further my ability to collect and test my own data.",
    "how to use SPSS and analyze statistical significance of data using different tests.",
    "I gained many valuable insights into reading popular media articles with statistical claims and hard skills using SPSS.",
    "I learned how and when to use different types of analyses such as one sample t tests, correlation\/regression, one way-ANOVA, etc.",
    "Basic statistics, APA style, how to use SPSS",
    "I learned about statistical concepts especially concerning how to use certain tests and analyze data sets.",
    "Knowledge of SPSS software and statistical tests, particularly useful for psychology majors.",
    "Thorough practical knowledge of SPSS & statistical tests such as t-tests, regressions, and ANOVAs.",
    "Learned about useful statistical tests to use for senior psychology thesis and more generally in social science research, how to be more critical about evaluating claims in pop science articles.",
    "I learned statistical concepts, such as normal distribution, mean, and standard deviation. I also learned about statistical tests, such as one sample t-test, ANOVA, and regression. I have also learned how to write up a statistics report.",
    "This course taught me how to run statistical tests for research applications.",
    "How to use SPSS\r\nHow statistics is used in the real world in terms of psychology and commonly known logistics within the field\r\ncorrect use of APA for statistical reporting\r\nhow different biases affect the way we not only present but interpret data\r\ndifferent methods for creating the \"best possible\" study \r\nalways stressing the importance of limitations in a study and future research implications",
    "A foundation in the statistical methods used in psychological studies.",
    "I learned about a variety of statistical tests, such as one sample t tests, independent samples t tests, paired sample t tests, correlation\/regression, and ANOVAs. I also learned how to apply my knowledge of statistical tests to real world situations (e.g. which test to use in which case).",
    "I learned how and when to run different statistical tests.",
    "I learned basic statistical tests.",
    "Learned how to use SPSS",
    "an introduction to statistics and statsitical tests",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength is Dylan Gee\r\nWeakness is the lectures are boring",
    "Proffessor Gee was super nice and supportive and the whole staff put a lot from work into the class. However, the class was just so slow and boring and while I loved how easy it was, I feel like the level of ease made me not put much effort in.",
    "Strengths: Professor Gee and SPSS Weaknesses: none",
    "Strengths:\r\n-Extremely useful\r\n-Great lab sections\r\n-Format of midterm and final which stresses knowledge and not memorization (both of these we get access to 24 hours before the final; the actual dataset is released at the time of the final) \r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-Since both the midterm and final both focus on deciding which test to use, it would be helpful to have continuous review throughout the semester of similar situations. For example, the class before the final, we reviewed in class several situations and decided which test would be best to run according to that situation. That was really great, and it would be even better if we did this continually throughout the semester. \r\n-I didn't really understand why we were only given 24 hours in advance to prepare the final. While I am definitely glad that we received in the final in advance(as noted above in strengths), this resulted in cramming (not memorization, but in writing terms) the day before. Another 24 hours would make a big difference so we have time to think about our task and plan out possible responses.",
    "The weakness of the course is that there is no need to go to lecture as you can survive off of reading slides.",
    "This was a very strong course. Prof. Gee is clearly dedicated to her students and their (our) learning, and expectations for our assignments were well communicated.",
    "Strengths of this course is that is caters towards students understanding the fundamentals of statistics analysis and applying that analysis to actual examples in real life. It is applicable to many career fields and is the analysis we studied are useful tools to have going into any job.",
    "Strengths: It is very easy to get any help that you need, it is an easy workload to deal with, and the concepts you learn are simple yet helpful if you're interested in research. I also liked how the course used Piazza (which I had never used before) and it was really helpful if you had questions or trouble with HW. Grading is lenient and there are no required texts.\r\nWeaknesses: SPSS is required, which can be $40+ on your laptop BUT you can get through the course just by using SPSS on any Yale computer.",
    "The pacing of the course was too fast at times, and I felt as if we were just breezing through some of the topics, especially when we began to fall behind schedule.",
    "it could be better if the kids were yeah you know",
    "Strengths: very straight forward and clear. \r\nWeakness: I don't think I ever really figured out the clicker situation.",
    "The course had great teaching from he professor and made use off many real world and practical examples that I believe aided in student learning, I think that a weakness of the course was in the way the weekly lab sections were conducted. The course could be improved by making lab more interactive and less scripted.",
    "The course was very well taught and easy to succeed in if you put in a little effort, turn in assignments, and attend lecture.",
    "This class is the GOAT. Super interesting, engaging, and not as easy as people say it is, which is nice.",
    "Very engaging!",
    "Good course, easy to follow, low workload. No complaints here.",
    "Strengths: very straightforward, lab sections are fun, psets are manageable, professor and TA staff are great.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are sometimes hard to follow as concepts can be challenging and sometimes only one example is used. In the future, multiple examples would help, as well as reviewing content (as we started to do at the end of the class).",
    "I think the course overall went at a good pace and was very accessible and relevant, which made the information interesting. The only structural thing I had a little trouble with is that I felt the most complex lessons were all crammed in the last two weeks, and would've liked more time to practice those concepts (eg. ANOVAs).",
    "I felt that the homework assignments and labs were very helpful, and I loved that we were able to really interact with the material through applying them on these assignments. I think that at times Professor Gee went fast, although towards the end of the class she worked on slowing the pace down.",
    "I honestly just dont like statistics so I didnt love the class, but at the same time I dont think it could have been taught better. Prof Gee was amazing and the TFs were so kind and willing to help. They truly tried to make it a good experience for everyone and I thought that was great.",
    "Professor Gee was a great strength of the course. She was incredibly friendly and accessible, as well as a great lecturer. Sections were a waste of time however, in that handouts were posted with step by step instructions in SPSS (and answers later). I felt like I was showing up only because attendance factored into my grade.",
    "Strengths were that the professor was very engaged and well prepared and cared deeply about each of her students \r\nShe even learned most of the students names",
    "The one criticism of this class is that they are EXTREMELY picky, but once you know what they're looking for and are careful, it gets better. I do think section times could have been better, but I found one that worked for me so I was fine (this wasn't the case for others). Great, easy class, so not much to complain about.",
    "Really only need to go to section; the lectures confuse you more than they help. Sucks that we were graded on going to class through clickers especially as an athlete and we had games every Wednesday and I had to skip class.",
    "great lecturer, very organized",
    "There are no weaknesses of this course. It is the most well organized course I have taken at Yale which is impressive given the nature of the software, the projects, and the exam format.",
    "The course is impeccably designed to be straightforward and engaging. Lectures move at a manageable pace, and the material is cumulative  not in a way that is overwhelming, but rather in a way that gives you a sense you're really learning something. Professor Gee spends the perfect amount of time highlighting the theory behind why certain statistical tests work, enough to help you appreciate the analysis. She also gives a lot of concrete examples, so you feel ready to import your knowledge into real-world situations. Problem sets require the use of SPSS (I didn't buy it since it's on the Yale desktop computers, and that worked out just fine) and directly reflect what you've learned in class and section each week, with ample time to consult with Professor Gee and the teaching team in advance of turning them in. Also, 10% of your course grade is based on showing up to section and lecture (the latter is measured by clicker data you provide when you come to class). Our daily \"clicker time\" was actually a fun part of the class, as were the lab sections, where you got to cement a new conceptual skill by working with real data sets (often from clicker data!) in SPSS. Additionally, I thought the exam format was brilliant, even though it was challenging. It involves actually working with a dataset during the 50-minute exam and \"telling a story\" about the data through a write-up like you'd do on a real paper in the real world. My only suggestion for the exam format would be to release the exam materials 48 hours before the test instead of 24 hours. I know that makes it easier for people to cheat, but since my Tuesday schedule was absolutely packed this semester, I found myself struggling to find time to prepare in the 24 hours before the exam and would have appreciated a little more flexibility in my schedule.",
    "Strengths: Homework and exams very well aligned with lectures and section\r\nNo real weaknesses",
    "The assessments are very one-note.  They lack variety.  The class, itself, is fairly straightforward, though, which is good.",
    "It was a good class and the psets and lab were very good at teaching the information. If anything, the lecture were a little boring.",
    "This class was very well-organized and delivered the information very clearly. The lab section was able very helpful in putting the things we learned in class into actual practice.",
    "One strength is the guided approach provided during the lab sections, because we learned a lot about SPSS, which we could apply to our assignments. One of the weaknesses is the lack of SPSS viewed in lecture (lecture mostly consisted of theory\/technical explanations\/analysis). However, I understand why SPSS knowledge was taught separately in lab sections.",
    "The lectures end up lining up really well with the sections, which makes it easy to follow along with course material. Professor Gee is also a strength, as she's a great lecturer. I would say, though, that toward the end of the course I felt like things got a little bit rushed with more advanced topics like ANOVAs, and I didn't feel like I confidently grasped the material in lecture or in section. I think because z-tests aren't included on the midterm or the final, it would be beneficial to not focus as much on those, and spend more time focusing on independent samples t-tests and ANOVAs, especially with regard to interpreting results.",
    "it was great overall--very clear lectures and tutorials, the teachers and TAs were all engaging. no weaknesses really",
    "Psets truly help you comprehend the material. Sections are fantastically well run by a great team of TAs. Lecture often left me feeling confused of with my head spinning but section did a good job of cleaning that up for the most part. Sometimes standards used for grading were a little unclear, or the choice of statistical tests was not an element of the process we spent enough time on.  Wish we spent more time thinking about how to apply statistical tests in sequence with each other, or how to truly draft a report.",
    "This course was well organized and covered topics in a logical, sequential order. However, it often moved too slowly over certain easier topics and too quickly over over complex conceptual issues. I understand that conceptual knowledge was not the focus of the course, but it would have been nice to gain a deeper understanding of why each test worked, rather than just that it did and which buttons to click to get it.",
    "Barely any theory is taught.  This class is largely copy\/paste 101.",
    "Dylan is SO ORGANIZED as was my TF. This class is structured wonderfully and with a goal of success for all students. Bravo! The only downside was the super nit-picky grading- getting points off for missing a space before\/after equals signs is annoying when we clearly understand the materials.",
    "Strengths:  Dylan Gee is an incredible professor and lady,  The class is fairly easy, class only meets twice a week for 50 minutes, section is very helpful, the midterm and final are very accessible \r\nWeaknesses:  almost everything you need to know for the homework, mid term, and final is taught in section. It seems as though the lecture is only for introducing the ideas. Everything you do in this class is on a software, and you only talk about how to use that software in section. Its essential that you get a good TF, and Im lucky to have had a good one.",
    "Very well organized and taught; very understanding and helpful professor and TFs who made themselves available as much as possible; very much oriented to engage students; loved the usage of data from the students in the homeworks and lectures!",
    "This class seems to focus too much on APA format and not enough in understanding the math behind stats or doing reasoning about how a hypothesis is related to psychological phenomena.",
    "The course was really engaging and great for student learning. The sections were really helpful with applying what we learned in class",
    "It was very well-organized to facilitate student learning. Lab sections were very helpful. Prof. Gee and the TFs were extremely helpful. One weakness is that I don't think I quite grasped the theoretical side of stats because neither psets nor the final really tested that, and lectures sped through really quickly.",
    "Strengths: very well organized, lots of resources for students in lab and online at home. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
    "I wish we could go over the math behind the stat tests a bit more, but understandably there wouldn't be enough time. Also the class is more fast-paced compared to other Yale courses.",
    "I think the course had a lot of strengths in my opinion because it was taught very well and the lectures were information that was actually used in section and homework. I also think that the homework itself really allowed me to understand the material and be able to use it in the future. I think the project was also a great way to put the work we did all semester into practice and the exams themselves were well structured for our success.",
    "I think that class lectures were mostly spent on theory, whereas sections were spent in actual application, so the lectures weren't necessary to the class at all. So I think the lectures could be better spent going through application on SPSS or just talking about real-world examples.",
    "I don't think this course had real weaknesses. It was an excellent course. It moved at a good pace and section was very helpful in ensuring that we all understood the material.",
    "Slides go by too fast. Section was helpful though!",
    "I think the class was well taught and did not have many issues.  I worry that SPSS is an inconvenient program to learn though since it is so expensive to buy.",
    "I thought this class was taught very well, considering that it is in an introductory statistics class. The workload was very manageable, and the material was very straightforward. The lectures were not particularly exciting, but they were very thorough, and having the lecture slides meant you could do very well with minimal engagement during lecture. I sometimes felt that the lectures moved to quickly, but because Professor Gee posted the slides, this didn't matter because you could go back and read them later. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the class is that I actually think we could have gone more in depth into some of the material. While I know how to conduct statistical tests on SPSS, I feel like I have no idea what SPSS is doing to get the results, which I think would add to my overall understanding of the material.",
    "Strengths: Organized, interesting, not too much work\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of information covered in lecture that isn't really necessary to know (for this course).",
    "Very well paced, very helpful teaching staff and professor, very well structured!! It's a great class!",
    "Strengths: It was a very well-organized, engaging, and useful course. Professor Gee and my TF were extremely responsive and helpful to any questions that I had, and I learned a lot through this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It moved too slowly at certain parts, and I would have liked to learn about more advanced statistical analyses as well as how to code certain syntax components on SPSS.",
    "The course did very well in covering various important statistical tests and having the students apply those tests in assignments and assessments with real-world significance. I cannot think of any ways that the course could be improved.",
    "I wish that the final exam had been more cumulative.",
    "strengths: clear, straight-forward, well-organized to facilitate learning",
    "Strengths- really nice, engaging prof\r\nWeaknesses- boring, hard, class material didn't align with homework\/lab sections",
    "The setup of the course with lab sections that gave us practice with the lessons we learned in class was very helpful and I really enjoyed the predictable structure of the class.",
    "Strengths: It was a great course! I appreciate that this course didn't get into specific calculations but instead emphasized when to use each type of analysis in an application-based manner.\r\n\r\nWeakness: n\/a",
    "Lecture was useful and slides were excellent. Section was boring and mostly uninformative.",
    "Professor Gee did a great job of lecturing. She always answered questions and explained everything well.",
    "strengths: Extremely useful!\r\nweaknesses: can move quite quickly, problem sets can kind of leave you on your own (definitely not always, but sometimes!!). Ridiculously nitpicky on exams, though.",
    "Clearly taught all material & very practical, useful course.",
    "It was very clear and taught well and provided a good introduction to basic statistical tests that would be most useful in thesis research. The pace was slow at times and I think we could have learned about more topics in the given time, but overall it was a really good course.",
    "The strengths is that for the assignments we are provided with what exactly we need to know. The lab sections are very helpful for the psets and tests. A way the course could be improved is that the lectures at the end were too fast when explaining concepts so that could be slowed down.",
    "Not a lot of guidance with final project. Exams, though we had 24 hours to work on them, took 5-6 hours to prep for.",
    "The structure of the class places much more effort on Lab section, such that if you don't attend section you are lost; however, the same cannot be said for the lecture itself. Some strengths are that its very easy to follow along in the class, the assignment and exam and other course materials provide a lot of insight. I also really appreciate that students at any level of statistics have a chance at succeeding in this course. I also appreciate that the assignments are challenging but you can take some of the knowledge from the assignments outside of the course and use it in real life.",
    "The course is well structured and does a good job introducing you to concepts in a logical order, but all you need to know for exams and the project is covered in lab. In this way, lectures feel somewhat unnecessary.",
    "Strengths: clear lecturers, great professor, organized lab sections, and fair psets and exams. Weaknesses: questions on psets and exams are sometimes worded in a bit of a confusing way.",
    "Strengths: class structure, organization, feedback, teacher involvement, teacher approachability",
    "This course was a wonderful introductory course to statistics and truly taught me so much.",
    "Professor Gee was great at teaching the material and her lectures\/slides were very clear.",
    "Great course, I would just remember to talk slowly in lectures :)",
    "Strengths are lab sections and Professor Gee. Weaknesses are that problem sets have a lot more to do with lab than lecture",
    "I think this course was honestly great. The best part is that the lecture material is pretty much exactly what is covered in PSets and exams, and sections are designed to be really practically helpful in doing the PSets. I loved that there was no required textbook, because those have never really been helpeful to me in QR classes before. I also loved that the exams and final project were literally creating statistical reports, because it was a clear translation of the class material to a real-world function.",
    "I thought it was great",
    "The material was presented in a way that was easy to understand and sections were very helpful.",
    "Weekly psets and lab sections really help to increase engagement with the course. Feel like it was unnecessary to have both a final and a project because the work were doing is essentially the same.",
    "Dr. Gee is very thorough and listens to the needs of her students.",
    "The lectures move very very quickly, and the sections do not cover material that will be on the homework.",
    "Midterm and Final format were horrible. Unnecessary, especially because we did this as the final project as well. Not a cool or creative way to assess students in a timed setting, some students struggle with copying number and working computer to run the tests, overwhelming in the timed setting, exams should be straightforward.",
    "This course is very well designed and taught by an excellent instructor. The lectures were very informative, and the weekly labs were crucial to my understanding of the concepts and for learning to use the SPSS software. The testing format of a midterm, a final and a project was also effective but relatively stress-free.",
    "learned a lot about stats, w\/o any prior knowledge\r\n\r\nweaknesses = tests are not ideal, they don't test your knowledge of stats, rather they test how quickly you can type in a timed environment",
    "I absolutely loved the course. Great structure, including timing of assignments. Assessments were fair, and I learned what I had hoped to.",
    "The course is extremely well organized, although sometimes it moves too fast and the majority of my learning was done in section.",
    "Dr. Gee is a major strength of the course; she was upbeat and clear in every class.",
    "Lecture and section do a great job staying in-step, while still being useful in distinct ways- theoretical information versus actual practice with the data. The weekly problem sets help to solidify the material. No major suggestions for improvement, except maybe teach chi-squared. Also, I liked having the clicker questions for student engagement, but perhaps asking questions to gauge understanding occasionally would be more helpful to the student than personal questions.",
    "The way the course was organized was really helpful. I really feel like the lab sections and psets really solidified what we learned in lecture. One weakness is I sometimes felt the course moved too fast.",
    "This course was really interesting, but pretty challenging.",
    "All the material was useful and set up students to do well on tests. The class and homework assignments were always interesting and sections were very helpful to completing the homework and projects. Lectures are sometimes too verbatim from the powerpoints.",
    "strengths: dylan is engaging as a lecturer and you can tell really cares about her students\r\nweaknesses: oftentimes section was more practically useful than lectures because it covered the material we would need for the tests and quizzes, whereas lecture covered theory that sometimes went over my head",
    "Exams should have extended time",
    "The strength is Professor Gee! She is really caring and cares about how much each student learns the topics.\r\nThe weakness would be that if I missed a class, it would not be \"deadly\" or \"costly\". However I do not think this was a problem.",
    "Absolutely love the way this course is taught! Honestly wouldn't change a thing. A serious strength was the way that Professor Gee always checked in with the class to see how we were doing on the material and if we should spend more time on anything. She is always looking to improve, and we notice that, and it means a ton. TFs always left very clear feedback and were super available and knowledgable.",
    "Great course - reasonable workload, extremely well taught, and nearly all of the assignments were worthwhile and engaging.",
    "The forms of assessment are a huge strength of this course. The problem sets ensure that we build a conceptual understanding of material, and then the exams ask us to put that information to practical use."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, great QR, interesting, and useful.",
    "This is a perfect gut QR. Just know that they are picky about APA and wording. If like stats I would recommend taking a different stats class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class",
    "Most definitely, at least with Professor Gee. This course supplies very practical knowledge that I really think any undergraduate would benefit from. Also Professor Gee is awesome.",
    "Sure.",
    "This is a solid QR credit. Accessible even to students without a stats background.",
    "Yes I would recommend  this course to another student. Professor Gee really invests in students understanding the material and sections assist in the application of the material. I chose this class over Stats 101 and I am very glad I did so. The midterm and final are very manageable if you use the time ahead to prepare correctly and the Psets are very congruent with what is learnt in class.",
    "I highly recommend the course, whether it is a requirement for your major, if you want QR credit, or if you just want a course without a heavy workload. Dylan and the TFs are super nice and easy to approach if you need any help.",
    "Yes, great QR with real life applications.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially a student looking to gain a QR credit that is more social science-based. The math component was very low, and the course focused on relevant statistical analyses and write-ups that are extremely useful skills for future research. Prof. Gee and the TFs were very kind and helpful, and all information was provided very clearly to facilitate learning. A great course overall!",
    "I would recommend the course to a student interested in statistics and is willing to devote time to the material and possibly learning on his\/her own. I wouldn't recommend it to a student with no interest in the subject matter, as outside of the lecture, there is not much guidance.",
    "Super nit picky!",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course to anybody interested in stats, and also people looking for a QR that's easier\/not too demanding but has some real world significance. Weekly homework assignments took maximum 1 hour, the midterm and final exams were really straightforward and geared toward actually applying data analysis (as opposed to questions meant to stump\/confuse students), and there was lots of guidance on the final project. Makes a good 5th course",
    "Definitely. Great class, intriguing material.",
    "Absolutely!  This class is awesome because Prof. Gee is a G and so cool and engaging",
    "If a student is interested in psychology statistics or needs an easy QR credit, this is a great class.",
    "Yes, I would. As someone who is not too confident in QRs, this was definitely a great one to take. Professor Gee is amazing and truly wants everyone to excel. Plus, much of the course content is actually interesting so doing the psets, etc. isn't bad.",
    "Yes, it's an interesting course especially for non-STEM majors.",
    "Definitely. A great introduction to statistics. Take it if you want a simple understanding of statistical concepts but not if you've already taken stats before.",
    "I would recommend it if the student has not taken stats before (I had not!) or is interested in the field of psychology.",
    "no. not worth the time for a bad grade",
    "Yeah for sure. I dont like stats but they made it doable for people who arent math inclined !",
    "Yes, if \r\na) You need a QR and you hate math\/are allergic to math\/remember no math\/etc. This class had less math in it than First Order Logic, which is impressive because that was a QR that was a philosophy class and included no numbers. \r\nb) You need it for a psych (or similar) major. It's fine and not that hard. \r\nOtherwise, this course is a waste of your Yale education. Take normal intro stats if you're interested in statistics. If you're interested in psychology, take literally any other class.",
    "Yes I would because I learned a lot but didnt feel overwhelmed by the work",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed this course. I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about statistics but the way that Professor Gee taught it made it so fun! She was so kind and made lecture interesting every day. Also, I really liked how she set the course up so that everyone could succeed if they put in the work.",
    "This was my easy course for the semester, and it was great. If you've taken any sort of statistics before, a lot of this class will be review. The one key difference is you'll learn ANOVA and apply this to studies. Work consists of weekly homeworks, 2 in class exams, and then a final project. Final project is the only downside to this class, but the class is designed to make you start that early, so it ends up being pretty easy to complete. If you want a relatively easy course for the semester, this is definitely it (if math is easy for you).",
    "Sure.",
    "Yes, it is very accessible for students like myself who have little experience with statistics. \r\nI have recommended this course to countless of students.",
    "I think this class is a ton of fun. It's accessible and prepares you for being a smart consumer and researcher. Plus, it works up to a final project, where you actually get to explore a question that interests you.",
    "Good intro statistics class, workload is very manageable and material is interesting. Highly recommend",
    "I would recommend this class. If you are engaged, pay attention, and are well-prepared, you will do well in this course.",
    "It is a good QR credit.  Good introduction to statistics.  Necessary for psychology.",
    "yes, it is a good class to learn about statistics without a lot of math and it is very applicable to many areas of jobs in the future.",
    "I think this is a great introductory statistics class that can set someone up with all the tools to do a basic statistical analysis. It also tries to explain some more complex concepts for those with an eye towards conducting research with higher-level statistics.",
    "While it wasn't the most interesting topic, it was definitely a really useful class so I would recommend it to others.",
    "Yeah, it's a pretty simple way to learn some basic stats.  If you've worked with numbers before, it's easy as heck.",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to statistical techniques, especially if you have never learned these before. The class is made up of students from various majors, so the course was taught very well from an introductory perspective. In addition, attendance at lab sections make the homework and exams much more manageable. Make sure to attend all the lab sections to keep up with the material.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It's perfect for psychology majors (the unofficial name for the class is psychstats) and for people who are uneasy about getting a QR credit out of the way. It is not an easy class if you're not mathematically inclined, but it's much less painful than taking MATH 115 or some equivalent course. The focus of the course is less about memorizing formulas and solving equations, as it is about reasoning about and running statistical tests, which can actually be fun. It's definitely more of the reasoning bit from quantitative reasoning and it's best to approach the psets and exams with more of a creative eye. The project is also interesting, because you can choose to run an experiment of your own (individual or in a group). My group actually found some interesting correlations which made writing the report less like a chore. Overall, I think the class is a solid QR class for those trying to find something beyond just learning math.",
    "Yes! It's a great intro course",
    "Take it if you have interest in understanding statistics!",
    "I would recommend this course as a fifth class to a student who is interested in learning the basics of how to conduct statistical tests or how to read a scientific paper. You'll learn about p-values in all their glory, and really get to dive into fun tests like ANOVAs. However, if you're looking to really learn about how statistics works (proofs, etc.) then this is not the class for you.",
    "Absolutely!!!! A great entry to thinking about statistics and a very intellectually stimulating course. Not too hard if you make the time to do the psets and work with the teaching team! I loved it and it was one of my favorite classes this semester.",
    "I mean, sure.  You probably have to take this class for your major anyways.  Professor Gee is really nice, but I swear to god this is like a paint-by-numbers equivalent of a math course.  So, pretty easy to get an A, but don't count on retaining an ounce of the material in the long run.",
    "Take this if you want an easy QR or a stats background class. It's very chill and difficult to not do well.",
    "I would  definitely recommend this course to another student. Its interesting, easy, and useful. Its low commitment and will teach you a lot. I was originally going to take a language course is my fifth credit, and Im very glad looking back that I took this class instead.",
    "If you need a stats class, this is the one to take. It's interesting, oriented to your goals, and not an intense workload.",
    "Yes! But please know that it is not as easy as others make it out to be",
    "This is a pretty good introduction to statistics. You learn the basic tests and then spend a lot of time practicing APA format to be prepared to write scientific papers. It is not a lot of work.",
    "Yes, Prof. Gee really tries to make it easy on her students!",
    "Yes, definitely! A good introduction to stats.",
    "Yes. I think this was a great way to learn how to conduct statistical analysis and interpret data.",
    "Yes especially if you are a psyc\/neuroscience major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others. Even if it is not in their field of work, I think that a lot of the information taught is helpful in everyday life and also can easily apply to several other careers that you wouldn't think would relate.",
    "I mean, a lot of majors have to take it and I think it's a fine course. Pretty easy to do well in.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "Pretty straightforward if you've taken any statistics in high school. Weekly psets don't take that long. Professor Gee is actually a good lecturer and cool.",
    "Yes, applicable statistics.",
    "This is a great class to take to develop a basic understanding of statistics.  If you are looking to better evaluate the claims put forth in studies which use statistics or would like to run tests of statistical significance of your own, take this course!  Professor Gee is super nice and responsive and the homework and lab sections are designed to really help students understand the material (no busy work).  The class is not too difficult and the work load is manageable, but you will learn a lot.",
    "It's at least easy, especially if you've taken any form of stats in the past, but Im not sure how much I really got out of this.",
    "If you need an easy QR that's decently interesting and relatively useful, this is a great class to take. Professor Gee is great, and she teaches the course so that everyone can do very well. Its enjoyable and very very easy. If you really want to learn statistics beyond the most basic level, this is probably not the right class.",
    "Yes!! It's a very fun and intuitive class that you're sure to do well in if you put in the proper time and effort.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student looking to study statistics, but from an application perspective rather than a mathematical one.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student above all because Dylan Gee is a fantastic professor and lecturer. The course material is extremely useful and actually helped me to complete a project in another psychology course this term.",
    "Yes, for a QR requirement or to simply learn valuable skills for statistical analysis",
    "If they like psychology or math. Not if they are not really a math person, like myself. I took this as a QR credit, but wouldn't recommend it to someone just trying to get the QR credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone because its really straightforward and youll learn a lot of statistics fundamentals.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course taught me when to run specific types of analyses by going through lots of real-world examples. I feel more confident running my own statistical tests now.",
    "Yes, it is a good QR for those who aren't STEM",
    "Yes! Great QR with manageable workload, fair grading, and useful topics.",
    "This course is an easy A and not that much work, so i would recommend it.",
    "It's a good foundational class for statistical concepts. Although it is not very mathematical, Professor Gee works with students who want more of the hard math so I recommend it.",
    "You have to take it if you are a psych student; I definitely recommend taking this class earlier rather than later in the major.\r\n\r\nIf you're not in psych it's a useful enough class to take anyway, but it is a good amount of work. Not overwhelming by any means, though.",
    "Yes! Anyone interested in research should take this course.",
    "Yes, it's a great stats credit if you need it for pre-med or your major. I took both the STAT 10x intro sequence and this course and thought this one was more useful, especially since we used SPSS rather than MINITAB.",
    "Yes ! This is the perfect class to introduce you to statistics. It is interesting and really really useful but doesnt involve math or really hard calculations! Super important stuff to know but a low stress environment! The exam format is also really good (you have 24 hours to work on it before you actually go in to take the test).",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. This course is good at laying down the essentials for statistics so you aren't confused about unnecessary things but you understand the basis for statistics.",
    "Unless you really need to learn R and all the computational stuff behind statistics, this is the best intro course. You learn what you need and it's not super difficult to do very well. The teaching is really good.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course and I already have to other students. I thinks it's mainly because it truly changed my perspective on statistics like now I feel like a knowledgable consumer of statistics in the real world and feel that everyone should be too in order to make the best decisions for one's life.",
    "If you have to take it, it'll go by quickly and it's very manageable. Also a good 5th class if you need a QR credit.",
    "Yes! Anyone and everyone can benefit from learning statistics!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, it's a great way to learn statistics and also its many applications. Prof. Gee works really hard to ensure that the class is clear and organized, and the course had great TA's as well. Highly recommend!",
    "Yes! This is a great way to introduce yourself to statistics. It is very approachable and applicable.",
    "Yes! This course is very organized and perfect for students who are looking to learn about basic statistics.",
    "Yes, I think this is a great introduction for students without coding background or any statistics background.",
    "If you are interested in gaining a basic knowledge of statistics, I would recommend this course. It's not extremely challenging, but I do feel like I have mastered the ability to run common statistical tests and analyze data. I also think I have become a more educated consumer of information because of this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who didnt take AP Statistics",
    "Everything you need for psyc research in a class. Prof Gee is the best!",
    "Yes I would recommend because it is good background knowledge to have in statistics",
    "Definitely!!! Whether or not you're a STEM person, this course feels so relevant because being able to understand statistical reports or maybe even create one yourself is SO USEFUL for most fields. Also, this is the first QR class at Yale in which I've been able to confidently do the PSets entirely on my own without collaborating\/leaning on friends in the class to help me, and I think that says a lot about how well prepared we were week to week to do them.",
    "Yes, I loved Dylan Gee.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Yes",
    "yes! great easy qr",
    "If a student enjoys- and already has a foundation in- statistics, this would be a good class for them. The course moves a little quickly for a humanities student.",
    "Yes! It's a great and well-organized course to take if you're a Psych major, need a QR credit or are just interested in stats.",
    "Yes -- it's supposedly a gut, but i had so much trouble with the course, i consistently scored in the bottom 25th percentile on all assessments, but I still ended up with an A- i think",
    "Yes because I think it is a valuable skill to have, and this class provides a simpler approach to statistics for people that are not necessarily majoring in the subject.",
    "I took this course as an English major hoping to take a QR that was interesting. This class was so so SO uninteresting to me. it is exactly what it claims to be, but if you are like me, you will be taken in by claims that this class \"is actually relevant to real life.\" If the idea of learning about psyc stats doesn't interest you, do NOT take this class.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to anyone. I went in looking for an easy QR and ended up learning a ton. The class is set up so that its really difficult to do poorly. Everything you need to know for the psets and exams is on the handouts you get in section, which are posted online. The psets only take like 40 minutes to an hour and a half and if you do them you master the material. The exams are straightforward and you get the questions 24 hours in advance and then the data at the beginning of the exam, which makes it was less stressful. Also professor Gee is AMAZING she cares so much about about everyone and is an incredible lecturer. She works so hard to make the class relevant and useful to everyone. I highly highly recommend it.",
    "Yes! Great introduction to statistics at Yale (especially if you're interested in Psychology or Cognitive Science as possible majors). Professor Gee and all the Teaching Fellows are extremely helpful and provide very thorough feedback on problem sets, exams, and projects",
    "I would recommend this course; it is organized, it teaches you the basics.",
    "Yes! If you need a statistics course and plan to do research in the social or behavioral sciences, this class provides a great introduction to the material. If you are looking for a really in-depth, math\/comp science heavy course, however, this class definitely does not fit the bill.",
    "Yes, great QR credit even if you aren't interested in psych. If you are interested in psych, it will definitely empower you to understand articles and design your own studies.",
    "Yes definitely. I only took this class because I needed to fulfill the QR requirement but Im really happy I took it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I really enjoyed the course.",
    "Great QR gut. But make sure to take it with a group of people you know because you'll need to rely on one another for psets.",
    "Yes - overall I learned quite a bit and while the course is fast-paced and more difficult than it might seem at face value, I am glad that I took it.",
    "Yes. If you need a QR credit, Psych Stats is super interesting and you get to learn a lot from doing a final project on a Psych issue. Professor Gee is super great and approachable.",
    "great class to get familiar with spss, especially if you're planning on doing psyc research. i feel like i can better analyze stats in the news and such. dylan is a great lecturer and it's refreshing to have a dynamic, female prof in a math class.",
    "Yes! If you want a class that has less workload and also provides a basic(intro level) information about statistics, take this class! Also the whole class is designed to facilitate your learning!",
    "If you have taken AP Stats or similar in high school, this WILL be easy and maybe a little slow. But I still learned things we never covered in high school and am glad I took it.",
    "Yes, wonderful introduction to statistics, especially if you have no background whatsoever in this field. It moved pretty slowly, but I left the class feeling prepared to analyze data using a the SPSS software and to understand the statistical findings of scientific papers in a variety of fields.",
    "This course was surprisingly very useful. As a MCDB major, I work in a lab where I actually use a lot of the tests we learned about in class. The workload is not bad at all; there is a short problem set every week. Lectures are nice but you can learn everything you need to know in the course in section. If you are looking to take a statistics class and you work in any type of lab, I would recommend taking this course instead of the regular intro statistics class. You will get a lot more useful information out of this class and it is easy enough to be a 5th credit.",
    "Absolutely! It is a fantastic and fascinating course, whether or not you are planning on taking psychology. Professor Gee is hands down one of the best professors I have had at Yale."
