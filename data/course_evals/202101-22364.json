                "I developed knowledge about the use of violence in societal structure, the difficulty of defining violence because of its physical and mental effects, and ideas about resistance as a means to freedom.",

                "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Great seminar quality, and I felt like I learned a lot from Prof. Kapustin and seminar participants alike. However, I will say that this is an upper level seminar so it took me some time to get used to contributing to class (especially as the class was mostly guys.)",
                "I really enjoyed the class discussion and the selection of works, but would have appreciated maybe a shorter final with 2 midterms, so that we could get more personal/in depth feedback and really delve into more of the readings in that setting.",
                "This is a very strong course, there are no substantial structural weaknesses.",
                "Prof Kapustin is the courses main strength. He is extremely insightful and engaging and can get our class discussion out of jams if we are all stuck. The readings were also very interesting and the course topics are well structured.",
                "I love Boris's takes on readings, he is an excellent speaker and always highly engaging. The syllabus is excellent, filled with a mix of classical and unusual texts which really work well together. Sometimes class discussion gets a little quiet when it feels like Boris is looking for one right answer, or when he asks a question that feels like a trick question -- in general, I wish class participation felt a little more low-stakes so that conversations could be more casual.",
                "The syllabus readings are fascinating and in rich conversation with each other. The flexibility of the seminar format is perfect for examining the implications of each reading and potential counterarguments.",
                "No weaknesses, this is overall a tremendous course which encourages student engagement on a deep level.",
                "Strengths are the format of discussions, which include lots of conversation alongside brief lectures by Professor Kapustin on the topics about which we learned.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kapustin is great! He is very excited about teaching and I really enjoyed his class\r\nWeaknesses: I found it very hard to speak in a class that was incredibly male-dominated and it felt like female students rarely got a chance to speak."

                "Absolutely recommend this course to any student of the social sciences or who is interested in theoretical and philosophical questions of violent and nonviolent political struggle. From Palestines independence struggle, to the Movement for Black Lives in the US, to protests against austerity in Latin America, political struggle is everywhere. This class is a well structured and well taught ideological tour de force of the concept of political violence that will allow any student to be politically astute to past and present global phenomena.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It will completely change the way that you view human nature, morals, power structures. The discussion of the role of historical development in creating modern self-consciousness is particularly fascinating. Readings are complicated but accessible.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone interested in philosophy or political science.",
                "Boris is a kind and enthusiastic seminar leader, so I would recommend any course that he teaches. If you've taken classes with Boris before and like his ideas and style, Critique of Political Violence is a solid course on a very specific topic. The readings are largely by 20th-century academic theorists of violence rather than practitioners of violence (no readings by Che, Mao, Lenin, Churchill, Robespierre, etc), so it's definitely a more intellectual take on violence than one might expect. For most students, I would recommend Boris's other seminar Moral Choices in Politics before you take Critique of Political Violence since it has a wider range of content from a more diverse slate of writers.",
                "Absolutely. It's a unique opportunity to examine political violence across a variety of texts that aren't typically found on the same syllabus. It has changed the way I think about history, law, and the moral status of violence in politics.",
                "Absolutely, especially on the merits of Professor Kapustin alone.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in the theory behind violence.",
