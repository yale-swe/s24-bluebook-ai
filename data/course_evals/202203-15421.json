                "This class is a great overview and introduction to many topics in environmental politics. I also learned lots from the group of students taking the seminar.",
                "I learned a lot of information about the inner workings of politics. I had not taken many government courses prior to this one and thoroughly enjoyed analyzing the political aspects of the environment.",
                "I learned about political science trends and how political events can affect environmental policy. I also improved on my ability to write papers that explain trends instead of advocate for a cause.",
                "I learned how to analyze readings and think critically about American Environmental politics",
                "In the course, I developed a greater understanding of the relationship between the environment and politics. Also, I learned more on how to write short, argumentative style essays.",
                "This course is a strong introduction to environmental politics. It covers \"must-know\" topics that anyone passionate about climate legislation should study manufacturing of doubt/challenges to climate science, the failures of American political institutions (filibuster, the judicial appointment process, sorting and polarization, etc), corporations and how they exert political pressure, sustainable finance, economic v. ecological debates (e.g., the Bet), and more! I've come out of this class with a good understanding about what the barriers to better climate action are and have a lot of questions to follow up on. Definitely a survey course.",
                "I gained valuable knowledge about politics, especially the different spheres of competition (electoral, epistemic, biological, and economic) that were the main themes of this course.  I'm now more politically literate and feel more comfortable participating in discussions about not only environmental politics but also just all politics."

                "This course is a wonderful EVST course. It is a bit disorganized (the syllabus and actual assignments didn't perfectly align), but I know Professor Swenson did take a leave and come back and was understanding to this fact, so perhaps that will adjust itself in future years.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- I liked reading about different topics each week. I would not have learned about some of the topics, such as climate and national security, had I not taken this course.\r\n- The argument papers, while not the most enjoyable to write, were challenging. I found that I had to really engage with the text to write a good paper, which is not something I have to do in other courses. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I felt a disconnect between the readings and content taught in the course. The readings were not often brought up during the course.",
                "Strengths: not a ton of work, flexible deadlines, only once a week, amazing peers in seminar to learn from, can present on what you're passionate about\r\n\r\nweaknesses: lectures aren't very engaging, lots of readings to do for each week, vague guidelines for papers",
                "The readings are great. I think students would appreciate more time to discuss the readings in class.",
                "The strengths of the class are the interesting readings. However, there were at times where the class felt maybe a little disorganized so just clarification on that end would be nice!",
                "This course is very strong as it pertains to readings and assignments. The assignments (papers + presentations) helped me to stay very engaged in the course, and the final as well (no regrets but boy was it long :/  ). I think this course might be improved in two aspects: 1) condensing Professor's lecture readings into about half or 2/3 the time they currently are now and then preparing discussion questions from students about the readings + lecture that could last around 15-30 minutes. 2) Marketing this more towards first-years and sophomores; even as someone who was very familiar with a lot of the topics introduced in this class, I still learned a lot but wished that I had taken a course like this my first year. It's a great crash course that can really get someone up to speed with contemporary environmental politics.",
                "Strengths: themes of each week were organized well, and readings were relevant.  Subjects we discussed were very topical, and other students in the class had a lot to contribute.  Weaknesses: general disorganization of the class itself - we didn't have access to slides after class, it was sometimes unclear what the rules of the assignments were.  Also, a lot of the content on the slides and data we looked at was really really old and the sources weren't clear."

                "Yes! Especially if you're a first-year/sophomore who is passionate about environmental law & politics.",
                "This course is very good if you want a better understanding of politics, but keep in mind that the class itself is still very unorganized and you have to make the most out of it.  Nothing is forced upon you."
