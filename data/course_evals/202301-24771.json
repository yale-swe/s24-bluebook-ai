                "I saw so much cool art! I had never studied the Avant-Garde before but feel that I have a solid understanding of it as well as connected social movements throughout history. This is an incredibly accessible class in all interpreting of the word.",
                "Familiarity with avant-garde art and literature movements of 20th century Italy, such as Futurism, Surrealism, and the Neoavanguardia; knowledge of artists beyond the (white, male) mainstream; the insights of my classmates and instructors; exploration across a wide range of media.",
                "I learned so much about topics that are niche but great. I loved the multimedia readings and assignments every week, overall the class was super engaging and covered so much cool art history",
                "I learnt about the history and practice Avant Garde artistic and political movements in Italy and how gender, queerness, and a host of other abstractions like motherhood are depicted through various mediums of art. I kept a journal where I was able to develop my thoughts both verbally and through illustrations (we were encouraged to keep our journal in any one or number of mediums) and my final project was a piece of neo avant gardist poetry!",
                "I learnt about art and developed critical\r\nThinking skills and introspection skills",
                "We learned about the history of various avant-garde groups, the nature of artistic and gender expression, and of a diverse set of very inspiring artists.",
                "I learned more about different avant-garde movements in the twentieth century with a focus on Italy.",
                "I learned a lot about a wide range of Italian avant-garde art and literary movements. I really loved this class because it exposed me to a lot of contemporary art that I found fascinating and the ways in which these art movements were so closely intertwined with literature. The material we looked at challenged me in many ways, oftentimes being more abstract and hard to interpret (especially the literature, for me), allowing me to experiment with how to process such things. Because of the flexible and open nature of the assignments, I was able to express myself a lot more creatively and freely in comparison to other history of art classes I've taken in the past. I feel as though, as a result of this, I was able to view this history of Italian art from a new perspective, helping me grow and be more confident in the ways I look at and interpret art. Definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale!"

                "The class trip to New York City was super cool but perhaps should not be scheduled on a busy Saturday afternoon. Other than that, literally no complaints. There is ample flexibility in student participation and creation, and the presentations in class are great.",
                "I couldn't wait to come to class each week, thanks to the insights of my classmates and the structure/understanding that Alessandro and Federica provided. The readings and art that we looked at were really cool. Alessandro and Federica provided extensive, helpful feedback on my work. I appreciated the level of creativity that the assignments encouraged. The class trips, to the Beinecke, MoMA, the Center for Italian Art in New York City, and the Yale Art Gallery were really fun. This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "The course is so well set up to learn new things, the discussions were all interesting, and I never felt like I was bored or slipping behind. The nature of the big seminar was a bit difficult to constantly engage in discussion, and the instructor did well to mitigate it, but that was the only challenging piece",
                "trips were good. pretty excellent class, alessandro and federica balanced having many students while also maintaining a seminar feel very well.",
                "The syllabus is extremely compelling and well designed and Alessandro is the most wonderful professor who will pay attention to every little detail in every piece we discuss and every thought his students have. I look at every work of art and literature differently now, with a much sharper sense of the nuances and overlying connotations of the creative process. The discourse was a little inaccessible to me at times so I would have appreciated some more context sometimes instead of jumping right into the very dense discussions but I could have asked for that and encourage future students to do so",
                "All amazing\r\nWhat can be improved is the addition of letter grades",
                "This course was fantastic, the material was very interesting, and I learned so much from Alessandro.",
                "I thought this course was structured in a really cool way; I especially enjoyed the journals and final assignments, since they gave students space to be creative while also reflecting all that they learned. I also really liked the readings and audio and visual materials. I do think this course might benefit from being taught twice a week--as opposed to a once a week, two hour seminar--since I did sometimes feel like we did not get to address all of the material.",
                "I think the main strengths are the professor and TF. Alessandro and Federica are very dedicated to their students, always making themselves available to speak with students, whether it be about how to approach an assignment or just try to work through the challenging material with them. Alessandro helped me a lot to gain a better understanding of things I had trouble processing and provided me with relative historical context (since I was pretty unfamiliar with Italian history prior to this class). They also provided very detailed and thorough feedback on our assignments, which were always so nice to receive! They both pointed out my strengths, which helped at times when I was uncertain about my work, as well as where there was room for improvement, which served as something to focus on for future assignments. The material for this class was always interesting, engaging, and challenging (in a good way), which is another strength of this class. The only critique would be that I would've liked to see more visual art provided in the materials, but regardless I was able to look it up myself when I was interested so it wasn't that big of an issue."

The material of the course is fascinating and definitely unlike material in other humanities courses. The assignments also provide room for thought and creativity, allowing someone to really engage with the material. Overall, I think this course is both taught and structured well.",
                "YES! 100%!!! Alessandro is literally the best professor out there! And regardless of whether you are majoring in the discipline or not, this is such a great class to take! It opens your eyes to this world of art with so many different ways of being interpreted. I may be a little biased because I love art, but I do think this class is great for everyone. The assignments are accessible for non-humanities majors, and for times when the material is challenging, Alessandro and Federica are always open to talk and help! This class is just so fun and interesting that I think everyone should take it."
