                "One strength is that Professor Kavathas gives a very helpful booklet containing more detailed information from the lesson that day, which is great if you want to review the material again. Additionally, I thought the readings on epidemics were interesting, albeit long. However, I sometimes felt that the class moved fast and I would be lost until I reviewed the slides and booklet when doing the psets. I wish that instead of having a lecture on the last day, we had just used the last two days of class for presentations so people would have more time to practice.",
                "I enjoyed the variety of our daily discussions, and I liked how we got to explore topics some of us had never heard of, such as the benefits of the gut microbiome. I also liked that the class tied in to social and political issues in healthcare, such as when we read about the race for a polio vaccine or went to the YUAG to look at art inspired by the HIV\/AIDS crisis. I think it could be improved if we had the opportunity to go over PSets, so that we can know how to improve our answers before submitting the next PSet."

                "Sure, if you're interested. I did not really enjoy it and was a bit stressed at the beginning because I thought we were moving a bit fast and it was hard for me to remember the material. But, it got better with time and the class trip was fun.",
                "Yes, I think it covers very fascinating topics that most students on the pre-med track would be interested in and eventually need to learn anyway. The professor is very knowledgable and passionate about immunobiology, assignments are communicated in a clear manner, and the final paper and presentation have plenty of room for instructor feedback before submitting. I think the workload for this class was very manageable. Keeping up with the reading is also ok, but it is best to look at the syllabus ahead of time so that you give yourself adequate time to read some of the book chapters. I met a lot of great people through the class, and our field trips to the YUAG, med school, and Natural History Museum helped facilitate bonding."
