                "I learned a lot about the life of Celan and his style of writing. I also learned about poetry analysis more broadly. Before this course, I didn't know how to write about poetry -- and I think that this class taught me about that skill",
                "Read almost all of Celan's work. Learned about his personal life and of the critical work that surrounded and sometimes haunted him.",
                "In this course, I gained a comprehensive overview of Paul Celan's works and the reception and interpretations of his works. In particular, I was able to engage with and understand the process of translation unlike I have before through Professor Connolly's insightful explanations as well as chatting with and meeting Pierre Joris for one class.",
                "Learned a lot about language, translation, reading with a comparative literature lens, post WWII Jewish philosophy, the philosophy of poetry and language",
                "I developed my understanding of how to research a single artistic figure. I loved the way the course engaged with a variety of media around Paul Celan's life. I also developed my skills in textual and poetry analysis.",
                "I came into this course with limited knowledge of Paul Celan, and now having finished the semester, I can certainly say hes one of my favorite poets. Through this course I learned how to effectively analyze poems and write thoughtful thesis papers."

            "comments": [
                "I think that its biggest strength is its depth. We go very deep into the life of one man and his poetry. It was a really great experience to be able to learn so much about one person and his work.\r\n\r\nI think one of its weaknesses was that our homework was related to a vast number of poems. Every week we were assigned a full collection of Celan's poetry, which was a little overwhelming. It felt difficult to grasp the \"larger picture\" at times. I think you could improve upon the course by assigning fewer poems, which we could study in more depth",
                "Strengths of this course are like the others that focus on one author. It is very rewarding to feel over the course of a semester that you have begun to grasp a large collection of art. These classes also often have very passionate professors, and this one is no different. Professor Connolly is amazing and TA Netta is fantastic as well.",
                "The strengths of this course were the syllabus and the content. While Celan's works are often described as hermetic or inaccessible, reading all of his poems chronologically along with articles from external authors, gave me access to his work and an understanding of his poetic process that I otherwise would not have had. The only weakness of this course is that I wish that all the presentations had not fallen to the last day, so that we could've had a proper wrap up last class.",
                "Strengths: Incredible professor and TF, lots of thematic continuity so you feel more and more grounded as the term progresses, gives you a strong grounding in the intellectual history of post WWII poetry\r\nWeaknesses: Later Celan is incredibly obscure and difficult to read without guidance so readings can feel like a slog in the later half of the semester",
                "Strengths: very engaging professor and TF; wide variety of source material; focus on single figure allows an in-depth engagement with the time period and history more broadly. I also got excellent and detailed evaluations on my written work that was very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Even though the seminar was almost 2 hours long, it was sometimes difficult to cover everything we hoped to cover in one session and not everybody could always voice their thoughts.",
                "No weaknesses! I really loved how immersive this class was its very fortunate and lucky to be able to take a course just dedicated to one person. I really enjoyed our experience see Celans work in person in the Beinecke library and our class with Pierre Joris!"

            "comments": [
                "Yes, it is a great course that teaches you a lot about Celan's work and poetry in general. But I think the student has to be ready to learn about a very specific facet of poetry",
                "If you are interested in poetry, take this course. It is fantastic. Connolly and Netta are wonderful. The art is wonderful. The assignments are not demanding and give you opportunities to really connect with Celan's work.",
                "Yes! I thought that this course gave me an in-depth understanding not only of Celan but also of German-Jewish literature. Every discussion was highly engaging, and students came to this class with excitement to learn from each other and dissect the difficult texts we were working with. I hope that this course it taught again, so that more students can take it.",
                "If your interest in Celan is primarily his lyric poems in Poppy and Memory, you might be disappointed to find his later poetry diverges profoundly in its aesthetics\/sensibilities. Be sure that you will enjoy reading his late work which is very obscure and dense (yet rewarding in its own way). Otherwise, reading Celan on your own time might be a better choice. You will learn a lot about the philosophy of poetry in this era.",
                "Yes, absolutely, I really enjoyed engaging with Celan on this level and Prof. Connolly is just wonderful!",
                "Absolutely!! I really enjoyed it."
