                "A lot of practical physics laboratory skills.",
                "I learned how to independently follow an experiment procedure and operate sophisticated experimental equipment, including a particle accelerator, LabQuest software, oscilloscopes, current and voltage sources, and Helmholtz magnetic coils. I also learned how to write a formal lab report in Latex and analyze data in Python.",
                "I learned a lot about experimental design and scientific writing. The encouragement to use LaTeX to write lab reports is really helpful if youre planning on doing a career in physics, and is high key easier than doing it in google docs. Also, I learned some pretty interesting new physics.",
                "Hands on experiments really helped to solidify the concepts we learn in physics classes.",
                "Developed skills with a variety of physics lab tools, such as oscilloscopes, circuits and breadboards, optics track kits, etc. Additionally, practiced lab report writing skills and learned LaTeX.",
                "The labs were interesting, but perhaps more importantly, this class was a sort of boot camp in basic physics data analysis.",
                "Lock-in amplifiers, electronics, data analysis, chaos",
                "Developing the ability to relatively quickly and efficiently process raw data, produce meaningful graphs and interpretations, and write a report (with all the components of a research paper) was the most useful and long-lasting aspect of this lab course. The opportunity to choose your own labs allowed for exploration of areas of interest as well as development of general knowledge of a range of common lab equipment and devices.",
                "Lab technique, data analysis, some new physics concepts.",
                "I developed a deep understanding of experimental process used in physics, as well as the content required for a report on experimental findings.",
                "I learnt a lot in the 206 lab - from lab techniques in more advanced domains (such as with the nuclear reactions lab or polarisation of light) to just delving deeper into modern physics."

                "This course is extremely interesting. You get to do some really awesome experiments, like using a particle accelerator and playing with high-temperature superconductors. HOWEVER! This course is WAY too hard for its half credit. I would estimate the workload at about 1.5 credits, and it probably should be a writing credit. This detracts from the experience of the course massively, because it's very hard to enjoy the interesting physics when you're drowning in work every week.",
                "One strength of this course is that it allows students to choose labs related to their interest. Several intriguing labs are offered, and students get to engage with them on both a conceptual and a physical level.\r\n\r\nThere are not really many notable weaknesses, although the analysis and write ups require substantial time commitments outside of class that in my opinion exceeds the 0.5 credit designation.",
                "Some weaknesses are that the lab reports could make it more clear what is being asked for in the lab reports. Also a better sample lab report to see how it is supposed to be formatted, and that you are not supposed to just follow the layout of the handout, which could have been communicated better. The difference between some TAs grading kind of sucks. But a strength is that the TAs are very nice and helpful if you have questions.",
                "Very fun labs. For a half-credit course, it's... a lot of work.",
                "Strength: wide range of topics, good survey and preparation for physics major \r\nWeaknesses: some of the lab guides are not very focused, workload is way too huge, time allocated is not enough to finish all lab works, especially for electronics where we are not familiar to the circuit design.",
                "More clear guidance in the experiment guides and descriptions and/or directions on finding other materials to help support students understanding of the theory and concepts for each lab would be useful. Many aspects of the course assume a basic or medium level of understanding with certain physical concepts which at times makes it difficult to fully understand and complete labs for students with a less robust physics background or who are taking physics concurrently with the lab.\r\n\r\nAllowing students to choose their labs is a definite strength and should be kept in future iterations.",
                "Some of the lab manuals could be revised to give more clear instructions.",
                "Very well designed labs and resources to succeed in them. Very good support and help when needed.",
                "Great course. Maybe just a tad more guidance initially on what was required for a report.",
                "The course provides a brilliant survey of lots of lab techniques across 9 experiments. I learnt a significant amount and feel much more comfortable in a lab environment. \r\n\r\nThe improvements for this lab, in my opinion, really need to come via improvements with the sub-par 205 course, which is meant to prepare you for 206 but does nothing of the sort. This lab would be incredibly difficult for someone with no background in programming or data analysis, with lab reports having to be written in LaTeX (a great and necessary skill for all physics majors), and data analysis needing to be done (either in Python, R, etc...). 205 needs to have at least some aspect of LaTeX / more formal lab reports so that 206 isn't such a learning curve."

There's a million incredible experiments and opportunities, and you'll learn a ton, but they're all drowned out by the fact that you have to write a full lab report every week, often on subjects which you know little-nothing about. This class has given me the most work out of any I have taken at Yale so far. So take it at your own risk!",

I personally disliked the layout of Phys 205L (though they seemed to improve the order of the labs, just based on walking over to the 205L side a couple of times), but Phys 206L was a great class that offered a lot of freedom, since you get to choose your own experiments. The experiments are really fun and much more interactive. I would highly recommend doing the two experiments where you get to work with the undergraduate particle accelerator (Rutherford Scattering, Nuclear Reactions).",

Some coding knowledge (python especially) will improve your experience in this lab. May be suitable for ambitious pre-meds or other biology based majors but not necessary for non-engineers and physicists.",
                "Yes, definitely take this course, it makes physics 205 absolutely worth it and there are so many experiments to choose from that you are pretty much guaranteed to get experiments that you'll like. I especially recommend the nuclear reactions, since it's such a unique opportunity.",
                "Absolutely if you're interested in physics or experiencing what it's like in lab!",
                "Absolutely, great lab that allows you to learn a lot about the topics that interest you.",
                "As previously mentioned, I would recommend this course to physics majors but would do so much more confidently were 205 improved to provide a better transition into 206."
