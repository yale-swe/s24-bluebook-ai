    "This class made me much more comfortable to ask questions. BIOL 102 felt different from BIOL 101 in that the professor encouraged students to ask questions, and it seemed like she actually cared about what we were asking. Though sometimes we asked too many questions and prevented the professor from getting as far in the lecture as she would have, it was a nice environment to be in.",
    "Not much, this course is more of a few examples than learning concepts.",
    "I learned a lot about biology facts and experimental techniques.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\n- Good lectures\r\n- Lots of study guides",
    "Strengths - Piazza to ask questions.\r\nWeaknesses - Problem sets were way too easy so come time for exams, I felt unprepared. The readings were not integrated well with the class, the slides were not posted until late the night before, and Professor Horsely was unclear in class as to what information is important. Class was generally unorganized and would benefit from standardization of material.",
    "The lectures were often not well organized for me",
    "I liked learning about the different intricacies of the cell, even if some parts contained a lot more nitpicky details and protein names than other parts. One thing I felt was a weakness was the little feedback we received on tests and homework assignments. For the midterm especially, some areas felt like a lot of minutiae, and I lost points based on very tiny and inconsequential errors.",
    "The major weakness is that it's such a large lecture which I believe hinders the course.",
    "I really like how the class is focused on experiments, not just regurgitating facts. I think it could be improved by making the lectures easier to follow. Sometimes, six slides will have no pertinent information and then one slide will have more information that the professor has time to explain.",
    "I think Q&A time could be a bit more limited. I also think additional practice and review problems would be helpful. For homework, it would be helpful if the readings were posted on time and accurately.",
    "The course does a very detailed rundown of many cellular processes and mechanism, but the material that is covered in the course is not very friendly to anyone that really has no background in biology. Of course, it is probably expected that everyone has had biology in high school at least once before, but if it were truly an introductory course, it should include more foundational topics such as ATP synthesis because throughout the entire course, we discuss molecules using ATP and GTP to derive energy for their functions, but we never technically learned what ATP was and where it came from. Also, other parts of the class structure are weirdly organized because we discuss cytoskeletal components being present in other areas such as in cell division throughout the whole course, but we do not actually discuss what the cytoskeleton is until the end of the course. I just think the curriculum is poorly organized for an introductory biology course, but if you are already decently enough versed in biology, then it is not as much of a problem. Also, it seems like some of the TF's are not the most knowledgable on the topics we cover in class. They have said things contradictory to what we have learning in class or what is said in our book, which is obviously not good for student learning. Also, none of the teaching staff is particularly good at answering questions. Prof. Horsley in lecture constantly misinterprets student questions and gives an answer that does not address the root of the student question. Also, on Piazza, the instructor answers have not clearly addressed the student questions.",
    "Strengths: Goes in depth about many topics and provides a comprehensive introduction to cellular biology\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were at times disorganized or the professor did not get through all the slides (spent too long on demonstrations or answering questions), which was frustrating",
    "Lectures can be kind of confusing sometimes, and I found myself turning to online resources often. Pre-class quizzes seemed to have a lot of information straight from the textbook, and less from relevant information.",
    "Students were allowed to ask too many questions in lecture. The same five students would ask numerous questions every day (usually repetitive or questions about things the professor had just said), which slowed lecture down to the point that it often became uninteresting. Sometimes, it seemed like we were rushing to get through all of the lecture material because we had spent so much time on questions earlier in the lecture. I understand the importance of being able to ask questions in lecture, but there is a point at which the overall learning of the 200-person class is more important than the same few students being satisfied with the amount of attention they are getting from the professor (it seemed like many of their questions were just ploys to get the professor to notice how clever or intelligent they were). I don't have a suggestion as to how this could be remedied, but I think maybe limiting people to two questions a day could be some sort of solution.",
    "Too much time each lecture was given to questions that became repetitive very quickly. This led to my attention being removed from class and disturbing my learning.",
    "I have many serious qualms with the introductory biology sequence at Yale, and BIOL 102 was no exception. While the instructor for this module was much more caring and understanding of students, the overall course is poorly structured for student learning and does not provide much incentive or excitement for pursuing the sciences at Yale. The two major weaknesses of the course are its grading set-up and the interactions had with instructors. First, grading in the introductory biology sequence emphasizes mastery of esoteric jargon and very specific, niche subjects while not really rewarding progress or genuine learning. I experienced this issue more in BIOL 101, but it remains true for BIOL 102. I come from a school with a poor STEM background and did not have an excellent biology preparation compared to some of my peers. This put me at a significant disadvantage in the course overall. When it came time to learn about signaling pathways and secretory pathways in the cell, I was still trying to figure out the basic functions of organelles and connect those concepts. So while I leave the course having learned much, mostly from self-teaching, my grades suffered because I did not start out the course on the same level as my peers and because of the assumption that everyone had been taught the basics at the same level. Rather than creating a course that is particularly detail-oriented and obscure in the name of \"creating equal opportunities,\" the biology departments at Yale should just accept the fact that some students come here ready for advanced courses while others need an old-fashioned, basic college introductory biology class and accommodate their teaching to match the reality. Second, it is very clear that the majority of people involved in the introductory biology sequence have very little desire to be a part of it. Other than the professor for this module (Dr. Horsley is so caring), the TAs seemed not very interested in being helpful or leading section. I went to section every week dreading the experience because I knew that I would be going through mind-numbing exercises for fifty minutes being led by someone who probably did not review the powerpoint given to them prior. I understand that graduate students don't dream of leading section or being TAs, but some effort would be appreciated. Other departments do not have this issue nearly as much as what I've seen in this sequence. In saying all of this, I realize that students reading this review probably have to take the class anyway. My input is more so for the administrators and professors who are involved with this course, and I ask, please change the introductory biology sequence. It is so disheartening to have come to Yale so excited to pursue science and then to be given this course as a primer for the next four years.",
    "The attempt to make this class accessible allowed many people not used to understanding science to truly grasp the material. However, it also transformed the class into a series of facts to memorize and apply by rote, as all attempts to move beyond the literal and experimental inevitably met with a barrage of questions and misunderstandings which proved difficult to remedy.",
    "Strengths: Teaches cell biology, suggests that you try to think like a scientist. The textbook, Essential Cell Biology 5th edition by Alberts, was amazing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course was terrible beyond repair. The lectures were unclear, vague, and boring. Horsley's lecture slides are unintelligible on their own. It is impossible to look at one of her slides and learn something from it because there is just a diagram with no extra detail. There is no text outside the diagram to explain what the diagram actually means. So it is impossible to use her slides to review the material once the lecture is over. During lecture, she gives poor explanations of the content of the slides. It is vague and by word of mouth. Because her explanations are so poor, there are breaks in lecture when up to 20 students in a row ask her questions (the answers to which matter for scientific knowledge and test questions) that she failed to address in her explanation.",
    "Very good overview of cell biology. Fast paced at times but you get a good understanding of the material.\r\nCourse is far too big for real meaningful engagement though. Discussion section is only once a week and very brief. Course would be much more engaging if offered as a seminar (like ECON 110\/115), or with an associated lab section.",
    "There were two major weaknesses of this course: the lectures and the textbook. I left lectures not understanding the material any more than I came in because it was not explained well to me at all. The course was not organized well such that lectures would build on themselves. It was very frustrating to be responsible for so much material that I had to essentially teach myself because the professor was not. Furthermore, the textbook was no better at explaining the material, which only added to the frustration. It was filled with material that we did not need to know for this course which made the readings extremely long and dense and did not explain things in a logical order.",
    "This course was taught very poorly",
    "The strength of the course is that it does a very good job of covering a lot of topics and introducing them so that we have an idea of the different parts of cell biology. Nevertheless, I wish that the lessons did not feel very connected. They felt somewhat isolated and separated. So I kind of wish the material was presented more like going on a journey to go deeper and deeper into the cell and think about how everything connectsit would also be cool if we got to talk about all these things in the context of something like cancer and how everything we talked about relates and connects to explain the behavior of cells. In that way, it would be really cool to talk about how dynamic and interesting cells on top of learning the material.",
    "strengths- study guides and lectures were more detailed than 101, prelecture quizzes were a grade booster and nice because they're open note, easier homework than 101\r\nweaknesses- study guides tended to be uploaded late",
    "I think that this course was organized really well and the material covered was really interesting. However, the lectures were all of the place and very boring, which made it hard to be engaged.",
    "Weaknesses: compared to Biol 101, the Biol 102 module seemed much more disorganized. The 101 lecture slides were clearly outlined and the main concepts and keywords were underlined so that you knew what the main takeaways were. The slides for 102 were mostly comprised of pictures (which is fine...I am a visual learner) but there weren't any accompanying notes or key ideas and Professor Horsley didn't always make these clear in lecture. \r\nStrengths: interesting info, my TA was very responsive and helpful, the Piazza site is a great place to ask questions",
    "Slides were informative and homework was engaging",
    "This course is extremely disconnected from the majority of the class. While professor Horsley did an excellent job of answering questions and letting everyone know that it is okay to be vulnerable, we would often fixate on minor concepts that were not super critical to understanding the course material. To fix this, I believe lecture should be shorter and section should involve more teaching as the smaller class size is far more beneficial for learning.",
    "Course was very memorize-heavy. Grading sometimes frustrating.",
    "The course seems to prepare you for futures in biology or related fields\/careers, but other than that it was bad.\r\n\r\nI hated the way it was structured. The online quizzes were a waste of time. The lectures were just somebody reading off of slides. Having the room divide into small groups to discuss every single lecture is a waste of (very limited) class time; I'd rather hear a Yale biology professor explain something than listen to a bunch of clueless freshmen guess blindly at the right answer. The homework assignments were almost exclusively about lab experiments and, despite being only 2-3 questions, were brutal to get through.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and the final were both very difficult and way too specific relative to the amount of material covered in just six weeks. Plus, the idea that there is no option for the class to be curved seems like hot air to me. Unless you give the same tests every year you have to curve the class to match distributions of past years, no?\r\n\r\nReading the textbook during reading week taught me more than the entire half-semester of classes, quizzes, and homework assignments put together.",
    "Strengths: a good survey of the different concepts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We had to know WAY more specifics than were ever covered in lecture for the exams, and lectures were not explained well. I often left the lecture more confused than when I entered. We covered a lot of topics and then were expected to know the details about ALL of them, without sufficient explanations for how different mechanisms worked. Basically, I had to reinforce a lot of the material by myself in this class.",
    "The material is pretty comprehensive and the slides were helpful. I do think that in lecture, we often got sidetracked by a lot of the questions being asked and we didn't always finish the class.",
    "Weaknesses: Sometimes the course material was very contradictory. Information on the lecture slide was inconsistent with what Professor Horsley said and\/or what the book said. Also, the quiz questions were supposed to be based on the reading, but there were often questions that were simply not in the book at all.",
    "I didn't like the performances during class; I found them to be distracting and took away from precious instruction time. Also, I felt that the instructor spent too much time focusing on answering questions that could be easily answered just by paying more attention during lecture or by properly completing the pre-class readings. A better method of teaching could be to go over the processes multiple times as it would make remembering the many names\/abbreviations much easier.",
    "I felt like the design of Bio 101 was much more effective in terms of actually learning the material - namely through having an in class quiz every week. I felt that the pre-class quizzes were ineffective in teaching me any information, because I had absolutely no background in what the questions were asking. And, a lot of them were not clearly answered in the book, which resulted in lots of Googling and conflicting answers. If not in class, then I think the quizzes would be much more effective due after the lecture in which the material was covered to test and see if you understood what was covered in the lecture. These quizzes could be graded on completion only, allowing students not to worry and look at notes but to truly have an understanding of their grasp of the concepts. Additionally, I do not like that the balcony is closed off to students. It provides a much easier angle of viewing the projector screen and as someone with a disability who has trouble focusing in such a large lecture hall, the pseudo-isolation of the balcony would've been very helpful for me to pay attention during lecture. Finally, I think that it is very disruptive to not have the PowerPoints used in section distributed to the students afterwards, because it forces us to focus on copying down the information rather than participating in discussion and answering questions.\r\nOverall, I thought this course was okay, though it was hard to know what specific details were important and which were simply brought up to provide a larger context for the discussion.\r\nI really loved the meme contest, I felt that it provided a fun and unique way to review material and present it in an easy to remember way.",
    "I appreciated that the professor really seemed to care about the students. I think pre-class quizzes could be changed to incorporate material that we actually need to know from the class and the lectures could flow in a more logical manner.",
    "I liked the lectures and enrichment was helpful, but I wish we had more practice materials for exams.",
    "A strength of this class was the pace of the course. If one did the readings, one could easily understand what was going on in class, and Dr. Horsley wouldn't hesitate to stop and take the time to answer anyone's questions. The concepts were very complicated, especially if you had had no prior biology experience, so this was a strength. A weakness was sometimes we focused too much time on things that were unimportant, or spent too much time on questions that were superfluous that it left little time in lecture to go over the information we needed to know. As a result, we rushed through information that was important to do well; I think an improvement could be for the professor to have questions be at the end of class, so that they have time to go over everything they want to cover. For instance, many questions arose that were simply about to be covered in the next slide. It would also be an immense help if they distribute the discussion section slides because it both explains and streamlines concepts covered in class. 50 minutes is not enough time to both go over the slides, copy them down, do the exercise and go over the homework problems. I also think practicing applying experimental techniques on par with the type of exam questions we got throughout the course would be helpful.",
    "More feedback with practice quizzes and questions; answers have to be worded specifically and these specificities arent obvious until the test (when its too late).",
    "Homework was short and easy, requiring quick reference to the lecture slides. This probably owes to the nature of the course content, which is specific and arbitrary, based on nomenclature and fundamental topics never introduced to the students. However, complex homework forces students to understand the material, and copying from lecture slides is not sufficient. Compare to BIOL 101, which is entirely fundamental and does a good job of relating successive topics to each other. BIOL 102 attempts to do this by linking topics by methods of experimental analysis, but even these are explained very circuitously. The midterm and final exam were almost totally composed of \"regurgitation questions\", as the 101-102 courses call them. This could be improved by narrowing the scope of the course significantly and focusing on concepts instead of names (Ras\/Rab\/Ran\/SOS\/SH2\/SH3\/etc). Future professors need to stop giving students so much time to ask questions, because they utterly waste the meager 150 minutes per week of in-class instruction. Homework should require synthesis from across the course, and discussion sections should not require participation for full grading, because that contributes to poor comments and a stressful environment. As for the student-teacher dynamic, perhaps because of the large size of the class, students were incredibly rude to the professor, often trying to trip up Professor Horsley by suggesting she made a mistake, and the course coordinator, rightfully upset at the students for a couple reasons, was somewhat caustic to the students in return. I think this could be solved by the professors being more firm about respect.",
    "the lectures could be way more informative and less confusing.",
    "Lectures often were confusing and disorganized, and the content seemed quite disjunct.",
    "A major weakness is that lectures often rambled and would devolve into a Q and A session at times where the actual course material was not covered in favor of answering questions, which is important of course, but should not take up the majority of time during lectures. Additionally, I found many of the slides to be unhelpful in that they often did have the central ideas explicitly stated but would instead give seemingly super specific pieces of information.",
    "There was a lot material covered, therefore, I definitely learned more information about cells. However, the material wasn't covered clearly during lectures, so a lot of self-studying was required to even understand the concepts that would appear on exams\/quizzes. I know that Professor Horsley is definitely interested in cell biology, however, it becomes very difficult to learn new concepts when she spends most of lecture answering questions that sometimes are a bit irrelevant to the lecture itself. In addition, even though the exams were supposed to be representative of the daily quizzes as well as the homework assignments, I found this to be untrue: the exams, especially the final, were much harder. I believe if the lectures actually covered the material that they were supposed to cover, and we were given more practice with the types of questions that were on the exams, the class would have been much better.",
    "The material as presented in class is very confusing. The class tried too hard to make it fun\/palatable when really it's kind of dry and is better learned out of a textbook. The HWs are good but the pre class quizzes were not helpful.",
    "This course was taught fairly well, a strength was I felt like the professor took her time to teach the material in multiple ways, demos videos diagrams quizzes.\r\nI wish that the pre-class quizzes we were given 2 tries, even more questions might be good. Because it was actually helpful to learn from the quizzes and I think it would be smarter if they were structured a little closer to how the Chem department does Sapling, because then the focus is really on learning.\r\nThank you for reasonable homework that did not take ages to complete.",
    "It was well structure, but reaaaaaalllly jam packed with information, we were going really fast and it was interesting trying to keep up while keeping up with a full courseload",
    "Strength: pretty well taught, had great TAs, really good peer tutors \r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes I felt that in lectures, we would overemphasize certain things and then rush on others",
    "great professor, material was challenging but not too much. I felt I learned a lot in this class.",
    "I don't like how long the lecture is, and I really don't see the point of class engagement in a lecture that big.  I think the time could be better spent by going slower through the slides.",
    "I think the material is really interesting, and it's definitely really helpful to have section and enrichment to help! I think it would be helpful if the lectures were a little more organized, because there's SO much information, so it's really hard to decipher what's important for us to know and what is more just informative.",
    "Weaknesses: though it is true that some people learn by different means such as acting things out, I dont know why these teaching methods were given preference over traditional teacher. Overall, I felt it detracted from my learning.",
    "I felt like this course's reading assignments were lengthy and dissuaded a lot of students from actively engaging in the reading itself. Therefore, lectures could be difficult and confusing at times, and then students would feel the need to relearn the material to understand it themselves. There are also too many questions asked during lecture, and there is not enough analysis of the most important topics.",
    "The course had very helpful online resources and BEYOND excellent peer tutoring, but the actual lectures were very confusing, and I almost never understood anything from the lectures until I had taught it to myself later or met with the peer tutor. I really think the endless Q&A and then rushing through the lectures (in order to make time for the Q&A) made it so that we never got to learn anything, and I would have preferred the professor to explain everything in detail.",
    "The professor has a tendency to loose track of time and not go through all the lecture slides in class",
    "The professor made the class interesting and I really enjoyed the use of visual demonstrations it really helped me learn. One of the weaknesses of the course was that too much time was spent answering questions about one certain topic that there wasn't enough time to learn the rest of the lecture.",
    "The course had so much information that was new, which made learning biology so refreshing. I got to learn about cells and the proteins in depth and constantly was pushed to apply the knowledge. Professor Horsley made the environment collaborative and encouraging. I think the course could be improved if we had more questions to practice with to be able to continue solving problems and applying concepts. While questions are great in lecture, I think we could spend less time on them. Rather, Professor Horsley could take a few and spend more time on explaining concepts because they are extremely difficult. Questions can be left for Piazza.",
    "There are many strengths to this course. There was a great effort by the professor to hear all the questions we had. This is pleasantly surprising given the size of the class. Professor Hartman and the TAs were instrumental in this as the ran around the room with microphones to ensure that we were all heard. The problem sets were manageable and were focused on the most important concepts.",
    "The lectures were like long tangents and simple concepts often were explained in ways that were unnecessarily complicated. It was organized really well with the study guides and lecture. I wish there was a practice final to help focus my studying.",
    "It's is a difficult course (it's Yale I  know) but these professors need to be more aware of the fact that their students are not all wealthy, that the community of first gen low income students is growing.",
    "It feels like it does not have much continuity in class from topic to topic. I did not understand how the lectures were always connected.",
    "The course was good at challenging us to apply the descriptive portions of the course to a variety of situations.\r\n\r\nThe lectures at time struggled at times to explain difficult concepts and experimental methods in a succinct and comprehensible manner.\r\nOn that note, more effort could have been given to help us understand the scientific papers we read for class. \r\n\r\nAlso, the daily quizzes, although great at keeping us on track with the readings, often failed to capture the key concepts that would later be discussed in lecture, focusing on trivial points.",
    "I really liked how this course was taught. One tough thing about these courses is access to textbooks, but this was made very easy in this particular course by the instructers.",
    "Clear lectures and concise explanations. The lecture style was at times a bit slow, and the pre-class quizzes were sometimes very confusing.",
    "The strength of this course the focus on the experimental side of biology, with TAs and instructors being very helpful with this aspect. The weaknesses lie in the manner in which the material was presented. The lectures required much memorization with little understanding.",
    "The content is pretty interesting. However, the teaching style is simply not engaging - we spend far too long on futile activities that do nothing for our learning, and far too little time on the actual complicated processes that are 1) engaging, and 2) actually present on exams.",
    "Strengths: Assignments are very straightforward, grading is not as harsh as BIOL 101. The professors and course coordinator really care about your learning and even though lectures are dull, I appreciated how much they cared that everyone's questions were answered.",
    "We didn't always get through all of the material in class as too much time was spent answering questions in lecture. The exam questions were vague and weren't particularly well written and many questions were about different material from what we spent the majority of class focusing on. Furthermore, the grading felt arbitrary and more concerned with the use of buzzwords than a student's mastery of material.",
    "The passion of Professor Horsely and the clarity of her explanations were definite strengths of this course. Some of the topics we learned about, such as nuclear transport or the cell cycle, are complicated, but Professor Horsely took the time to explain them all and helped us learn the best ways to approach complex biological processes and make sense of them. The course was well organized with its use of Piazza and comprehensive study guides for each lecture so we knew what we had to know for the exams. I enjoyed the format of having a midterm and a final, and I feel like that facilitated learning of the material without adding undue stress. This course would improve if fewer questions were taken during mid-lecture so we could focus more on the material and save individual questions for section\/Piazza. The same people were constantly asking questions, and it felt sometimes that it became a bit like individual tutoring rather than a large lecture. I agree that other students do benefit from hearing other students' questions, but sometimes it felt excessive, like when we did not finish a lecture due to the number of questions that were being answered.",
    "Professor Horsely's teaching style was to present very high-level information on the topics we learned, but that would often result in people asking unnecessary or redundant questions in lecture. If we could get into more detail on the topics we covered in lecture and spend less time on questions, that would be great.",
    "The course should be conducted more logically and structurally",
    "One strength of this course was that a majority of the concepts were visually displayed throughout lecture, while a weakness was that the concepts felt extremely in depth and did not promote an overall schematic of cellular biology.",
    "The lectures are sometimes hard to follow and the material seems a little bit convoluted, but there is a lot of support from peer tutors and TAs.",
    "Course was paced well.",
    "It's fine for an intro",
    "Really only was able to get through lectures if next to a friend, the material wasnt explained particularly well, and the way this class was run allowed a huge lecture of students to raise their hand at any point, wait to be handed a microphone, and ask a question. Often they were off topic, already asked, or already explained and this took up a significant amount of time meaning we hardly ever got through the full lecture. Many other weaknesses (Horsely did not communicate the material very well, lectures were unproductive, prelecture hw was often tedious and not helpful, etc)\r\n\r\nOnly strength of the class is that it is easy and you can pretty easily learn most of the material on your own.",
    "Strengths: interesting lectures \r\nWeaknesses: depth of material on random subjects but insufficient coverage of other topics; unnecessarily hard tests",
    "The lectures felt like a lot of information at once. I found I didnt really understand anything until I sat down and studied it on my own afterwards. The homework was helpful for understanding which topics to focus on.",
    "I feel that a weakness was the speed of the lecture. I always felt like I was trying to catch up.",
    "I much preferred this module to 101--the lack of quizzes was really really nice.",
    "The lectures ran long some classes.",
    "Professor Horsley is really kind and tries to be inclusive of everyone, but I found the lectures boring and hard to focus on. I think I would have enjoyed the course more if the lectures were more engaging.",
    "The lectures were well organized, but people asked too many questions. They were mostly unrelated questions that just wasted time in class.",
    "I think a strength of this course was the level of the exam questionsthey were challenging enough without being overly difficult. The weakness was the lack of clarity and cohesion through the lectures; it was unclear what was important to know and I felt like not enough time was spent thoroughly explaining important concepts, which resulted in a lot of confusion and time spent on questions due to a lack of understanding.",
    "I love the lecture style and the interesting course material.",
    "strengths are straight forward material weaknesses were the class i think there was material that wasnt covered clear enough but was required for testing",
    "Very disorganized in terms of what information we need to know. professor horsley tends to ramble about things that are kinda random and the slides are not clear or informative",
    "I liked that the discussion sections were helpful to further understand the course material. I did not like the pre class quizzes or the readings before lecture as I felt that they did not help with what was actually taught in lecture.",
    "I liked the topics that we covered and really enjoyed going back over them in section to solidify our knowledge. However, I found the lectures a bit rambling and the slides a bit repetitive when the information could have been consolidated onto them the way that it was in 101.",
    "Lectures fairly unclear, not cohesively put together, Piazza helps",
    "The course was strong in in-class engagement and interest, which Professor Horsley facilitated with activities and various interactive demonstrations. However, she often spent long periods of time on the beginning of the powerpoint and rushed through the more nuanced details of the concluding parts of the presentations. This led to a disparity between knowledge obtained about the more difficult portions of the lecture and the more ethical focus of the beginnings of the presentations.",
    "Professor Horsley had a habit of spending a loooot of time answering questions and going over specific concepts, which sometimes prevented us from getting through the whole lecture or actually grasping the larger picture of what we were learning.",
    "A strength was the commitment of the TAs and professor and a weakness was the lack of practice exams to prepare for midterms",
    "I the online quizzes prepared me for the lectures well, and the homework was a good reflection of the material we were learning.",
    "Weaknesses: professor is a bad lecturer who makes many mistakes and does not include all the info needed on slides\r\nslides always posted the day before as promised\r\nthe only good thing was that weren't any weekly quizzes",
    "I was not a fan of the quizzes that went with each lecture and textbook assignment. I did the textbook readings, and I often found that the information in the short quizzes was either too specific or not particularly useful to my understanding. These quizzes did not encourage me to study, as they were open book, and I often found that none of that information stuck with me after the next lecture. When I spoke with other students, most told me that they never even read the textbook to complete the quizzes, instead using 'ctrl f' to find vocab and fill in the boxes. This seems like not the intended goal of the quizzes. I think that real in-class quizzes would have helped me to study and remember topics throughout the course. Instead, I often felt myself falling behind, confused, and unprepared, and constantly struggled to fight that feeling. I went to almost every Sunday peer session, which I found to be more helpful than most of the information I was given. However, I still felt unprepared. I did very well on all of the quizzes and problem sets, and so found it difficult to judge how well I understood the topics, as these grades did not reflect the lack of understanding I felt.\r\n\r\nIn terms of lectures, I thought that often Prof. Horsely would begin by presenting very, very simple overviews of the overarching concept, and then jump immediately into overly detailed examples. I wish the lectures had provided a sturdier and more detailed background of the actual concept before moving into specific examples that I was not able to understand fully. Later memorizing these examples seemed like memorization for memorizations sake, not necessarily for understanding cellular biology.\r\n\r\nIn terms of strengths of the course, I thought the problem sets were helpful and challenging, and allowed to me grasp a little better the material I didn't understand in lecture. I thought in-class visual aids were very helpful as well.",
    "The course lectures can be better structured. Too much time is given to questions and the lecture slides are rushed or left incomplete as a result at times. A strength of the course is that the discussion sections and the review sessions are very helpful.",
    "The peer tutors were such a great help! Even though the professor does explain things fairly well in lecture, having the peer tutors go over the lectures with us again during peer tutoring hours and going to their review sessions is invaluable.",
    "Strengths: I loved the experimental applications on the homework, midterm and final - they helped me remember the material and understand it better, and will be useful for (hopefully) future lab experience. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes did not explain in as much depth as was necessary. There also could have been more discussion of the journal article readings in lecture.",
    "I think the strengths of this course were learning about relevant experiments that are being conducted in labs today. Weaknesses were that we learned all the experiments in the first 6 lectures which meant they were disproportionately tested. Further, I think we learned too much detail about certain topics and surface-level material on other more important topics. It was hard to remember the big picture with the number of processes we had to memorize.",
    "I didn't feel as if review sessions helped much. Essentially, if I was initially confused, I would just remain confused, so I think more effective review sessions would help, perhaps by giving us other reading sources or even pointing us in the direction of better understanding the coursework.",
    "The strengths were that the topics in the lectures were covered pretty deeply. A weakness was the neither the quizzes or midterm were reviewed in class and there was not much of a chance to ask questions.",
    "The course is pretty good as an intro bio course.",
    "Professor Horstley was often unclear and did not communicate material from the powerpoint lectures in a way that necessarily clarified it.",
    "Overall I found the course to be well-organized and conducive to a good learning environment. The study guides, exams, and lecture notes were all clear and straightforward. However, I did not find the lectures to be very engaging, and learned the majority of the course content through self-study.",
    "The course was very comprehensive in the material it covered. Sometimes, the lectures were boring and dragged on a bit. There were some lectures where a disproportionate amount of time was spent on a single topic, leaving little time to fully cover new material.",
    "The strengths of this course were in the helpfulness of the peer tutors and the extra resources provided to students. However, there were weaknesses were in the teaching style. I felt the professor took too much time answering very specific questions from single students which would have been more appropriate in section or office hours and were not an efficient use of class time, since we then had to rush through other material meant to be covered in the lecture. I also felt that the pre class quizzes were overly specific and did not always apply to what we were learning in lecture the next day. I think this course could be improved with a more focused approach to teaching the material on the slides, if that is what is important, as well as more detailed slides for later review.",
    "There is a lot of material in such a short amount of time and I don't know if there is something that can be done about this"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! You learn so much, and it's likely a requirement.",
    "Only if necessary.",
    "I recommend taking other higher level MCDB classes and not the intro sequence unless absolutely necessary.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is required to take it or who simply loves cells. It's a LOT to remember, but once you do the concepts will start making sense.",
    "It's required and kinda foundational material, just wish it were taught differently",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it helps provide a nice biological foundation without going over your head.",
    "If you are at all interested in biology this class is a must. The bio sequence is not as bad as people make it out to be and in all honesty very enjoyable. I hope to take another class with professor horsely sometime soon.",
    "No! I had to take it for my major and it made me want to change my major!",
    "I would recommend this class only if it is necessary. I love cell bio, but if I'm being completely honest, taking the class decreased my appreciation for it.",
    "Yes, the information is very interesting and relevant, especially the experimental aspects that were explained.",
    "I would only recommend this class if it is needed for a major or pre-requisite otherwise I do not this it is worth the struggle.",
    "I would recommend it. Overall, it was less interesting than BIO 101 (content-wise), but the homework assignments are significantly easier -- some assignments took me less than ten minutes to complete and still get no points off. The lack of weekly quizzes also takes the pressure off compared to BIO 101. The content was pretty interesting too.",
    "If you have to take bio, take it. If you placed out, don't take it. If you just want a science credit, don't take it.",
    "While this course grants a first glimpse into the world of biology, that glimpse reveals little more than the dictionary of terms and diagrams required to understand cellular processes without any of the larger themes which make that knowledge worth having. As a result, it should only be taken by those for whom science is a list, not a framework.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless Valerie Horsley is replaced with a professor who is actually competent. Her lecture slides are unintelligible; you cannot use them to review after lecture, because there are just pictures without explanations. Horsley's lectures are vague and cause students to ask a multitude of questions during lecture. These questions (the answers to which you WILL be tested on) could be answered with a 3-word explanation in the slides, but no, she offers no basic explanations such as these. Moreover, Horsley is a liar. She says you will only be tested on topics covered in lecture. However, she thinks this means that she can assign a scientific journal article on listeria and actin filaments, say nothing about it in lecture, and still ask you about it on the final. Take this course with a professor who actually knows how to teach. Otherwise, the textbook is your best friend, because it actually offers coherent explanations.",
    "Yeah - of the various bio modules this one seems to introduce the most stuff not covered in high school. Very helpful for cell biology understanding and prep for higher # biology courses.",
    "No",
    "yes",
    "Yes, if you have to take the bio sequence. Otherwise, there are easier science courses to fill your science requirement.",
    "I think most people taking this course are satisfying some sort of requirement (pre-med, MCDB, MB&B, etc) so you don't have much of a choice. Professor Horsely is enthusiastic about the material and I'm sure she is very smart but she doesn't always articulate the concepts in a way that is understandable...as a result, we spent a large part of every lecture on questions to clarify what was being explained. This could have been avoided during situations where Professor Horsley would try to explain a topic and then people would start asking questions because the concept wasn't clear and we would spend a lot of time answering questions and then finally watch a video on the next slide that explained everything...the video should come first. The midterm was okay but the final was unfairly difficult given the quality of instruction in this course.",
    "Yes, good for learning everything about cell bio",
    "I would not recommend this course as a fun class. If another student is considering going into Pre-Med or some biology related major then they would have to take it.",
    "I mean, you probably have to take it. It gets annoying sometimes. But go to peer tutor sessions, they are helpful.",
    "You really have to want to be a doctor to take this. If you don't want to go to med school, don't take this.",
    "I did not enjoy 102 as much as I did 101, so I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to take it for a major requirement or some other requirement.",
    "If you are interested in cell biology but don't have experience in it, I would recommend taking this class to kind of test the waters.",
    "Not unless you must!",
    "Yes, because I enjoyed learning the concepts in this class, and I think they are a useful basis on which more in-depth biology topics can be built upon.",
    "Not unless you have to take it as a pre-req, or are extremely interested in cell biology.",
    "You should really only take the bio sequence if you have to and that's that on that.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in biology. It is one of my favorite introductory science courses at Yale to date, but you are only going to enjoy it if you enjoy the subject. It is also, in this sequence with this professor, much more laid back than biology 101, so that is an advantage.",
    "Yes but you kind of have to take it so",
    "No, but it is required for any pre-med student.",
    "not really but you have to take it for the sequence.",
    "No, because it doesn't give a cohesive overview of cell biology.",
    "While I would not recommend this course given its difficulties in structure, presentation, and organization, it is a required class in the biology sequence unless you test out of it so ultimately, many students will have to end up taking it.",
    "Compared to BIOL 101, this class certainly isn't as organized, therefore, if you're taking the intro bio sequence, this class will be a bit frustrating at first. However, if you're willing to put in the work outside of class, I think this class isn't the worst; it still covers valuable concepts of cell biology. If you're only relying on the lectures to learn information, then I would definitely not recommend this class.",
    "If you're taking it, it's probably because you have to, so sure.",
    "I would recommend the on sequence 102 with Valerie Horsley. She cares and it is taught well.",
    "Not if they don't have to take it. I learned a lot this semester, but at a very deep expense.",
    "I would recommend this course if it is with Horsley.",
    "yes, if you are interested in pursuing biology further. the material is fairly niche and focuses on specific mechanisms as examples. this is great for learning but also may not be useful to people taking this course as their only science class.",
    "Yes, it was better than bio 101, but still not a riveting course.",
    "I would if you have to take bio as a requirement... I don't know how many people take the bio sequence for fun but if you want to, go for it",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in biology itself, or if it is a requirement for their major or pre-med track. Otherwise, this is a challenging course that someone who is not entirely interested in biology might not enjoy.",
    "This is a required course for many STEM majors so I would recommend it in that sense, but I would not recommend this course to anyone who is not required to take this course for their major.",
    "Yes, but it requires a lot of hard work for the midterms and finals",
    "I would recommend this course because it provides a good background for the rest of biology.",
    "I would recommend this course because I learned so much about biology. While this course is introductory, the material definitely is packed and gives you a challenge. I gained a much better understanding of how pathways, the cytoskeleton, transport, and other phenomena work inside the cell.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is interesting and I believe that I have genuinely learned a lot.",
    "It's a necessary evil for many majors, so take it. It's not terrible.",
    "Not unless you need to for credit. Credit\/D\/Fail is also an  option.",
    "Take only if necessary for your major.",
    "I would because I genuinely feel more knowledgeable about the cells and their operations to the point where I can not only teach the basics myself, but apply the information as well which will be crucial for biomedical engineering.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it is a great course to see how lectures work in college, and exposes you to a different style of teaching and learning.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if he\/she wished to learn about how to study cells. The topics touched upon allow you to read research papers using cell biology, which is a plus if your interested in cell biology research. However, there were some things that were surprisingly not covered, such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Nevertheless, the course was doable if the student is willing to put the work in. There was a little too much memorization, but it's a biology course so that's not a surprise.",
    "No",
    "If you're already doing bio, then you don't have a choice. If you're taking this class for fun, I would be heavily advised though... I would rather self-learn these topics than take this class.",
    "I didn't dislike this course as much as BIOL 101. If I had invested a little more time into really learning the material, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more. I actually found it pretty interesting when I took the time to get into the material. However, if you have the chance to place out of the class I definitely would; there are so many more interesting biology courses out there.",
    "I would recommend this course mostly if the student has to complete the introductory biology sequence for major\/pre-med requirements. I felt that the course material was interesting and well-taught, so if this class is not a requirement but the student has a passion for biology, it would definitely be a good class to take.",
    "Very exciting stuff if you like biology.",
    "Yes 100 times over. I couldn't stop thinking or talking about this class-- it was incredible.",
    "no, because this course did not aid my learning in biology. The course was not organized well and did not foster a learning environment.",
    "I would only recommend this course to people who do not mind learning minuscule details.",
    "Only if you need it.",
    "Yes because it provided a good understanding about cell biology.",
    "It's not bad but you'd probably want a reason for taking it",
    "Unless it is a required course, the material isnt useful enough or in depth enough to warrant taking this class. I learned most of the material through videos",
    "If youre not interested in majoring in biology or going on the pre med track, Id skip it.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in biology. Since I have since changed my major, it was not the best experience for me, but overall was a good course.",
    "Yes, I felt that this course provided me with enough knowledge to feel confident moving forward.",
    "The course isn't horrible but I didn't feel like I gained much from it and it was not very engaging. If you don't have to take it, I wouldn't, but if you do it's not terrible.",
    "I would only recommend it if someone had to take it for a major prerequisite or if they were premed.",
    "Noit is a necessary course as part of the intro biology sequence, but I do not feel the course was well designed and taught.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want to learn about the techniques of biology and the cell.",
    "i would but its frusterating to have 20\/20 or 19\/20 on all homeworks and then study a ton and get a 67 on the midterm. the midterm wasnt testing knowledge mainly covered in the course in my opinion",
    "its kinda disorganized which is annoying, but not horrible\r\nnot too much work or too complicated but its hard to learn feom the slides",
    "Not unless you have to take it.",
    "No, unless youre required to take it. This course was as uninspiring as a gut but the instruction was poor enough that getting a good grade was not easy.",
    "Yes, I think that it was interesting to learn and a good portion of the biology sequence. I would definitely recommend a student continue biology and take this part.",
    "Pre-req for a lot of things so yes I guess. Need to do a lot of learning on your own. Recommend using Piazza",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in pursuing laboratory science at a more advanced level, or to a student interested in the intricacies of cell biology, but not to a general biology student. It was focused on seemingly random topics at very detailed levels, which lowered my interest in a lot of the lectures.",
    "Only if you absolutely have to. It was not an enjoyable science credit and I've learned much more in other science classes at Yale.",
    "If they are interested in any kind of Biology, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "you probably have to take it in anyways\r\nif u took AP Bio you'll be better prepared",
    "I would recommend this course to another student to learn about the basics of cell bio and of research.",
    "Yes, the course is well taught and students are well supported by the peer tutors so no one should feel left behind.",
    "I would recommend to any student considering STEM - great overview of experimental methods and useful applications",
    "I would recommend this course for students who have a love for cell biology and all the details that come with it. However, without a particular love for cell biology, it is hard to enjoy this course as it is difficult to relate it to other parts of biology.",
    "I mean I've heard better about the spring semester version...",
    "Yes, this is a required course for most, if not all, biology majors, and this was a good class taught by a professor who is passionate about cell biology.",
    "If you are interested in bio or anything bio related (pre-med, bme, etc.), then definitely take this course because it's the intro class.",
    "Yes I would because it was important to my understanding of biology.",
    "Although I would not recommend this course by itself, I will recommend as part of the first half of the intro bio sequence. I think taking 101 and 102 are a great way to gain an in-depth understanding of cell biology principles, even for students that are not interested in studying biology but are still looking to challenge themseslves.",
    "I would recommend this course along with the rest of the Biology 101-104 sequence for anyone pursuing a science-related major. Many fundamental concepts and principles are covered in-depth.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if taking the bio sequence.",
    "If they need to",
    "Not if you have the choice although the professor is so knowledgeable and cares about the students. There is too much memorization for little time we have"
