   "comments": [
    "As the title would suggest, I learned a lot more about topics related to inequalities in health.",
    "In this course, I developed an idea of the field of medical anthropology and was guided to think critically about a biocultural perspective on health issues and their potential solutions.",
    "I learned about foundational concepts such as health equity (and how it differs from health equality), and applied these concepts to \"case studies\", such as the opioid epidemic in the US, HIV\/AIDS in South Africa, etc.",
    "Much deeper understanding of health disparities in the United States, focus on equity and intervention structures. Great guests in class, structured incredibly well, incredibly engaging material and professor.",
    "An understanding of health equity and health disparities - which are related to but highly distinct from the aspects of global health covered in other classes, which are usually more straightforward and not as concerned with justice, rights, access to care, etc.",
    "This was an incredible introduction to different health issues and how to address them. This is a MUST take for GHS students, global affairs students, anyone interested in health. Prof Panter-Brick is the best prof Ive ever had. Its a fireside chat every class about important issues. So enjoyable."

   "comments": [
    "A strength is the professor. She is really knowledgeable and a juggernaut in the field of global health, so it is valuable to be in discussions with her. Also, the assignment schedule is pretty flexible, so it works well if you have to pick and choose which weeks to be more engaged.",
    "Strengths: this class was incredible. I learned so much from this class. Discussion is always very engaging even if you dont talk. \r\nWeakness: I wouldn't change anything",
    "Strengths: the professor and TF, hands down--they're both incredible and personable. Weaknesses: the reading load was a bit high, and near the end of the semester the quality of discussion dropped off because people couldn't make it through all of them.",
    "It taught me to understand things but I struggle to grasp what the concrete knowledge I gained was. This is not a bad thing, just noteworthy.",
    "It's a really strong course from the professor and TA, to the readings that compliment the class discussions really well, to the guest speakers Professor Panter-Brick brings in, to the class activities that we do to assist our learning. 10\/10 would take this course again.",
    "I really enjoyed how the students were able to shape the course by presenting through presentations on readings each week. Having student-led presentations not only allowed us to practice synthesizing long and often complicated reading into a few key ideas, but it also gave students a chance to inject their own personal interest into the topic and open up the discussion to everyone else in the class. One of my favorite aspects of the class was learning the hard work of my peers. The only weakness I can think of is that the CA's lacked guidance and I definitely struggled with them at first because they were unlike any other writing assignment I had done before.",
    "The syllabus covers a variety of different topics, but it is not very cohesive and we had many surfacy discussions",
    "A major strength is Professor Panter-Brickshe is  joy to be around and had organized class so the nearly two hour seminar wouldn't drag. A weakness is that I think there is too much emphasis on class discussion; while I enjoyed hearing from my peers I would have loved to hear more from Prof. Panter-Brick, or spend more time in small group discussions\/activities.",
    "Strengths - CPB as a prof, interesting material, small class, not too demanding\r\nWeaknesses- not too many assignments so you must to well on them, not enough classes!!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Definitely. It is so good to become more about greater social issues related to health and what the scholarship on it has to say.",
    "Yess 100% but only if you are interested some what in health. You'll think about health disparity like you've never thought about it before. It'll show you if you really want to go into global\/public health if that is your interest.",
    "Yes! The teaching and atmosphere is great.",
    "Yes. It forces you to engage with questions of health and questions of equity in a more complex manner. Professor Panter-Brick is lovely.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone even somewhat interested in the social sciences, medicine, or global health. The seminar is incredible and touches on some of the most recent work across many different themes, including the social determinants of health, controversies in health interventions globally, and the intersection of opioid addiction and race, to name a few. I had no background in anthropology or global health coming into the course, so while many of the discussions were relatively new to me, I feel like I was able to come extremely far in the course of the semester. This course would be especially important to any pre-med students, as it expands the scope of medicine from the biological to the social and cultural.",
    "Explore other options...it doesnt live up to the hype. If you have absolutely no background in public or global health studies, this might be good. Like if youre purely STEM or something. If you do have a global health studies background, it can be a bit boring.",
    "I would recommend this course. I was initially hesitant to take the class having very limited background in global health, but I found the class material to be accessible, especially since I did all of the introductory reading carefully. The class requirements (one presentation, three short papers, and one final paper\/project) were manageable, and it was nice to be able to choose when to turn in the short papers so deadlines wouldn't pile up with other classes. The class material was really interesting and important, especially for anyone going into medicine.",
    "Take this class if you can. Professor Panter-Brick is incredible, really cares about both her students and the subject material. Fascinating discussions in class of privilege, interventions, structural oppression, all in the context of mental and physical health and well-being. Fabulous class.",
    "yes - if you are sure you are interested in health equity and health disparities, which are not the same as health in general. This class draws heavily on concepts from medical anthropology and the social sciences which are interesting but unfamiliar territory for global health scholars and others coming from more STEM-heavy fields.",
    "Absolutely. Best class Ive taken at Yale !"
