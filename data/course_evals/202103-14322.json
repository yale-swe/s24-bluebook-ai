I also learned a great deal about comparing texts with one another, and examining how our readings were interconnected was the most interesting parts of the course.",
                "Youre breadth of knowledge on the western canon will increase tremendously alongside your skills as a writer. If youve ever wondered how contemporary literature came to be this is a good place to start.",
                "I developed a greater knowledge of not only how to read literary texts for content, but how to evaluate them against other texts and in their content. This course then helped me develop a way to write about those evaluations.",
                "I developed my analysis skills, as well as listening skills during class discussions. I also became better at asking questions to my professor to seek help.",
                "I learned how to close read passages taking into account multiple levels of meaning. I also learned to appreciate the nuance and complexity that can be found in literature. I learned to look for more than the simple message. I learned to craft well thought out and clear literary essays. I also learned to participate more thoughtfully and tastefully in group discussions.",
                "Learned a lot about the literature that we read as well as about the historical context behind said books",
                "This skill was helpful in demonstrating ways of thinking about texts with a wide lens and making intertextual connections. The classroom discussions asked us to bridge specific textual examples with broader claims, and the written assignments gave an opportunity for closer reading. Through the example of Dr. Figlerowicz, I also learned to speak about text more precisely and intentionally. I picked up many specific insights about pieces in Homer, in Sappho, in Ovid along the way.",
                "I learned how to closely analyze and interpret literature at a level I had never done before. The class had a very high standard for analysis, which helped me raise my own bar for how I spoke and wrote of literature. I also learned a lot about ancient literature, which was something that I had never really done before.",
                "I feel as though my ability to close readand particularly to build off of other students close readings, flourished in this class."

                "The strengths were my professor's feedback and way of teaching, class discussions, and the appeal of the readings.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness was that I felt as if sometimes class discussions structured to the extent that sometimes it was difficult to freely build off of others' points.",
                "I really liked it! I wish we could spend more time on the same sources (going through genesis in a day felt hectic), but overall I enjoyed it a lot!",
                "The strength of the class is the instructor, who led us through the material very well. It might be improved if we experiment with different discussion formats (unmoderated discussions).",
                "The strengths of this course lie in the well run discussions in class and constructive feedback on papers. The professor also did a really good job of drawing out important themes in the works. The discussion posts were also useful.\r\n\r\nI think the class would have done better to allow students to prepare and present some organized thoughts on the different works.",
                "It is a common complaint of DS that the program sacrifices depth for breadth. I agree with this wholeheartedly, and nowhere was it more evident than in the Literature course. I found that none of the texts we read was apportioned enough time to be truly mined for its layered meanings and nuances, and that the speed of the course made it hard to even maintain clarity about through-lines and context. I think this issue could be ameliorated by the removal of 1 or 2 texts from the syllabus, though I know such a decision would be a difficult one to make.",
                "The strength of this course is the amount of material we cover and the professors that cover it. Directed Studies literature essentially goes from Homer and the Bible to Dante, which is a truly amazing amount of texts. We also covered a lot of ground textually, with long poems like Ovid's Metamorphoses sharing a place with the lyric poetry of Sappho in our writing. Another strength of the course are the lecturers. With a new lecturer every week, each a leading scholar in their field, the amount of detail they go into is truly incredible. That being said, an issue with the course is that it might cover too much in too short a time. There were some texts that definitely deserved more attention than we were allowed to give them, and I left many of the classes disappointed that we couldn't keep talking about texts like the Bible after spending only one class (essentially an hour) on the entire book of Genesis.",
                "I felt this course was overall perfectly balanced: it exposed students to a host of complex and rich readings, helped them to think about how others learned from said readings, and also to display their conclusions in clear essay form."

                "Yes",
                "I would unquestionably recommend this course to another student. My professor was amazing, and I grew so much as a student of literature. The class provides an amazing foundation in some very important texts. I was always excited for class, readings, and (dare I say) the papers as well. It was intellectually stimulating, and I could not have asked for a better experience with literature this fall.",
                "Of course. Directed Studies is a once in a lifetime opportunity to read and work with great, necessary texts. The relationships you build with students and professors I think are unmatched as far as first year courses go.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! This course was fantastic.",
                "Yes, this is an amazing class and I love the professor.",
                "Yes, this is a great way to become familiar with the foundational works, imagery, and language of the western cannon. Also a good way to learn how to write literature papers.",
                "I would recommend this course to others. The DS Literature texts are beautiful and often haunting; not only are they my favorite books I've read at Yale, but they are some of my favorite books I've ever read. Writing an essay a week is difficult, but the prompts are always interesting, and it is worth it to see how much you improve by the end of the semester. The opportunity to do one essay as a creative writing assignment was very fun (but it's optional, if that's not your thing). The only reason I would not recommend this course is because we move so quickly through texts that it always feels as if we move on right when we get to the heart of a book, but I think that is unavoidable in a class that covers so much material.",
                "I think that Dr. Figlerowicz is a first rate professor, and I'd recommend any of her courses to any student interested in literature!",
                "I would recommend it, but with the caveat that it is a lot of work, and that many of the texts are only given a brief amount of time in the syllabus. The whole course (Directed Studies) goes through three books essentially every week, which means that there simply isn't enough time to cover some of the material at the level of depth that it deserves.",
                "Yes very much so. DS Literature does exactly what one thinks it will: it exposes you to the great books in a refreshing and fulfilling way. If one has any desire to continue studies in the humanities, a base understanding of this tradition is a must."
