This course was intensive in feedback which I found helpful. Therefore, the skills I was able to develop were in retrospect to adequate responding to criticism and suggestions.",

It was really cool to learn about what a drink and liquor can represent and how different liquors came to be. There were also a ton of really awesome guest speakers that provided interesting perspectives and knowledge about the industry.",
                "We learned an extensive overview of the history of specific cocktails, as well as bar and cocktail culture more broadly, including overlap with colonialism, class struggle, and other factors/disciplines that I never expected to come across when talking about drinks. We also gained appreciation for the critical thinking that goes into making cocktails and designing bars."

It is extremely evident that both professors have an expansive knowledge of the topic and their enthusiasm transfers onto their students. The one weakness was that for the assignments I found it difficult at times to fit ideas into only two paragraphs or less but I understand that that is part of the challenge.",
                "Strengths: very interesting content, cool professors who want the best for students\r\nWeaknesses: professors talk a lot during the class, leave little time for students to discuss, readings are not brought up a lot",
                "The assignments, readings and guest speakers were all really awesome and engaging and allowed for a ton of learning. However I think the regular seminar discussions in this course could be more organized by maybe having presentation slides or an outline of what the conversation is going to revolve around.",
                "I have no complaints! The main strength of the course is definitely how the two professors' experience and expertise supplement and balance each other out. Jessica has a background in history and ethics that serves as great context for John's real-time knowledge of the bar industry. Additionally, their connections managed to secure an incredible series of visitors that really added to the course.",
                "It definitely would have been easier to have discussion in person. It would have been nice to have more students participate during the seminar."

One of the ways they did so was by doing assignments on the Sidecar app. I loved this small detail as it provided an easy way for us to engage with the local New Haven drink culture while also completing our own assignments."

The guest speakers were kind of cool. Most of the class was spent justifying the class. The teachers seem like great people but the class was confusing and boring. Don't get tricked by the name.",

                "Definitely! This course material is very different from all other courses at Yale and provides information which can be used in everyday life. Cocktails are a major part of our culture and I think its really helpful to know the history around them.",
                "Yes! It's just a fun class on a great subject that deserves more credit than it gets.",
                "I thought this was a great last course to take at Yale. It was on a subject I didn't think I would get to learn anywhere else, and for that, I am grateful. The professors were extremely knowledgeable and had so much to share, and whether or not you knew anything about cocktails or drinks before this course, you came out knowing more about how these drinks and their spirits reflected and influenced their time periods. What I loved most was the end of the year project (though you work on it throughout the year) in which you take the lessons you learn in order to plan out your own bar or cocktail event."
