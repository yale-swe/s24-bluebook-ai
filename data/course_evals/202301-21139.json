I did not enjoy the questions that simply required us to summarize long research papers. I feel like they took a long time, and I did not retain the information very well over the long term. I believe normal qualitative questions concerning those topics could be more helpful in narrowing down the most important takeaways from the papers.",
                "Strengths: High correlation between lecture content and exams. Bi-weekly psets are incredibly manageable and non-cumulative exams + cheat sheets really reduce the stress level of the course. \r\nWeaknesses: The uncertainty with the exam dates was a little frustrating, especially with the second exam occurring during reading week. Cramming all the hard atmospheric chemistry at the very end was stressful. Lecture content does not always translate well to psets."
