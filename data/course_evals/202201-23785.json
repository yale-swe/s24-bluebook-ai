                "I, a student from Mxico, learned SO MUCH about my own country. Every week the readings were fascinating, covering material from the Mexican revolution to the present.",
                "SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MODERN MEXICO! THIS IS AN AMAZING CLASS",
                "This class taught me how to think about history as a discipline that is not just learnt or observed, but actively discussed and subject to interpretation. We got to learn so much about the history of Mexico and discussed the most important events of the 20th century and how they affected the course of history in Mexico.",
                "A comprehensive understanding of the Mexican pre-revolutionary period, Revolutionary period, and post-Revolutionary legacies. Also developed an understanding of existing scholarship on the matter.",
                "HIST 332J was an invaluable course to my academic career. Dr. lvarez-Pimentel's instruction was conducive to topics surrounding Mexican Revolutionary history, larger historical transcripts, and even present-day Mexican news.",
                "This course was super helpful for developing an understanding of the Mexican Revolution considering the various ways we define revolution. We examined how different sectors of society not typically included in conversation about the revolution contributed to it.",
                "I learned about Mexico's complex history and the question of whether the Mexican Revolution of 1910 was actually revolutionary. We took into account various players and groups that complicate the study of the revolution and what occurred after. We learned about violence after the revolution and what the revolutions legacies were. We learned how to think like historians, how to evaluate primary sources, and what questions we should ask when analyzing history.",
                "KNOWLEDGE: I learned a TON about the Mexican Revolution. The readings were short enough that I was able to do them all pretty calmly pretty consistently, so I think this is the history course I've taken the most out of in terms of the readings/content. We covered from the causes of the revolution to pretty much the now, focusing on the bulk of what is known by historians as the revolution. the armed phase, the sort of state building phase, then all the presidencies that came after that. \r\n\r\nSKILLS: I think I improved my reading, writing, and research skills SIGNIFICANTLY in this course. Professor Alvarez gave us reading tips from the very beginning, I think this is the first time a professor has ever done that in my college career, and so when the time came to read a ton for the research paper I felt beyond ready and I felt satisfied and not overwhelmed with the way I was approaching reading. In terms of writing, Professor Alvarez gave us super comprehensive guidelines for how to write, and I truly feel like my writing developed in the history field. He dedicated the last 20 or so minutes of class each seminar to talk about our writing assignments that were coming up, and there he answered questions and went through exactly how writing is done in the field and how to approach different parts of the essay. The main essay was broken up into parts. I don't know what else to say besides my historical writing really grew. Research skills grew here as well. Like I said earlier, Professor Alvarez really spent time at the end of each class to talk about the research assignment and gave us tangible steps to take when looking for books for literature reviews, when looking for book reviews, when citing, the type of questions to answer when writing a lit review, a LONG list of places to find literature and primary sources on Mexican history, resources that will be useful even beyond the course (THANK YOU DR. A!), and super great outlining techniques. \r\n\r\nOverall, learned a TON.",
                "I developed a better knowledge of Mexican history and also improved my skills as a researcher/historian.",
                "We went into detail about Mexican history and key actors from the Mexican Revolution in the early twentieth-century and the role of violence in the country's history up until the present-day. I found this course to be well-accommodated to history and non-history majors. As someone who is not a history major, I had a steep learning curve content-wise but also in the practical aspects of the class, in regards to learning how to look for information online, how to strategically use Yales library, extracting the most relevant information from a variety of sources, coming up with an original argument, etc."

            "comments": [
                "strengths: readings, discussions, incredible professor, overall ambiance with the rest of the class\r\nweaknesses: none",
                "The one weakness of this course was the fact that for the second half of the semester, most of the talking was done by the students and the professor did not add much to the discussion. This was due to the student led presentations that, although good and useful, did not allow much lecturing time/discussion with the professor as opposed to more of just student discussion (which is good but more Professor participation would have been nice).",
                "Strengths: SUPER ACTIVE class. Everyone was always ready to discuss. This is really one of the only classes I've attended at Yale where it was obvious everyone had done the readings for class. Dr. Alvarez Pimentel was always prepared for class and a great facilitator. Students felt supported and comfortable speaking, and it was great to have a close learning community on a history that is not taught extensively at Yale.",
                "This course has been the best-taught course I have taken during my time at Yale. Dr. A's instruction skillfully facilitated productive conversations and deeper engagement with the course material. The people who partook in this course were also extremely engaged and prepared, which facilitated the smoothness by which the class was run. The course began with the professor lecturing for the first three classes and the rest of the classes being led by student presentations of the readings. The engagement was also ensured by the weekly reading responses. I thought that the midterms being cumulative towards the final paper was also smart, as it did not seem like busy work.",
                "The course included some great readings and that was one of its greatest strengths -- although, readings at times were a bit tedious.",
                "Strengths: Dr. A is a fantastic professor, the readings incorporated a variety of perspectives and laid a solid theoretical framework complemented by informative sources \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The group presentations sometimes did not stimulate fruitful discussion",
                "STRENGTHS: THE PROFESSOR: Professor Alvarez for sure. This has been one of the few, if not the only seminar, where I have been engaged each class. This has been because there have been engaging activities in each class period, the activities were also varied, and there was a LOT of mixed levels of discussion, from partner work to small group work to entire group discussion. He set up the class incredibly well and set up an environment that was very conducive to learning. THE READINGS: having a primary text for the class has its limitations of course, but it was so helpful to keep a consistent reading schedule and to keep the historical perspective consistent and really build up to content knowledge. I really enjoyed the beginning of class, when we had one theoretical work next to one historical content work to read and they complemented one another very well, that was an incredible reading experience. CLASS STRUCTURE: The way class was structured was such that a small group of students presented each week, but this wasn't just a presentation, it was basically like teaching a class. The presenters had to set up a warm up activity, a presentation with context, and scatter different discussion activities throughout the class. I feel like this structure led to the class being very engaging and motivating, and the varying activities that the presenters brought to the table made for very rich discussion in groups of different sizes as well as a variety of sources that we got exposed to. WRITING ASSIGNMENTS: The writing assignments were structured in such a way that by the end of the semester when the time came to write our final papers, we already had a historiography and primary source analysis written. It was really scaffolded well. Also all the assignments came with a very detailed description of what was expected, not only for this paper, but in historical writing as a whole in general. I gained a LOT of knowledge about how to write historical papers and also gained a LOT of resources for Mexican history research that will be useful for me in the future. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: the professor maintained a consistent and organized lecture format that made learning the material each week straightforward to do. While I was a bit concerned about the amount of reading that we would have to do, the assignments were very engaging, and I thought that the readings were a great balance between historical context and theory. While there was a lot of material to learn throughout the semester, anyone who is interested in the class can take it regardless of whether they have taken history classes in the past or not.\r\nWeaknesses: None that come to mind other than I wish we had enough time to cover the material scheduled for the last week of class wherein we would have talked about contemporary issues in Mexico!"

                "Definitely don't take as an easy credit. This was not an easy/ trivial class; the essays were a lot of work and the grading was somewhat harsh and there was a lot of readings that, if you wanted to get anything out of the class, you had to do. Doing the readings was essentially the main way of learning the history and class was mostly spent on analyzing these readings. A bit more of professor input would have been nice but overall, I learned a lot in this class and would definitely recommend to someone who was willing to put in the effort.",
                "YES the content is very interesting and life-changing!! This course really exposed me to so many new ideas that might influence my senior thesis in History.",

                "YES YES YES YES YES YESS! Professor Alvarez is the best professor I've had at Yale. It was evident that he really took the time to curate the class readings, to think about how to structure the class, the best ways to keep us engaged, and the best ways to support us as rising scholars in terms of reading skills, writing skills, and research skills. He really gave us all the knowledge he had to improve our skills as historians. I learned a TON in this class, more than in any other history course. I grew in my reading, writing, and research skills. Overall an 11/10 course.",
                "Absolutely, this was one of the most informative classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "Absolutely! This is hands-down the best class I have taken (and likely will take) at Yale. At the start, I was a bit concerned about the workload given the number of pages we had to read for the weekly reading assignments in addition to the student presentations, weekly responses, and writing assignments, but I realized very quickly just how engaging this class was and how interesting the material was, too. Most of the students had a personal tie to the subjects presented, which made the conversations we had all the more insightful, and I left every single class satisfied; in general, I am in awe of how much I learned this semester both in terms of Mexicos history as well as practical research and writing skills. Despite the challenge and this steep learning curve, I never felt overwhelmed by this class and actually found myself eager to engage with the next weeks readings immediately after each meeting. I never imagined being able to be a part of a space as special as this one at an institution like Yale, but I am wholeheartedly grateful to have been able to experience it."
