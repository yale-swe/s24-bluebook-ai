                "I learned how to identify the main organs of a diverse variety of plants, especially angiosperm flower structures, as well as how these phenotypes can mark the phylogenetic clade the plant belongs to. This lab also allowed me to see how the diversity of plant foods that we eat are spread through the different clades and families of plants. Both of these skills will allow me to think about and see plants in my day-to-day life with new insight.",

                "I feel like I can now dissect a flower with my eyes closedrazor and alland tell you the mode of placentation in the ovary. The food and drink spread every week was fabulous and made Tuesdays (which was otherwise my hell day) something to look forward to.",
                "The strengths are that it is the best, most relaxing lab there is. It was a highlight of the week to go to the greenhouses once a week and eat foot while drawing flowers and talking with fellow students. It's also so informative and you get to look at so many cool plants. It is so low stress but you learn a lot! The only weakness is that the practical was a bit difficult due to the amount of memorization of certain words needed, but it's not like you get exposed to anything new that you shouldn't know.",
                "Very well organized, and the food was an awesome addition. Sometimes it was hard to tell what you were supposed to be looking at, though, so a little more guidance would have been nice.",
                "This course was very fun! It was a bit tedious at times but takes as long or short as you want it to take. There was an extreme amount of ambiguity throughout the course on what we were expected to know, how well we were doing, and if we were on the right track to succeed. There were also several times where there would be a specific piece of information that was essential to know, but it felt as though a student would have to ask about what it was for us to be taught the content. In some instances, only a certain group, the group who asked, of students would hear about what the part of the plant was. We were ensured throughout the course that the practical exam would be easy and would require minimal studying, ultimately resulting in an exam that caught most of the class off guard. \r\nThere were several times when it seemed like the TFs didn't know what the content was, and weren't able to accurately help us. I had several instances of asking for help from a TF, only to be corrected by Professor Edwards in passing. \r\nThis class would be greatly improved with check-ins on how our learning was going. Whether it be through more frequent lab book check-ins to see if we are understanding the material/recording everything we need to know or practice questions before lab days, I think it would be helpful to have a grasp on if we are succeeding in the course.",
                "Great lab",
                "I loved how interactive it was. The food was amazing too!! The lab was very cooperative and relaxing. I wish there was more feedback throughout because it turned out I had a lot wrong in my notebook and didnt realize that until the final.",
                "This course was such a fun way to engage with the plants that we learned about in lecture and it helped me put all of that material into context. It was also such a relaxing way to spend the afternoon because I really enjoyed dissecting and drawing the plants + eating the food and talking to everyone!",
                "For this course, more of a final review before the last lab practical that brought together everything we'd learned over the course of the semester would be helpful. More feedback with the plant specimen project could also be helpful. I really enjoyed the class, the wide diversity of plants and foods brought in every week was incredible and it was very cool to learn to dissect and identify plant parts for ourselves through the lab.",
                "Strengths: very hands-on, very enthusiastic professor, excellent spread of plant-themed food provided every week. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class was relatively unstructured in a way that made it difficult to learn, with expectations for students' learning being extremely unclear throughout the semester. Each week there was a list of plants to dissect/draw, and it was extremely self-guided. I felt like we weren't really taught what to look for during the dissections, the expectation was just that we would figure it out, and then we would be expected to identify structures that we had never been taught about or told to look for, and which you would only know about if you happened to sit next to the professor throughout class or asked a TA to go over the important parts of each flower. Sometimes the TFs didn't even know things about the flowers that the professor wanted us to know. On more than one occasion, I labeled something in my lab notebook after discussing and confirming it with a TA, only to have the professor contradict the information when I asked her another question. The inconsistency made it particularly hard to know what was going on. In the future, I think Professor Edwards should walk through each plant with the TFs prior to class so that they can all be on the same page. It might also be helpful to provide a lab manual like some other lab classes do, so that there's some more instructions/guidance/records of what is important to know.  \r\n\r\nThe expectations for the level of detail to include in our lab notebooks was also very unclear--I was constantly questioning whether mine was adequate, and the answers I got from the TFs when I asked about it seemed very vague.  \r\n\r\nThe final exam was a disaster. The professor had said, and I quote, \"this exam is going to be so easy! You shouldn't even have to study!\" They made it sound like we would just be labeling some flower parts and counting numbers of petals. It turned out that the exam was actually REALLY HARD. They expected us to recall the families of a bunch of the plants that we'd worked with throughout the semester, identify and label structures which we'd barely learned about (some of which, I don't think we ever learned the names for, or maybe it was just casually tossed out in class), and a lot of content from the lecture course was tested on in the lab final, despite us not having talked about it specifically in lab.",
                "The strength is how the course was constructed to keep engagement high.  Every. Single. Person wanted to be there. With the hundreds of specimens, beautiful greenhouse, and even a field trip, it was the best course to show intro botanical science. The food bar kept us happy and made a lasting impact of how the specimens we are studying are critically relevant to our everyday lives.",
                "Strengths: The taxa that we studied followed what we were learning in lecture and improved my understanding. Dr. Edwards also put a lot of effort into making it fun, and there were new foods we could try each week. \r\nWeaknesses: It was sometimes unclear what we were responsible for knowing. Sometimes there were flower structures that were brought up only once that were tested on the lab practical final.",
                "This was a fun and engaging lab course. One of the strengths was that we had enough time to go at our own pace and could ask lots of questions if needed. One of the weaknesses was that it felt a little too unstructured at some points, and I wasn't always sure what I was supposed to be looking for, or what to draw.  Another weakness was specific to the final exam. There wasn't clear communication on the format of the exam and the possible content the exam would cover.",

                "I have mixed feelings about this. In some ways, it was really engaging to dissect plants and learn about botany. But it could also get tedious (3 hours is kind of a long time to be cutting plants) and it was frustrating how little guidance and clear expectations there were.",
                "Highly recommend if you want to learn plants hands-on. The best way to learn.",
                "If you're taking the class, definitely take this lab! The hands-on experience makes the lectures a lot more interesting. My advice would be to pay close attention to all new terms that are brought up (they might be tested on the final), and be proactive about asking questions when something isn't clear.",

                "A must-take class. You'll never take another class like it--every week we studied different clades of plants, dissecting and eating plants in the clade. The most relaxing part of my week by far"
