Truly developed a better historical and literary understanding of Latin American literature and authors as a whole. Was challenged to think more about the historical context and time periods of the writings rather than such their composition which is something I hadn't had the privilege of doing for Spanish Literature at Yale.",

                "A critical understanding of ethical and political frameworks applicable to the Latin American canon.",
                "I learned so much from this course. On a technical level, I learned so much about how to analyze and understand the genre of the short story. On a language skill level, my Spanish grew so much just from being in class every day, as well as from the assignments both reading and writing.",
                "This course was a great introduction to the short story, a hallmark of Latin American literature. We learned about the characteristics of a short story, how it has developed in history, about different notable Latin American authors, and how ethics and politics are reflected upon in the short story. I developed critiquing skills, knowledge about different ethics and learned about Latin American cultures.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Challenging in the best way possible due to Profesor Gonzlez-Prez's style of teaching and conducting a seminar(teaches much more than one would imagine and is expected). Such challenging \"conduction\" very much leads to encouragement and improvement. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many come to mind other than the sometimes the classroom would not run in a seminar manner but more so of a \"leminar.\" Still very much enjoyed it.",
                "Wish there was more student engagement I do think people read the stories more when there were quizzes",
                "Great mix of critical essays and original short stories. Perhaps could use more student participation during classes.",
                "I think this class could benefit from a bit more class discussion engagement overall it was much more lecture style than seminar. However, it's hard to mind when the lectures are so engaging! Professor Gonzlez-Prez is so knowledgeable about the subject I learned so much just from listening to him!",
                "Strengths: Great selection of short stories, Professor Gonzalez is great, the course does a great job in tying ethics and politics into literature. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes felt a bit disorganized, there was not much class discussion, it was more of a lecture",
                "Its a great course that talks about some interesting concepts in literature and philosophy, while allowing the student choice in how much engagement to put it in. Its lecture-style, so participation isnt incredibly important.",
                "Strengths is that the professor is so knowledgeable and learning from him is amazing. He knows so many details about all the authors and stories and the time period that it gives you so much context and is really cool to hear",
                "This course is lecture style. If you are to participate in lively discussion about texts, this likely isnt the class for you. To encourage active participation, the course should definitely start with more discussion to set a president for the rest of the course."

                "Yes, 100% If the student has an interest(actual interest) in Hispanic and Latin American literature the student should definitely take this class. Anibal is beyond knowledgable and explains the materials extremely well. If the student is looking to improve their Spanish, the class will definitely get the job done bc the professor is very well-spoken and the vocabulary within the readings is extensive and diverse.",
                "Yes, good 300 level if you are trying to get the certificate",
                "I would recommend to anyone who loves literature and is either very comfortable in their Spanish skills or looking for more language immersion practice. It's a great course!",
                "Yes, I recommend this course to any student who is interested in Latin American literature and ethics and politics. It is not too stressful, Professor Gonzalez prioritizes that students enjoy the course and have fun with the short stories.",
                "Yes! If you want to read in spanish and learn about different stories and authors and philosophers i would recommend it. It is not really a discussion type of seminar, it is a lecture the size of a seminar. You have opportunities to speak and can definitely add your thoughts if you want to but most of the class is a lecture",
                "Yes. This class is a great way to improve Spanish language abilities while reading and analyzing fascinating Latin American short stories"
