Extraction, GC-MS, purification with the Biotage, use of microwave reactor instead of reflux, 2D NMR, and even more synthesis techniques. I also learned that maybe organic synthesis is not for me haha but we did so much that I'm more confident saying that. I also grew as a writer and a scientist.",

However, this loose structure also means that deadlines can be very unclear, which leads to feeling behind and overwhelmed by assignments all of a sudden. I think with more clear deadlines, this class could keep the independent aspect and still maintain the sanity of its students.",

The only thing I would change is the speed of the course: maybe get into and start the first experiment earlier so there was more time at the end to do final projects."

Some weeks it'll be really light, and others you'll have a final paper and proposal due within two days of each other. It's a rewarding course to take though! It definitely prepared more for a career as a researcher.",
