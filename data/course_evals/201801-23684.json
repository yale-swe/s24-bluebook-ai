    "You become a lot better at speaking spanish. They don't teach the grammar well, they just expect you to know it and they review a different one each day. Then, they'll quiz you on all of it.",

    "My speaking reading and writing skills greatly improved.",
    "I improved my grammar and vocabulary in the Spanish language.",
    "I definitely improved in my fluidity of speech and pronunciation.",

   "comments": [
    "Strength is that it really challenges you to develop your skills even if it takes time and errors\r\nweakness is that the teacher's grade very harshly and don't really have a lot of time out of class to help you",
    "The class is very fast paced, it would be nice if we spent more time on certain topics or readings.",
    "The course was great and should not be changed.",
    "I believe that one of the weaknesses of the course was the speed of the course and the difficulty of the material. We covered many advanced and new grammar concepts in a very short time frame, and I sometimes felt lost or confused. \r\n\r\nI believe that the biggest strength of the course was the range of literature and poems we read because they helped illuminate the different ways that Spanish can be used as an art as well as practically.",
    "The course was very good about making the student more fluent with the language, which is a big focus of the course but I felt like the exams only tested absolute perfection of the grammar rules, which did not really agree with the course goals."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if they're willing to put in a lot of work. You have daily homework and sometimes will have multiple things due in one night.",
    "This class helped me improve my speaking skills and know more vocabulary words.",
    "Yes great course.",
    "I would recommend the course to a student looking to improve their Spanish, but I would also warn them about the very high workload and intensity of the course. It is very difficult to achieve a high grade due to the workload, difficulty of tests without a curve, and the harsh grading.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed this course and learned new things about the history of Latin America.",
    "Yes, good course but be prepared to perfect your spanish grammar."
