                "I think this course was great. It was easy to follow, informative, and super engaging. I really liked the step by step lecture style that wasn't rushed and paced at a comfortable rate.",
                "pretty well-rounded coverage of the subject matter, but didn't remain entirely faithful to the textbook",
                "Strengths: availability of office/help hours, review/hw sessions\r\nWeaknesses: grading errors",
                "I thought the course was well-organized. The exams were fair. The only weird part is that the grading sometimes feels a bit arbitrary. I would get points taken off from my problem set for some really niche reasons.",
                "Strengths: teaches material at a level that is best for actually using it as a tool. Prof. Kim's lessons on the background and history of the topics we learn are amazing (even if sometimes also upsetting)--they are interesting, give the material more character, help paint a backdrop for all the concepts being introduced, and help correct some of history's wrongdoings. Prof. Kim is also just a great guy in general. John's problem sessions are also very helpful, and he is a fantastic TA. Prof. Kim also gives a lot of examples for each topic introduced, which is very helpful for learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes concepts are not introduced in a way that is mathematically rigorous and can be confusing as a result--i.e. definitions are given in terms of specific examples, not well-defined mathematical statements, which makes applying them to other, more general cases much harder and less clear. Occasionally homeworks or exams will require knowledge of content that was never introduced in lecture and is only in the textbook, which is not assigned reading, so this causes a lot of confusion. Grading is also very inconsistent and not done in a way that focuses on students' learning or fairness; answers that are incorrect (sometimes in a meaningful way) and proofs that overlook important cases will sometimes receive full points (of course, this is to students' benefit in terms of grades, but does not help us learn) and answers that are logically equivalent to the solution key's will very frequently lose large numbers of points due to minor (and usually logically insignificant) differences between them, which is obviously detrimental to both students' grades and (more importantly) our learning.",
                "The biggest strength was the clear, concise, and unambiguous lectures. My main complaint is that the grading of psets and exams was often a bit harsh, and points were often taken off for minor, inconsequential deviations from the answer key.",
                "The class was well organized and well taught",
                "Good",
                "Strengths: It is taught so well. Prof Kim will really clearly go through all of the material and makes the homework and the exams very reasonable. They both cover exactly what is taught in class, so as long as you are in class or watching the recording you will learn. \r\nWeaknesses: The test percentage is so high. If you have any testing anxiety or are just not the best tester, you have been warned. The final was worth 45% of our grade which is just insanely high.",
                "The professor was a really big strength in my opinion. Was a really well-balanced professor that taught with many examples that helped solidify the concepts. As well he was able to talk about things other than the concepts and even give very enriching history lessons that I appreciate. Motivated me to learn the concepts and his sharing his work has been really cool as well. Also, the helping hours being open throughout the way before problem sets are due, helps a lot as well. Nothing much for this course to improve on.",
                "relatively interesting content. Just don't see how a lot of it is applicable.",
                "Feedback is really unclear and I lost so many points to formatting my homework and proper labelling",
                "Strengths: course organization, exams were mostly fair (except for last question on the final that only few people were able to do), and John, who was an amazing TA.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses;\r\n- The TAs and the Instructor are unhelpful. Not because they don't know how to help, but because they seem to assume that any request for help translates into a student wanting to gain an unfair advantage over the rest. In fact, this is a recurring problem throughout the course. If 1% of the class behaves like this, the professor will go on and punish 100% of the class. You don't have to believe me, these are some of the things the instructor said in class: \r\n-- \"I have disabled regrade requesting on the midterms because there is some bad behavior going on here that I do not like. There was a typo in the solution. Some people are using this to claw back points in very strange ways\"\r\n-- \"I'm gonna have a total regrade policy for the final ... it goes through me ... I'm regrading your whole thing. After I regrade the whole thing, you may end up with fewer points than when you first handed it in. The reason for this is - there is zero cost so far for submitting for a regrade ... so there will be some cost for submitting for a regrade\" and he acknowledged that \"he knows the vast majority\" of the class was not taking advantage of the regrading system",
                "I think the class actually progresses pretty well through topics in a logical fashion. I think professor Kim does a good job presenting them as well with lots of examples. I think the historical tangents, while interesting, aren't necessarily useful, and are usually an excuse for me to stop paying attention in class. I think the homework level of difficulty is appropriate.",
                "I thought the class was overall really enjoyable. The PSETs were reasonable and the late days let me never be stressed about having enough time to do the work. Professor Kim is a great lecturer in person. The only negative of this course is grading. I thought it can be really random and harsh at times. For example, there would be one question where the graders would give lots of leniency, but then for another question a simple wording thing could lose you 10 points (around 10% of your grade). This can be really scary when your midterm and final are worth 30% and 40% of your grade respectively.",
                "Professor Kim is definitely a strength. He is friendly and empathetic, but he also demands commitment to the course. Although he sometimes appeared uncertain about course material, he did motivate me to give my best effort. The final composing 45% of the overall grade put undue pressure on students. I think smaller assessments like canvas quizzes throughout the course of the semester that compose some percentage of the grade might help reinforce student learning and decrease the pressure of the final.",
                "The biggest weakness of this course was the horrid grading by the ULAs. Too often I as well as many other people in the class would get points counted off for answers that were clearly right but didn't solve the problem the exact way the answer key presented it. Additionally, on the midterm, one of the questions was arguably graded incorrectly. Instead of addressing this and allowing students to request regrades, Professor Kim decided to just close regrade requests. \r\n\r\nAnother weakness of this course is its attempt to cover such a wide range of topics. While I do understand that this is a survey course, the course goes into very little detail on most of the topics and instead focuses on something niche within the topic (like why are Jacobi rotations one of the only things we learn about in linear algebra, or why are we given so many chinese remainder theorem problems when we don't learn about euler's theorem/fermat's little theorem). Additionally, while the history of the algorithms is somewhat interesting, it feels irrelevant to spend a few lectures on it when we barely have time for counting/probability.",
                "There are review sessions and helpful recordings for the homeworks.\r\nThere did not seem to be much correlation between the different topics and felt like we jumped very randomly from one another.",
                "Strengths: psets are really fun (especially if you work with friends) and the ULAs / TA John are super helpful and patient. John also makes weekly problem session videos which are very helpful for studying for exams and working on psets\r\nWeaknesses: The course is weighted heavily on exams which can be hit or miss depending on the grading, but overall I think the course is well structured for learning with less emphasis on grades",
                "It was a great course. The only gripe I have is the last question of the final exam.",
                "CPSC 202 attempts to cover too much breadth with not enough depth. As Professor Kim noted often throughout the class, many of these topics (if not all of them) have entire semester-long classes devoted exclusively to them. I believe CPSC 202 could be improved if the topics covered were refined and given more time on the syllabus so we could develop a better understanding of a smaller selection of Discrete Math concepts.",
                "Very mediocre experience. The content of the course is alright, if not a bit superficial. You will be barely scratching the surface of a topic before moving on to the next. I dislike the vibe of the course in general. TAs are asked specifically not to answer anything that is *mildly* related to the psets. So during help hours it is most likely that your question will be left unanswered. Not that I don't like TAs as people, just that the course policy gives a strange vibe when you are trying to get help. Also you will find yourself bogged down in minor unimportant details - they will come after you for formatting issues, citation etc. - things that are relatively negligible. Generally, I wouldn't say it was an intellectually interesting experience.",
                "Strengths: teaching; weaknesses: TFs",
                "I thought the concepts that were taught were not too difficult, but the problems that we were supposed to solve were very specific, and I thought they didn't really contribute to us understanding the concepts overall.",

                "Problem set grading took a long time, slow feedback meant that student errors could take a long time to correct.",

                "In class lectures were pretty hard to follow, textbook wasn't great, found it far easier to learn the material from online resources than the traditional course method.",
                "Professor Kim is certainly the course's greatest strength. I think John was amazing too. Other than that, I feel like a digital form of the notes could be useful after each lecture so students who missed class don't have to rely on others or the video (which may not even exist for a given class) to be able to take notes.",
                "I thought Professor Kim was a great lecturer: he clearly cared a lot about his students and about teaching us the material in an engaging manner. I did think that the gap between the examples we got from the lecture, the problem sets, and the exam questions, however, was too big. We might benefit from more difficult or in-depth examples in class. The problem sessions by John, our course manager, were also really helpful.",
                "Material is well organized, but the lectures can be a bit dry and hard to keep up with.",
                "Strength: The combo of Professor Kim and our TF John.\r\nWeakness: The material either feels complex and intriguing or very dry. There is no in between.",
                "Good course overall, coverage of material was not too fast and not too slow",
                "Strengths: The course had a lot of breadth, covering many topics in the semester, and went in-depth enough for us to use the topics learned.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because of it's breadth, there'd almost always be some lectures where you'd learned what specific topic we were talking about, and those would be a little boring.",
                "Homework helpful sessions -> Good strength",
                "Professor Kim was did a very good job of teaching through multiple examples, which made it easier to grasp the topics being taught.",
                "One strength was the weekly problem sessions that helped with the problem sets and understanding of the content",
                "Professor kim made the class more entertaining than it could've been. I enjoyed the personal touches he added where he related what we were learning to stuff in the real world",
                "Strengths: TA John's help hours, in general the abundance of help hours, Theodore Kim's course policies re: the late policy, plugging us into other cs department opportunities. The tests and homeworks were appropriately difficult. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: John's TA'ing really did a lot to help many of us, with his weekly problem sessions being as important as the twice weekly lectures for me. If he weren't TA'ing in the future, it'd be important to have another person who can do those weekly sessions similarly well. This is the only real concern to me.",
                "this is probably unavoidable given time constraints, but I wish we had looked more closely at why certain strategies worked. proofs were sometimes explained very quickly",

                "I would recommend this course to any CS student. I tried taking MATH 244 instead of this twice and dropped it both times. I found MATH 244 extremely vague and unclear. It was totally not conducive to learning. With the choice of CPSC 202 or MATH 244 as a requirement for CS majors, I would definitely take 202. As soon as I took CPSC 202, I understood everything from beginning to end. Concepts that I found extremely bizarre and confusing in MATH 244 were extremely simple in CPSC 202. There is also much less proof based math in CPSC 202 than MATH 244. Professor Kim likely had a lot to do with the easy to follow nature of the course. He was a very clear and knowledgable professor with a lot of relevant experience from Pixar. He brought in very fun and interesting examples about how the math we learned could be applied in CS, like a Cars animation or the original Google search algorithm. So if you are a CS major: take CPSC 202 (please don't do MATH 244 unless you really like a lot of theoretical and proof based math)",

                "Provides a good basic introduction to proofs. Most of the material was taught at the surface level and many topics emphasized memorization over understanding. It seems the class tried to cover too much at once. I don't feel like I learned much, and would recommend considering MATH 244 if you need to fulfill the requirement for CS.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It is much better than MATH 244 (having experience with both), and Theodore Kim is a great professor. Really interesting dude.",
                "Yes this class was interesting but hard",
                "I would recommend taking the AMTH 244 course instead since introducing the mathematical concepts more formally I think would actually reduce some of the confusion that can come up in this course. The material is not so hard and is very useful and interesting, but the grading is not consistent or fair. Overall, I would neither strongly recommend nor discourage taking this course.",
                "It depends. If you have a math background, you might find it a bit tedious. If you're a computer science major, the material of this course will probably be useful for you later on. The course serves its purpose as a major requirement well, but isn't very interesting beyond that.",
                "Yes, especially if this is a prerequisite for other elective courses because it teaches many useful concepts that appear to be quite fundamental to future classes.",
                "Yes if you have to for the CS major. The midterm was pretty easy, the final was pretty hard.",
                "Sure! I took it only because I needed it as a requirement but it was still a great class. I'm not positive what context you would take this and it's not a requirement but I guess it is taught well and I learned a lot, so yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because as well as teaching you some fundamental math applications for CS, you learn its origin as well as some other enriching topics. Really liked the way that this course was taught.",
                "I would recommend this course. It is taught very clearly and the psets and exams were all very fair.",
                "Not unless you have to take it for the CS major.",
                "Only if 244 happens to not be a gut this semester. Otherwise, you might lose an A just because of how student-unfriendly the course is",
                "I don't know what use this class has for someone not looking into a CS track or needing it for a prerequisite, as I did. That being said, unlike some of the other CS classes you will take, this one is quite well taught and constructed, so if you want/need to take it, don't dread it.",
                "Yes, it's a CS requirement, and Professor Kim is a great lecturer.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course, though you are likely just taking because it is a requirement in the CS major. Professor Kim made the lectures enjoyable, and the TF John helped guide you through the problem sets with his walkthrough sessions. I never felt particularly stressed about the course until the final came around.",
                "Only if you have to",
                "Yes, especially if you are majoring in computer science",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend taking this class if it is taught by Professor Kim and you are interested in CS / discrete math",
                "Good professor. A little petty. TF is amazing. Do all your work.",
                "YES! Even if it's not required for you, if you plan on doing computer science or math in the future, it is great.",
                "I took this class because I am a prospective CS major, and either CPSC 202 or MATH 244 is required for the major. I almost took MATH 244 last semester (Spring 2021), but I dropped it after only a few classes because I could not follow the professor's thinking or teaching. The professor for MATH 244 this semester would probably be better than the one in Spring 2021 (again, for me, not necessarily for you), but it did not fit in my schedule. If you have to take one of CPSC 202 and MATH 244 for your major, I would recommend at least shopping MATH 244 even though I have not taken the class. CSPC 202 is not the move.",
                "No if you want to an intellectually interesting experience/are not particularly good at following directions *precisely*. Content is not difficult, but if you want a full learning experience go to Math 244. Very neutral course - not good, not terrible.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would take it if its required for your major. If not, it's a pretty basic math class but it doesn't relate too much to CS.",
                "For easy alternative to discrete math to fulfill CS requirements. You won't really learn much from the class. It's not too hard to get an A. The graders will annoy you with their nonsensical grading if you don't follow the exact format they have on their rubric or whatever. Still, the content is easy enough that you'll probably get an A and be too lazy to bother complaining about those points you lost because of the graders' incompetence.",
                "Yes 202>244",
                "202 is required for CS, that's why I took it. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it to non-majors, but I'm also not a huge fan of Math or the way this course was taught.",
                "For anyone interested in learning the mathematical tools necessary for computer science, yes! I thought it was a good time and the content was solid and easy to understand (for the most part).",
                "Yes, I felt like my logic and proof abilities improved.",
                "If you have a particular reason to learn discreet math or need it for the CPSC major.",
                "This is a fun course for anyone who enjoys thinking about logic and math.",
                "It's required for the CS major, and was an interesting course for sure. If you're interested in the math that powers our computers, take it! And Dr. Kim showed us many examples of the applications in his work with computer graphics.",
                "Yes, Kim is a good professor and lots of interesting ways to think about math",
                "I would recommend this course to people interested in math and logic. The course material isnt the most interesting, but you learn a lot from it that can be applied to many different fields.",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to gain a broad understanding of various math topics or are a CS major.",
                "As just a math class, probably not. Youre not going to learn a ton about any given subject to justify it i think. That being said, it isnt the worst pre req for the cs major.",
                "Would recommend! This course is fun, the material is really fun, and it's not as scary as math classes may be traditionally for those of us to whom math doesn't come easily. Kim is a great professor who's lectures are great teaching and are also full of humor and history tidbits that contextualize what we learn. And of course, what you learn specifically in regard to inductive reasoning and proofs is crucial for CS down the line.",
                "if they are interested in learning computer science or discrete math? I think it's a necessary foundational course",
                "Well it is required for the CS majors, Computing and the Arts, and CS certificate, and is a prerequisite for some CS classes.",
                "No, I wouldn't. Unless you HAVE to take it for a requirement (and even then, see if you can take Math 244 or otherwise be prepared for a difficult, unenjoyable course)"
