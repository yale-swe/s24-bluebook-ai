    "I develop my public speaking skill and imporve my way of buliding argument.",
    "I learned a lot about thinking in ways that are sometimes not intuitive and I learned to open my mind to new perspectives on how to live",
    "I was introduced to a brief overview of different fundamental schools of philosophical thought, and how their principles can be applied to different scenarios. I also learned how to write a philosophy paper, which is different from papers that would be written for other disciplines.",
    "I continued to improve upon my writing skills using excellent comments from the TA and notes I took on the material that was presented well by the lecturer.",
    "Knowledge of ethics and moral philosophy. The ability to think back and forth on the debatable issues. Insights into how we are judging ourselves or our actions currently.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course were the ability for us students to engage in discussion and the availability of the professor and the TA for any questions.\r\nThe strength might be its weakness in that for a seminar intro course a lot of time was delegated to students engaging in resolving their own pursuit of a philosophy rather then academic introduction of certain theories taking away time for others to engage in learning.",
    "A strength was the smaller class size and longer class discussions. The assignments were also thorough and I liked the readings (they werent too much either).",
    "this class itself is amazing and the TA and instructor also worked a lot to help this class become better",
    "I love how the teacher guided us to have topic-related discussions. But sometimes we waste our time on something vague.",
    "The course was very well organized and the class discussions went smoothly I just wish more people participated  in class",
    "The seminar style discussions of this class helps in solidifying knowledge of concepts and encourages participation from the class. However, it would be helpful to have a bit more of a lecture component to the course, as well as regularly scheduled breaks to keep the discussion engaging.",
    "I thought that the course was very well organized by topic and had a good number of assignments. I particularly liked the policies of requiring a reading question before each class and structuring discussion on the basis of those questions, as well as having an ungraded first assignment. An opportunity to rewrite the midterm essay was also quite helpful.\r\n\r\nI think the course could have benefited from handouts on each topic.",
    "This course could be improved by focusing more on certain concentrated issues for discussions, which makes the discussions more valuable. During the course, I felt like often the discussion was shifted before the original focus was fully explored."

    "Absolutely. I think it was a thorough and thoughtfully structured introduction to a critical area of philosophy. Feedback on essays was outstanding and I imagine would be quite helpful to a student learning to write a philosophy essay.",
    "Yes. For a learner who is new to moral philosophy, this course is a good place to start."
