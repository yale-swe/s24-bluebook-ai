                "I learned how to close read texts and how to use that close reading to develop tense, arguable, strong claims for my writing. I also learned a lot about how visions can give us an insight on what it means to be human.",
                "Analysis of important and difficult texts.",
                "My writing skills were extremely improved through feedback from Professor Soles and my TA. Additionally, my close reading skills grew exponentially.",
                "I developed my ability to write, think critically about texts, discuss texts, and bring sources in conversation with one another.",
                "I was able to learn to write in a more concise, clear way, as well as be able to learn to analyze works, from literature to artworks to movies, to greater depths than before.",
                "This course was a helpful introduction to the humanities at Yale. I gained valuable skills in close reading, analysis, and writing. This course was also helpful in showing me how a seminar is structured, how to time out and properly understand readings, and how to write a successful paper.",
                "I was definitely pushed out of my comfort zone in close reading and putting into conversation a variety of different styles of texts - books, poems, sutras, songs, movies etc that I would never think of drawing connections between. I also felt like my writing genuinely improved a lot",
                "I improved my abilities to critically read and analyze texts significantly. In particular, I found that this course was helpful in teaching me to recognize similarities between sources and be able to draw on a past source in order to improve a present reading. Additionally, I learned many insights about the role that visions play in the forming of an individual self. I also greatly expanded my conception of what a vision actually is -- for example, rather than limiting it to sort of a visual hallucination, I began to see visions in almost everything, including the text and the cosmos. I think this was a cool and interesting intellectual development, but it was also much more than that. Having a new understanding of visions was constructive in changing the way I read texts as well.",
                "This course taught me so much about how i perceive the world, as well as how others perceive the world. this was by far my favorite class of the semester",
                "Ive learned so many invaluable things that Ill find it hard to put into words.\r\nI think this course is an ideal introduction to the studies of the Humanities in all their diversity and wildness. From the Gita to Native American visions to Blake to Milton No visionary stone was left unturned.\r\nIn addition to drastically broadening my culture, this class taught me how to analyze a text truly, and how to push my thought process as far as possible. I also learned to communicate that thought process efficiently, and understand other reasonings. The discussions were always incredibly stimulating, and so were the readings as well as the assignments.\r\nAdditionally, I feel that Ive grown a lot as a writer as well, feeling less intimidated to tackle hard topics just for intellectual challenge .\r\nId take this class again in a heartbeat .",
                "I learned so much about how to close read a text and how to write an essay. I took away not just so much about each individual text but also their applications to my life and my worldview. Through reading texts and watching films from all different time periods, I learned many common themes about what it means to be human and found similar ideas across cultures and time."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course were Professor Soles and Jon, who both cared so much about their students and their wellbeing. The discussions we all had in class were also very beneficial and productive, and always helped me better understand the texts we read. A large weakness of this course, though, was the writing labs on Fridays. When we went to the Beinecke or YUAG to explore ancient texts or artworks, these labs felt useful and were very cool actually. However, sitting in the Poorvu for three hours on a Friday afternoon, talking about structures of our papers and approaches to close reading, was very, very unproductive, and felt like a waste of my time. On those occasions, I felt that we should have only needed to listen to an hour lecture. Of course, this lab component is still being developed, and I felt our students did a great job giving feedback on how to improve the lab, but from my experience it was still a great weakness of this course.",
                "Strengths- the syllabus had a lot of texts that kept me engaged. I think I was shown a variety of literature that is good foundational knowledge of the remainder of my Yale experience. \r\nWeaknesses- Class discussion time was very unstructured. Many times it felt like a mini lecture. I did not really understand the \"goal\" of the discussion or that week's reading. Because there was so much reading with such dense texts, I think it would have been helpful for there to be at least some guiding questions for that week. Or specific points to talk about. A lot of times the discussion was just flow of thought. The Friday SPGX sessions in the Poorvu Center were frankly a mess and a waste of time. I learned the same amount of writing material in a semester of Friday lab as I did in one week of English 114. Do not take this class if you are looking to learn to write. I think a common weekness, for both the lab and the class, was that there was not a \"point\" or a shared understanding of why we were doing what we were doing.",
                "My seminar was amazing. However, the writing lab on Fridays was a disappointment, to say the least. I signed up for this course partly because I thought I would be able to improve my writing by writing every week. That was not what the writing lab offered. Instead, they largely discussed writing in a theoretical sense and focused on a thesis formula for nearly the entire semester, even when we had been submitting assignments to our seminar professor. The only good and educational part of the lab was our field trips to the Beinecke and the YUAG.",
                "Strengths of this course include very interesting readings, an amazing professor, writing assignments that I and other students cared about, a strong sense of community (something I'd never experienced in a class until this),  a strong sense that my writing improved from this class, and plenty of time spent on the greater implications of the topics and themes discussed in class. The only weakness (and this has nothing to do with this class specifically, more the 6PGX suite as a whole) was the 3 hour writing lab every Friday. It sounded nice in theory but in practice it was never all that helpful, I think it's just too long to stay in one place Especially when most of the time no actual writing was being accomplished, only lecturing on writing and even this moved at a very slow pace. There were some weeks that the lab involved gallery visits, and I found these to be valuable, but when the labs were just 3 hours of listening to someone talk about writing at a very basic level they were not as valuable.",
                "It was a bit intimidating to enter a discussion in class, so maybe something could be changed about the class' structure to better facilitate everyone's involvement in the class (ex. Starting discussion off with an initial thought from everyone)",
                "The course was a great survey of different religious texts and one of the greatest strengths was definitely teaching us how to make connections across different belief systems. The only weakness was that sometimes discussions were somewhat circular and didn't lead to any \"bigger picture\" conclusion, but they were all still very interesting!",
                "Strengths: Prof. Soles and Jon are amazing at leading the seminar, they make even the most dense texts seem very interesting. The wide variety of texts were very fun to discuss and you get a lot of freedom in your papers which makes it interesting even as someone who dislikes writing. \r\nWeaknesses: The writing lab (not with Prof Soles) is not taught very well; the 3-hr sessions are tedious and could be used a lot better. It was very repetitive and what was taught was quite self-explanatory.",
                "I thought the visions portion of this course was excellent. I was very satisfied with both the content of the curriculum and the professor of the visions course. However, the structure of the Friday writing labs could be improved. I thought it was a very fun and open space to get to know fellow six pretty good members, and the collaborative nature of the lab should remain intact. But, adding more clear structure and direction to the lab could help improve student's engagement with the large group discussions and writing practices.",
                "only strengths on this class. I loved how after reading the text our professor would \"take the temperature of the room\" and we would just talk about the text we read while building upon our ideas. the building upon our own ideas was huge and prompted a lot of discoveries",
                "Strengths : diversity of the readings , content, topics , discussions , assignments, PROF SOLES AND JON\r\nWeaknesses: I feel that I havent benefitted from the writing lab at all.",
                "The Tuesday\/Thursday seminars were perfect, and I would not change anything about these. I only felt that the Friday labs were not super productive in accomplishing their goals of teaching us how to improve our writing."

                "I recommend the 6 Pretty Good Visions course on its own. However, with the lab component, this course loses its magic a little bit. If the lab improves next fall, then I highly recommend this course.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, it's been an amazing overall experience. My writing has improved, my ability to read analytically has improved, as has my overall appreciation for the humanities. The biggest selling point for this class, however, is the professor. Professor Soles is absolutely phenomenal, I can't think of a single class discussion, or a single bit of feedback on my writing, or a single assignment that I didn't find helpful. He has this uncanny ability to keep students engaged in their studies and conversations in his class, everything we did was just so interesting, and it was so clear that he cared about what he was teaching. Professor Soles also did much to foster a strong sense of community among Six Pretty Good Visions; my classmates from this seminar are some of my closest friends at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, as it was my favorite class of the semester. The works addressed during the course itself were interesting, and my peers and I were able to build solid relationships with one another.",
                "Absolutely yes with Prof Soles! Him and Jon are amazing and I will be taking classes with him in the future. I was intimidated by the fact that it's 1.5 writing credits as someone who genuinely dislikes writing but I am glad I took the class - I actually found the papers and discussions very fun and got very close with my classmates.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! I think the content and structure of this course (visions in particular) was one of my favorite learning experiences at Yale. It is also a particularly excellent first-year seminar -- while the content and readings are very challenging and at times unapproachable, the class itself feels very accessible, forgiving, and eases you into the texts extremely well. Additionally, the curriculum of the course is wonderfully diverse. I think it spans a broad variety of time periods, continents, and styles of writing in a very refreshing way. Yet, the theme of visions is very clear and evident across them all, so the texts don't feel disparate or cobbled together at all.",
                "100% yes, I have already started recommending it.",
                "Yes . If you can, please take it. Everything in this course is amazing !!! I also hope youll get as good a group of peers as I did. A small setting also builds friendships: not only between the students but also with the Professor and teaching fellow.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to other students but more importantly would recommend Professor Soles and our TA Jon who I felt were a huge part in making this class so enjoyable. Both of them care so much about the class and would constantly take time out of their busy days to meet with us and help us with our writing."
