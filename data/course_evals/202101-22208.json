Professor Renaud takes care not to give an uncritical presentation of this canon, yet at the same time explains the relevance and importance of the texts we read. My paper writing skills improved immensely.",

                "I really enjoyed the course!  The readings offered such fascinating glimpses into history and politics from many of the thinkers I've always heard about in previous history classes but never had the chance to read.  I've left the class with a much better understanding of the works and how they continue to bear relevance in our world today.",
                "The readings in DRST 006 are more dynamic, relevant, and fun than their predecessors in DRST 005. On the syllabus, The Federalist Papers, while understandable after the social contract theorists, felt irrelevant and unnecessary and could be removed. Correspondingly, both the Arendt and the Dubois readings would have benefited from a third seminar.",
                "Prof. Renaud is great. He has many insightful opinions on the course topics and is also good at leading discussion. The level of workload is appropriate. Cant think of any specific weaknesses."

It's a chance to broaden your thinking in ways you never knew were possible and place the works of so many great thinkers in conversation with each other.",
