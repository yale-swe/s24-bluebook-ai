I gained meaningful historical background on the revolutions and US involvement in Central America and really enjoyed reading history books on the border. I particularly enjoyed Hernndez's Migra! and Goodman's The Deportation Machine -- they actually made me think about pursuing a similar history project myself. I also enjoyed hearing the author's perspectives in our many Zoom visits.",
                "I gained a deeper appreciation for Latin American history and the interconnections between the region and the United States.",
                "I developed a philosophical argument to explain the border crisis. It feels comprehensive and hopeful. I learned to read books and to ask questions of interesting people."

                "I think the seminar meetings could have more structure; I would've loved for Prof. Grandin to send discussion questions on each book or offer his own perspective on the course readings.",
                "The readings are dense and require large amounts of time.",
                "It was incredible to study with Professor Grandin, a Pulitzer-Prize winning author and historian. He is brilliant and gives great lectures about the history of Central America and the U.S.-Mexico Border. He also invited several of the authors of our assigned readings to discuss their books with us and answer questions, which was a fantastic academic experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, Professor Grandin gave almost no feedback on assignments. He never gave me comments on my short or long paper, the two writing assignments in the course. I still learned a lot in the course though.",
                "The highlight of this class is getting the opportunity to talk to the authors of many of the books we read",
                "Strengths: Dr. Grandins huge knowledge and very insightful analysis, class discussion, guest speakers, interesting books\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not super cohesive since its a whole new book & often topic each week",
                "The syllabus was interesting, and Professor Grandin is fascinating. We met a lot of the authors whose books we read - which was insane. I appreciated the agency we got in choosing writing assignments and deadlines.\r\n\r\nThere wasnt very much student-led discussion or interaction between students. Every conversation was mediated through Professor Grandins perspective. Office hours were great - they should be mandatory, or encouraged."

                "Yes",
                "I didnt know much about the region and it was very interesting to learn. I wish we had spent a little more time getting acquainted with Central America before diving into specific books",
                "Yes! Dr. Grandin is so thoughtful, smart, and compelling, Id recommend the class to hear his perspectives alone. Also great guests speakers and VERY reasonable assignment load",
                "Yes. We read a book a week, wrote a reading response for each, and then spent our weekly class time asking questions. It was led entirely by student interest and arguments. We asked questions of most of the authors whose books we read - who came in to talk to us, including Grandin, whose books are brilliant. I feel competent and hopeful, which I appreciate."
