                "There is not a ton of feedback on your reading responses throughout the semester unless you ask for it, so it is hard to know how well you are doing with those assignments. That made the actual coursework feel very disconnected from the class itself, which was a strange feeling. \r\nAs far as strengths go, the seminars are well done, the material builds logically, and there is very little ambiguity regarding what you should know. Though most of the class is spent listening to lecture, Professor Kockelman always reserves some time for questions and discussion, which makes it still feel like a seminar. Overall it's a pretty barebones affair without many moving parts, which makes this a great low-stress 5th class.",
                "The strength of the class is definitely professor Kockelmans lectures. The weakness of the class is probably the homework assignments you have to do every week, because some of the readings are quite dense and difficult to understand.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lecture/seminar, relatively easy to follow; mid-semester feedback was on time\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sources used to incorporate ethnic and racial culture beyond \"language culture\" were stereotypical and misrepresentative at times; feedback and grading was vague (e.g. no explanation for grades, little suggestion for writing improvements, etc.)\r\n\r\nOne suggestion for improvement: Replace Basso with another work on Native language phenomena (e.g. oral storytelling practices, description of inanimate* objects as animate and living, etc.)\r\n*inanimate by English language speaking measures and understanding"

                "Yes- this is a great course for an introductory linguistics course for anthropology or linguistics majors",
                "Yes--a cool introduction to the study of anthropological linguistics",
                "I would! While it was not what I expected (I was expecting a class about how language influences culture/why cultural differences exist in language), it was a fascinating class in which I learned a lot. The class goes pretty deep into how different linguists structure the study of language and meaning-making, which was completely new to me and very interesting to think about. Later on, you get more into various interesting ways in which language is used in cultures, how language evolves, etc. Professor Kockelman is an absolutely brilliant lecturer who always makes class fun and interesting, while simultaneously explaining complex concepts in easy-to-grasp ways. You can tell he comes from a physical science/math background with the way he talks about many of the topics, which is a joy to listen to as a STEM major. He has definitely been one of my favorite lecturers I've ever had - and that's not even taking into account his laugh!",
