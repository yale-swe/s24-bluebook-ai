                "This course taught me a lot about how to write in terms of art, use special collections, and look at things through the lens of color. I learned a lot about color theory, applications, and history. The class was designed to be interactive, and we often had object viewing or making sessions that aided a lot in my understanding of our readings. The final project\/paper was also great because you could choose any topic related to color, meaning I could tailor my project to my own interests.",
                "Not only do you learn about the use of color in so many historical art forms, but you also get the opportunity to learn how pigments\/pastels are made (and make them yourself), and the historical and cultural implications surrounding art and color. You learn the ins and outs of Yale's extensive special collections and how to request objects for your own personal use and research. This class was amazing, by far my favorite of the semester (coming from a STEM major).",
                "The course included a lot of opportunities for personal exploration in order to delve deeper into the wide span of topics covered in the class. I enjoyed the opportunity to conduct my own research into the specific topics that most appealed to me, while also gaining a valuable oversight of a variety of topics from the many experts that were introduced to explain them.",
                "I learned about the history of color in art, especially with relation to pigments and pigment science. I also got a broad overview of the special collections at Yale and the role of conservators."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths - The class was well structured with an appropriate amount of assignments and readings to accompany the course. I greatly enjoyed every class we had, and it was clear that a lot of effort was put into organizing each session. You get to meet a wide array of people who are experts in their fields, so anyone taking this class will find that at least one unit resonates with them. Jae and Cindy were wonderful professors and made it clear that they wanted this course to be as engaging and informative as possible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Very, very few. The only obstacle was that the deadlines regarding required discussion posts and replies could have been spaced out better, rather than multiple being due on the same date. Jae and Cindy were cognizant of this and made sure to adjust deadlines and requirements once they understood that it wasn't working, which is a strength in and of itself.",
                "Strengths: The collections we got to experience. You go to the Medical Library, Beinecke, Arts Library, Sterling, YUAG, British Art Center, Lewis Walpole Library, and much much more. We even met the person who essentially created Yale blue. Jae and Cindy are amazingthey want you to succeed and push you toward that. The organization of the class was really well done and facilitates learning and interpretation rather than a rigid structure. The workload is perfectly manageable and allows for a lot of fun. Weaknesses: Virtually none. I believe this was the first time this specific seminar was taught, which is incredibly surprising to me. I wish that we were pushed more to speak up and contribute to the discussion. Art is interpretive, which is maybe something I didn't was stressed enough, and the class kind of began slow.",
                "I believe that strengths of this class were in the number of unique experiences it offered. This class was completely different from any of my other classes. Every class was something new, whether it was visiting another one of the special collections, getting the opportunity to learn from a variety of professionals in art history and related fields, or the opportunity to try hands-on experiments to connect with my learning, I was always excited for every class. One improvement could just be to work out a schedule that spreads out assignments more over the course of the semester, because I think the layout of the deadlines could lead to a buildup of work towards the end of the semester, but overall this was not a major problem in my opinion.",
                "This class was an engaging overview of the field of art history, especially from the viewpoint of a conservator. Being able to see all of the Yale special collections was fascinating, and I now feel a lot more comfortable using library resources at Yale. The workload was rarely stressful but I always felt it was very relevant to the learning.\r\n\r\nSometime the topics felt disconnected week to week. I would have appreciated more continuity between parts of the class. I feel like it would have been easier to understand the class material in its historical context if the class was organized chronologically."

I found the making sessions to be especially engaging, and I would recommend this course to anyone who likes hands on learning. I looked forward to every class because we always did something totally new. Not to mention Jae and Cindy are absolutely wonderful.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone! It doesn't matter whether or not you are interested in art\/art history, as there is definitely something in this class that will pique your interest. There's a lot of fun and engaging exercises built into the class that are highly enjoyable.",
                "Yes most definitely! It was probably my favorite class of this semester. I learned a lot and the class time itself gave me many great experiences  making our own pastels, many museum and special collections exhibits, a field trip, and great class discussions to name a few.",
                "YES! Take this course if you are a first-year, it is what Yale is all about: the collections, the people (This is coming from a STEM Major). I wouldn't be surprised if this is an incredibly competitive seminar in the coming yearsas it is truly a must-take class. You learn so much and have an incredible time doing it. If you are interested in getting a deeper grasp on just the richness of Yale and the importance of color (in all forms) then this class is for you.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students interested in learning more about the special collections available at Yale, how to access them, and how to preform further research within special collections request system. The class was also just a really exciting and interesting way to learn these universal skills while getting to investigate color and its role in art and design.",
                "I would recommend this course to any first-semester student who is looking to explore what Yale has to offer in its special collections. I would not think of the course as a traditional art history course; the course wasn't about memorizing dates or facts. Instead, it gave me a greater appreciation for art and for art at Yale."
