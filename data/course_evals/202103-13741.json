                "I have learned how to think cross-media wise and much more about different movements of black cultural production in the US.",
                "I learned nothing of substance in this classall I gained was the fact of having read some really great texts and watched two great films. A class where I could have just read what's on the syllabus on my own and not wasted my time with the class itself.",
                "I really enjoyed the content of this course. We read so many works by Black women that I've wanted to read for a long time. I really appreciated that we read novels and poetry and things that were really engaging and relatively easy to follow instead of only reading theoretical texts. I liked that we were analyzing the devices and the themes of the texts in the larger context of black feminism and theorysometimes literary analysis on its own can feel very abstract and disconnected for me personally. Overall, I'm really grateful I had the opportunity to take this course and be exposed to this content because it was really touching for me personally, and it's inspired me to potentially pursue some of the themes we studied in my thesis next year.",
                "I learned a lot about social movement history, specifically black feminist history and the nuances of the black liberation movement and how it interacted with second wave feminism. I learned what cultural production is! Very exciting! I also better grasped how to read and approach denser theory. Through our class discussions, readings and assignments I felt I really learned how to bring literature and art together with theory, which I really appreciated."

                "The syllabus was wonderful and the class discussions were always interesting. I wish there was more visual art on the syllabus! And maybe a fieldtrip (maybe in non-covid times) to an exhibition or something?",
                "I appreciated the lack of punitive measures (response papers, attendance) to this class. However, the lack of structure seemed disproportionate to the harshness of grading. We had to nag the professor for basic outlines and guidelines for the assignments and she was also atrocious at responding to emails to meet and discuss.",
                "The materials on the syllabus themselves were really compelling. But overall, the course was very weak all around. For personal reasons, our professor was really out of touch and uncommunicative over the course of the semester, and our seminar discussions were really disorganized and sometimes ignored entire texts. That made it really, really hard for me to have any investment in the course. We received I think the course has great potential to be successful, either at a time when our professor isn't going through a crisis or if it's taught by someone else.",
                "I definitely really loved the format of reading the primary sourcesnovels, autobiographies, poetry, filmsin addition to theoretical texts. It was very helpful because reading the primary text strengthened my understanding of the theory and the theory strengthened my understanding of the primary text. It's usually much harder to understand theory on its own, and I probably gained a much deeper understanding of each primary text than I would have reading it on its own without the theory to follow. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were mostly logistical for me. The main one was keeping up with who would be doing weekly presentations. There were a few times where Jocelyn forgot about people's presentations and we as students didn't mention it to her because we assumed she would have said something about them. This wasn't a huge deal at all, just something that could have made things a bit smoother. \r\n\r\nOne other potential improvement could be with the final paper. Of course, Jocelyn has been dealing with a family emergency so I'm not thinking about the effects of that. I'm mainly thinking that when I was writing the final paper, I realized I could have used a bit more practice or discussion about it. The final paper asked us to write our own theory about black women's cultural production or expand on an existing one, and I had never done that before. I think giving us more examples or doing a class session where we come up with example ideas/thesis statements together as a class or individually and talk about them would have definitely helped with writing the paper and anxiety about writing it.",
                "Strengths include a warm and encouraging class environment and an expansive reading/watching list with pairings that felt very intentional and fruitful. Lots of cross medium conversation which was exciting."

If it were a lecture with discussion sections, I feel like I would've gotten more out of it. Also, the content was spread so thin that we never substantially delved into any one piece of work, art, and literature.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in the works of Black women authors like Toni Morrison and Audre Lorde and black feminist theory. The primary texts we looked at like Toni Morrison's Sula, Audre Lorde's Zami, and Cheryl Dunye's film The Watermelon Woman\" are all works that I've begun to cherish even more because of this class and the theory-based texts we read with each of these works were really fascinating.",
