I learned about the evolution of viruses and other infectious disease, and I gained knowledge about antibiotic resistance and the mechanisms behind the resistance of infectious diseases towards other medications, such as AZT resistance in HIV. I gained critical thinking skills in applying concepts that I have learned in class and in discussion section during the exams, in which problems were application, and not memorization, based.",
                "I developed a good baseline understanding of how pathogens and parasites interact with their hosts, and their impact on the individual, community, and ecosystem level. I also learned about how both the host and parasite evolve. With all of the focus on infectious diseases because of covid, I feel like I am a lot more equipped to understand what people are talking about and to spot misinformation after taking this class.

                "A strength is definitely how many examples were given while we learned new concepts. A weakness would be the lack of practice of application with the content we had prior to the test. Section was a great spot for this but maybe some think-pair-share type questions in lecture immediately following the teaching of a new concept would be good.",
                "weakness - grading scheme was not clear",
                "Strengths: \r\n- I really appreciated the teaching team's enthusiasm for this material. It was so clear how much Profs. Turner and Ezenwa care about these topics and want us to enjoy what we are learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- No practice problems/study guides for exams - this made it really difficult to know what kinds of questions we should be prepared to answer. Especially since the emphasis in class was to understand the general concepts, whereas exams sometimes asked for very specific answers. \r\n- With so few assignments/grades, it was really hard to know how we are doing in the class or bounce back after a lower grade. \r\n- Regular office hours / review sessions for the midterms would have been really helpful! The review in section often felt unproductive, since many of us had questions we couldn't ask",
                "Strengths is interesting content. Weaknesses are the sections that are loosely tied to the material and the exams were super difficult.",
                "This course was great! I really enjoyed the lectures and felt that they were really well complemented by the discussion sections. The material was interesting (and really topical) and it felt like a good mix of learning new statistical/theoretical models and reinforcing ecological/evolutionary ideas from other classes too.",
                "Well structured, provides an overview of a large field with decent depth in every lecture. The teaching team are all enthusiastic.",
                "Strengths:\r\nProf. Ezenwa is an excellent lecturer and makes her material accessible. She also pauses a lot for questions and is super cool.\r\nThe discussion sections are super interesting and engaging (at least with TA Noah Houpt who ROCKS)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nProf. Turner's lecture style is more disorganized than Prof. Ezenwa's and it is as if he hasn't looked at his slides since the last time he taught the course. He is a less engaging lecturer and the information he shared was in general less interesting. \r\nSpillover, while a good book, seems unnecessary reading. \r\nThe final paper was a huge bummer to write and didn't feel like a good application of the knowledge I obtained in the course.",
                "The strength of this course was the approachable nature of the lectures. The lectures were very well designed, and the content was taught well. The speed of the lectures and the rate at which content was covered was appropriate considering the difficulty of the material, and the discussion sections were well designed to focus on the paper that students read prior to coming to discussion section. A weakness of this course is the lack of problem sets. Although the lack of problem sets helps reduce the overall workload of the course and allows students to focus more on reading for discussion section and preparing for exams, the lack of problem sets does not enable students to learn how to accurately apply knowledge learned in class through problems. This leads to greater difficulty in taking the exam. Exam II, when compared to Exam I, was significantly more difficult and instead of testing the overall concepts taught in lecture, it tested much more specific concepts that students were not expecting to be tested on at that minute level.",
                "Strengths: Both lecturers were amazing and I found their lectures really engaging. They both made me excited to come to class. I feel like I learned a lot in this course, and I like how they didnt really focus on any one parasite but really emphasized the patterns common to infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I dont think there were many weaknesses, maybe just that there could be a little more clarity in terms of what would be on the exams. I feel like I was often a little unsure of what I was expected to know going into the midterms, and I didnt realize that guest lectures would be covered until fairly late in the class.",
                "Expectations for exams and papers were not very clearly communicated",
                "The content of this course was fascinating (and especially timely)!  I learned about the basics of pathogen spread and diseases, so much of which I had never even thought about before.  However, midterms were frustrating since we were given no preparation, sample tests, homework, or review guides prior to taking them.  It was difficult to study for exams solely from lecture slides and my own notes."

                "Yes - this course is great! The material is really interesting and it's presented in ways that are digestible and thought-provoking.",
                "I would highly recommend this to any student. As a non-E&EB student, I believe that the material was taught well enough that I could understand it. The course material is comprehensive and provides a great introduction to the field. Having this perspective towards infectious disease is eye-opening in terms of how many more options it creates for disease control, and it also expanded my understanding of the importance of parasites in the evolution of life. The workload is just reading a book chapter and paper a week, studying for midterms, and writing a paper at the end, very manageable. The professors and TAs were also very enthusiastic, which made the course more enjoyable.",
                "Yes- if you are interesting in disease and haven't developed a deep understanding already, this course is super fascinating and has breadth and depth. I left feeling like I had learned a lot- specifically knowledge that was applicable to my species diversity and other evo devo courses.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The content taught during lectures was very interesting and it was taught in a way that made the material more comprehensible and understandable for the students. The discussion sections were journal-club style, in which one paper was discussed per week, which students read prior to coming to the discussion sections. I found this format of sections not only to be interesting, but also helpful in applying knowledge that we learned in class through reading more in the primary published literature. The final paper assignment allowed students to deeply delve into a specific infectious disease, and to explore the ecology and evolutionary biology concepts that were taught in class. I think the class is also applicable to non-STEM majors, as the difficulty and workload of the class make it an appropriate class for students without a strong STEM background.",
                "Yes! I think that infectious diseases are unfortunately becoming increasingly important, so having a basic understanding of how they work is really helpful. This class doesnt teach you too many specifics about any one disease/parasite, but instead you learn about how they work more broadly and how they evolve. I think taking an evolutionary perspective helped me understand that patterns common to infectious diseases, and even think about how things will look in the future which has felt really relevant to me especially right now.",
                "Yes! Very interesting",
                "While the material was interesting, I would probably warn students about the fact that there are some flaws that could negatively impact one's grades/performance within the class.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes!  It's a great course that opens your eyes to the world of pathogens.  In a post-pandemic world, it also gives you helpful perspective into our increasingly complex relationship with nature.",
                "Though Professors Turner and Ezenwa brought a lot of interesting material to the course and delivered lectures that were indeed engaging, I'm not sure I would recommend taking the course for a grade for two primary reasons: grade scheme and organization. (If one isn't taking the course for a grade, then I would indeed recommend, see below.) Though the course appeared to have been billed in previous reviews as a gut, it certainly is not from a grading perspective; in fact, for a 200-level E&EB course, the class presented an academic challenge that was surprising  and not because of the difficulty of the content. A number of factors, including a grade structure that leaves little room for any kind of feedback, a lack of clarity on certain key concepts that led to class-wide confusion on exams, as well as a fairly shocking lack of any kind of curve (despite a midterm distribution that was certainly not toward the upper end of what I have seen at Yale), make this course unnecessarily difficult to read in terms of what one might come away with. I took the course Credit-D, and I'd certainly caution against those (including students in biology majors) thinking that this course is as straightforward as the syllabus makes it seem. The grade distributions that the professors make available from past years cannot possibly be representative of what the final distribution looked like this year, and unless they make changes to the way the course is graded, be forewarned: it will not be an easy (or at least straightforward) A.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the presentation of material certainly suffered from organizational issues. Concepts that seemed logical to pair together or would have flowed into or from each other in natural ways were separated into distant parts of the course. Lecture material tried to balance background from peer-reviewed work and specific experimental or observational examples with theoretical concepts, but these lines were often blurred such that it became difficult to understand what material was considered important knowledge for class assessments.\r\n\r\nThat said, Professors Turner and Ezenwa do really give absorbing lectures on topics of crucial importance for the past, present, and future of biology (from ecology to molecular bio) and for global public health. I would certainly recommend the course from a content-based standpoint; it will likely make a good fifth class if one plans on using a Credit-D (or if the grade structure is brought closer to the standard of most other Yale courses). Certainly, give it consideration if infectious diseases or even broader precepts of ecology or evolutionary biology are topics of interest, and keep an eye on how the structure of the course might otherwise have changed."
