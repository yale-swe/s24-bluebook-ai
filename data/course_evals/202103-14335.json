I gained understanding of the development of political theories across time, how they related to each other, and how they provide insight to our current era.",
                "I learned how to write a focused essay in response to historical and political events and ideas and how to carefully read dense text in order to prepare for seminar discussions. I also gained an overview of classical and Roman history that served to contextualize the literature and philosophy that I was reading in the rest of Directed Studies."

                "I generally think that the set of texts we read was pretty good: it was a good mix of political philosophy and political history. I also really enjoyed our section - we consistently had really good, deep discussions about core topics in the texts. A couple areas for improvement, though: I think the H+P lectures were generally the weakest out of the three DS tracks. While there were certainly excellent ones, I walked out of more than a few of them not feeling like I'd learned or gained anything new. Second, while it's the expected nature of DS to rush through lots of texts, the last couple of weeks in particular felt really rushed (we covered three different political philosophers in the final three section meetings). I think the course would end on a stronger note if the last part were cut back a little bit.",
                "The content was ok, but some of the context of the readings was ignored. I feel like the acknowledgement of racism or slavery could have gone a lot further than blatantly trying to ignore it. In addition, debates in which we actively try to justify the raping of women -- probably not the best idea! Also, some of the students talk too much in the class -- i think this happens overall in each section, but it's definitely a problem. I understand some people have a lot to say but there's definitely better ways to put them.",
                "I loved this section of DS! Professor Smith is so smart and his views on all of the texts educated me so much. He really taught us how to evaluate these texts from an equally historical and political perspective. I was never a huge fan of political science, and Professor Smith really changed that!",
                "The course covers a lot of central material in the political theories of ancient civilizations, yet not enough attention is given to the actual history.",
                "I thought the course was extremely strong. While there were certainly texts that I found more engaging than others, each one, in hindsight, added something unique to the course: sometimes I got lost in the historical details of a certain author, but discussing their broader visions of history alongside the individual anecdotes always brought the learning to life for me.",
                "There were times when it was difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of the historical context of the texts purely from the historical texts themselves, and I think it would have been helpful to have a slightly more straightforward explanation of the chronology and of key figures."

Prof. Smith is a true expert in so many of the authors and topics we covered this term, and he did a really excellent job of managing our class discussions so that everyone was heard from while simultaneously adding his own really helpful insights. I consistently looked forward to coming to this class and feel like I learned a lot. Do be prepared for the reading load, though: to me, the load was by far the heaviest in H+P (relative to the other DS tracks).",

                "I would fully recommend this course. It was my favorite academic experience of the semester, and the readings were amazing.",
                "I certainly would. I found the intersection of history and politics that the course explores quite profound to consider, I loved most of the readings, and my writing improved to boot.",
                "I would recommend this course. It definitely felt like the biggest challenge of the three Directed Studies sections, both in terms of the level and quantity of the readings, and because of the tasks presented in the papers. However, it was definitely a rewarding and essential component of my experience throughout the first semester of DS."
