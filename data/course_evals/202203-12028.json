However, my most important takeaway from the class was the joy of identifying trees and being able to (relatively) read the natural landscape around me.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of the course were the field trips. I learned the most when we were out in the field, typically a forest, and Kealoha or Janey were teaching us about the landscape's history or processes. There was an organic informality, where any of us students could walk about to Kealoha or Janey and ask questions about what we were seeing, or why something is the way it is. I also loved learning to identify trees!! The course felt relaxed and Kealoha and Janey were always super flexible and accommodating. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of the class was the in-class component on Tuesdays. Us students were meant to lead discussion, and it typically ended up being pretty low energy and I didn't get much out of the papers. \r\n\r\nThe Thursday field trips really made the class.",
                "I thought the course was really fun, especially the field trips. I thought the Tuesday discussions occasionally dragged, but were often about pretty useful/relevant content so I understand why they were included. No real recommendations for how the course can be improved, I thought it was pretty well organized. The iNaturalist project was fun, but I feel like it was difficult writing a useful report from the project. One other thing I would have appreciated is more experience/lessons doing statistical analysis of experiments.",
                "The field trips were definitely the best part of the course. Of course, that's the main point. But I definitely gained actual experience with field science and feel really confident with my abilities moving forward.",
                "Discussion class is very long and hard to keep the ball rolling",
                "strength: prof and TA were super nice and helpful, we had lab/field components every Thursday which was very fun, low workload, lab reports were actually quite fun to write since you actually see patterns from the data you collected and draw knowledge from the readings\r\nweakneas: could have gave us a brief intro in anthropod and tree identification instead of giving us a book to investigate during lab/field sessions"

                "I would say yes. The chance to go outside every week for class was really wonderful, and the iNaturalist project and other lab reports (especially about sugar maples) were super interesting and I got a lot out of them. There were other parts of the class, like the in-class part, which I felt faltered.",
                "It's a great way to get outside and explore New Haven while still feeling productive. The skills I learned didn't feel particularly applicable to my interests, but if you're interested in field work or ecology it's definitely a great class, and generally a great option to fulfill the lab requirement for the EVST B.S. program.",
                "I definitely would, because it's always nice to learn about science by doing science, rather than reading about it. The discussions were often dry and felt pretty redundant after the second week, but the times that we were in the field or in the lab were really fantastic and made up for it.",
