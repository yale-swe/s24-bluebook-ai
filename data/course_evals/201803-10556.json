    "really enjoyed printmaking itself but the pace of the class was super super slow which could be frustrating.  this was most likely due to the large size of the class and the limited space in the print shop, but other than that it was overall a super fun class!",
    "The projects were open-ended which I enjoyed. I think just by virtue of timing, the schedule got a bit disorganized by the end, but Alex's flexibility more than made up for that.",
    "studio to be open longer outside of class.",
    "there werent enough screens and we werent allowed into the printshop as undergrads outside of monitor hours which make everything much more challenging.",
    "The class was an incredible way of learning how to make prints, but I found that at times it moved a bit slow, which meant that the final week ended up having to be a bit rushed.",
    "Strengths: learning a variety of techniques with a patient professor and lots of physical resources at your disposal. Crits are fun and low stress. Weaknesses: not a lot was asked of us in terms of ideation or expanding on our work critiques were useful, but we ran out of time to complete our final projects."
