Professor Kraus is rigorous and thoughtful, and certainly sets a high standard for the classroom every day.",

The secondary literature helped me think about the big themes and the study of the poem's reception brought on interesting discussions of the different repurposing of the material. Professor Kraus also showed us related artworks, artifacts and manuscripts and the visual aspect helped ground the discussion about some topics that are ancient and/or foreign."

Compared to the introductory level Latin class, I enjoyed the incorporation of the poetic interpretation aspect of the class. The secondary literature helped me think about the big themes and the study of the poem's reception brought on interesting discussions of the different repurposing of the material. Professor Kraus also showed us related artworks, artifacts and manuscripts and the visual aspect helped ground the discussion about some topics that are ancient and/or foreign. The relative small size of the class helps one get to know the other students and creates a familiar, relaxed atmosphere. Overall it has been a good time!"
