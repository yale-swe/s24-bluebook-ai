Successful examples have historically contained these subjects covered in the course. \r\nWe also learned a fair bit of Rust for the programming assignment. The assignments contained topics about kernel hacking and deep neural networks which focused on communication between different systems.",

                "Strengths: Lectures (see \"Recommend?\" evaluation -> \"The most important learning I did in this course...\"). Professor Zhong is a funny, wise, and incredibly knowledgable guy, truly a gem. Getting to learn Rust. Getting more experience with kernel development.\r\nWeaknesses: Basically no formal instruction on psets, so need to hound Guojun (TA) for help every week. Maybe having more office hours and/or more TAs would help?",
                "The course lectures are great and offer valuable insight into the development of computer systems. It introduces many useful resources for reading and learning and Professor Zhong is a great lecturer. There was not a single lecture where I did not come out having learned a new piece of knowledge or was disengaged.\r\n\r\nA weakness I experienced throughout the course is the lack of feedback on assignments. There is only one teaching assistant for the course and he seemed to be busy with his own work during the 1 hour allocated for office hours so it was difficult to get assistance with the programming assignments. There are also no ULAs which can help, but the silver lining is that this course teaches you to dive into very low-level code and documentation. I spent hours browsing the Linux source code to complete the assignments.",
                "The assignments were quite difficult, but this is the purpose of this course. \r\nMaybe, lectures could include more info about assignment-related topics like the DNN, to be able to better tackle them, if someone has no prior experience with a specific topic."

                "Only if you are willing to put in the grind. This course is to 323 what 323 is to high school intro to scratch. The actual programming is not so hard, but prepare to spend hours pouring over linux blogs from 10 years ago trying to figure out how to do one specific thing. Unlike basically every other CS class at yale you are doing something which is not widely done (linux kernel in rust) and so it is painful trying to look stuff up. There are no stack overflows, no tutorials no nothing. Everything you have to lookup how to do it in c, then figure out how to make that into rust. Its a nightmare, but the projects themselves are super interesting. Overall an excellent course, but only if you are willing to put in a huge grind.",
                "The most important learning I did in this course for sure came from the lectures. We delved into anthropology, cognitive science, psychology, number theory, history, engineering, business, politics, biology, philosophy, parenting, and so much more. Truly an amazing peek into the foundations of modern computer science (i.e. logic, computing, computers, and operating systems) as well as an overview of the historical and interpersonal context in which these foundations were formed. I strongly advocated to Prof Zhong that the lecture portion of this class be offered as an intro CS course, because I think this is important for all CS majors (and honestly even non-CS majors) to know. Also, learned a good amount about kernel development, Rust, and virtual machines (QEMU) from ChatGPT and Google.",
                "I highly recommend this course for students looking for a way to learn more about history of operating systems and the tried and tested principles for system design. It's not a course where you would really be learning about technical things like load balancers but more about observations about what works and what didn't in the history of system design.",
                "I would recommend. The workload is manageable, especially if you can start psets 1 and 2 early, and you learn about Rust, Linux Kernel hacking, and other systems programming/low level driver details which are all really cool."
