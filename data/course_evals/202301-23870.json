                "This class was a wonderful introduction into Philosophy from Descartes to the 20th century. Great for learning how to write a academic philosophy essay.",

                "Familiarity with several influential philosophers who dealt with various areas of philosophy including metaphysics, the self, ethics and morality, skepticism, empiricism, rationalism, the influence of science on early modern philosophy, philosophy & religion and much more. Learning how to analyze philosophy, but even more importantly training in how to think and phrase like a philosopher or logician."

                "Strengths- Great instruction\r\nWeakness- too heavy on pre-Kantian philosophers",
                "The strengths of this course is the level of detail devoted to particular passages of philosophical text and their importance not only in the rest of the work but in the Western philosophical tradition as a whole. Additionally, I greatly benefitted from the various different authors and subjects discussed in what we read. However, I feel that some of the works were rushed through or that metaphysics was unduly emphasized during the first half of the semester.",
                "The texts were thought-provoking and would affect my way of processing the world in the future. Professor Franks was a phenomenal instructor. He is incredibly knowledgeable and is an expert on second semester philosophers including Kant and other complex philosophers. He instructs the class in such a way that makes you feel that youve gotten as much as possible out of the texts given their complexity and the time-constraint of the DS curriculum. His teaching style lends itself to more lecturing than some of my other sections, but I found it fitting given the complexity of the material and found that the proceeding class discussions and occasional group-exercises were better thanks to this approach."

                "Yes! Most definitely",
                "100% would recommend. Franks is a wonderful Professor",
                "I would definitely recommend this course as a good continuation of first-semester philosophy to any Directed Studies student, but I would stress that the first half of the course is a definite switch from the sort of reading one grows accustomed to from first semester Directed Studies. The student should make sure he\/she is willing to commit the time and energy needed to do well in the course, but if he\/she can do so then it is a very rewarding experience.",
                "If you enjoyed DS first semester - absolutely! DS was an eye-opening, transformative experience for me and this philosophy section was the highlight of my semester. I feel so fortunate to have been in Professor Frankss class."
