                "I learned how to recognize and distinguish between various chromatic chords. I also developed the skills of being able to sightread and perform complex rhythms and time signatures.",
                "This is really mostly a chord analysis class -- as it existed this semester, the majority of time was spent on learning how to hear and identify chord progressions including functional chromatic chords, mostly using a classical lens but also incorporating significant elements of pop analysis and other critiques of the \"classical\" approach. The content is really valuable for starting to hear more complex chord changes in compositions, and the idea of chord function (in the sense of dominant\/subdominant\/Roman numeral function\/etc.) is emphasized throughout. In addition to chord analysis and transcription, there is also a bit of sight singing (melodic and rhythmic), pop and rap analysis (lyrics and chord loops), a bit of melody harmonization (also chord-function based), and improvisation.",
                "Improved ability to identify chord progressions, improved ability to write harmonic chords and do melodic improvisation, improved ability to transcribe pop music and identify chromatic chords, learned about diminished chords, analysis of a variety of genres including rap, pop, classical, and even film scores, sight reading complicated rhythms (triplets, quadruplets, and when the top line and bottom line have different time signatures).",
                "I developed my aural skills (as the course name suggests) and learned to listen for more complex harmonies, as well as learning chord functions in a progression and a lot of new terminology to describe these harmonies.",
                "Different types of chords and how to listen for them in chord progressions.",
                "Basic music theory knowledge dictation, rhythm (particularly 2:3 and 3:4 polyrhythms), chord functions (particularly augmented 6 and dim\/half dim 7), and melody harmonization",
                "I learned how to identify chromatic chords (diminished, tritone substitution, secondary dominant, etc.) by ear, as well as how to notate them in Roman numeral analysis."

                "So many strengths- we learn a lot and practice important musicianship skills, and the environment is very supportive and stress-free. \r\nCan't really think of any weaknesses",
                "Strengths: Nate is so incredibly knowledgeable about music and is able to play, hear, and consider any points brought up right on the spot in high detail. The course format is pretty friendly, with a homework schedule designed in part with students, and it feels like the emphasis is on doing your best to learn complicated chord concepts without the stress of rigid benchmarks necessitated by other classes. The content is incredibly valuable for hearing music with a more critical ear and understanding how chord progressions are put together.",
                "Professor Adam is an incredible professor. The class was rigorous but also was not super stressful. He was able to create one of the best learning environments for music and kept the class super enjoyable. No weaknesses.",
                "A great strength of the course is that due to the small class size and that this was the first semester it was offered, we were able to take time to not only go over what was on the agenda, but also to change the agenda based on what the class was most interested in learning about, and we also were able to take the time to answer everyone's questions and delve deeply into various topics. On the flip side, this sometimes made the class a little unstructured, and since people in the class were at different levels, some students had more knowledge and skills of the topic that made it hard to keep up with for someone who wasn't on the same level. This could be improved by just assuming a less knowledge (though still assuming everyone has the knowledge learned from the prerequisite course).",
                "This course facilitated a welcoming learning environment where I felt comfortable singing, expressing my ideas, and making mistakes. It covered a large range of chromatic chords, however, and I would have appreciated more listening examples. At times the course felt a bit unstructured and I did not know what the lessons were building towards.  I would have liked to do more singing in class!"

The atmosphere was quite collaborative and the content (really chord function-based) is valuable for a variety of musical contexts.",
                "Take this course if you are interested in learning music theory and developing aural skills without the stress. This class is both rigorous and you learn a lot but its also not stressful.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. As a musician, I hear chords and harmonies all the time, but this course was able to organize that information so I could finally understand it and be able to describe it. Since it was a smaller class and higher level, it also allowed for me to talk and learn about more interesting topics and music.",
                "Yes! Im a STEM major who took this as an interest class and I loved it. A music background would be helpful though.",
                "Yes, if you are looking to expand upon your music theory knowledge, particularly ear training\/dictation",
                "Yes! Prof. Adam is wonderful and makes learning this material so fun. Plus, if you are a musician or composer, learning about chromatic chords is essential."
