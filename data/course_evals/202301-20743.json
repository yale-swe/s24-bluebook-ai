It is a great course for anyone looking for an engaging yet relaxed studio environment. I felt that due to the set up of the course, such as our scheduled collection visits and guest lecturers, I didn't produce as much as I would've liked, but the projects I did complete were worth while.",

Not as much printmaking practice as I expectedeach assignment was risograph-based, which I was surprised by (I don't think this was clearly stated in the syllabus). Zine-heavy, which is fine but also not entirely expected."
