It is a great course for anyone looking for an engaging yet relaxed studio environment. I felt that due to the set up of the course, such as our scheduled collection visits and guest lecturers, I didn't produce as much as I would've liked, but the projects I did complete were worth while.",
                "I really enjoyed the studio days and how collaborative this class was, I was able to gain a great technical skill set with risograph printing and photoshop, and classmates were always ready to help thanks to our collaborative projects.",
                "Strengths: a lot of materials to use, free to use the risograph, a very open and relaxed environment \r\n\r\nI think perhaps more direction on mixing colours on the Riso would be great.",
                "I loved the community that developed in this class. However, there wasn't a lot of clear and direct instruction or guidance on how to do various techniquesstudents very much helped each other out.",
                "The class is extremely interesting and the class critiques are very helpful. However, I wish we had learned a larger range of techniques in publishing.",
                "Strengths: Enthusiastic instructor. Engaged group of students. Print shop environment is conducive to in-class work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Bit of a lack of structure. Not as much printmaking practice as I expectedeach assignment was risograph-based, which I was surprised by (I don't think this was clearly stated in the syllabus). Zine-heavy, which is fine but also not entirely expected."
