It helped me read on a higher level than I had before through connecting with the characters and see the world as they would, as well as general close reading. I learned in this class how closely literary impressions are bound up in the experiences of the author, characters, and readers, as well as how beautifully heartbreaking the Greek tragedies and epics are.",
                "I developed better analysis skills and a better knowledge of ancient literary texts.",
                "The first thing that comes to mind is reading. Where Philosophy and H&P often read selected chapters, Literature was more likely to read entire works (with the exception of the Bible, but that's a long one). Finding the time and the stamina to read everything was a marked departure from my high-school experience.\r\n\r\nI also improved in writing, although I came in with more experience than average (thanks, IB Literature HL). Sustained inquiry into a range of works upped my mental flexibility, and the short time frame demanded mental clarity.\r\n\r\nLiterature was the class where I appreciated my classmates the most. People were sometimes (justifiably) confused in Philosophy or (justifiably) bored in H&P. In Literature, people were consistently engaged and the discussion was always vigorous. When I think about how much I respect my fellow Yale students, much of the positive is founded in our Literature seminar debates.",

                "This course was very strong in discussion, even in the virtual format. I felt that everyone had a chance to share their ideas and that everyone's contributions were incorporated into the whole. A weakness was that I felt less connected to other students whom I did not already know because the discussion was so focused on the ideas rather than the people.",
                "Readings are massive in Literature especially (often 200 pages in a week), which can be overwhelming. Besides the workload, everything else about the course was great.",
                "The strengths are the numerous feedback from the professor for the essays whether it is at the brainstorming stage or at the end of essay after its been graded. The weaknesses are that there are lot of readings to do.",
                "DS's Breadth is both a strength and a weakness. On the one hand, it gives first-years a wide exposure and encourages later study to get the details. On the other hand, it deprives first-years of details and depth.",
                "This course allowed a high level of engagement with a wide variety of literary works. The only real criticism I have of the curriculum is that I felt we engaged too little with the Divine Comedy. I felt that only discussing the first third of the work limited what I was able to take away from it.",
                "I would've liked some of the material to be put in conversation with current events.",
                "The only pertinent weakness with the course was our inability to spend a significant amount of time on the books. Some books we spent only one (or less than) a week on. As such, it felt some works got less time than they deserved. However, there is also something beautiful about our having gone through as many works as we did, so I understand that weakness is inherent to the program.",
                "Strengths: Increase the time spent on authors towards the end of the semester (Ovid and Dante in particular)\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lectures didn't include content overviews of the readings",
                "A strength of this course is the discussion seminars, as I feel like they were very engaging through both the \"starter\" format of different students opening each class and the presentations of art\/music that sometimes occurred. I also found the personal feedback that I received on essays and shorter reading responses to be extremely helpful. I think one way to improve the course overall would be to possibly have a few targeted points for the discussion seminars, as at times I feel like due to constraints on time we were not able to discuss certain fundamental issues in the texts.",
                "The weekly writing assignments were good ways to get points but they were exhausting. The reading load was really really heavy and hard to complete, but that is more a DS problem and is not unique to this course. The DS lit reading was my favorite of the DS readings.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the art slideshows and the discussions!",
                "Strengths include the well-thought-out lectures, the deep connections developed between texts, the strong faculty-student connection formed throughout the program, and of course the richness of the texts selected.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses include the focus of time on complete readings of entire texts rather than smaller but more diverse portions and the depressed back-and-forth debate between students due to class discussions occurring on Zoom."

                "Professor Handler Spitz did an excellent job of transitioning the discussion to a virtual format, but there were certain times when a student would have their hand raised for several minutes without her noticing (which is an issue peculiar to Zoom, I imagine). \r\n\r\nI especially loved the professors art presentations in class - they were a nice treat during a stressful year.",
                "I am a by-the-book student, so it was out of character for me to skip so many lectures. I think that a synchronous model would have helped increase my motivation, as would lecture-related assignments.\r\n\r\nProfessor Handler-Spitz gave weekly reading response assignments, and I would have benefited from something similar for lectures.\r\n\r\nThe Zoom format worked well for seminars. We had one speaker at a time and I had no issues focusing or keeping up with the discussion.\r\n\r\nMy Philosophy course met three times a week for 50 minutes instead of twice for 75. I recommend that model to all 75-minute classes.",
                "The classroom environment was present, although obviously not in the way one would expect for a college seminar. This class was the only one in which my professor did not allow the use of the chat, which I personally preferred, as I sometimes found the chat distracting in my H&P and Philosophy sections. However, it did cause a few awkward moments when people felt uncomfortable un-muting themselves to say something that they might have simply typed in the chat had it been open. I'm not sure how this might be improved, except that maybe teachers could outline guidelines for the chat might be used rather than removing it completely.",

                "I think that the virtual seminars worked quite well in place of in-person classes, but I personally found it more difficult to engage with the pre-recorded lectures due to their length and the focus that it requires to watch them straight through in a virtual format.",
                "The virtual seminars worked pretty well; I know nothing can replace an in person conversation!",
                "All practices undertaken were mostly successful, but I believe there is improvement to be made in terms of the ability of students to \"clash\" during discussions. As they exist now, discussions are less analogous to insightful debates and more analysis to disconnected thoughts shared student by student as the instructor calls names down the line."

Though I would not go so far as to say I look at the world differently after taking it, I definitely come to written works with more questions and more interest than I did before. For me, DS Literature has changed not the way I look at things but my field of vision.",

In addition, I think the weekly reading responses and the essays are extremely helpful in terms of improving one's academic writing and ability to think critically about literature. Even in a virtual form, the discussions were very engaging and illuminating, making me consider the texts in an entirely different light after having attended them.",
                "I would recommend DS! And DS literature in particular. But I think that the DS reading load is very heavy and stressful",
                "I would strongly reccomend this course! The value of the course might vary with the specific professor running seminar, but the program itself is sterling and will give a strong introduction into the early texts of the Western Canon."
