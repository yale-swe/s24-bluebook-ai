Students learn explanations behind a lot of common thermodynamic processes and acquire the skills needed to solve problems in the field.

                "Strengths: super clear instruction, the professor actually cares if you understand the material or not (which can be rare in Yale STEM classes). His uploaded notes were also super clear and neat. I am very thankful I took this course instead of any physical chemistry class that was offered in the chem department. The TA was also very helpful, and everybody seemed like they cared a lot about whether or not you were understanding the concepts. Weaknesses: the subject matter is not very interesting, at least to me. Maybe if I was pursuing a career in engineering, I could see how this might be helpful? Most of the things I learned felt like just rote exercises.",
                "It was a very organized class and I really liked how everything was written out on the board. In some other classes, professors only show equations on slides but I appreciated how everything was written out step by step because it really helped me understand the material.",
                "guo and hao are great instructors and the content of this class was appropriate for the length of the semester. no weaknesses come to mind.",
                "I think it is a very good course, well taught.",
                "The subjects taught in class flowed together, but sometimes there was a little bit of  a disconnect between what was taught and what was asked on the psets/ exams",
                "I really enjoyed how Professor Guo actually wrote out stuff on the board it made the experience more engaging. Also the problem set recitation sessions with Hao were awesome.",
                "Course gave a great introduction to thermodynamics and its various concepts",
                "STRENGTHS: The professor and set up of this course is perfect. the material in the course is very difficult, which is not a secret, but Dr. Guo and Hao did a perfect job of relating it to the students. He posted all of the notes, for homework there would be a recitation where we went over each answer thoroughly, and the tests were not out of left field (the average was usually around a 90). Comparing this class to CHEM332 is like night and day. Whereas it seems like that class is trying to kill you will homework all the time, no notes posted to canvas, and impossible tests, this class understands that the material is difficult and helps guide you through it. Dr. Guo and Hao clearly know what they're talking about and want to help their students. He even puts a little break in the middle of lecture to give you time to focus.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: the lectures are long and dense, but such is the nature of the subject matter",
                "Organization could be a bit better, but that does come with time.",
                "The course was fairly well organized and well taught. The review sessions and materials really help a lot, to sum up all the material in each chapter. However, the material is sometimes abstract, particularly in the middle parts of the course and it is sometimes hard to follow due to its nature. Also, good tip is that the textbook is really dense and probably not worth reading (just read the lecture notes).",
                "There is a lot of content to learn and a lot of equations and derivations, but the exams are very fair. The psets and optional quizzes are extremely useful study tools.",
                "This course could be improved by holding additional office hours prior to exams. While review sessions were held, I believe that offering more would be especially helpful. The strengths of this course are in the the teaching and practice available for students. The professor is very willing to answer questions and did a very good job at structuring the course into units that built well upon one another. The homework was also very helpful, providing essential practice for exams.",
                "The course overall is pretty great. I feel like the lectures can be a little bit confusing and derivation-heavy as opposed to thinking intuitively about what certain values actually mean. My biggest gripe with this course is that the material on the problem sets doesn't match up well with the material covered in the lectures, and since we don't do many examples in class, the problem sets are extremely difficult and time-consuming to try to finish on your own. It is basically required to go to the recitation sessions where the TF explains how to solve each problem if you want to finish in a reasonable amount of time. I think it would be nice if we worked through more concrete examples in class so the problem sets don't feel so disorienting.",
                "Dr. Guo's impeccable notes are the greatest strength of this course, and our TF, Hao Dong, had amazing recitation sessions for each of the problem sets. One thing that could be improved is that by the end of the course, there are so many different variables that it would be helpful to go through and review what each of them means, as some are similar, which led me to be confused sometimes. Looking back, I could have fixed this myself by having a running sheet of variables and their definitions, rather than having them dispersed throughout my notes."

                "Yes, please take this course over CHEM 328 or CHEM 332 if you are an MB&B major. There are three non-cumulative exams. The \"final\" exam is just a third midterm, which is kinda a game changer. The pset's aren't bad (you can finish them yourself), and the professor and TF are all super nice and helpful. This course also meets only twice a week, unlike the 3x / week CHEM department courses.",
                "Yes! If choosing between this course and the mechanical thermodynamics, I would definitely recommend this one. I've heard from many people that they didn't like mechanics thermo but I really enjoyed this class and felt that I learned a lot from it.",
                "absolutely. you wont find another prof that makes thermo enjoyable and painless to learn. i never dreaded showing up to class or actually studying the content because everything was taught in a fair concise manner.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! If you're looking for an alternative to physical chemistry, this is the class to take! Both classes are known to cover a significant amount of the same material, and this class was much more tuned to facilitate learning for students. The instructors were ready to help students with individualized office hours and frequent recitation sessions for the PSETs and exams, and they were always ready to re-explain course material so that everyone could understand.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Its engaging and the material and problems are quite fun.",
                "If you need a thermodynamics course then yes the professor and TA were very good",
                "absolutely. You're probably taking this course because you have to, but I actually strongly reccommend this course as a course if you're not ssure if engineering is right for you or not. It's difficult course material that will show you whether or not you really wanna get into the weeds of engineering, but with low stakes in terms of the grading and how much they leave you out to dry. If you need a thermo course, this is much better than CHEM332",
                "Do not take this without chemical engineering background; I suffered.",
                "If you took PChem before taking this course, it should be a review of material and a breeze in the water. However, without any experience in solving thermodynamic problems, it can be quite challenging but still manageable for most students. There are not that many problem sets and our TA basically set up all the problems for us during recitation sessions.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. First of all, the professor is very cognizant of the fact that if a homework or exam goes poorly, it requires further covering. He is very fair with the grading, allowing plenty of chances to improve one's grade. This is super helpful when considering that the course content is a bit more challenging. This class is very well-taught.",
                "You have to take this course if it's for your major. It may not be the best option just for a science credit as the material that this course is fairly narrow in scope, but if you are really set on taking this course, this class covers the same material as the thermodynamics offered by the Chemistry department, so you may want to see which one works best for you.",
                "Most students taking this course probably do so for a major requirement, and for anyone deciding between this course and another for this purpose, I'd highly recommend this one! The first third of the course will be easy for those who have recently covered basic thermodynamics through physics, and the multivariable calculus aspects of the course are relatively straightforward. If you're just interested in learning more about thermodynamic systems, this course will give you the techniques needed to tackle most basic thermodynamics problems, so I'd recommend it as well!"
