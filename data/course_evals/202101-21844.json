It expanded my vocabulary to allow for engaging discussion of real-world issues: labor issues, the evolving modern family, regionalism and nationalism, and immigration and integration among others. As a non-French and non-European person, it can be difficult to understand French culture, but the course forced me to interrogate the origins of cultural misunderstandings and develop a much more nuanced perspective. We got there through a mlange of readings, shorting written assignments, exposs and films. If nothing else, the course introduced me to a wide variety of super interesting French media, particularly some unforgettable films. Of course, the course also offers many opportunities to practice your spoken French.",

                "Strengths: Good discussions with the class, almost always very engaging and interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of weekly assignments (in addition to other classes) and sometimes lectures would run on for a long time, being a little tiring (especially over Zoom).",
                "Strengths: The course offers a deep dive into French culture, and it manages to do a thorough overview even with so much content to cover. Vocabulary lists are actually really useful, and much of them will stick with me. Like most language courses, particularly in the French Dept., the course is super well-structured, and there's rarely any surprises. The workload is just enough to be manageable while also engaging, considering that the class only meets 2 days a week. I had no problem watching all the films, since they were genuinely really interesting. The readings offer a lot of interesting perspectives, too. Mme Sherak does a good job of challenging your ideas so that you're forced out of your comfort zone and think about things from different POVs.\r\nWeaknesses: Minimum vocabulary quotas in the writing prompts felt a little bit juvenile given the course level, but that depends on your skills with the language. The class wasn't that large (maybe 10ish people, maybe a few more at the beginning of the semester), but given that the class time is so short, and only meets twice a week, you don't have too many chances to speak. That might just have been a symptom of Zoom, though.",
                "Strong course the only issue was it being on zoom because some of the personal connection was lost .",
                "Considering the virtual format, this class went well",
                "I thought this was a great course to help students improve their french speaking skills. I thought a main weakness was related to the fact that we were on zoom instead of in person in a seminar where interaction is pivotal, but that couldn't have been changed and we had to adjust.",
                "The films we watched were well selected - this was reflected in the long and engaging discussions we had about them in class. The oral exams also felt a good way to consolidate the confidence in speaking we'd been working on during the semester. Although the class purported to be based in discussion around topics relevant to French and francophone culture, the focus was definitely concentrated on France, which left discussions on other parts of the francophone world cursory and somewhat shallow. The topics for both the written and oral exams were very vague and the prompts required reference to multiple topics, which also made it difficult to engage more seriously with an idea or argument - the responses necessarily ended up being more like summaries of basic ideas around the topics of the class."

This course provides you with the tools to make interesting conversation, engage with controversial topics and immerse yourself in French culture. It's definitely necessary for anyone hoping to master the French language and use it professionally in the future. Also, the final oral requires you to conduct an interview in French with a French-speaking person. Super cool and informative.",

                "Yes, definitely! It gives you a lot of confidence in communicating in French but more importantly, about discussing broader societal issues in France in general. We  talked a lot about the idea of lacit, which ties into the strict French laws around religious headscarves; we discussed regionalism in France and how there are countless languages spoken across the country and how the government has historically pushed to make french the national language at the expense of regional cultures; we talked about education and the lack of resources in banlieues  all of which, to me, has been extremely invaluable.",
                "Yes, I would. It is a difficult french course but it is very helpful in improving your conversational skills.",
