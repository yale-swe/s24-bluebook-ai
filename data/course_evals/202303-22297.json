                "Strengths: The course consistently went at a good pace, where I felt challenged the whole time, but never felt bored or like I was learning things I already knew. Professor Tai was really helpful and supportive throughout the course, and I improved much more as a musician than I expected to before taking this class. Weaknesses: The content could be hard to keep up with if you didn't immediately know what was going on.",
                "Strengths: It was nice that the professor was very willing to listen to our feedback and change the pace of the course with our comfort level on certain topics. I also appreciated that we didn't limit our music theory lessons to just classical music.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's hard to learn solfege! I wish we spent more time getting comfortable with that.",
                "great class, definitely helped me with my aural musicianship.",
                "It seems at times a little thrown together because its mostly based in the practice of those skills. The two sections should work together to create a joint curriculum that feels a little more structured and maybe dives deeper into music theory.",
                "I loved the content! It covered a lot of things that I had no idea about as a musician from a low-income, public school background. I will say though that it became a little harder to follow along when we got to chord building and inversions.",
                "I really appreciated the consistency of the homework as it helped me stay on track with my practicing. The in-class group exercises were also really helpful for improving my skill and confidence with sight singing.",
                "Great course, very engaging and fun. Loved the rhythmic and melodic dictation parts of the class.",
                "This course overall has a lot of strengths. Class itself was engaging, with the class engaging in group singing exercises often. My only complaint would be perhaps the pace is a little too slow for those students who have \"better ears\" coming into the class than other students.",

                "I would highly recommend this course to any student who wants to improve their aural skills. Aural skills are very important in aspiring musicians, so this course is applicable to a wide variety of musically inclined people.",
