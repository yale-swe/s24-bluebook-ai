I also appreciate the assignments we had due each week which kept me on track compared my friends in different majors who saved all their work until the end of the semester. Finally, I really liked the thesis presentations I thought that was super rewarding.",
                "While I wouldn't have appreciated it at the time, with hindsight, I think there should be one earlier deadline for a partial draft prior to the Nov. 19th rough draft deadline. I think this would be helpful because, at least for me, my thesis work seemed to really escalate at this point of the semester. \r\nThis course was super helpful for helping me stay on track with my senior essay and I really appreciated the feedback I received from my colloquium mentor and my peers. It was also really cool getting to learn about the work everyone was doing in small groups.",
                "I think that the small mentor groups were incredibly helpful in getting feedback and support in my writing process. I appreciated having the drafts due early and having the time to review/ make edits. No major weaknesses I can think of.",
                "This course is very well organized to facilitate student research and productivity. I only wish there were more opportunities to submit concrete pages of writing, rather than planning/data.",
                "From talking to students in other majors I am very thankful for this colloquium as I don't think students compiling their thesis in other majors were offered as much support and clarity which I was provided with.",
                "Strengths: the group dynamic of working on the thesis in a small group was helpful, and the peer and professor check-ins were really helpful, especially compared to friends writing research projects in less structured programs. \r\nWeaknesses: Given the desire for people to conduct independent research, the major needs to give students tools their junior year to conduct research over the summer - possibly with an entire seminar, or with a series of evening workshops."
