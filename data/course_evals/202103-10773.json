                "I learned about the politics of celebrity and how power structures underpin celebrities and other powerful figures. I also learned about charisma, religious celebrity, and how mass culture affects all of these.",
                "-How to speak in a humanities seminar in a meaningful way\r\n-Developing my own opinions and worldview from scholarly and non-scholarly texts \r\n-Integrating my classmates' views into my own, having active debates \r\n-Knowledge: what people value as sacred, what makes a celebrity, how power is developed",
                "I learned how to analyze a topic and and go in-depth on one particular detail.",
                "This course is an excellent opportunity to discuss and identify popular culture. I would not call the class particularly hard, but it can certainly be dense. You're reading a lot of theory, a lot of cultural commentary that is quite serious. One of my biggest takeaways is that everything we discussed (Kim K sex tape, Taylor Swift, BTS) is actually quite serious. Popular culture is who we are. It was such a great class.",
                "I learned how to treat pop culture as serious, analytical, and as in conversation with broader (and seemingly more important) socio-political dynamics. I also learned to investigate my own likes/dislikes, as well as visceral reactions to and participation in pop culture.",
                "This was a great course to get better knowledge of celebrity culture in the Us and develop my analytic skills",
                "I learned how to apply specific language to the media and images I consume. Its been very helpful in examining pieces of pop culture that Id previously written off before.",
                "I learned so much in this class! I gained an understanding of the theory of celebrity, fame, and social hierarchy. I also learned how to contextualize information I consume in my everyday life! this class is 100% so valuable and will be something I use for the rest of my life!!",
                "I learned how to critically analyze moments in pop culture.",
                "Thinking critically about celebrity and WHY people like the things they do!",
                "I learned about celebrities and why they become popular.  It was interesting to further connect celebrities to systems of power and consider how they can make a political impact.",
                "Really pushed me to dig deeper whenever I evaluate anything related to pop culture, whether it's my reaction to a piece of news, my take on a celebrity controversy, or my opinion on a TV show. Everyone in the class sort of pushes each other to move past the feeling that critically analyzing celebrity culture is trashy, or shallow, or not worth your time- and once the class really builds a rhythm, the conversations are incredibly thoughtful and interesting.",
                "This course helped me learn how to think critically about the world around me and pop culture in particular. Politics exists in so many forms all around us and I think I have a much better understanding of how it complicates our social relationships and perceptions. I also felt pushed to really put effort into my writing and participation, and make sure my contributions involved critical thinking. Most of all, I was reminded of how fun classes can be.",
                "We learned about the making of celebrity in the shared imagination, its relationship to religion, as well as different tropes that circulate in the world of celebrity. We discussed all types of celebrities, ranging from BTS to Kim Kardashian to Beyonce, at length and theorized why they are so popular.",
                "This course was INCREDIBLE! The way i think about popular culture and the things we consume mindlessly (music, social media, tv shows, etc.) has forever been changed. I learned how to think critically about things that we are told to NOT think critically about-- this has given me a new perspective on the US culture industry, human relationships and myself.",
                "I learned how to intellectually examine things I engage with in my everyday life - things that arent usually discussed in a classroom. I learned how to recognize the political in everyday life and pop culture. I learned how to do a close reading of a People article or a Youtube music video.",
                "I learned SO MUCH about pop culture and about the meanings of celebrity and politics. I also feel I improved as a writer and critical thinker in this class.",
                "I feel I learned what makes a successful campaign, both celebrity and politically.",
                "I really enjoyed this course! I learned how to analyze pop culture, which I never thought I could apply to school, in an academic setting. Using articles written across a range of topics, I learned how celebrities become who they are. Through the case-study-style class looking at different celebrities each day, I learned how to apply interesting readings and thought to my own thinking. I also was able to participate in engaging discussions where I could formulate my ideas.",
                "Looking at celebrities and politics more critically, being able to analyze pop culture events and offer suggestions for celebrities on how they can best use their political power. Talking about things like the Kardashians, Free Britney Movement, Colin Kaepernick, AOC's MET Gala dress...",
                "I learned how to trust in my own instincts and value the insights I was creating! The class was incredibly supportive and all ideas were embraced and lifted up.",
                "This is a super fun course where you learn how to talk about the things you're talking about anyway in a more informed and impactful way.",
                "By taking this class, I learned about the fascinating political underside of popular culture. I gained insight into the cultural and political relevance of stars like Beyonce and the Kardashians alongside stars that are less theorized about (Lin Manuel Miranda, Kate Winslet, etc). Additionally, I learned a lot about the celebrity of public figures intimately linked to politics, ranging from Ronald Reagan to Colin Kaepernick. Through the study of this diverse group of people/celebrities, I came to understand the importance and intention of popular culture, thus developing a more theoretical eye to the world around me."

                "Strengths: SPECTACULAR discussions\r\nWeakness: Did not explain expectations of the course until after the first assignment was already graded.",
                "Strengths: 1) Professor Lofton and TF Dusty Gavin. Just wow. Wow. The way they cut past the BS and hit on the meaning lurking beneath the surface. Their discussions in front of us, for us. They're an amazing team and really showed the class how this investigation of pop culture through personal relation to the media should be done. 2) It's really fun to talk for a whole class about Beyonc (or literally any other celebrity). You can't really do that in any other class. 3) There are very few assignments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) The class is way too big at 30 people. It is lecture-style and too many people means too many unrelated and bad takes on Dolly Parton. 2) It's hard to figure out how relevant the readings are to the class because they are only meant as potential ways of thinking about celebrity. That means that the texts' presence in class is inconsistent.",
                "Professor Lofton and her TF Dusty are so knowledgeable and affirmingit was such a joy to be taught by them. I only wish there was a bit more of a lecture component to frame our discussions.",
                "no weaknesses!! the class was amazinggg",
                "Throughout the course I would have loved to hear more lecturing. It was a super dynamic class filled with open discussions, but sometimes the peer to peer comments felt a little undirected. Dustin and Professor Lofton would make really astute observations, but I always felt like they were cut short to make room for students comments.",
                "Strengths: Great professors (especially Prof Lofton)! The class was very engaging. Weaknesses: sometimes the assignments were a little unclear, but the professors were always willing to further explain and help guide through it.",
                "In any class with Professor Lofton, she is always going to be the biggest strength of the course. Learning from her and watching her lead a class is always a ton of fun. \r\nAnother strength- mostly because people tend to have really strong opinions on pop culture, people in this class are totally willing to openly and completely disagree with each other. Huge strength of the class, because you end up not just hearing a lot of good takes, but also seeing the drastically different ways people formulate their thoughts and connections.\r\nNo weaknesses, and if there are any that come up, Professor Lofton is always willing to hear your concerns and adjust the course based off what you say.",
                "The strength of this course was that it was incredibly entertaining and intellectually rigorous at the same time. I was actually excited to do the readings and we got to talk about pop culture moments that I analyze with friends in my free time. The quality of discussion was so high that I was always leaving class with new perspectives. There were not any major weaknesses.  I do wish that the instructions for some of the earlier assignments had been more detailed.",
                "I wish there was more politics",
                "This was probably one of my favorite classes at Yale. Not only did it allow me to draw on the obnoxious amount of knowledge on celebrity I have accumulated over the years, this class genuinely pushed me to think more critically about our consumption of pop culture and the different forms of media we interact with everyday. Unlike most of my other classes at Yale, I actually paid attention during the class and did not find myself being bored. We also had a great deal of control over what we chose to write about in our assignments.",
                "No weaknesses! the syllabus was manageable and so interesting, the teaching team is AMAZING, class discussions were dynamic, assignments were FUN to write-- 100% take this!",
                "Strengths: Lofton is the coolest professor you could have at Yale. She is just brilliant and has something to say about everything and breathes energy and passion into any subject. Dusty was also incredible and I just loved the way the two of them led the class together. The assignments were also really fun to complete and let me speak my mind and to my emotions in a way other courses have not allowed me. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the class just felt too much like an open forum. While I appreciated having the space to speak openly and give opinions, the conversation sometimes felt misdirected or too broad. I also wish that there was maybe more variety in the structure of our class - perhaps activities or something else that would engage us besides discussion.",
                "There were many strengths of this class, including the effort and enthusiasm that both instructors brought every class, and I appreciate that this class made me think and theorize way beyond the surface level of any text, video, song, or celebrity we were discussing.\r\n\r\nAs far as weaknesses, the only weakness is that the class was a leminar, and it was sometimes intimidating to speak in class because of how many other people were in the room.",
                "I wish there had been more input as to what Professor Loftons notions about what we were learning were. Much of this class was very discussion based, which made everyone engaged, but hearing more of professor loftons opinions would have been nice.",
                "The class is very engaging, and I think its biggest strength were the discussions. All of the students seemed very interested in the topics chosen for each day, and we learned how to interact both with the readings and each other. Professor Lofton and Dusty were also both incredibly dynamic and interesting teachers who I really enjoyed getting to know. I think that the only small weakness of the class was that while the assignments were applicable to the course, I often times did not understand exactly what I was supposed to be writing about until a meeting with Professor Lofton or Dusty. I enjoyed those meetings, though, so definitely not entirely a weakness.",
                "Literally all strengths. This class was so so great. I think one of the greatest strengths was the subject matter and flexibility of the discussions to talk about what we felt compelled to discuss (even if that wasn't on the syllabus). The entire semester worked up to the final, which had us basically practice what we had been doing -- analyzing the politics of celebrity actions. All reading were super relevant and interesting. No weaknesses, I loved this class!!",
                "The course was so good! No improvements!",
                "This course was overall totally great. The only area for improvement is the size and pacing of the class. I think this course either needs to go full lecture or be a smaller seminar. I'm saying that because it felt like there was never enough time for everyone who wanted to participate to do so.",
                "I think the content of the course is thrilling. I really appreciate the diversity of celebrities and forms of popular culture we look at, because it allows for everyone to speak on something they know and learn about something new. My favorite part of the class was the creation of a class instagram page to display our celebrity research projects. I thought this was a really unique way to learn about various celebrities and their cultural impact while simultaneously connecting to our peers in the classroom. All of the writing assignments were an entirely manageable length and contained interesting prompts/jumping off points that made writing easier and fun. Some of the theoretical reading could be quite dense, so in the future it might be better to assign smaller chunks of reading or offer reading guides.",
                "I really enjoyed the class discussions and topics of this class, so incredibly interesting. Nothing like anything I've taken at Yale. This was the first time it was being taught though, so definitely some ambiguity around assignments that required clarification in class. Professor Lofton is a gem though and I definitely think that any kinks will be worked out the next time she teaches this course."

                "I would absolutely recommend for anyone interested in American culture, social movements of the last 20 years, or media portrayal of certain groups. I think this would be a really valuable course for anyone interested in advocacy, politics, entertainment, and media.",
                "Hmmm. Tentatively yes, and especially if the class is cut from 30 people to 15. It's fun (you get to talk about celebrity couples and social media and TV all class), Katie and Dusty are INSANE in the best non-professorial way, it feels much more visceral and personal, and it's not very much work. It is chaotic, especially with so many people. For a decent amount of the first half of the course I was disappointed that didn't get anywhere in the discussion. It's hard to dig deep and not just dish out a random take about a celebrity you kind of know. There are definitely classes where I walked out thinking that I had learned nothing. It's also hard to justify doing all of the readings, which vary widely in quality. But the teaching duo is inspirational and occasionally there's a fantastic class period that keeps you going.",

                "YES, 100%",
                "You get to explore really fun celebrity news through the lens of critical analysis. You read a lot of theory which helps ground the discussions.",
                "Absolutely if they are interested in pop culture. It was the class I talked about the most last semester.",
                "Yes!!",
                "Yes! It's a lot of fun, but you have to be interested in celebrities and talking about people like the Kardashians. This will change your view on celebrities.",
                "Absolutely. This is without a doubt one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. By design, it's going to feel really different from your other classes. That makes it challenging at times, but that's also what makes it so fun. If you take this class, you're going to look forward to it every week as a highlight of your schedule.",
                "YES!!! I loved this course!! I took a lecture with Professor Lofton freshman year and every semester was hoping to take another with her again. I'm so sad that it is over and I would recommend it to any student who can take it. I learned so much while having the best time.",
                "Its fun and you absolutely need to take a class with Professor Lofton before you graduate",
                "YES! YES! YES! Please take this class if you get in. Professor Lofton and Dusty are some of the most wonderful people I have met at Yale. This class genuinely did not feel like work yet still managed to be extremely intellectually satisfying.",
                "YES PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND TAKE THIS COURSE!",
                "Yes absolutely!!! This class was so much fun and you just have to take a class with Lofton. The class just felt like one long incredible dinner party.",
                "Yes definitely. It opened up so many avenues of thinking about this particular issue, bringing in historical and present day examples.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! I really enjoyed coming to class each day and discussing pop culture phenomena that either I consumed in my personal time or had yet to learn about. The assignments were not too difficult but very engaging, and both Professor Lofton and Dusty were amazing teachers who I think anyone should experience if they have the opportunity to do so. I think that both my critical thinking and writing improved from this course, and I also thoroughly enjoyed it.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. The greatest class I have taken at Yale, hands down. If you are at all interested in any of the things on the syllabus (and there's a wide range -- Hamilton, Beyonce, Reagan, Oprah, Lil Nas X, ....) I would strongly encourage you to take this course. Katie and Dusty are so supportive and want to make sure everyone's voices are heard. I had a great experience and could not recommend it more!",
                "Yes, yes, yes!",
                "Yes! Honestly, if you are interested in celebrity or pop culture studies at all, TAKE this. There's no other class at Yale like it (as far as I know).",
                "I HIGHLY recommend this course to all students. The syllabus is thrilling and diverse, making it so that you can talk about your favorite celebrities while also learning something new. In this class, everything is related so there is also a lot of opportunity to theorize about ANY popular figure or societal trend that intrigues you. Katy and Dusty are also excellent instructors who easily keep debate rolling and care for/connect to students on a personal level. I think there is not a class at Yale where you will get to do the type of thinking and theorization that encompasses this class, so definitely take it if you can!",
                "Yes! I had no idea celebrity culture would foster such interesting class discussions, and it was my favorite class this semester."
