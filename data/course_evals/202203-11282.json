                "I developed a solid foundation in Japanese, including both syllabaries and a fair bit of Kanji. I learned how to engage in basic conversations, and alsomost usefully for my goalsgot acquainted with various resources for learning Japanese, both at Yale and publicly available.",
                "Elementary speaking, listening, writing, reading Japanese - can say basic sentences in a trip or greet someone",
                "Basic formal Japanese grammar, lots of conversation practice. All of the Japanese syllabary and about ~40 or so Kanji."

            "comments": [
                "The main strength is that it forces you to remain very constant in your language learning effort, so you improve a lot. The class is small, which allows you to practice a lot, and to get to know classmates very well. I would say the weaknesses are that, in being so fast paced, most concepts are rushed over in class, and a lot of the studying must happen outside on your own time. If you are looking to advance as quickly as possible this course is great, but if you want a slower and more in depth understanding of the contents then it might not be for you.",
                "I enjoy that the course had a lot of tests and quizzes. They acted as good checkpoints, without being too stressful. I wish that there were weekly quizzes on katakana, like we did for hiragana. I find it much more difficult to remember katakana because we just did one big quiz on them. I also hate the VoiceThread app, and wish that an alternative could be used. It is super buggy and gets in the way of doing shadowing. Additionally, I think shadowing would be better if it were done with more realistic scripts\/recordings. The cartoonish readings that we did in class I felt were actually detrimental in learning how to pronounce things. Lastly, I think it would be better if the homework assignments were assigned more evenly. The main thing is that more than one assignment per day can be cumbersome.",
                "I really liked taking the class overall, especially the very fair grading system, which awarded high levels of participation, but also gave students many chances to raise their grades. I think the textbook is well designed. In terms of weaknesses, I did sometimes wish there were certain activities that were tailored more to graduate students, but understand that the majority of students are undergrads.",
                "The course was almost perfect for me, except the workload is a little bit much. However, I do think that consistent exposure and practice are key to learning a language, so the workload was not necessarily a bad thing. I think I learned a lot and motivated to move onto the next stage of learning.",
                "Learning Japanese can a very different experience depending on your familiarity with other East Asian languages, but this class treats all backgrounds the same way. I feel that this can be accounted for as the program gets bigger."
