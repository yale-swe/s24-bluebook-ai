                "I gained a strong overview of the major trends in jazz from the bebop era in the 40s to the contemporary experimentation of artists like Steve Coleman. In addition, I learned about various global sociocultural events that likely influenced musicians within these movements. Professor Veal, as well as the readings and section, provided great insight into artists' motivations, perspectives, and output.",
                "I learned so much about jazz history, jazz musicians, and the historical/social movements that intertwined with them.",
                "This course provides an excellent introduction to many of the fundamental movements in jazz history. Explorations of bebop, post-bop, third stream, latin jazz, etc, are accompanied by great listening homework and productive class discussion that really helps students to engage with the material. I came out of this course with a clear knowledge of the whos who in the canon, and I feel confident in my ability to place other musicians in jazz contexts.",
                "I gained a deeper clarity in how to listen to jazz. I learned to recognize some conventions of the music, and became familiar enough that I could notice when they were subverted.",
                "I learned about some of the jazz styles following bebop."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Veal is a very engaging and passionate instructor, I always felt excited about going to class. While the workload is a bit heavier than the average music history class in terms of essays and readings, this content maintained my engagement in the class and advanced my learning. \r\nWeaknesses: Could use some suggested supplemental readings on the actual historical events, because at times I felt I did not know enough about, say, the Civil Rights Movement, to inform some of my ideas.",
                "Sometimes the historical connections weren't as clear, but other than that it was great.",
                "The first 3/4 of the course are excellently structured. The last quarter felt somewhat unorganized with regards to lecture material and assigned homework. This course would benefit greatly from more detailed lesson plans for those last couple of weeks. Still, this course is definitely worth it.",
                "The class content is very interesting, but the lectures are not well structured and professor Veals delivery is sometimes confusing.",
                "The class had a great listening list, and as someone with little exposure to jazz, I appreciate the music we were assigned. The course is a great introduction of a wide variety jazz styles and its a big strength of the course. \r\n\r\nBut it felt like the readings were predominantly anecdotal interviews with jazz musicians that didnt really get to the core material of the course. These readings didnt really offer much considering that this is a survey course where most of the class had little foundation in jazz from this era. On top of that, we would then have to write essays, using the readings from the course. Sometimes, like with John Zorn, for example, the only reading would be a short oral interview, and we were expected to write about his music and contextual it using the readings. For someone like Butch Morris we had to do the same without a reading about him. I wish the course material wouldve better supplied the knowledge necessary to complete the coursework.",
                "The strengths was in the listening that Prof. Veal recommended. He clearly is invested in the music studied in this course, and went out of his way to find tracks that especially spoke to him. It could be improved with more tangible discussion of the music itself that we studied; periods or styles often were painted in much too broad strokes for me to feel like I took anything away. When we did focus on a single artist, a lot of time was spent listening to other students' initial reactions to the music. It would have been valuable to hear more musical information about what we were listening to, what made it important musically, as well as more concrete information about the musicians and the production of the music. The readings also were quite long and somewhat disconnected to the lectures; it would have been nice to either have clearer connections between the readings and the lectures or have readings from a single textbook or a few authors, so as to let us draw our own lines between the readings more easily."

                "Yes, if you are interested in jazz music and learning about the development of musical styles and musicians, then this course is very engaging.  You will need to engage with the material sufficiently to gain the full advantages of Professor Veal's teaching style and the essays.",
                "Absolutely, if you are interested in music and have a base music knowledge (no need to know theory, just a general understanding of music listening).",
                "I would absolutely recommend this to someone who is starting off in jazz and is in need of a crash course in its history. Ive learned so much about the most important musicians, historians, and movements in jazz, and I have the knowledge necessary to explore the genre on my own now. I think for those with a much stronger command of jazz history, this course may feel too introductory at times.",
                "If youre interested in contemporary jazz and would like a course to introduce you to it, this is a good course for you. Youll be exposed to a breadth of jazz from the listening list.",
                "It depends. As a music major, it felt to me that the material was not taught in great depth, which caused me some frustration. On the other hand, many people whose first music class it was found it satisfying, interesting, and ear-opening."
