                "All strengths, no weaknesses",

                "I wish it had been the size it was meant to be! Prof Kim was too nice when letting so many people in.",
                "Overall, I enjoyed the subject material and felt as though the course gave me a new perspective on North Korea and defector narratives. I did feel like, though, the class was mostly student presentation-centered and didn't engage in overarching themes as much as I hoped it would. I would love to see Professor Kim dedicate more time to a guided discussion on the readings that ties them to the week's theme and broader ideas in North Korean culture and identity.",
                "This course is great! You learn so much and get a better perspective on the lives of North Korean defectors and life in North Korea. There are no weaknesses!",
                "As much as I appreciated the interactiveness of letting the students give the class presentations, I really enjoyed it when Professor Kim would just lecture and share his thoughts. I thought that hearing from him was extremely valuable.",
                "I think the structure can be changed.",
                "Engaging, lots of memoirs, amazing professor. \r\nPeople were not really willing to speak up and ask questions. Sometimes I felt like people had preconceived notions still about certain faiths and also assumed everyone agreed with them on their respective views which isn't necessarily true. I wish we had access to the slides.",
                "Hwansoos commitment to his students was perhaps the greatest strength of this course. That he opted to allow so many more students into the class than originally intended reflected his kindness and hesitance to exclude anyone who showed genuine interest. Particularly at the end of the course, when he was left to grade dozens of extra papers with no help from TFs (based on the comments I received, he truly did read them carefully!), he was willing to take on extra work to make sure every student received personal attention. \r\n\r\nThere were two main areas of improvement for this course, in my view. The first is the number of people allowed to take it. Since the class as structured this semester included individual student presentations, allowing 60 or 70 people to take the course meant we all spent wayyyy too much time listening to four, five, or even six presentations per class. It ate up a lot of time I would much rather have spent listening to Hwansoo lecture. The course should either be restructured to accomodate a larger cohort of students or admit fewer people. Admitting dozens of students and then teaching it like a 15-person seminar was the worst of all options. \r\n\r\nThe second opportunity for improvement regards the relevance of our readings and assignments. Although the premise of the course was a study of North Korean civic religion, the various memoirs we read spanned a variety of focuses, and few meditated extensively on the leadership cult. Similarly, student presentations spanned pretty much every topic imaginable, most of which had nothing to do with religion in North Korea. There was no requirement, either, that our final papers address the nominal thrust of the course. I think it would make a lot more sense either to broaden the idenitifed focus of the course and choose a new organizing principle or impose more discipline on the readings and assignments, because the status quo is a little unfocused.",
                "I loved the book selection and the lectures! I don't have any critiques!",
                "Strengths: content is super interesting and prof kim. was super engaging and brought a lot of speakers in",
                "Strengths: the readings were super interesting, and the weekly discussion responses allowed students to engage more fully with the memoirs. It was also cool to have students lead each week's reading discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think the individual student presentations were super helpful, as they became a little repetitive and were difficult to engage with. I think if you got rid of these and kept only student-led book discussions, students might be more engaged throughout the class. I also enjoyed your lectures and preferred the lecture to book discussion format of class.",
                "I loved the professor! I think the journal entries are helpful to keep up to date with the readings. And listening to the presentations\/lectures were super interesting!",
                "This course was extremely interesting and I was excited to hear from Professor Kim everyday in class. The material is simply very thought-provoking and I love how we looked at North Korea from a lens completely different to what we traditionally hear in the media. A weakness would be that we often did not actually hear from Professor Kim due to the multiple presentations that quickly backlogged and had to be completed by students.",

He is a sparkling lecturer, attentive teacher, and interesting thinker. If the course is structured like a seminar but you have dozens of classmates, then maybe wait for a different semester.",
                "Absolutely. Prof Kim is an absolute gem who really cares about his students. He provides so many out of class opportunities to engage in the material. From the mayor of Seoul to meeting a North Korean defector, this class is super special",
                "Yes! an amazing course!",
