    "I learned a lot about modeling Game Theory situations and a little about the historical events. Reading wasn't really enforced so I'm doing it now in preparation for the final.",
    "You learn the strategic mindsets that actors take in international relations while learning the material on game theory itself.",
    "I gained a mathematical perspective of looking at situations involving war and nuclear politics.",
    "I learned basic game theoretical concepts, and how to apply these to a IR-related context. I learned to evaluate choices made by actors in a different perspective and understand how rationality works when outcomes differ according to the interaction with the actors.",
    "Game Theory concepts and its application to critical moments in history involving critical decision making from both sides.",
    "I learned how to think about current events situations in whole new ways. I now find myself thinking about everything in games.",
    "This course taught me the fundamental basics of game theory, including the math behind it, as well as practical applications of such math to events in international relations, from the Cuban Missile Crisis, to the Iraq War of 2003.",
    "I developed a basic understanding of game theoretic concepts and their application to strategic interactions in US history.",
    "Learned about basic game theory concepts, Nash and Bayesian equilibria, repeated and single-period games, and modeled instances in IR",
    "I learned a lot about not only game theoretic analysis, but also about the leadup to the invasion of Iraq and got to reconsider WWII, the Christmas truce, and the cuban missile crisis, which I had previously known a bit about, in an entirely new light, which was very interesting.",
    "Knowledge on Game Theory and analogies iwith IR events",
    "A better understanding of game theory concepts and their applications in International Relations.",
    "An amazing window into how game theory can be used to understand important developments in international relations.",

    "Basic concepts of game theory and insights into how these concepts are applied to thinking in political science.",
    "I learned about the mechanisms and mathematics of game theory, and how it applies or does not apply to several historical and modern situations in international relations. I learned how to understand and evaluate game theory models in real-world situations.",
    "- Solid intro game theory course, good intro to the kind of reasoning involved in behavioral economic models of this kind, rationality, etc.\r\n- Interesting applications of theory to historical strategic dilemmas"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We could have learned more of the math in class and spent the sections doing problems, sometimes it felt like we were learning stuff for the first time there.",
    "I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE AGGRAVATED IN MY LIFE. THIS IS A HARD, HARD CLASS AND I ONLY TOOK IT FOR THE GLOBAL AFFAIRS SECURITY REQUIREMENT BUT THEN HALFWAY THROUGH THE SEMESTER, GLOBAL IS JUST LIKE X GON GIVE IT TO YA, MERGES SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT, MAKES GAME THEORY AN ELECTIVE AND FORCES US TO TAKE INTERMEDIATE MICRO. WTF GLOBAL.",
    "The more advanced material at the end of the course is reviewed way too quickly. I would probably cut down on some of the readings and put more time into that material, such as discounting\/repeated games and PBE.",
    "I feel like Professor Debs could explain the math component a little better, but I really liked the international relations component to this course.",
    "The course provided me with a useful analytical tool and a new understanding of various international happenings. Sometimes I was rather confused by the concepts covered in class that were much more complicated than the basic concepts we just recently learned, and although my TA and problem sets were very helpful, having more time spent on really making sure everyone understood the solution process would have been great. This would have made the exam questions much more approachable, as some of them, sadly, seemed to be well beyond my ability to solve.",
    "Excellent teaching from Professor Debs and the TF Eli Rau. I felt that I had a good overarching knowledge of the history part and a solid understanding of most of the game theory.",
    "There needs to be more office hours.",
    "I found the material interesting but Prof. Debs was confusing at times when explaining quantitative material, and did not offer much engagement with the readings, mostly opening up discussion to students for part of the lecture and then going back to the slides to summarize very basic historical facts. This format for discussing readings was awkward and might be better done in sections, but sections were also packed as the TFs had to reexplain pretty much all of the quantitative stuff. TFs were great, but psets often threw in questions that we wouldn't learn how to do until the next week or that went way beyond what we were shown in lecture or section, which doesn't seem particularly fair. Readings were not always relevant, though mostly they were great. Half of the exams are short answer analyses based on readings, but the grading for these was not very clear. Response memo grading seemed overly harsh.",
    "The main weakness of the course is the great difference between what is covered in class and what is tested in problem sets and exams.",
    "I think that this course, in theory, was a great idea for the Global Affairs major, as a number of IR papers include game theoretical models that are difficult to understand without the proper mathematical background. I also think, in theory, that connecting the math to international relations, was a good idea, in terms of making game theory more approachable and more interesting. However, I think that one huge weakness of the class is that there wasn't enough emphasis on the mathematical component of game theory. We really only learned how to approach it mathematically in section and in problem sets, which proved very challenging. Game theory is a very difficult mathematical concept to grapple with, and more time in lecture should have been spent on walking through the math of game theory, and solving more problems. Furthermore, problem sets and exams should not have students make the extra leap from what was learned in class. I, along with other students in the course, spent an exorbitant amount of time in office hours with the TFs, and even made extra appointments with the TFs to try and understand the material better.  Because we didn't cover a good foundation of these game theory aspects, tackling difficult math questions in the psets and especially on the exams is unfair to ask of us, as we don't have the skill sets to be ready to try challenging game theory problems, especially when it counts towards our grade.",
    "The main weakness of this course was the lack of practice. There was very little practice with the material which made it hard to learn and to know if you understood it. Also, the exams were not representative of the class. The exams were much harder than both the homework and the practice tests.",
    "Elon Rau was a fabulous TA. The feedback on our problem sets was very helpful and important to my learning. Lectures werent always easy to follow or learn from.",
    "At times the course was too fast paced in lecture; material was glossed over in order to fit the day's slides into the 50 minute time slot. In addition, based on what was asked on the exams, most of the mathematical information from lecture was extraneous and thus detracted from other, more important material. The structure and progression of the course was sound, although it would've been more beneficial to have been required to write a memo on all the major topics of the course, instead of just 2.",
    "I think this class spent too much time in the start of the year on easier things like calculating pure strategy Nash equilibria...honestly there is no need to spend more than one lecture on it. The problem arose when toward the end we were learning more complex models, but did not spend as much time on them, so people were not as clear on those.",
    "This course did a very good job of teaching exactly what it said it would teach, and making game theory, which generally is fairly dry, really interesting.",
    "Definitely not well organized to facilitate the process of learning.",
    "The connection between these concepts and the real world seems very small. To use a 3x3 grid to explain things like the attack on Pearl Harbor feels somewhat strange. I did not find these explanations or analyses to be satisfactory and it seems that this course is an attempt to make the Global Affairs major a more quantitative based study. This attempt is feels quite futile.",
    "Strengths: Very interesting material, enthusiastic professor\/TA's\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the connections between game theory and the IR material seemed a tad \"stretchy\" but I feel that is understandable given the game theory was basically intro level.",
    "The professor is very knowledgeable, however, the course material is underdeveloped in that there aren't a lot of practice questions except for the PSETs.",
    "The history is interesting and the theory is boring.",
    "I think at times there was a disconnect between the math and the real life applications.",
    "The course was interesting in its integration of traditional theory and history. However, the coursework leading up to the midterm exam did not represent the objectives covered by the exam. In this, I felt the assessment was unfair.",
    "I feel like there is a lot of focus on the Game Theory without a ton of discussion on how to connect game theory with the international relations concepts covered. I wish there was a bit more of a challenge to design\/consider games from scratch to describe IR situations.",
    "Strengths: engaging lectures, interesting historical and current cases in international relations, game theory concepts are well-taught\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some problem set problems are much more difficult than anything taught in class, could be improved by more in-class examples, extra notes, or more TA office hours",
    "Most of what I gained from this course I gained in section. That's not necessarily a bad thing (I still learned a lotand felt like I got from this course what I wanted to), but, if the course is to continue like this (with basic material and problem-solving most effectively covered in section), it means (a) TFs have to do a good job (like mine did), (b) lectures might be better-spent on exploring more historical examples, research, etc.\r\n\r\nI hate to be a stickler like this, but the grading structure of the course was also somewhat frustrating. The work was appropriately (not incredibly) challenging, but the relatively high cutoffs for A- and A grades combined with the small number of points available for the course (30 pts on a midterm, 40 on a final, only five psets, etc.) meant that it felt very difficult to improve (i.e. the marginal return from extra effort studying, working on psets, etc. was usually too low to encourage engagement at the level that this course probably deserves)."

    "Yeah, a good alternative to regular Game Theory.",
    "Midterm slayed everyone. Global Affairs is fake.",
    "I would recommend if interested in the topic of the course. If not at all interested in game theory then I would not take it.",
    "If you need it for the credit, but otherwise it is a difficult class that you really do not need.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who would like to understand how decisions are made from a more mathematical perspective, especially in the field of International Relations. The course basically covers what it is titled after: game theory in international relations. The concepts are not the most intuitive at first so one should expect a learning curve, but if this topic is something they would be interested in, the course will provide such.",
    "Yes, Prof Debs is a grear instructor, although I recommend shopping the TF's sections since having a TF whose teaching style works with your learning style for the discussion sections are critical to really understanding the game theory part.",
    "I would recommend you take it credit\/d\/fal because it is very interesting however takes an enormous amount of time and the tests are hard.",
    "It's actually really interesting! Psets aren't that scary, and if you get really stuck go to TF office hours and they'll help you through it. Despite a lot of problems, I'm still really glad I took it!",
    "I would not recommend this course to a student who has no background in game theory. The exams and problem sets are ridiculously hard.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless you must take it to fulfill a requirement for the Global Affairs major. While this class sounds interesting in theory, it does not work well in execution. Not enough emphasis and time was spent on the mathematical components of game theory, and when problems were reviewed together in class, the steps proved very confusing because they were reviewed too quickly, or mistakes were made and the professor would backtrack in problems. Ultimately, we were given very difficult questions in the problem sets and on the exams, which was unfair to ask given the basics we learned in class. Essentially, we were taught the very basics of game theory in class, and then asked extremely difficult questions on the exams, which required us to make huge leaps that we just weren't ready for.",
    "Not as a QR, but if you are passionate about game theory I think this course could be a good start.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who has fairly strong quantitative and qualitative skills. This course will reward those with advanced mathematical abilities who also take the time to do the readings and take comprehensive notes on them. This is not an easy class. The exams are hard, but graded fairly but were unfortunately not like the psets or practice exams. The units after the midterm are fairly complicated, so do your best not to fall behind!",
    "Yeah, it's good to take Game Theory if you're a social science person. You need to understand the logic of strategic interaction. This class is not very math heavy, however, so if you want a more rigorous theoretical\/mathematical experience maybe try econ 159 or 351.",
    "If you do, talk to the TA's real early",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because I feel that it is an attempt to explain something (IR) with a language (game theory) that is unsuited to the task.",
    "I would. It was a great way to understand both the fundamentals of game theory and how it applies to international developments.",
    "Recommended for any student who want a real work application of Game Theory. it could be tough, but worth.",
    "If it weren't a requirement for the global major I wouldn't have taken it.",
    "I think that a knowledge of game theory is useful, but those looking to take the course solely out of interest in IR should look elsewhere.",
    "Don't take this if you want very rigorous game theory\/math, nor should you take this if you want deep IR discussion. Due to this class serving in part as an intro to both it doesn't get very deep into these schools of thought. If you are a poly sci major that wants to develop more mathematical aptitude I think this is a good option.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because you learn to really understand the game theory models that you see used in political science papers. Game theory is also a really interesting and important way to analyze real-life situations, especially in international relations."
