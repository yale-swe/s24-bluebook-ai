                "The course was nice in that it allowed us artistic liberty, while also forcing us to expand to different and unique forms of writing. It was also nice to read works from other authors. The only part of the course that I struggled with was knowing what exactly we were supposed to be doing since most days we did not follow the syllabus, but we would eventually figure out what we were supposed to be writing or reading, albeit the day of class.",
                "The class is a very collaborative environment. Students review eachothers' feedback and tell them how to improve. Group projects were a great way to learn about different authors together. I really enjoyed the historical aspect as we covered different styles of writing.  Prof. Jordan was incredible and facililated an open dialogue where everyone felt comfortable speaking. She brought fun subjects to the table as well. The course could have a more structured and updated syllabus and rubrics for assignments.",
                "The main strength of this class is professor Jordan. She is an absolutely fantastic professor. The small class was also great as it facilitated class discussion and everyone bought in. As someone whos never written wrote much creative work, I was very comfortable opening up and sharing my work with the class. Everyone was very welcoming and helpful."

You will have to work very hard if you are not grammatically up to par, however if you are (or if you work hard) it is a great class that pushes your understanding of the language by making you engage in the reading of poetry and stories that are very unique and complex.",
                "Yes, Professor Jordan is my favorite professor at Yale. It is an extremely fun Spanish course that pushes you to write about subjects you would not have written about in other courses.",
                "Yes, 100%. Unfortunately professor Jordan will not be teaching it again but from what I understand it will be similar. This is a great class to take, it is unique class at Yale and I highly encourage students who have never done anything creative to give it a chance. This is a good class for both native speakers and non native speakers"
