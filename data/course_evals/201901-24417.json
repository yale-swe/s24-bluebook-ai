    "I learned about different protest movements and characters as well as forming a coherent style of writing that aided me in other classes as well.",
    "How to write a research paper (short- long), how to dissect writing, about peace\/ protest, how to go from a topic to a completed paper step by step (structurally, etc.)",
    "I learned what specific improvements I could make in my writing to produce a better paper.\r\nI also learned how to deliver a public speech. Through reading about nonviolent protests, I discovered a lot about what sparks protests and what determines their outcomes.",
    "Knowledge: social movements, esp. civil rights movement, Black Lives Matter, nuclear disarmament, gay rights, decolonization, Indian independence movement, South Africa apartheid\r\nSkills: writing college papers, esp. research paper, public speaking",
    "Structuring an essay paper, analysing texts, improved essay writing (both formal and for speeches)",
    "I learned skills of writing more clearly as well as scholarly research and public speaking. I gained immense knowledge on how protest movements and social movements work in general and different approaches to creating social change. I gained insight on the drastically diverse schools of thought on the topic ranging from violence to non violent methods. I became a better reader, listener, and writer through this process.",
    "I learned how to write in a college course -- style, content, organization, as well as the expectations professors of writing courses have.",
    "I learned about protests and social movements while becoming a better writer. I feel that I am now better able to evaluate my own writing.",
    "How to analyze drafts to improve on final paper. How to read analytically."

   "comments": [
    "I liked the overall structure of the class and enjoyed the challenges of trying to answer the essay prompts. However, in the middle part of the semester, I found the readings to not be as engaging as those in the beginning or the end. The paper topics drifted away from the readings, which was perfectly okay with me but also made me less inclined to read them closely.",
    "Strengths: Professor Killian is amazing: kind, approachable\/ accessible, always prepared, funny, helpful, insightful and more. She is receptive to feedback and knows exactly how to get conversation started, the class was very engaging and the readings were interesting, the writing prompts were good as well, gave a lot of freedom\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses",
    "This course was very well organized and the content was incredibly engaging. I dont think this course had any weaknesses, it was fantastic!!",
    "Strengths: learn about a variety of social movements, class discussions are insightful and engaging, improve writing and public speaking skills, get to learn from fellow classmates, prof is amazing\r\nWeaknesses: lots of reading, sometimes hard to understand, and don't always get chance to discuss everything in class",
    "Strengths - few students, close contact with professor. I enjoyed reading others' papers and giving them feedback and thought that peer feedback was generally very helpful for improving my paper\r\nWeaknesses - Not enough writing practice",
    "It was a great course that created a safe space for me at Yale. It was thought provoking but not stressful. It was engaging and collaborative. Genuinely an amazing intellectual experience. The pace of the class makes you feel caught up and not drowning in work. It is very helpful as a first year to be surrounded by those who are on the same page.",
    "Strengths: Very interesting readings and engaging discussions. Interesting writing assignments.\r\nNo glaring weaknesses.",
    "I was an amazing class- really enjoyable and I also felt like I learnt a lot."
