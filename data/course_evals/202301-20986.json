                "Test analysis, close reading, writing, discussion.",
                "I learned about exactly what the course promises: Ancient Chinese Thought. I got a great view of about a thousand years of intellectual and even political history, from the oracle bones of the Shang dynasty (1250 BC?) right up to the introduction of Buddhism under the Eastern Han (220 AD). I learned about the trends and tensions within this intellectual history, and also about some of the most debated and controversial questions in this history (especially about Confucius).",
                "Developed a sweeping understanding of Chinese philosophy over time.",
                "I learned so much from this course!!! I gained knowledge of the Ancient Chinese tradition from the Odes to the Eastern Han period. This is not strictly a literature, history or philosophy course  it is truly interdisciplinary and approaches the texts from multiple angles. I learned about so many interesting (sometimes weird, in a good way) ancient texts and stories! Professor Hunter shows how the tradition is much more rich than the stereotypical labels people use (\"Daoism\" \"Legalism\" etc.) to describe it. His lecture style brings the texts alive, as you can just tell how passionate he is, and also the new ideas that he has introduced to the field in his own scholarship. There's also a ton of freedom to write your papers about whatever you want, and you can integrate your own interests into your writing (e.g., the ancient world, East Asian literature, philosophy, rhetoric, Chinese politics, archaeology, metaphors, you name it). You could also do a podcast, dance or some other form of assignment to get credit for the course, if you're interested. If any of the things I wrote here sound appealing, definitely check out the syllabus!.",
                "I came into the course with very little understanding of Chinese philosophy and left knowing far more about ancient Chinese history and thinkers as well as a better understanding of the classical Chinese canon.",

                "I really loved the readings and the grading structure (it gave me a chance to actually focus on learning instead of grades!). The lectures were also very engaging and informative.",
                "Great coverage of many different topics, for such a long history I think it is remarkable that we have covered all that we have! The main thing I might have included is more explicit connections between the ideas and the political situations at hand. This is greatly emphasized during the very important \"Warring States Period,\" but I think this would be much more memorable if there was a persistent visual marker that indicated the progression of intellectual and political differences. There are many videos on youtube that I've watched that provide such an illustrated history but actually including some of that within the course or even as homework or something could help make the history feel more concrete.\r\nAdditionally, I appreciated the inclusion of some women authors in the course, but I think it would be worth explicitly framing the question of patriarchy and gender in a way that is specific to Chinese history; otherwise classes are often only able to discuss such matters by analogy with the West-- either explicitly so or just by the assumption of a sufficient historical similarity. Perhaps this assumption is justified, but this was not made clear in the course. Another watch out for is the unintentional reproduction of orientalist tropes that are almost omnipresent in Western study and analysis of Chinese history. I am sure the professor is aware of these tropes, but providing the class with an explicit introduction to these problems could help bring everyone involved to a more sensitive and critical position regarding their own relation to the texts at hand.",
                "Great class!",
                "AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME class. Strengths: Professor Hunter is clearly extremely passionate and knowledgeable, and a real innovator in the field, and the lectures were always engaging. The subject material ranged from historical accounts to more philosophy-style arguments to literature, and I appreciated that variety. The readings for Friday section were especially fun because they would be on a more niche subject (assassins, rhapsodies, etc.) so I definitely appreciated that component of the course. The flexible syllabus is a fantastic idea that I'd love to see implemented more widely at Yale, as it allows students to pursue the subjects they're interested in and earn the grade they want in the class if they put in the effort. I like the lecture format where Professor Hunter calls on students to elaborate on their discussion posts from the night before. Clearly Professor Hunter has put a ton of thought into designing this course, and it pays off. NO WEAKNESSES AT ALL. TAKE THIS COURSE, no matter what your major is!.",
                "The course moves at a good pace and does well balancing readings, lectures, and sections. The grading system is also genius. I felt I put some of the most work into this class, yet never felt stressed out. I hope Professor Hunter is able to convince more professors to adopt this scheme; I'm convinced he's engineered the future of grading.",
                "Strengths - Syllabus choice, and Mick's organization. Course is very organized and streamlined. Grading style (choose what you do) also makes the course very flexible and very transparent, and makes Credit\/D\/Fail option a lot simpler.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Discussion sections were probably the weakest portion of the course, but not because of the instructors' fault. This might be improved by giving more concrete discussion questions beforehand so that students know what to talk about during sections, and\/or having people prepare questions\/answers beforehand similar to the discussion posts.",
                "Because the lecture is big, its sometimes hard to participate meaningfully in normal class time.",
                "Well-taught course but section could have been more engaging\r\nI loved the variety of figures.\r\nThe readings were sometimes a little too long for me to really read them well",
                "I like how to grading scheme allows students to go focus more on the topics they are most interested in (essays don't have preassigned prompts unless you ask the teacher for one), and how you have a lot of flexibility on when\/what type of assignments you do."

That said, the readings and discussion posts can be burdensome at times (and neither can you write off the written assignments\/exams). I would say only take this class if you have the room on your schedule to devote to hunkering down and doing the readings + staying engaged in the lectures. If you dont (kind of like I did), the class will feel more like a slog and the end of the semester will pile on you",
                "Absolutely! This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and I came in having no background in philosophy. The texts we read are really remarkable. Plus, Mick is such an engaging and supportive lecturer. I would highly recommend any class that he's teaching.",
                "YES! CERTAINLY! INDUBITABLY! In fact I already have recommended it to many of my friends. Here are three good reasons to take the course. 1) Professor Hunter is clearly a really innovative and creative thinker in the field. He's also a very caring professor in that he makes time for his students and provides thorough feedback. I can tell a lot of thought goes into making the course the best possible experience for the students. 2) The flexible syllabus is a blessing because it lets you pursue any topic you're interested in. You could write papers, take exams, make a podcast, write a book review, etc. so it allows you to choose the learning experiences you will most benefit from. Plus, I felt like I didn't have to stress so much because I knew if I did the work I would be able to receive the grade I hoped for, and that allowed me to enjoy the material even more. 3) The stories and texts are just so fascinating. Some are super bizarre, in a good way. Professor Hunter makes an excellent selection of texts  the syllabus is just one hit after another. If you like the ancient world at all, this is a great course to read some cool history, literature and philosophy. I doubt I will ever forget some of the texts we read. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 10\/10..",
                "Absolutely. I took this course not for any requirement and found it one of the most rewarding I have yet taken. The grading system  with optional assignments to build up to whatever grade you want made me work hard but without stress.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Mick's lecturing and teaching style is very easy to follow and very organized. The grading system is also the most flexible I've seen at Yale, and makes getting the grade you want to get very easy and transparent.",
                "Yes, its very interesting.",
                "yes!",
                "I would recommend it if you are good at self-pacing and interested in the material.",
                "Yes, I think Chinese philosophy is an excellent gateway into understanding Chinese culture.",
