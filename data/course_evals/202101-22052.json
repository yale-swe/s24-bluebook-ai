                "The strengths are definitely the professor and the TA's (especially Rob). The amount of office hours held was extremely helpful. I do not have any advice on how to improve this course. It was great.",
                "I was able to learn a new programming language",
                "Strengths: fairly well organized, covering important concepts like Turing machines, gates and circuit, computer architecture, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: not a particularly engaging course, and uses recursion-heavy Racket, which sees very little use in the real world -- it would be better to use a language like Java or Python",
                "Strengths: Really good at teaching the idea of recursion. Also covered turing machines, CFGs, and TC-201s, which was nice to be exposed to that aspect of computer science.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1.) Racket. I know that top 10 reasons to learn racket and all that but I would have much rather learned a relevant and useful programming language while ALSO learning about recursion. \r\n2.) Professor Slade's lecturing style. Monotonous, and often goes out on tangents about classic music, which is not really my cup of tea. I have zero interest in classical music. I did not sign up to learn about classical music for twenty minutes during class time. Class was essentially him reading almost word for word off of lecture notes, which demotivated me to attend class since I could just read the lecture notes.",
                "Office hours are an amazing and, in my opinion, under-utilized resource!",
                "One of the main strengths was the availability of ULA's, as well as the recorded videos on the cs201 youtube channel explaining the homeworks.",
                "The lectures were frustratingly unhelpful. We are all capable of reading the notes, so why did Slade have to as well? I did love the psets though; I thought they were well-designed, and I personally think 80% of my learning happened solely from doing the homework.",
                "The main strength is the abundance of office hours available to help with psets. Also, the availability of resources on the website was helpful.",
                "Strengths: Psets really helped reinforce concepts. ULAs were amazing during office hours. The late days/extensions were definitely appreciated, especially during such a weird semester. Professor Slade was really understanding and made himself accessible. The Youtube videos were awesome. Weaknesses: sometimes the lectures felt not as engaging as they could have been, especially with the virtual format. Maybe twice a week lectures (so they'd be a little longer with more time for questions/examples built-in at the end?)",
                "I don't know if this was a strength or weakness but the exams were more conceptual and very little like the psets.  I wish we had some homework that was a bit more like the format of the exam or the exams were more like the homework. \r\nStrengths: Good ULAs and Office Hours.  The professor & course manager are really accommodating and understanding. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the psets had too many parts to each question. Also given the difficulty of this semester - online learning, a peer of ours committing suicide, and all other circumstances people may have experienced - I wish there was a little more flexibility in the grading like letting us drop our lowest pset grade.",
                "Strengths: Most TAs were great in helping students with the problem sets, definitely take advantage of office hours! Weaknesses: Stephen Slade seems a bit advanced sometimes when explaining concepts. It can be a bit dull and boring sometimes.",
                "Strengths: very organized class, great concepts, important ones as well Weakness: Content covered in class and assignments is not clearly linked, so you have to go to OH to figure it out",
                "Office Hours were amazing! The ULAs were all so helpful and accessible. I also thought the exams were fair (they never threw anything too unexpected). Also Rob is very nice and answers emails very fast. The weaknesses are that we had to learn Racket.",
                "The lecture wasnt really engaging but all the notes online were so well written and organized so you could teach yourself easily.",
                "The course assignments are unnecessarily complicated, and the concepts taught are extremely specific, relating to the teacher's interests rather than focusing on using the Racket language as a whole. If you truly want to have students learning racket, making programs and functions to do certain functions that are NOT introducing a completely new set of required knowledge like turing machine or TC-201 would make students much more appreciative.",
                "I was definitely very surprised to see that we don't have (much-needed...) discussion sections and/or places where we can discuss the topics. That was a major hindrance to learning. However, the TAs and Professor Slade were awesome!",
                "I think the course would have been better if it had not been virtual and if the lectures had not just gone over the notes.",

                "I dont think theres a real reason for the course to be in Racket. Sure, there are cute reasons such as Its like learning Latin!, but in the end, you will never use Racket again if you continue with CS classes. The course had great ULAs though; the office hours were amazing. Problem sets werent too crazy, and the exams were fair.",
                "I do not know if this was only due to the online format of the lectures, but I ended up learning almost everything from going through the lecture notes beforehand. Even though I did attend all of the lectures I could, I did not learn much more at lecture than from my own reading of the notes. Perhaps, there is a way to make the lectures a more engaging experience than simply going through the lecture notes.",
                "Recursion.",
                "Strengths: \r\nThe problem sets: I think I have a stronger understanding of functional programming and Racket. \r\nThe exam review sessions.\r\nIncluding UNIX: I knew almost nothing about UNIX prior to this course and feel decent about the principles now. \r\nRecording and posting all of the lectures along with a transcript.\r\nThe drop in office hour sessions: I'm referring to the sessions where we could come by and ask questions not necessarily about the class but about CS in general. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nI think I would've gotten more out of this course if more practice material was provided. I'm grateful that every exam was accompanied by a practice exam but the real exams were absolutely nothing like the practice exams (they were old practice exams). \r\n\r\nI think the problem sets could be adjusted. They felt top heavy in the sense that I spent most of my time getting a simulator to work and then would quickly finish the actual boolean/dfa/circuit questions. I think this should be adjusted because the exams are testing on whether or not we can write a boolean/dfa/circuit. I think more problems like this on the practice exam would be helpful for understanding the concepts. \r\n\r\nI didn't receive any feedback on my code or exams (other than getting a question right or wrong). I would've liked to know what I can do better in the future. \r\n\r\nSometimes the lectures felt disorganized. It was difficult to know what I need to focus on and understand conceptually or just be aware that something exists. There were moments where we briefly addressed a topic in class and then that same topic would be on an exam.",
                "It was very easy to get help in this course and all the course materials were easy to find and access. Lectures were informative but had low turnout because they were recorded and a decent portion of the lecture time was spent off topic. Exams were not overly difficult, but some portions of the exam tended to be overly nit-picky.",
                "There were always plenty of opportunities to receive help in this course, be it in solving a problem set or preparing for a test. The material was also quite clearly explained, so I did not feel confused about the topics covered. I do believe, however, that class time could be better spent. Occasionally, I thought that the Professor spent too much time introducing upcoming homework assignments, at the expense of covering class material.",
                "Good overall course he was fair with late days and homework due dates and lectures",
                "More practice questions for exams",
                "A strength was definitely the ULA's. Office hours were very well organized, and they were super helpful. The course website is also super helpful, there are a TON of resources. There weren't many weaknesses, but sometimes the lectures could be a bit dull. Also, some of the material felt important on a fundamental level but not really on a practical one, so this might not be the most \"useful\" computer science course.",
                "In general, the lectures seemed to go into more depth than we needed to know, and a lot of learning was through the problem sets rather than the lectures. In some ways, that was a strength of the course because it allowed you to really practice concepts on your own. In some ways, it was a weakness because it was sometimes hard to learn from the lectures, at least for me, because they could get a bit rambly.",
                "This course really makes the students think and struggle through the problem sets in order to learn the concepts because I definitely was very confused in lecture, but I started to understand more when I was doing the psets. This class does help in teaching how computers work in very basic parts, and I know recursion more than I was prepared for in the beginning. It is a little difficult to follow along, but going to office hours and asking questions really does help. I appreciate that the deadlines for some of the psets were extended from the because some of the psets in the middle of the semester took much longer than anticipated.",
                "Strengths were the abundance of peer tutors and the numerous time slots that were very helpful in terms of understanding and completing the homework. Weaknesses were that the information was spread out very far such as across the zoo, canvas, gradescope, and ed discussions.",
                "The topics in class were very easy to understand through the lectures, and the psets helped deepen this understanding further.",
                "The strengths of the course include the plentiful office hours available and the helpful youtube videos. This course's weakness mainly lie in the fact that there is a lot of theoretical concepts taught in lecture, but the tests and psets mainly consist of coding these concepts in racket. I found it to be a big jump and wished that there was more guidance as to how the concepts can be applied in racket/code perhaps with guided examples.",
                "Strengths: The material is interesting, the instructor is enthusiastic, and there are many opportunities to get help (peer tutors, the TA, the discussion board, etc.). Weaknesses: The lectures mostly involved the professor reading off of the jupyter notebook for the day, which was a little unhelpful sometimes."

While I appreciated the one-on-one attention from the office hours, I wish there would have been a general office hours zoom call so that you could work on the homework and get help even if you did not have a specific question.",
                "The office hours schedule was well-organized and easy to access. I also appreciated that lectures were recorded, as I could go back and review parts which I did not fully understand. I wish that the course had been a little more interactive. Most of the classes consisted of the Professor lecturing for the entire class period. Perhaps some classes could have been interspersed with activities which encourage student engagement.",

                "recorded lectures helped because Prof Slade talks pretty slowly and the beginning 15-20 min of class is just watching a classical video. all the learning was pretty much the same because everything is done through coding online, and there were no problems with the adapted tests",

                "If a student wants to learn \"how to code,\" this is not the course for them -- CS 50 teaches that and much more. However, this is a solid course and thorough introduction to the inner workings of today's modern technology. It truly feels as though one learns of the science behind computers.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you are planning on majoring in CS. If you are just looking to take a QR credit, I believe there are much easier credits out there. However, the course and homeworks are quite fun once you solve them.",
                "Yes if you need a CS requirement",
                "Yes, only if you enjoy logical puzzles.  Every Pset in Racket feels like putting together pieces of a puzzle, as many Psets involve coding an implementation of a simulator for a certain construct (turing machine, assembly language simulator, etc) through smaller procedures and then working with that simulator.  Additionally, the language is quite non-intuitive at first and codes quite differently from other languages, so you have to be willing to endure the steep learning curve.",
                "Depends, if you want to get a solid grasp of the some more basic CS concepts, you might want to take the course. If you're a CS major, then you might have to (unless you can skip to 223). Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",
                "If you are a CS major then you have to take this course. \r\nIf you are not a CS major, I would not recommend you take this course. CS50 is a much better basic exposure to CS, and if you are trying to take CS223, it might be a better use of your time to learn recursion and other concepts on your own.",
                "Yes, a great intellectual challenge. What's cool about CS in general is that you may not come up with the same solution as others, but it'll still work!",
                "Yes, while difficult, I really enjoyed the coursework.",
                "Skip this course if you feel comfortable with Turing machines, circuits, and functional programming, and machine code. Otherwise I'd probably recommend it, as you can't really learn these foundational topics in any other Yale course. However! If you don't care about any of that, take something more practical like CS 200.",
                "I think it teaches fundamentals so yes.",
                "As a requirement for the CS major, yeah. It honestly wasn't as bad as some people say, though. If you start the Psets early and go to office hours, you should be fine! (Also Racket is not bad!!)",
                "Yes if you're interested in learning more about concepts in computer science/need to take it for the major.",
                "I would recommend only if he/she is a computer science major. Other than that, you should do CS50 if looking for an introduction to computer science.",
                "I definitely would. People say that racket is useless bu I don't think we are at Yale to necessarily learn the most practical skills. This course teaches the basics of computer science very well and racket is a fun and actually very capable language in my opinion.",
                "yes if you have to take it",
                "Yes if it is required",
                "Take it if you have to! Otherwise, just take CS50.",
                "No don't take this course. Even as an aspiring CS major myself, it made me want to major in CS",
                "This is required for CS students. If not a CS major, this course is a good introduction but a better option would be CS50.",
                "It needs to be improved and made more accessible to students. Great staff.",
                "It was fun! Don't worry about having to learn racket",
                "Yes, I feel like I am more capable in applying code to accomplish more than rudimentary tasks.",
                "Its a class that I would take only if youre going for the major. Otherwise, CS50 is much better as an intro class.",
                "I would recommend this course to any prospective Computer Science major (because it is a requirement for the major) and anyone who wants to take more advanced Computer Science courses (because it is a prerequisite). Otherwise, I would advise other students to look for other courses. While it was an interesting course, it will not be as useful as courses in other, more widely applicable programming languages.",
                "If you dont feel comfortable with recursion, take this class. If you do, take 223.",
                "Definitely! Its a fun class and you get to learn a lot of computer science topics by doing homework.",
                "I think I benefitted from taking this course but I have the overwhelming feeling that this course has a lot more potential. I would recommend it to another student but I hope that Yale college will work to improve the course.",
                "Even though racket is not a language you will likely ever use, I would recommend this class because it gives you a fresh perspective into computer science. I think that all of the concepts covered in the course were important fundamentals that were intellectually interesting as well.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in pursuing a computer science degree. If you are just interested in learning programming, another course might be a better choice. If, however, you want to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of a computer, this course provides a good introduction.",
                "Only if youre interested in CS or programming in general because you do have to learn a lot",
                "I would recommend tbis course to another student because it evens the playing field and makes you learn in a ceeative way",
                "Yes, you will become a better programmer and learn some interesting things. But if you're going to be annoying about how strange Racket is, take something else.",
                "I would recommend CS 201. Even though some people say that it is not a practical class and that you should just skip to 223, I think it helped me become a lot more confident in my programming skills.",
                "Yes. I think it is a good course for learning a lot of foundational computer science skills. Even though the programming language used, Racket, is not a language that is actually used in the \"real world\", it is very useful to learning how computers work, which was really the focus of the class I think. The lectures can be a little dry at times, but it does feel rewarding whenever you see the tests passed during problem sets.",
                "Well I guess it depends on what you want out of the course. I personally changed my major halfway through sophomore fall so I literally had no coding experience expect for one stat class. I learned cs50 over winter break online by myself and then I went straight into 201, so I'd say don't worry too much about not doing well in the class. It was definitely a struggle in the beginning to learn racket and coding for hours and hours, but over time you get there, and I think it's not as bad as people make it to be. It is a bit unrelated from other programming languages, but the fundamentals are still there. I would suggest going to office hours often and asking questions because that's the only way I could finish the psets as I didn't have many friends taking the class. I also would recommend starting early on the psets too. They're a good challenge and are actually kind of interesting.",
                "Yes, if comp sci major.",
                "Yes it is interesting and has a great support network of peer tutors and teaching fellows.",
                "I would recommend the class because it taught computer science skills in a very interesting and digestible way.",
                "Yes you may not use Racket in the future but you still learn a lot about cs fundamentals that I think would be useful to know going forward",
                "I would not recommend taking this class, but it is necessary for computer science majors. I found this class to be hard and had to spent a lot more than 10 hours on this class' psets and that's not even including studying time for the exam.",
                "I would recommend this course if you have some CS experience and are looking to see if you are interested in pursuing CS. While this was a difficult course and the teaching was a bit rough sometimes, I really enjoyed the work and the concepts taught."
