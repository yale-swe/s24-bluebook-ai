In the course of wrestling with the arguments in the readings, I was left with a more lucid understanding of my own epistemological and metaphysical views about science. The three required papers also helped hone my ability to advance a philosophical argument.",
                "A very good general insight into different views and areas in the Philosophy of Science. You basically learn how philosophers approach scientific theories, hypotheses, hypothesis testing and much more. A good course if you have experience in STEM or just enjoy science generally.",

                "Strengths: the content provided a great survey of the important views and debates under the umbrella of philosophy of science, and Prof Greco did a great job explaining the conceptual basis behind each one in lecture. The readings were also meticulously chosen and always relevant to the content being discussed in lecture. Weaknesses: although this class taught me a lot of philosophical material, there were limited opportunities to actually argue for a particular stance (other than in the essays). I believe this class would benefit from a more 'flipped-classroom'/'seminar' style of pedagogy, wherein more time could be allocated to back-and-forth argumentation in class.",

                "Strengths: Students explore works of a wide range of philosophers.\r\nWeaknesses: some of these works are pretty difficult to read and understand for someone who has no prior experience with philosophical concepts."

                "If you're interested by concepts like the Raven's paradox or the New Riddle of Induction (look them up!), you'll enjoy the type of philosophy done in this course. It's a great introduction to the different facets of the philosophical underpinnings of science, which I believe is imperative for every natural-science-adjacent major to learn about. Prof Greco is also a great lecturer, and an awesome professor to talk philosophy with!",
                "Only if you enjoy writing long philosophical papers evaluating different attitudes and views on science and scientific theories. This is not a gut by any means, you will have to work hard while writing papers and understanding the readings assigned for each class. If you're fine with all that, then this could be a good course for you.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only if it was required or they have great interest in the philosophy of science. If you are not very familiar with scientific thinking and historic examples, this class is a struggle.",
                "Would recommend this course to people interested in philosophy or science, it definitely changed my view of what science is and how it should be done. Science always makes some philosophical assumptions, and for students seriously interested in pursuing science, I think it's worthwhile to learn about these philosophical underpinnings.",
                "If you plan on increasing your skills for analysis, or seeing the usual problem differently then I would highly recommend this course."
