                "Lots of political theory",
                "As other reviews in the past have indicated, this is only partly a course about federalism and institutions  the true gem is a general discussion about issues of trust and loss in democratic theory, which I found really interesting and rewarding",
                "Awesome mix of history and some theory about American political institutions.",
                "I was exposed to a wide variety of views and beliefs in this class, which I felt challenged and strengthened me. I learned a lot about Constitutional change and the different theories that bring it to life.",
                "Knowledge of political theory and how to discuss it",
                "This course harps on thinking of political institutions in theory, and then applies such theory to practical examples, notably to civil right movements in American history. Few courses at Yale do such a great job at integrating philosophy and political science, and after finishing the course, you develop the skill to make the distinction between institutional problems rather than as-applied failures. The weekly assignments force you to think hard of expressing your thoughts in a succinct matter, and your writing is put to the test as you develop your paper throughout the semester.",
                "A deeper understanding of social movements and the structures they seek to change. Emphasis on a deeper language of political theory. I came away from this class feeling like I had developed a deeper skill in talking about political theory.",
                "Understanding of American political theories and history and its contemporary implications.",
                "There was one reading in particular by Schattscheneider about conflict that still sticks with me. That was useful, as well as readings from Vincent Ostrom about constitutional choice and construction. The reading from Jones on the The March on Washington movement was a great reading, too."

                "Great course overall. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I can think of is that it felt like cognitive dissonance to read and take Charles Koch's book in good faith given his involvement in the anti-civil rights John Birch Society at the height of their attacks against MLK, only to then turn around and read MLK (not to mention the countless other ways that Koch Industries undermines democracy). Regardless of the validity of Koch's political theorizing, reading his book felt like consuming propaganda.",

                "S - Loved the paper design\/format\/flexibility. Thought it was very fun to pick my topic and work on it so thoroughly. \r\nW - The class can be a bit challenging when it comes to theoretical\/technical language\/frameworks. It's all common sense ideas, but they can be lost in the words sometimes.",
                "I think this class had great, interesting discussions. If you're very interested in political theory, it's a great class to take! Be warned that it's not very applied, and the discussion is often quite general, so for those with less background in theory it can be difficult to figure out what to contribute and how.",
                "Great activities and discussions to foster deeper understanding. Great facilitation by the professor to engage the students.",
                "I thought this course contained a.lot of fluff. Get rid of the fluff. Get rid of Koch, get rid of Abrams, you might not need as much King, maybe less de Tocqueville."

                "Yes, I would recommend this class if you're interested in American Politics with the question \"How to create change?\". This will look at old and new methods and ideas of constitutional change in a seminar set up that is engaging and interactive.",
                "I'd recommend it to a student with a strong interest in political theory and US history\/founding. Definitely provides a good complement to other courses that are more critical\/specific about US politics and policy.",
                "If you are interested in niche discussions on the instruments of political institutions, absolutely yes! The course is difficult to manage because the readings span from the founding to modern day political issues, but it is well organized to allow your ideas to develop over time until you gain a comprehensive perspective on how and why our institutions function the way they do. I enjoyed this course particularly because it was intellectually challenging, and because Professor Fotos allowed us to develop our ideas through class discussions rather than dictating how we should view the material. This course embodies the way seminars should be taught.",
                "Yes! This course is fun and you get to learn a lot about political theories and analysis.",
                "This is a low ROI course. You had to do the readings, the professor seemed sort of passive-aggressive about doing them, and it didn't always even feel like we needed to do the readings to participate in the conversation (at the beginning of the semester, class activities necessitated doing the readings so that established a bit of a precedent that was not particularly upheld).\r\n\r\nDon't take this course.  The feedback was inconsistent, and the grading seemed arbitrarily harsh. The readings often did not seem particularly insightful, and the discussions, being based in these non-insightful readings, were also not particularly insightful."
