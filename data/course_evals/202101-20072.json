I did not want this class to end.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the semester, some quiz and homework questions were ambiguously written, which made answering them frustrating, but this subsided by the end of the semester and the point totals weren't stressful in the slightest.",

The recorded content-based lectures and untimed quizzed helped me more fully understand the topics presented in class. Finally, we were able to post any questions we had on Ed Discussions which really helped me understand the topic from the points-of-view of my classmates.",

The workload was relatively light and the overall atmosphere was relaxed, yet I still enjoyed learning a lot about a subject that I had previous interest, but not much knowledge, in. The Topic Papers were challenging, but creative and fun to work on. In terms of weaknesses, sometimes the pre-lecture quizzes and problem sets had confusing questions (especially on the multiple choice). There were also sometimes small issues with problem set content, but it was not prohibitive.

Nearly everyone got an A, and especially with several assignments being dropped (1 out of 3 topic paper was dropped, 1 our of 7 Pset was dropped, several pre-class quizzes were dropped) and lot of extra credit opportunities, it was very easy to get an A in the class if you cared even remotely. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The Topic Papers (30%) of the grade was not a great reinforcement or assessment of what we have learned in class. Anyone could have done the topic papers with a little bit of research on their own. Also, I don't think the topic papers had a fair grading rubric as some of the criteria in the rubric included non-astronomy related topics such as the formatting of the paper, the length and wording of the sentences, and the title of the paper. I understand that topic papers were a replacement of the exams, which undeniably lowered our stress, however, I would say the topic papers barely helped my personal understanding of the class content.",
                "It was easy to follow",
                "Strengths: Professor Geha is an excellent lecturer. Making a virtual lecture interesting is very difficult, but she managed to make the live and virtual lectures really engaging. I was initially a bit nervous about taking this course because understanding mathematical concepts is difficult for me; however, she always used metaphors to explain the mathematical concepts in a way that was easily understandable. I learned a lot from this class, and I also really enjoyed taking this class! Weaknesses: This class was a bit more demanding than I expected. The PSets and especially the topic papers took a lot of time to write.",
                "The course was super engaging and the break-out rooms were a great way to allow some discussion about the lecture with others.",
                "S: topic is unbelievably exciting. I have truly formed a passion for the astrophysics that I was exposed to here.\r\nW: none to offer",
                "Strength: Cool concepts, a good surface level intro into the material, very warm and friendly teaching environment \r\nWeaknesses: the class was VERY easy - almost so simplified that I felt like at times I wasn't really learning that much. I understand that the content is very difficult and complicated and the Professor did a great job of simplifying and presenting the material to a non-science audience, but as Yale students I feel like all of us could have done and learned more than we did. Probably one of the easiest classes I've taken, definitely the easiest at Yale and honestly easier than many of my AP classes in high school which I don't see as a positive.",
                "Strengths: very interesting material, very kind professor. I liked that she tried to enforce watching lectures by having straightforward quizzes. Not difficult. Weaknesses: no complaints off the top of my head, I enjoyed it!",

                "This course could be improved if it were in-person because it could be more interactive.",
                "The course is very interesting, and I like that it was broken down into three main units. I think the class could have been improved if the live lectures went into more detail about information raised in the prerecorded lectures, rather than the question/answer format.",
                "I felt like the topic papers were creatively fun, but also felt arbitrary at times especially with no precedent to work off of.",
                "I wish we had field explorations using telescopes, etc. but overall the experience was great.",
                "It was a great course overall that will only be strengthened by returning to in person classes.",
                "Strengths: loved the prerecorded lectures, loved the creativity of the assignments, loved the in-class breakout rooms\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the quizzes were a little stressful. But all very fair and manageable.",
                "Strengths: clear pre-recorded lectures, many TFs available to answer questions, and Professor Geha is fantastic \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "The course is literally perfect in the form that I took it. I genuinely couldn't think of any improvements to the course.",
                "Strengths: Great class for non stem majors and it is well structured. Also really creative assignments that get you excited about what you are learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of weekly work - quizzes for every class and psets",
                "Love Marla and the wag the course was structured. For accessible for non science majors.",
                "Geha was amazing. Materials were interesting. Work was engaging. If you do the work, you succeed. No weaknesses",
                "I think the class was very well run. Additionally, the material was interesting and the psets were not too long. The topic papers were a little bit off putting and I may have preferred exams, but the prompts were certainly interesting to think about.",
                "This class is amazing! Prof. Geha is awesome and cares deeply about her students and the topic materials. The class is very engaging and not too difficult for non-science majors. There are few ways that this class could have been made better.",
                "The strengths were the teaching staff and their care for the material, and the structure of the class itself. It was very fun learning environment focused on helping and aiding the students instead of making it more difficult during this hard time.",
                "The course was generally engaging and gave an overview of a variety of topics. That being said, it was fairly low workload and didn't require a high level of engagement.",
                "strengths: super interesting material, amazing professor and TF team that were great at explaining difficult concepts, short papers instead of exams\r\nweaknesses: consistent workload throughout the semester with prerecorded lectures and short quizzes due before every live lecture, but never overwhelming.",
                "The recorded lectures and notes and Ed Discussion posts made this class extremely accessible for me. Online classes often affect my ability to focus on the material but the resources provided helped me tremendously. \r\nI did have a hard time participating in the large group discussions. The breakout rooms were sometimes really great, and other times they were not. It depended largely on the group of people you ended up with. Overall though, I appreciated the chance to get to know other students and discuss my ideas in a smaller group.",
                "Strengths: excellent and fascinated content. Weaknesses: I think it wouldve been nice to do more hands-on work with that content (math, scientific explanation, etc.), instead of writing.",
                "Some of the class seems like busy work.",
                "Marla & Co. were really incredible  responsive, actively engaged, kind. No objective major improvements can be made to the course other than possibly uploading prerecorded lectures a bit more consistently ahead of class. I do want to say, keep the papers! I think I got a lot more out of them than exams.",

                "I think Prof. Geha and the TFs did an amazing job with ASTR 160 especially in light of the pandemic. I think the course structure was very helpful in facilitating learning while not adding stress to the students. The topic papers were a cool way to explore the subjects more independently too.",
                "This class was very accessible to non-majors, and I didn't have difficulties worrying about my math skills.",

                "This course was strong!",

                "I don't really think this class could improve for an online format. It was designed fairly and interestingly. It wasn't a difficult class, and that was the point of it. It was made to help non-STEM majors enjoy science, and it did that 100%. I loved that we had Topic Papers instead of exams, and I think most people did. Great chance to be creative and think differently.",
                "The strengths are that the essays are a great way to understand the three topics that are taught within the course. A weakness is that the pre-class quizzes are sometimes difficult to stay on top of.",
                "Recorded lectures",
                "Strengths: Professor Geha! She is very engaging and genuinely cares about the course and her students. The material of this course is also very interesting.  If you have even a remote interest in astrophysics, rocket science, exoplanets, or black holes, take this class. The math is not challenging, and you learn a lot even though the workload isn't high.\r\nWeaknesses: none really.",
                "I loved this class! I think a more effective structure would've been virtual lectures with optional sections for the question sessions, but as it was the class was still good.",
                "This is a fantastic course for non-science/non-astro majors. The emphasis/encouragement to ask questions builds a very friendly environment to learn. The course material is intro-friendly and Professor Geha does a wonderful job of simplifying complex topics when necessary. The psets were also very manageable and the topic papers were fun to write.",
                "- weakness- could give more personal feedback",
                "Strength: biggest gut of all time\r\nWeakness: breakout rooms were immensely boring and a lot of people would skip them",
                "Great style, focus, and assignments for non Sc.",
                "The course is quite strong as it is. Perhaps one of its main strengths is that it gives the students an opportunity to ask questions to Prof. Geha directly.",
                "strengths: All of it, in particular how Professor Geha/the TFs made the content accessible for those who had little to no college math/science experience. Also, there was a whole lot of grace extended throughout (grade drops, extra credit, assignment extensions, etc.) The class felt like Professor Geha said \"I love this stuff and want to make it available for others to appreciate as well.\"",
                "The professor and TFs were very engaging, and the material was easy to digest and interesting, taught in approachable manners.",
                "Its overall a great class but the recorded and live lecture is a bit too much",
                "Strengths- supportive staff, straightforward content for non-STEM majors\r\nWeaknesses- I wish we'd received more guidance on the topic papers. The rubric was really specific and it seemed like we glossed over a lot of it.",
                "It was very comprehensive and interesting, but I think that the recorded lectures were very long and could have been given during class time.",
                "No weaknesses. Great class",
                "Great course all around, no suggestions to change. I want to specifically praise the grading format.",
                "Very great course. Well organized and very helpful during this pandemic/zoom year.",
                "Strengths: the class was exactly as advertised; the papers helped apply what we learned in class; the lectures were easily understandable\r\nWeaknesses: the live lectures felt useless at times",
                "The course was well structured, the grading was transparent, the lectures were engaging, and the content was fascinating!",
                "Just about all strengths for this class. The recorded lectures were brilliantly planned and executed, and a ton of work was put into this class outside of class time. The Ed Discussions board was fantastic as a resource, from asking inane questions about course logistics to course material. The TFs were equally as accessible as the Prof. Geha, and shared a wealth of knowledge. If I had to come up with some weaknesses, I think some of the grading was a little harsh for the topic paper assignments, and some of the pre-class quiz questions were a little ambiguous, but given the number of possible points, it was very feasible to do well."

                "Yes but I fear telling more CS majors about this class will overflood it again.",
                "good gut",
                "Yes! Great class if you need a science credit!",
                "Yes, it's a fun and easy course.",
                "YES! Prof Geha is amazing and you will learn interesting concepts in a easy-to-understand way",
                "Yes. For non-STEM students, this is a great introduction science class.",
                "Yes, especially if you are looking for an easy science credit. Nearly everyone in the class got an A/A-, so if you want an easy 5th class, this is the class for you. Professor Geha and the TAs were passionate instructors and they were very friendly. Workload for this class was also very manageable, and the topics are fairly interesting compared to other gutty science class.",
                "Yes! Super fun and easy science credit. I learned a ton about astrophysics in an easy to understand way. Professor Gehia is wonderful and engaging. If you are looking for an easy and fun science gut this is it!",
                "Yes! This is a great class for students who do not consider math to be their strong suit but still want to learn about Astrophysics concepts.",
                "Yes, an amazing science credit for anyone with a slight interest about space.",
                "Definitely recommended especially if you're looking to complete your science credit as a non-science major! A fun course which won't overly burden you!",
                "Yes, especially if you're interested in space! The topics are really interesting and Professor Geha is very engaging. You'll learn about satellites, exoplanets, and black holes.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "If someone is looking for an easy class to learn basic surface level science information then absolutely. If someone is looking for a spring board into more science or is genuinely curious about the material, maybe a higher level class would be better.",
                "Yes! It's a great science credit that's approachable for all majors.",
                "Yeah, its actually very interesting! Cool perspective I wouldnt have gotten otherwise. Really liked the stuff about exoplanet and black hole detection",
                "Definitely! I think the topic will be interesting to everyone, no matter their major or primary interests. It's really important to be able to situate ourselves in the universe we live in, and this class did this really well and opening my mind to all the amazing things around us. The workload is low and completely manageable. Amazing choice for a Sci/QR credit.",
                "Absolutely, especially if you're scared of math/science (like me) and you just think stars and rockets sound cool. That's basically what this course is about! Professor Geha is fun and engaging, even to those who thought this would just be checking off a distributional requirement!",
                "Yes! It's great if you need a fifth class or want a fun science credit for a non-STEM major. It's pretty easy to get an A, and the teaching staff want the class to be interesting and manageable, and the weekly problem sets aren't too bad. It does take a little more to do well on the topic papers, but grading is fair and communicated extremely well (probably the best managed course I've taken so far)",
                "YES.  Best science class ever.  Grading is very chill and you don't have to do all the assignments to get an A.  Low stress.  Learned so much and Professor Geha is amazing and really focuses on student learning.",
                "yes, it's a very good science credit for non-stem or science majors.",
                "Yes! If looking for a science credit or just interested in astronomy, take this class!",
                "Yessir",
                "Yes 100%. Learn a lot, chill atmosphere and the breakout rooms work really well",
                "Yes for gut",
                "Yes, good fifth class",
                "Yes",
                "Yes",
                "science credits don't get better than this. I took biology, the world and us last semester and had to credit d because it sucked. You must take this course if you're looking for a science credit. Just make sure to check that they haven't changed from the spring 2021 format because I believe this was the perfect format.",
                "Yes! Great science credit where you learn a lot.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely. A super fun class that is *very* low stress. If you do the bare minimum, you should be walking out with at least an A-",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, especially if they are not STEM students.",
                "I would recommend this class to a student who needs a QR/SC credit and want to dip their toe into astrophysics.",
                "Take it if you want a science gut, otherwise go take another astr class",
                "Yes, very engaging. If you always wondered about space, insights into how it operates and exists, this is a great class!",
                "Yes, its a great class.",
                "Best science class Ive taken at Yale. If youve ever looked up at the sky and been interested in the stars, the planets, or any part of outer space, you should take this class. Marla provided a great survey and scientific literacy builder on all things space. I really enjoyed this class!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It provides a great introduction to several interesting topics in astrophysics and presents the content in a way that is easy to follow.",
                "Yes 100% take this if you need a science credit",
                "This is hands down the best class I've taken at Yale. If you are at all interested in space in any capacity, please do yourself a favor and take this class. If I wasn't so far down my major, I might've switched to an astronomy degree.",
                "Yes! Especially if you are looking for a science credit",
                "Yes. Take this class if Geha is teaching it.",
                "Absolutely. It is so phenomenal in its content and teaching",
                "Yes, it is a low stress class that still teaches you a lot about an interesting and engaging subject.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this class to another student! It was an amazing class to take, especially for a non STEM student. This is a perfect science credit and it was not too difficult. It also was an amazing class, each bit of information seemed relevant and extremely interesting. Could not recommend more to other people who need their science credit.",
                "Yes, a great fifth course!",
                "Yes, it is a wonderful science credit that is super interesting and engaging.",
                "I took this as a science credit. To be honest, it was more of a gut than I expected, but still had interesting sections and good takeaways. It's worth it if you need the credit, but I think there are better options if not.",
                "absolutely!!! amazing course if you need a science credit or are just interested in astronomy or astrophysics. this was a fantastic course and I'm so glad that I decided to take it! One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale",
                "Yes! absolutely LOVED this class. so much fun and learned a lot, and the workload was pretty low. definitely take it if you have the chance",
                "I would! Prof Geha is so nice, and she really does go way out of her to make sure people are accommodated for and learning as much as they can. She extended the deadline for a large assignment because of Ramadan. I think this is a really great class to take if youre a non Stem person because its not too too challenging but youll still learn a lot. Seriously, getting an A is very achievable with all the support systems they put in place.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. If a student struggles with the sciences or is looking for a class to help get them into science again, this is perfect.",
                "Yes. The class is interesting, engaging, and conducive to learning. Also, I think its really cool that I know this much about black holes now.",
                "yes",
                "Yes. Good SC credit for people who are average at math & want to know about space! Interesting with a good professor, very well organized.",
                "Yes I would. Low stress environment where I learned a lot!!",
                "Yes! Prof is awesome",
                "YES YES YES!! This course is so incredibly fascinating, I would recommend it wholeheartedly",
                "Yes, interesting and easy science credit",
                "Yes definitely!",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course. Even if you have studied physics before, you will learn a lot of cool things about our solar system and universe, and the course is fun.",
                "Take this class! Amazing professor and fascinating content.",
                "Yes loved professor Geha and the class",
                "Yes! Fantastic science course for non-stem majors",
                "I would recommend it to other non-STEM majors looking for a science credit.",
                "If you are in search of a gut science course this is definitely the class! It is both enjoyable and informational without getting to difficult. It is also a good taste of astronomy without becoming a major.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. If you need a science or QR credit, TAKE THIS CLASS. It is fun and easy, and the teaching staff is sweet and engaged. The professor and TAs really care about the students. If you don't need a science or QR credit, I'd recommend this class anyways. I found so much of it engaging and interesting.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I was able to learn the process of writing a scientific paper.",
                "Yes, its fun",
                "Absolutely! This course is incredible for non-STEM-oriented people, and I found it incredibly approachable despite the daunting nature of the topics.",
                "YES! If you are even remotely interested in black holes, rocket science, exoplanets, and NASA, take this class. It's fun, and Professor Geha is great. You learn a lot despite a relatively low workload. The grading is also very clear and transparent.",
                "Yes! It was a great introductory class for someone who knows very little about space and was often daunted by heavy math.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially anyone new or intimidated by science classes. The lectures are friendly and interesting, and the psets are not overly complicated but challenging enough to test your understanding of material. Professor Geha is also an engaging and kind instructor.",
                "Yes, highly recommend for non science majors",
                "If you need an easy science credit take this. Each pset took 15-20 minutes and it was once a week. The drop the lowest scores of each type of assignment so it makes it super easy to get an A (a lot of people didnt have to do the last two weeks of assignments)",
                "Great class for non-Sc people!",
                "yes, especially for science credit  very doable, even for those who arent very stern inclined",
                "Yes, interesting science class if not STEM",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is at least somewhat interested in astrophysics. I came into this course with little to no base knowledge about the topic. Because of the engaging learning format where we were encouraged to ask questions, I managed to learn more about it.",
                "100% if you're looking for an easy but informative gut.",
                "Yes, if you have an interest in the topic. If you're nervous about getting a science credit, this is a great course for you. The prof makes sure everyone gets the help they need to understand the material and succeed. If you put in the work, you can get an A fairly easily, though don't take that as a reason to not do the work or not put effort in, because then you won't be happy with your grade.",
                "I would recommend this course as an introduction science class, especially for those who have little math/science backgrounds.",
                "Yes! I think it's a great course for anyone looking for a science credit.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes",
                "Yes absolutely.",
                "Yes, for a science credit that isn't technical or mathy. You learn a lot of interesting topics.",
                "Absolutely. Amazing content and professor",
                "Yes, if they want an easy but interesting class.",
                "Yes. The material and Prof. Geha are both amazing.",
                "10/10 recommend for non-STEM majors to get a basic fluency in some scientific topics and to get that Sc credit",
                "Yes! This class was awesome! Professor Geha was an incredible professor who understood the difficulties students had this semester and adapted her class to help us the best she could. Even as a humanities person, this class was interesting and I found myself wanting to pay attention in class. I would suggest this class to anyone who needs a fun SC/QR credit.",
                "Yes. This is a great science credit for those non-stem people looking for one. Very interesting material without a lot of hastle.",
                "Yes! Great science credit for non-stem majors that care about the why science and astrophysics are relevant in today's world",
                "YES; if you are non-STEM and slightly interested in studying the heavens, this course was so good. It was a great introduction to the study of astrophysics with a very managable workload.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, no matter their major or experience with astronomy. The course material is interesting and explained well, and even though there were many students enrolled, the semester was very well-structured.",
                "Yes! But it is NOT A GUT. Don't believe what others say. If you treat this as a gut, you can do well. If you pour your time into the class, you'll get an A. The work in this class is extremely fascinating, sometimes extremely difficult to understand, but you'll be astonished when you can comprehend rocket science by the end of the first third of the class. Professor Geha is a gem of a lecturer, and explains things in easy to understand words and examples. Our P-Sets had fun problems on them, like calculate the exhaust velocity of the fire extinguisher Wall-E uses to move on the spaceship in the movie. This was a fantastic class to take for my dreaded SC/QR credit, so I'd 100% recommend it to someone who doesn't freeze up at the mention of numbers and equations. There is a fair amount of math in this course, so heed those warnings about comfort level in math. But otherwise, find a partner or someone to work with, and you're gold. The topic papers were a brilliant change from exams, as I don't think I'd have done well on exams. We wrote a NASA mission proposal, an exoplanet press release, and a dumbed down explanation of black holes (which I didn't even have to do, as I had gotten the sufficient number of points to get an A!). You'd be a fool not to take this class."
