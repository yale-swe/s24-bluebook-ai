                "haha its not an option, but no I would not recommend, writing a thesis is kinda hellish especially if you have procrastination issues since there are zero deadlines until the end. The course should be much more organized by the DUS/department, because right now they don't do a single thing and it makes the entire experience seem much more daunting, confusing, and intimidating. Even just reaching out to all the seniors at the beginning of the year mentioning that this is coming and how/when to find an advisor would have been more helpful. I also would have appreciated a couple more deadlines to keep me more on track. An outline deadline and maybe a draft could have been helpful to me. Zero communication whatsoever is kind of ridiculous."
