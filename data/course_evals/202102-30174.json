                "A strength is the live discussion session held each week. They provided much clarity and allowed for more stimulating thought about the different concepts. A weakness is that there wasn't too much discussion of the weekly problem sets that were assigned, so I never really knew if my answers were correct.",
                "Not very much time learning with the professor - most learning occurred through the pre-recorded material. But the pre-recorded material was very engaging and the workload was low.",
                "Strengths: the course itself is genius,  I found myself chatting about the class often and it is one of those classes that constantly comes up in conversation.\r\nWeakness: the way in which the course is taught. We teach the class to ourselves the whole time and lectures are just q and as that can feel too long with no real learning accomplished.",
                "I generally prefer courses with less of the grade weighted on exams- 80% is a bit high",
                "weaknesses: discussion classes felt unproductive\r\nstrengths: lecture were engaging and informative",
                "Sometimes I felt like it would've been better if the professor lectures during class rather than host two-hour discussion sections--that way we can ask questions as we're learning the material and we don't have to watch lectures AND do readings. However, I understand that it was a lot of lecture material so perhaps that wouldn't have been possible.",
                "The course allows you to learn about a wide range of cognitive topics. I think it could have been improved with more of a focus on emerging research and theories in the field since cognitive science, especially under these domains, is a very new and rapidly developing area.",
                "Discussions with Dr. Wynn and Ashley clarified any confusion on course content and allowed for further analysis of assigned readings/studies. Weekly online reading/lecture viewing was a bit heavy, but that's to be expected with online summer courses.",
                "The strengths of this class were that it was able to communicate a large amount of information in a short amount of time and that every class was essentially a discussion section, allowing students to ask questions. However, the weaknesses were that the lectures were not recently recorded and were not captioned."
