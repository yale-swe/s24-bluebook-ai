                "Strengths: lot of practice and work to improve Chinese \r\nWeaknesses: class wasn't structured the best",
                "Strengths: Extremely rapid pace. Class is taught exclusively in Chinese, and daily 30-minute tutorial sessions really hone in your conversational skills. For me, this class was a turning point in becoming confident enough to speak Chinese\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there were no exams for handwriting (just asynchronous practice) and all exams were asynchronous. This greatly helped in reducing the workload for the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Rapid pace can lead to burnout at times. Voicethread assignments took longer than most other assignments, leading to Mondays and Wednesdays having significantly more homework than Tuesdays and Thursdays.",
                "This course had a variety of assignments to improve my Chinese skills in many aspects, such as listening practices, online dictations, or speaking practices. Also, effort in the course was a signficant portion of the grade so tests alone did not solely determine the grade in this course. Overall I did not feel there were any major weaknesses in the course.",
                "The course was well structured to facilitate student learning. Every chapter was followed by exercises in new vocabulary, reading, and listening comprehension. There were also regular essay assignments which allowed me to consolidate my knowledge of vocabulary and sentence structures. Feedback was also given in a timely manner.",
                "I really enjoyed the overall structure of the class!",

                "It was very work intensive which for me was both a strength and weakness. I was able to rapidly increase my ability in Chinese but also found myself a bit weighed down by the course."

It is still manageable, but the course moves very fast and deadlines are short. It can get a bit stressful. Otherwise, the course is well organized and you will learn a lot. There is a lot of support from teachers and TA's to ensure aid learning.",
