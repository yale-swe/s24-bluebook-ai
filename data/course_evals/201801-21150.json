    "Great course overall! Can't think of of any suggestions for improvements. Classroom activities were all very varied and interesting (ranging from watching movies, playing board games in German, classroom debates, and also more generic grammar and reading exercises). Theresa was great: super friendly, helpful, clear at teaching, responsive, etc. Small class also means you got close to your classmates and they were very fun and funny people",
    "The course is very well taught, but the online exercises that are given are often stupidly mundane or unclear, as they are put up for convenience rather than how well they stimulate learning.",
    "If you play your cards right, this class could occasionally feature a whole dog.",
    "The strengths were the conversational practice it gave you. \r\n\r\nI think there could be more structured and rigorous grammar work and skills such as essay writing or introduction to literature.",
    "The course would benefit from a different online homework textbook"

    "Yes! If you want to keep taking German, Theresa was amazing and this course was probably one of my favorite hours of each day.",
    "Yes, this is about as good as language courses get.",
    "I think its a great course to practice your German but it might not always be the most interesting",
    "Yes, the teacher is very engaging and it does a good job of getting students to practice speaking"
