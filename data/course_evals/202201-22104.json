                "Through this course, I was able to reconnect with my love for ancient Greek civilization and mythology and realized I may want to major in classics. I learned a lot about Sophocles' plays, adaptations of them, and the Western literary canon.",
                "I learned SO MUCH! This class completely altered my perspective on a lot of things and actually impacted my way of thinking permanently. I've bettered my critical analysis skills, and I am so confident in my ability to write. Professor Kraus is amazing and if you're looking for someone to challenge you way of thinking without breaking you down, TAKE THIS COURSE! It was truly my favorite class and I'm so sad that it ended."

                "This course was awesome. I do think Professor Kraus could have possibly split us into small groups for some discussions because it is easy to become distracted over 70 minutes and let other students then carry the discussions.",
                "One strength of this course is how it integrated current social issues with Greek Mythology. I can not stress enough how cool this was, how talented our professor had to be to pull this off, and how much it highlighted problems in our society today. There was absolutely no sugar coating, yet I personally was never uncomfortable. As the only black student in the class, there was never a time that I felt like my opinions weren't valued, taken into consideration, and actually wanted, which is rare considering that this is a PWI. If anything, I became more confident of my thoughts. Another strength was the constructive criticism. I don't think our professor held back when critiquing our work, but there was never a moment where I felt torn down. Instead, it encouraged me to try even harder on my next paper, and actually be excited to come to class. Considering that this class is 1 hr 15 mins long, I always felt like there was never enough class time to finish our discussions. I could've literally talked to my peers and our professor for HOURS and not have been tired. There are really no weaknesses that I can think of off the top of my head besides this class having to end. Kraus is once again an amazing professor and if I could, I would study under her countless times!"

                "YES! TAKE THIS CLASS! It can be very intimidating taking courses at such a prestigious school, but NOT THIS CLASS! Professor Kraus truly valued our opinions and actually liked hearing from us. Her brain, mindset, though processes, everything Is truly immaculate. She is a BRILLIANT professor with a great sense of humor that always offered valuable insight and new ways of looking at things. I would give this class a 100000/10, but I can't so I have to give it a 10/10, lol. Just know that this was such an awesome class, and do not miss out on the chance to take it. I promise, you will not regret it!!!"
