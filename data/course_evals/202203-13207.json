This course based everything off of a strong mathematical foundation and allowed the students to confidently discuss algorithmic issues using the correct vocabulary. This class comprehensively and clearly introduced topics of bias, fairness, privacy, guarantees, and more in computer algorithms while allowing students to conduct their own work and put all the knowledge obtained in the class to use on term long projects.",

                "Strengths - the prof is very smart \r\nWeaknesses - the prof is not very engaging, other students were not engaged, and there was no incentive to be engaged. Then, with the semester long project, Prof. Vishnoi would provide very vague or unimportant feedback (like that of formatting the paper) to wasted our time. Due dates were made last minute (the week of a progress update) and there was zero structure to this class.",

                "I would recommend that other students take the class if they're coming in with a very concrete idea of a topic in fairness\/bias\/privacy\/robustness that they wanna work on. Nisheeth provides a very broad overview of what these ideas are, but I don't think many of them get deep enough to go into multiple concrete algorithms\/methods. It's the type of class where you'd have to wanna read material outside of it in topics you're interested in.",
                "Yes!!! This was one of if not the best computer science class I have taken at Yale. The same class format allowed for engagement and discussion, the lectures were easy to understand and interesting, the material was thoughtfully presented, and the theoretical and practical components of this class were well tied together.  I honestly think this class should be a requirement for the major it is one of the most useful classes you can take in CS!!!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in viewing algorithms and computer science through perspectives beyond \"make the number go up\". It is truly an excellent course, perhaps the most important that I took this semester. Any student in the major, and perhaps even students outside of computer science interested in these topics, would benefit from this.",
                "This was a really big gut; You really don't learn much but it's a super chill way to get a cs credit; I think Prof. Vishnoi needs to add some structure to the class for this to valuable.",
                "Highly recommend if you like thinking about how we exist with technology and the impact that we have on each other."
