We dive into his thought, his relationship to the Enlightenment, his view of natural rights, his Burkean sensibility on certain issues, his reformist bent on others, etc. \r\n\r\nWhat made the class great is that it remains a political theory class. We use history as a starting point for broader discussions about issues of central importance to philosophers, contemporary and historical.",

                "Incredibly interesting course content, structured in a logical way by Professor Smith. The lectures are interesting, the discussions are generally thought provoking.",
                "Strengths: Professor Smith is deeply knowledgeable. He does a great job of picking out Lincoln material and pointing to important moments in his speeches\/writings. And the material itself is very engagingLincoln was a truly special writer\/thinker, and it was enjoyable to see how his thinking evolved from the 1830's through his presidency. Jack was also a great TA.\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "Strengths were the discussions because we talked about very interesting topics in Lincoln's speeches. A weakness was that near the end of the semester the seminars didn't line up with the readings we did for that week, so it was kind of confusing to go back and forth between weeks.",
                "Strengths: the Professor and TA were great, discussions usually went pretty well, the readings are incredibly interesting \r\nWeaknesses: the class was a bit large, maybe 15ish students would be more conducive, but it wasnt a big problem bc we broke off halfway through the seminar into two groups, one led by the Professor and the other the TA, not every reading gets discussed, some were not mentioned at all, at two ten-page papers and a final exam the work was a bit much",
                "Biggest strengths were the TF and Professor and the readings. In a moment where politicians have gone so low, reading Lincoln was quite refreshing.\r\n\r\nBiggest weakness was the amount of writing. Two 10-12 pages papers for a non writing credit class seemed a bit steep. I feel like not much would be lost reducing that requirement to 6-8 pages.",
                "The class has a large (but great) amount of reading, fun assignments, a great structure, and a fantastic syllabus. The only way it could be improved would be by getting rid of the final exam -- a final, long paper would be more rewarding. An otherwise splendid class.",
                "The strengthens were Professor Smith and Jack (the TA) who were both extremely helpful with essay feedback and understanding the content. Also, the discussions and lectures by Professor smith were great",
                "This course was very strong in virtually every aspect.",
                "I very much enjoyed this course",
                "The instructors are very passionate about the material. The readings are great. I definitely learned something interesting every class that gave me greater perspective into historical characters as American history as a whole. I left wanting to take more classes about particular historical characters. \r\n \r\nEventually, if you understand to repeat what the professor has said in your writing (writing that he's grading, not the TF, who had a different style), then you learn a particular mode of thinking - one which is valuable but does not really forgive competing insights to his... Also, the lectures at the beginning of the semester were sort of a rehearsal of the background history we had been reading, more than a study of rhetoric, which was left up to the seminar half of the class, though it was added on to the end of each essay question. This was a weakness, because the seminars were a bit uneven, with different instructors. While both the professor and the TF were really nice, one section was more about students bringing up what they thought, and the other invited participation but was more about accepting the instructor's perspective. In the end, the former gave me a false sense of latitude in my writing, without enough formal knowledge of what they expected to see. However, both instructors were also extremely available for guidance during the writing process and for feedback afterward. I think that the class could benefit from some clarity about what kind of insight and analysis students are supposed to be learning from the class and eventually write about. Also, there should be narrower essay questions.",
                "strengths: prof smith does a great job w the two hour format: half is a lecture placing the speeches in context, the other half is a discussion seminar, which makes the class far more enjoyable\/less tiring, smith's knowledge is really comprehensive, reading is relatively light, themes are hammered into you, TF Jack Greenberg is GREAT\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I did not like the final exam, would rather have written another paper, just felt sort of repetitive\r\n\r\nimprovement: I think we should have read more primary sources responding to Lincoln to place him in context w his peers - e.g. more stephen douglas, seward, herndon, etc"

                "Yes! Lincoln is the best president in American history (you will come to realize that over the course of the semester), so he definitely deserves to be studied. Everyone is familiar with the 2nd Inaugural and the Gettysburg Address, but this class will show you the wealth of other great speeches\/writings in his corpus (the Lyceum Address and the Temperance Address were two highlights for me). Workload is reasonable (expect a few hours of reading\/week, with two 10-12 page midterm papers + a final exam). And the quality of teaching is very high. Professor Smith knows his stuff. The TA, Jack, was great. And grading was fair.",
                "Yes if they are passionate about learning about Lincoln and his work during his political career. Although it is important to note that this class does not work closely with improving your writing or practicing certain writing skills until after the assignments, and there are only three so there are not many opportunities.",
                "Yes-I believe this course isnt offered every year, so I would take it as soon as you can. It works well for a variety of interests - political science\/theory, history, English",
                "This was a super solid course. As a STEM major, I found it accessible and fair. Just note its not really a history course about Lincoln or his era. If you like reading political speeches and thinking, then this will be a good class for you.",
                "Yes, but only if 1) they are deeply interested in Lincoln himself, 2) have some background in American history and political theory, and 3) enjoy both history and philosophy. This is not a class to take to fulfil a requirement, or to get an easy A. But it is a great class for those who want to put it the work and dive into the life and thought of one of America's best statesmen.",
                "Yes, this is an excellent on course to learn about how leaders must govern a state, especially when listening to all sides, and making the best decision to achieve as many goals as possible",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in history, political science or even religion, as it illuminates the past not by imposing any modern lens but by operating within the thought and philosophy of the period.",
                "I would recommend. I learned a lot about one of, if not the, country's greatest presidents.",
                "I have to admit that I felt a bit let down and confused by reviews of past years, which, across the board, recommended this class with no reservations. I would like to qualify my feelings, because of the imposition of the pandemic, but I still think that there are regular factors about this class that would cause me to recommend this course with reservations. It's good because of the material and because of the instructor's sincere belief that a major mode of political science teaching and thought should be a focus on individual statesmen and historical characters. It's great to be exposed to Lincoln's style of thought and writing, which presents a stark contrast to political rhetoric on the national stage today. It is not a class that will help you learn about the polical science major, improve your writing or analysis too much, etc. The seminar component relies highly on the input of class members, but ultimately, the professor will only really want to hear his own insights a second time. By the end, I did really feel like I knew Lincoln well and that this intimate knowledge of his writing that the class helped me cultivate would serve me well in my own future thought and writing, and that's a big thing to take away. Perhaps people who are more experienced than I in writing political science and history papers would not have felt the same burden by the papers that I did, but I felt that I worked so hard to then be burned for not regurgitating the material as it had been given. The multifaceted nature of the prompts gave rise to my confusion. Once I figured out to just repeat what the professor had said, things went better. Basically, interesting for the material and if you keep this advice in mind, a bit of a letdown in some other ways, nice engagement with the instructors outside of class if you want it.",
                "yes - nice mix of poli sci and history, an excellent array of readings (e.g. mix of letters, autobiographies, movies), professor smith is so knowledgeable and funny - cares genuinely about his students and works to make class fun, lincoln is more complicated than you might think"
