                "I was able to learn and develop a deeper knowledge of calculus 2 and I feel that I learned a lot in the course, it felt difficult in class to pick up every detail that they wrote during class. Also it felt like sometimes other classes and professors would give different tips to help learn the content that made it easier for them. Overall I benefited a lot from the class and learning a lot of calculus.",

            "comments": [
                "One strength of the course is that I was able to adequately learn new topics in calculus. Some weaknesses were that the length of the classes made it difficult to concentrate the full amount of time especially with the lecture-style teaching. The structure of the class was not very hands on nor did it promote collaboration which would be expected in a smaller class setting. Usually a couple topics needed to complete the problem set were taught the day before it was due which was unhelpful and made it more stressful to complete under the added time constraint. I also did not like having a problem set due the day before the midterm because we would not receive feedback in time for the midterm or those topics did not appear on the midterm.",
                "Strengths: course structure \r\n\r\nWeakness: student-teacher engagement",
                "I thought the class was very good. The only change that I would make would be having more practice problems available aside from textbook assignments when studying for exams.",
                "Strengths: lots of checkpoints and potential for practice problems, you have an introduction to the material before learning it in class, lots of opportunity for extra health through the professors office hours and peer tutoring \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we go through the material really quickly so it was hard to do enough practice problems for each unit",
                "The strengths are the lower numbers of kids in the class so it is very easy to connect with your professor. He did a great job of trying to help me out where I needed it and which paths to take to make sure I am having success in the course. A weakness I saw, not specifically my course but I heard with other professors that they didn't present the content very easily.",
                "I feel that the learning could be made more interactive which would keep me more engaged with the subject matter being taught.",
                "I really enjoyed the small section arrangement and having an individual instructor for each section, yet this could be a weakness if the instructor is not good.",
                "Too fast paced",
                "Strengths: class work is organized and review sessions are incredibly useful for learning the class concepts and doing well in the class. Of the classes I took this semester, in this class I was most certain about what I needed to do to learn and do well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not find this class to be engaging. Sometimes I would show up at my professor's (a grad student's) office hours with a question about the problem set and after he would go over the problem with me and I submitted the pset, I would realize that the answer he helped me derive was wrong. The course content rarely felt relevant to my life, which is sort of an unfair critique of the class -- I think that's just calculus. In any case, this class did not leave me wanting to take more math classes."

                "I would recommend this to another student I would just caution them with which professor they choose because their ability to retain the information and learn is based on how well their professor presents the information.",
