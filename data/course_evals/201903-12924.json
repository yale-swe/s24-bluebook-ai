    "Critical thinking about different sources, all more or less related to this perceived idea of \"wilderness.\" This was an excellent first humanities course for me. It really challenged my ideas about what wilderness was and what it means, and how different people experience it in different ways. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Writing and critical reading got better. Lots of material on ecology, conservation, colonialism, and the meaning of wilderness.",
    "This course introduced me to the ways that American environmentalists have traditionally understood wilderness and problematized these understandings through the lens of contemporary environmental justice scholarship. Along the way, I became familiar with key terms in contemporary environmental writing and also learned how to interpret a broad array of texts  and materials.",
    "I learned a lot about how wilderness, environmentalism, and the outdoors have been discussed and understood over time and within different communities. I learned a lot about environmental justice and how different communities are impacted by environmental realities.",
    "I learned how to synthesize many sources into a coherent argument. I learned how to effectively manage a large reading load.",
    "I was able to investigate what the idea of wilderness really means. We looked at this topic through many different lenses. I was happy that this course did not just focus on the white environmentalist view. Instead, Carlos made sure to include many Indigenous and Latinx viewpoints.",
    "I learned a lot about the American frontier and borderlands, and got to explore the canon of naturalist and native american literature."

   "comments": [
    "This course was great- Carlos did an excellent job leading the discussion and challenging us to think about the readings in different ways. Additionally, the timeline of assignments was very well spaced out.",
    "Carlos is an excellent seminar leader. The readings were great. Field trips were super fun.",
    "This course was very well organized. I appreciated how each week had a clear topic and that these topics built sequentially from one another. I also appreciated that Prof. Nugent would recapitulate the readings from the previous week and provide a transition from them to the current readings at the beginning of each class. \r\n\r\nThe only (small ) suggestion that I have for improving the course would be to include more essays and primary sources and fewer book introductions. Because the essays were meant to stand alone, I consistently found them to provide a clearer and more cogent argument than the book excerpts we read.",
    "It is great, and the readings are good although a bit heavy at times. It could be improved if there were slightly more assignments that were not just reading and writing.",
    "Strength: Carlos provided unbelievable feedback on our papers. He was always available to meet, whether in person or over the phone, and really encouraged it. Lastly, he was clearly invested in his students' success. \r\nWeakness: I think there were too many readings assigned per week, which left us with not enough time to devote to each piece during class discussion.",
    "The readings were very dense and sometimes too overwhelming combined",
    "The strengths of this course were that the syllabus covered lots of material and built upon itself. Carlos made sure that the space was very open and he was able to facilitate an inclusive and engaging conversation each week. A weakness was that sometimes I felt like there were too many readings and that we had to rush our conversation a little to be able to cover everything.",
    "Strengths: good conversation, readings and subject matter was diverse\r\nweaknesses: too many introductions to books without context, I'd have greatly preferred an actual chapter of the book."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Absolutely would recommend if you are at all interested in the wilderness and its intersections with race, gender, class, etc.",
    "Yes. Field trips super fun. One to Thimble Islands, One to Miya's sushi. You learn a whole lot about wilderness, western united states, colonialism, and conservation.",
    "If you're looking for a course about glorifying trees or mountains, this is not the course for you. While we did read and discuss canonical texts about wilderness by John Muir, Aldo Leopold, and others, our focus was on the people who live in or have constructed wilderness. For this reason, I found this course deeply rewarding. Although I continue to love trees and mountains, I've found that this course has challenged my previously naive idea about wilderness and how Americans have interacted with it. For those who have an interest in nature or simply want to know about the tradition of wilderness in American thought, I highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes, although it is a decent amount of work. Great content and structure",
    "Yes, I would. And definitely if Carlos is teaching it again.",
    "I would recommend this course because it was well organized, engaging, and Carlos is a great professor. I learned so much, received lots of feedback, and thoroughly enjoyed class each week. This class was one of my favorites at Yale!"
