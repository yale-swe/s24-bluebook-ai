                "The material is essential despite being a little boring at times. Junliang is a great strength of the course. He's a very good lecturer and posts clear notes online. Profesor Shen manages to give some applications and motivation for the more boring parts of the class.",
                "The material itself is pretty cool, since many of the things you learn about modules and even category theory generalize and combine results and intuitions from previous courses.  I feel like the course gives a more unified theory of how a lot of algebra work and fits together.  The main strength of the course, however, is Professor Shen.  He is great: engaging, approachable, enthusiastic, etc....  Psets are pretty doable and not that stressful, but I still feel like they did a good job at reinforcing the material.",
                "Strengths: organization is great, content is super cool and interesting. Problem sets problems are constructed so that they are illuminative and help you learn the material much better without being onerous \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none at all",
                "Strengths:\r\nProf. Shen is a very energetic and passionate teacher. The course material is inherently dry, but he was able to do a good job keeping it motivated (mainly through connections to algebraic geometry). Also, the pset feedback\/grading is consistently given within one week, which I appreciated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI wish the course allocated more time towards the later topics (tensor products\/tensor-hom adjunction, the nullstellensatz, etc.) - I feel like too much time is spent reviewing rings + going over modules (especially since everyone has seen rings before, and most people, even if they haven't seen modules, are  comfortable with vector spaces\/linear algebra, a lot of which transfers over).",
                "I learned a lot throughout this course, and it was well organized. The homework was a good review of the in class material. The final exam was more challenging, but still reasonable.",
                "Very well structured and clear, lecture notes followed class extremely well. Homework and exam was reasonable and tested material covered.",
                "The biggest strengths were professor Shen (awesome teacher, really good at explaining, unparalleled chalkboardwork), and the organization of the course. The biggest weakness was the dryness of the material."

                "if youre planning to study algebraic geometry in more depth, i would recommend this class. junliang is a very good lecturer: he gives organized lectures, moves at a good pace, and frequently provides intuition for definitions and proofs. he is also very helpful and clear in office hours. the workload was very low for a math class  our weekly psets only had three questions each, and there was no midterm. however, the class content could be a little dry at times, because the course is really designed to give you the ring and module theory background to take other math courses like algebraic geometry in the future.",
