                "The professors were very engaged with the course and very invested in students' improvement. However, I felt that the course would have benefitted from a more specific syllabus, since I did not anticipate an October and November\/final project consecutively for the last two months of the class. More individual work like the NBA project would also have been helpful.",
                "The strength of the course was the way it mirrored real-life projects one would encounter working as a data scientist.  Students had the opportunity to address challenges set by instructors, with a deadline for completion of either a class period of a specified amount of time outside of class.  We also worked on case studies, longer projects that granted more freedom in choosing data to address a specific research question and crafting a thorough analysis.  These experiences allowed students to work together in a small team format, similar to whats found in the workplace.  There was a good balance between assignments with rigid specifications and those where we had substantial latitude to choose the scope and depth of study.  I liked how the instructors focused more on the way we went about addressing the problem rather than whether or not we arrived at the correct answer.  Such emphasis facilitated more effective learning as we freely explored various methods for solving certain problems without stressing over whether the outcome was perfect.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course included the lack of variety and novelty of certain projects, both of which were simply the unavoidable downsides of the way the course was formatted.  The longer case studies and the broader latitude to work on assignments over multiple weeks allowed students to delve deeply into those projects, but the downside was that there were only a certain number of such assignments that could fit in the semester.  I would have appreciated perhaps a bit more balance in these assignments, allowing us to cover a wider variety of projects rather than working on multiple iterations of the same project.  This, however, is a relatively minor weakness.\r\n\r\nA more substantial weakness was the number of specific in-class challenge assignments we completed.  These including two or three on the construction of a model matrix and three on hypothesis testing under different conditions.  These assignments, in general, felt a bit disconnected from all the data analysis work we were doing - I understand that they represent useful techniques and skills, but we barely integrated that knowledge into the case studies and other assignments completed over the course of the semester.  I didnt mind doing the occasional one-off in-class project; although I found them a bit boring and often challenging and somewhat confusing, I had no problem mixing things up by working on them in the midst of all our data analysis assignments.  It became annoying, however, when we were asked to do the same exact assignment three times in a row with different groups.  By that point, I didnt feel like I was learning much: I hadnt fully understood the assignment the first time it was given, and by the third iteration I simply wanted to be done with it.  This led to a drop-off in engagement.  I feel that this trend - the repetition of somewhat tedious assignments that already are not as concrete and applicable as they could be - was the biggest weakness of the course, and the one major aspect I would want to see changed.",
                "The course has no syllabus so I did not know what to expect each day. It would have been nice to have syllabus so students can not only understand the grading system but also know how to prepare for the next meeting. I still do not understand the grading. It feels pretty arbitrary.",
                "I really enjoyed the weekly office hours because I was able to receive individualized feedback.",
                "Strengths: hands-on, real world application, Elena and Professor Emerson really try to give minimal guidance which challenges you to really figure out things on your own, ask the right questions and understand your work and the assumptions that underlie your analysis. Class time is often spent on working on projects and reinforcing ideas. I do wish more of class time was spent a little bit more on reviewing data methods and statistical theory, and it could've been more on us to spend time outside of class working on our projects, but otherwise, the class is phenomenal - take it as a seminar credit and then do your own research project in the spring! It's super helpful in preparing you to do your own research, as you basically are doing your guided research throughout the class.",
                "I felt restricted by the final project because we were only allowed to do something that included a linear model. I wouldve wished to do something more challenging or interesting for my Statistics capstone. The strengths are the class format, which uses classtime to do group work on projects.",
                "I appreciated this course because you get to learn by actually practicing data analysis. We had multiple opportunities to receive feedback before and after submitting our work. The course format translated well to an online format and was very engaging since we had to do exercises during most of the classes. The main weaknesses are that the workload is variable throughout the beginning of the semester and the grading can be a bit unclear at times.",
                "The course could use one or two more days of structured learning and skill building, but I thought it was largely what I was hoping for.",
                "Very free form, they don't hold your hand. October was a individual or paired case study in which class time was just given for you to work on it. After that, same thing repeated for a final project. September had a series of shorter term assignments that all followed a general project (data scaping from a website which was very interesting)"

                "The synchronous seminars definitely succeeded in engaging class members. I also liked the extra hour meetings, where we had two on one time to talk to Elena. However, I felt that breakout rooms were not always the best use of class time, especially during the months when we worked on group projects.",
                "I do not feel that I missed out on anything by taking this course virtually.  An in-person version likely would have been more conducive to naturally-arising discussion with classmates, but we were split into breakout rooms nearly every lesson, so I got plenty of face time with my peers.  \r\n\r\nThe ability to share screens made the virtual experience smoother than it was for other classes.  I think this course, merely by its design and subject matter, was well-suited to transition to virtual format, and I have no complaints about how it was run or handled in said format.",
                "The one-on-one meetings made it more accessible to interact and develop a relationship with the professor, which I really liked. Elena\/Jay are also the only professors who sent out the zoom link via email every day - I found this practice actually super convenient and easier than trying to find the link in canvas every day since I almost always have my email open. Elena\/Jay were also masters of the breakout room and encouraged a lot of group work in class. I really liked the different challenges they gave us, where they broke us into random teams and we would try to figure out the problem and submit a solution by the end of class.",

                "Yes.  This was one of the best and most engaging courses Ive taken at Yale, especially since I know I want to work with data upon graduation.  I would highly recommend it for anyone in a similar position, since I think it is one of the few courses at Yale (in my experience, at least) that truly emulates real-world duties and responsibilities.  The instructors place more value on a students process and the quality of his\/her code and technique than they do on the correct outcome, a philosophy that encourages students to master the fundamentals and to actually learn from each assignment rather than doing the bare minimum or flying through them.  Such a philosophy, in conjunction with less than typical emphasis on the importance of grades, was a stark reversal of the way basically all of my previous Yale courses were structured.  I think I benefited from this approach because I became personally invested in the assignments for the sake of learning  and because I find data cleaning and analysis quite interesting in general.  \r\n\r\nThe case studies took such self-engagement to the next level, allowing students to thoroughly immerse themselves in projects using real data and confronting the types of challenges - pertaining to data manipulation, research question formulation, and general problem solving - that would likely crop up in the workplace or in academia.  I really enjoyed the opportunity to collect, clean and analyze data from nearly a dozen independent sources in order to model the spread of COVID-19 and its resulting deaths across the United States.  These are the types of projects I hope to which I hope to contribute during my career, and this course offered me a controlled, guided setting from within which to understand how such projects come to fruition.",

For S&DS students, this class is required if you want to use it as your capstone, but I would actually recommend taking it as a seminar as prep for your own research, and then fulfilling the senior requirement with your own research project. I feel a lot more prepared and have an understanding of the research project now, and I get to spend the whole next semester on a project I really care about and like. Doesn't get better than that! Also Elena and Jay are fantastic.",

Usually it is meant as a capstone, but this was the first time offered in the fall and most of the undergrads didn't take it as that. Given this, it would have been nice to have slightly more structure: ~9 weeks were free form devoted to only 2 projects but I enjoyed the beginning in which we were able to practice more specific skills in smaller-scope projects."
