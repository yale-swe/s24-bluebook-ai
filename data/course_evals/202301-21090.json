                "Strengths: Holmes is a great professor. Very chill with the reading responses even though the syllabus seems to indicate otherwise. Super knowledgeable and explained difficult concepts clearly. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some jump starts were extremely long (25-30 minutes) which was problematic when 5-6 people had to present per class. This led to rushed discussions towards the end of class and some students not getting enough time to present their jump start. This could be improved by imposing stricter limits on the amount of time per jump start. Sometimes, no one was interested in a particular paper which led to little conversation. Also, there were a lot of readings per week (4-6 papers) so we didn't get to talk about each one in-depth.",
                "The course is mainly run by student presentations, which gives us a chance to discuss the topics anyway we want.",
                "Strengths - I learned a lot!\r\nWeaknesses - It may have been nice to have a very high level overview of each reading given at the start of the class by the professor.",
                "Strengths: Very chill and comfortable environment  where you can discuss psychology and neuroscience topics with other students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Most of the classes are student led discussions so it can be a little difficult to fully engage in the conversations when you are less familiar with certain topics but prof holmes did a great job of explaining topics that students were less familiar with",
                "you get to discuss interesting papers, great way to learn about added stress",
                "The course is what you put into it. You can get a lot out of it, but also if you dont put it in the work, you can just float. I really liked how we were free to hav e conversations, and it wasnt  too structured",
                "I think a strength was the fact that the class was very focused on discussion which was really nice to be able to hear other people's thoughts and discuss the papers and the results from it. I think a weakness though is that I wish that there was a part of the class where we could learn about the topic focused on for the week and maybe get a little introduction about it. It would have been cool to have a portion of the class that was like an interactive presentation where we heard about general/important knowledge about the field and have a time to hear thoughts about someone who is currently in the field.",
                "Prof Holmes included a wide variety of papers from the field and we were able to talk about each of them in depth. I did not like that even though we were supposed to read the papers prior to class, we spent most of class time summarizing the required readings. I think more time should be spent on discussions and questions."
