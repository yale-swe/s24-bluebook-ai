                "During this course, I significantly increased my ability to speak and read Chinese. We all became significantly more conversational and more able to use Chinese in real-life contexts. We got much better at debating and speaking entirely in Chinese.",
                "I continued to build my knowledge of Chinese and gained more skills.",
                "I improved my Chinese reading and speaking skills! Since we mainly talked in Chinese throughout the class, we were constantly being immersed in the language so it helped us get used to hearing and understanding Chinese.",
                "I improved my Chinese speaking, reading and listening skills \r\nI slightly improved my writing skills \r\nI learnt to work in groups and partners for different projects and tasks",
                "A good grasp of intermediate-level Chinese, including some advanced sentence structures and vocabulary.",
                "I developed a deeper understanding of grammar structures and vocabulary. I think I improved greatly on my speaking skills.",
                "Chinese speaking, reading, and listening skills were the focus of the course, and I felt that material was effective in improving students' abilities in these areas. I feel more comfortable using Chinese on a daily basis, and I feel that L3 is a pretty high step up from the ability I left L2 with. Material is intended for students who've been in the groove of Chinese learning for a while, so it can move faster without feeling overwhelming. I am very glad I took this course, my Chinese has improved a lot!"

I would appreciate if everything was just on Canvas.",
                "The structure of the course is very effective and straightforward. It rewards improvement and, with the proper effort, is very easy to succeed in. I think the department has hit the nail on the head when it comes to how it teaches this course. People's comments about the course being too much work are overblown.",
                "The main strength is the amount of contact time in class, and the nightly assignments. This helped improve my level of Chinese. I think the textbook was good and the setup of the week in class was well structured. \r\n\r\nA possible weakness  was that it felt a bit repetitive, doing the vocab on Monday, reading quiz Tuesday... and so on. Also the exams were too heavily focused on grammar particles and not enough on comprehensions I felt.",
                "Strengths: the teachers put in an unimaginable amount of effort into this class, and the class is extremely well-structured. Weaknesses: at times, the four-day-a-week pattern can get tiring, but class was still almost always fun because of the energy Ao laoshi put into it.",
                "There is a lot of work, much of which I feel could be omitted. I think getting rid of the Quia reading quizzes in exchange for grammar practice questions similar to the ones that appear on examinations could be more beneficial."

                "Yes! This is the class you take to learn Chinese. After just three semesters, I am on the same level as some of my peers who have taken Chinese for 5+ years. Do not expect this class to be easy. Languages require daily practice and you need to dedicate your time to learning it.",
                "Without a doubt! As long as you are willing to put in the work, because it isn't easy, this is an amazing course. It's very engaging and you learn a lot!",
                "Certainly! Ao Laoshi was amazing and you learn to take hold in new interesting conversations in this level.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because even though it is more work compared to other classes, it does help you develop your Chinese skills and it definitely pays off. You also get to make amazing friends and have a good time.",
                "Yes, if they're at the right level of Chinese and want to improve",
                "This course is not for the weak-hearted; daily homework is not the most exciting thing to look forward to after a long day. However, I still think this course is definitely worth the work you have to put in - my Chinese has definitely improved by leaps and bounds this semester.",
                "Yes definitely! I would recommend Ao LaoShi in particular; she is incredible!",
                "I would recommend this course! Especially if you plan to continue on learning Chinese in L4, this is a great stepping stone that will help you improve your overall Chinese ability."
