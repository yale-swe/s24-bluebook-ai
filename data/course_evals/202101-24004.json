                "I learned how anthropologists have studied social movements and how to employ the same analytical tools to do so myself. Each week we were presented with different analytical frameworks that have been used to understand social movements and we discussed the relative merits and limitations of many of them.",
                "I learned about different social movements in Eastern Europe, as well as around the world. We looked at an array of movements and the ways they frame their arguments, attract supporters, and how anthropologists write about them. I gained a significant amount of vocabulary and theory concerning social movements and social theory in general.",
                "So much social movement theory. We summed it all up in the last class session. Some thing that stick out: social habitus formation, social death, poisoning the air, transnationalism, arts as resistance, communitas and liminality, sympathy pool, collective effervescence, and a ridiculous amount of information on movements in Ukraine, Russia, Mexico, Nicaragua, South Africa, Bosnia, Albania, the US, Genoa, France, Poland, Germany, Georgia (the country), and so so so many other countries I'm forgetting."

                "This is an overall well-designed course that would have benefitted from having a Spring Break to give students a break from the high level of work this course demands, but that is outside of the professor's control.",
                "The course was always structured well and we built on topics each week. We started each class with a quick recap of real-world movements and how we tied them in with what we learned. Aga gave us a lot of guidance with our final projects and was great at facilitating discussions. Everyone was engaged and we were able to learn so much from the readings, assignments, and each other. We got great feedback for our reading responses but the only weakness I can think of is the fact that we did not know much about our grades at any point.",
                "STRENGTHS: brilliant class. Breakout rooms were amazing. The activities were groundbreaking. I genuinely looked forward to Monday afternoons and having class for two hours - and no break! It was just that good. Assignments were doable, readings were all interesting, documentaries were fascinating, and Aga was a fantastic facilitator. She not only allowed for everyone to speak but also didn't just respond with a \"thanks for that\" and moved on, but actually provided constructive feedback that challenged opinions. WEAK: I hated how little feedback we got. 6 reading responses, 2 sets of feedback out of a promised 3, and the second one was around two sentences long vs. the first that was a few paragraphs. And then two sentences of feedback on a 4000+ word research paper was really, really aggravating, if not disappointing. If I'm going to pour my heart and soul into your class and paper, the least you could do is provide some written feedback."

                "I would strongly recommend this course! Aga is wonderful and created such an interesting and necessary course for anyone interested in any aspect of social movements. This was one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale and I feel I've learned so much that I can use later. The discussions were amazing and our class was very close. The environment was always welcoming and our discussions were exciting and insightful.",
                "100% yes. Fantastic class, fantastic professor, small class size, intimate and welcoming environment. She brought in guest speakers too which was so cool - accomplished anthropologists came to give presentations to our measly class of 6??? What??? So cool. Groundbreaking, revolutionary, mindblowing. This is what other classes hope they could be."
