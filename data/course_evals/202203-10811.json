                "The structure of the class was not very helpful. Topics weren't always clearly explained even when clarification was requested. I often turned to peers or peer tutors for math support.",
                "This course has strengths in problem-solving. For problems not directly related to calculus, but still used calculus, it was interesting to learn the processes to solve these problems. Additionally, although there was not an emphasis on proofs, it was helpful to have proofs spread out throughout the lessons. There's not much that can be done to improve this course."
