                "The content is really interesting. It's really interesting to see the parallels between computer vision and human vision, and see how we learn about each from the other.\r\n\r\nActually, the content is FASCINATING!\r\n\r\nHowever, everything else about this class is a mess. There is 0 communication among the teaching staff. The one TA was out of the country for the entire semester and only would hold office hours at inconvenient times on Zoom. \r\n24 hours before the midterm exam, the professor discovered that we had not received even a single graded assignment (and only because we told him in class).\r\nIt is not clear at all how to study for the exams. There are no example problems or even a specific list of topics or ideas that might be on the exam.\r\n\r\nZucker's lectures are totally unstructured. From the start of lecture to the end it's just a high-speed whirlwind stream-of-consciousness developing ideas, but without any meaningful preface of what those ideas are supposed to be. I could never expect where a lecture would end based on where it began. It is not clear at all which ideas are important, or even the main ideas. Zucker's math is all very handwavey, his notation is never consistent. His lecture notes are long, rambling, and also lack any notational consistency.\r\n\r\nTruly though, the content of the class really is deeply interesting. The neurological and computational ideas that are presented are really beautiful, it's just often hard to see them.",
                "This course was well taught but not at all organized, many homework assignments were returned months after they were due and their was very little feedback on them. Expectations on exams were not clear and there was not a lot of support for the students.",
                "Strong applications for this, the homeworks were not very applicable to the exams though.",
                "Weaknesses: the course was a little disorganized in terms of the communication between the prof and TAs. E.g. it often took a very long time for us to get grades back on assignments, and the prof always seemed surprised and unaware that this was the case. Because different TAs graded different things, the grading was also inconsistent on PSets vs. tests, for example.\r\nStrengths: the main strengths of this course were the content and the professor. The content was beautiful and fascinating, and the professor was funny, warm, caring, smart, and passionate.",
                "office hours literally not available, too much emphasis on math and memorization in the exams",
                "Professor Zucker is a huge strength of this course. His humor and enthusiasm for the material shined through and made lectures very engaging. The homework assignments were interesting as well and an appropriate level of challenge. The only difficulty, which may just be a function of the material, was that if one got behind in a lecture it was pretty challenging to catch up. That being said, slides were available for all of the content and lecture notes for most of it, so I wouldn't recommend that the course material be condensed much at all. Another weakness was that it was slightly unclear how much of the (extremely-dense) content on the slides was meant to be memorized for exams, although the guidelines in review sessions were helpful. The last problem was a frankly ridiculous lack of grading on the part of the TA, but this was out of Professor Zucker's control.",
                "Strength: very interesting material\r\nWeakness: terribly organized, impossible to follow",
                "Very disorganized lectures and notes make it difficult to understand what knowledge we're expected to know.\r\nThe professor is extremely passionate about the subject.",
                "Strengths: imo, the material is super interesting. And the way everything comes together at the end shows a thoughtfulness in organizing the material to teach students a highly complex process in pretty high detail. Exams are well written, so dont feel like you need to memorize all material. Focus on the crucial parts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: however, Professor Zucker is not that great a lecturer; his notes and lecture style are highly disorganized. Lecture notes are often incomplete (including empty sections and sentences that just cut off) and accompanying slides have almost no information to be able to follow off of. If you dont go to lecture, its impossible to follow along the course. And his lectures are often meandering and hard to follow.",
                "The material taught in this class is very interesting, and the problem sets are engaging and relatively straightforward. However, the course is relatively weak in terms of the lecture slides, and could benefit through recorded lectures or more thorough slides.",
                "Strengths: a lot of interesting material, and problem set were well written and interesting (and not too challenging).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were given at a very fast pace and there was usually too much content to absorb most of it in the lecture.",
                "Lectures not engaging, hard to follow because the information is disorganized. Would be better if they kept a bigger picture in mind",
                "Super interesting content but the lectures were quite dense and hard to follow. I wish I had more math knowledge coming in, especially of linear algebra. The psets can be hard to understand but once you spend some time with it, the content is actually really interesting.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Lectures are taught in logical order from most simple to most complex\r\n- Strong focus on math as opposed to just coding\r\n- Interesting content and tangible connections to biological systems\r\n- Science credit for CS and CS-adjacent majors\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Grading was never punctual, and homework solutions were never released because the problems are reused every year. As I type this, I have a final grade but the last two homeworks and final exam are not in Canvas. \r\n- Homeworks were on the easier side and not very effective at reinforcing the rigorous lectures. I honestly feel like the Jupyter notebook\/Matlab-based assignments would be bespoke freshman-level material. It was always simple to complete, but not very engaging.",
                "This course has great lectures and interesting material. Steve Zucker is also a really nice guy and is haply to answer all questions. \r\n\r\nI wish there was some provided exam prep material.",

However, you can code everything using Matlab so don't be afraid to take this course (plus a lot of the topics like FT, convolution, etc,... are covered in other BME classes so you have a strong background already). You do not get any feedback on your exams or homework though and grading is slow.",

It is also comparatively low workload for anyone concerned about that. I know this is often a course CS students take for a science credit, but it is genuinely worth it and contains lots of interesting CS content as well. As a computational biology student I will admit that this course played well to my interests, but I also did not come into the semester planning on taking it and was sold by the two lectures I intended during add\/drop. So at the very least I'd encourage anyone to try attending a couple of classes before counting it outl.",
