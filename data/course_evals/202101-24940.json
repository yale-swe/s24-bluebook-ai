                "I definitely learned more about my own writing process as well as the different tools that are available to playwrights. Reading others' work was just as helpful as workshopping my own, and I think I definitely started to view playwriting as a conversational act because of how everyone's work influenced each other's.",
                "This class balances studying previous works (mostly Off-Broadway short one-act plays) with workshopping new student-written material. By writing three short (10-30 page) plays throughout the semester, students learn more about their own writing style and receive helpful feedback.",
                "Because this was a workshop seminar, I learned about the value of process, imperfection, and editing. We wrote 3 short plays over the course of the semester which also allowed me to further understand the different voices I have and stories that I can tell.",
                "THST 321 was my first college-level playwriting course, and the expertise of someone like Professor Jacobs-Jenkins was invaluable. He was detail-oriented and interrogative when giving feedback on our works, but he always prompted us to trust our instincts and to let our choices guide the trajectory of each play. I feel I'm walking away from this course knowing what sort of questions I have to ask of myself (and others) in strengthening my dramatic writing. Additionally, while this course focused on short plays, it undoubtedly laid a framework for the production of longer works."

                "I think this course was very strong as a workshop, but I wish that we had more writing exercises in class like the ones we did on the first day. I think short assignments like those would keep things interesting and help to find ways into our longer assignments.",
                "This class has such an emphasis on student voice and work, which definitely is a strength in terms of growth and learning. Structurally, the class is organized around each student having three workshops, writing one new short play for each. This is super unique compared to other playwriting classes offered at Yale, which normally have you workshop bits and pieces from just one long play that you write all semester. This three short play structure emphasizes experimentation, improvement, and a 'work-in-progress'/first draft mindset, which is all so important to becoming a better playwright.",
                "I see no major weaknesses of this course. It was a deeply enjoyable, intimate seminar that achieved an admirable balance of workshopping, focus on texts by professional playwrights, and analysis/discussion of media in general, which synthesized very effectively."
