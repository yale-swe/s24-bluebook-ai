I really liked using books and movies to learn French as opposed to French In Action."

Also on the final exam, in any other normal context you could use a dictionary or look up the conjugation of a word before writing something in french, so on the essay portion, we should be allowed to do that.",

Professor Turcat was kind and gentle, but also intent on teaching us the mechanics of French. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, I think there *could* be a system of checking the homework, since I feel like I fell off when I would occasionally drop assignments and there was no punishment."
