We also learned how to use resources like Verterbukh to look up forms we dont know.  \r\n\r\nBy the end you can pretty reliable translate an unseen document well with the aid of a dictionary",
                "I learned to translate yiddish text ranging from Eastern European 18th century text to modern US Hasidic writings. I also learned a lot about Yiddish culture and Jewish history that I hadnt learned in any other class at Yale.",
                "Basic grammar of Yiddish with a ton of interesting translation work.",

We explored a really wide range of Yiddish text\/writers. It does move really really fast though, which can be difficult to manage at times.",

                "Take this class! Take it earlyif youre at all interested in doing research\/taking other Jewish studies classes, its invaluable to be able to read (or at least get the gist of) Yiddish primary sources. Its also just such a wonderful learning environment. Its never about the grade or an assignment, its about learning the material and if you make a mistake, you fix it without worry about being penalized. Josh lets you ask questions and explore topics that interest you and really it feels like learning for the sake of learning and improving your skill level.",
                "Yes, 100%. Take it if youd like to dabble in Yiddish. If youre sure you want to learn to speak the language, take L1-L2, but this class will get you translating with a dictionary quickly.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It was a great way to learn a bit of Yiddish while also getting to read important Yiddish texts. Josh Price is a very kind and helpful teacher. He clearly cares a lot about the Yiddish language and is very knowledgeable about the langauge."
