                "Learned about many different topics ranging from inequality of opportunity to problems with the US healthcare system, to wealth inequality, to climate change. An awesome analysis of issues which we usually talk about at surface level. This class uses data to back up conclusions regarding these topics. It reminded me that date is crucial in todays world",
                "I was exposed to a wide swath of economics research in areas like equality of opportunity, climate change, and criminal justice. I learned a lot about the various different areas in which economists specialize, as well as a glimpse into some of the research methods they use.",
                "Learned sooo much about the field of economics. Its so much more than I thought it was",
                "I learned more about social issues in America through the lens of economics (e.g. student loans/debts, generational mobility, environmental justice, etc), as well as being able to code / interpret economic empirical data.",
                "I learned about the economic impact and implication of many different social issues that id touched on or heard about in other contexts but never studied or really thought about as relating to economic impacts",
                "Goes over a variety of social issues so that you can  have more insightful conversations in the future. Develops discussion skills and also demonstrates the connected nature of many of Americas issues.",
                "as a prospective econ major, I felt that econ 002 expanded my perspective on real world issues related to economics. I felt that this class was relevant and very informative in general, and that it was important for me to understand the topics of this course for my general knowledge.",
                "I learned a lot about social issues in America from an economic standpoint. I am better equipped to evaluate empirical evidence as well as synthesize economic papers. Overall, I am better educated to talk about social issues regarding our country today."

                "Strengths: interesting guest lectures, insightful readings, Toseland is an amazing lecturer.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Professor Toseland and speakers she brought in. Great selection of readings. Weakness: moved kind of fast sometimes but thats just because we had so much interesting material to get through.",
                "The biggest strength of this class is Rebecca - she is simply awesome. She's incredibly knowledgable, kind, hard-working, and empathetic. She has clearly put an incredible amount of work into making this class a success, and she's also just a wonderful person to get to know. Beyond that, the content is also a strength of this class: it's well-organized and comprehensive. I'd say the one area for improvement would be the empirical projects - they're really interesting and I very much enjoyed working on them, but I'd say they could maybe use a little more introduction and instruction in class before each one to allow us to get to know the techniques a little better.",
                "I think towards the beginning of the semester, the format of the class was more each student going around and talking about something in the readings and then after that, prof spending much of the class going through slides that largely reviewed readings. There wasnt much discussion. By the end, there definitely was! The class felt a lot like a conversation w students and prof not just sharing thoughts and insights but responding to each other.",
                "Strengths: great focus on current, concrete issues with a variety of proposed/experimented solutions for solving them. Class discussions were always a way to share opinions and often the perspectives of classmates were eye-opening and insightful.\r\nThe only weakness (if it is one) is the inclusion of coding but without a strong emphasis on it. It is mainly something the student has to self study, though Prof. Toseland makes herself incredibly accessible to the student, mitigating the issue of it arises.",
                "I loved this course as an overview of the way economics ties into many different social issues. I thought it was incredibly well taught and organized and the readings materials and assignments were meaningful. The only thing that i think might be improved would be the organization of class discussions and less going around the room and sharing thoughts on the readings and more sharing and discussion by choice because it would get a little repetitive.",
                "Strengths: great instructor, good pace, good variety of topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some topics are covered only at a surface level, though she gives you plenty of resources to continue learning about each topic outside of the class",
                "The lectures were often not as engaging as it could have been, and there were often so many readings that it was hard to keep up without skimming the material and feeling frustrated that there wasn't enough time to absorb all that content. A majority of the class struggled with the R coding projects and I felt it was unfair because it was incredibly difficult for me to learn that by myself, as it was not clearly taught in class. \r\nThat being said, the course was eye-opening, and when the class was engaged, there were many memorable discussions.",
                "This class was extremely engaging, with a perfect amount of work and discussion. I never felt bogged down by this course and I was always excited to participate. The outline for the course provided a fun learning environment that wasn't stressful or frustrating."

                "Yes! It teaches you to look at the data.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class. If you're passionate about social issues from racial opportunity gaps to climate change, and if you're interested in how data can help us understand those issues, this class is for you. You'll be exposed to a wide array of economic studies in these areas and get a better understanding of what the field of economics looks like outside of the traditional intro micro/macro sequence. Finally, you'll have one of the best instructors Yale has.",
                "Yes! My favorite class of the semester. Prof. Toseland is incredible and the course is structured very well in a stress-free environment. I gained new insights into complex societal issues, and gained knowledge on key policies and policy proposals. I would recommend this class to any major",
                "YES!!! Great prof, great course. If you are interested in supplementing your knowledge of social issues by looking at things from a quantitive perspective, take this course! Data is cool",
                "Absolutely. The professor is amazing and you come out a little more aware of issues many of us already have slight grasps on (though this class will, evidently, take the economic aspect of discussed social problems).",
                "Most definitely. This course was wonderful. A great first year seminar and way to explore and confirm ones interest in econ and potentially  social policy",
                "Yes!! If you need a low workload class that is still engaging. Only 3 major assignments, and the final paper gives you lots of freedom to choose a topic. Most of the work consists of readings. \r\nDont let the coding portion of the class scare you off - you are walked through it and it is not as hard as it looks, even if you have no experience.",
                "Yes - again, I think the material in this course is extremely relevant for most, if not all, majors",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. This course was my favorite one of the semester, because I learned so much and I was so excited to go to class every day. So many people major in economics at Yale, and I feel like this class provided an outside-of-the box perspective on economics, with an emphasis on the social side."
