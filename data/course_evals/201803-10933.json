   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the structure of the class was nice and the work load was manageable; however, it felt as though we were rushing into many new topics towards the end.",
    "It was overall a pretty good course with good teaching and problem sets, but the pre-class quizzes were not helpful.",
    "Strengths: So many opportunities to get help, great textbook, engaging class, fun topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The psets could be a tad easier.",
    "Because of the pace of the course and because of Prof. Ozolins's teaching method, much of the learning is done outside of the classroom (i.e. lots and lots of textbook reading). I wish there was a better and less grueling way to learn the material",
    "The major weakness of this course was the design of the lecture. The lectures were not very engaging, and many times, they were hard to follow. Frequently, the class would have to stop Professor Ozolins to have him repeat a point or show all his work and mental steps that he took in solving an example problem. I wish that the lectures could have been better structured to add more clarity. The strength of this course was the workload and the grading system. The quizzes and the problem sets were perfectly designed to help us understand the concepts that we were learning and how to apply them without overwhelming us with work. The grading system allowed us to make mistakes on some assignments and still do well in the course if we improved upon our errors.",
    "This class is taught so much better than MATH 120. The material is presented in the same logical order as the textbook allowing for connections to be made between each new section and the older ones. The course was also very fair in preparing students for the exams. Numerous different practice exams were provided on Canvas, allowing me to get a good understanding of how the questions are worded. The exams themselves are noncumulative and focus on the topics corresponding to their respective chapters. Because of this, the course really challenged me to not only understand how the theorems are used, but to also be able to connect their applications to other theorems. The problem sets were also worth doing as they provided good practice for the exams. Overall, a very fair and rewarding class.",
    "Strengths: small class; good pace; tests are reasonably difficult and definitely test what we learn in class\r\nWeaknesses: flipped classroom\r\n\r\nThere should be more of a focus on doing example problems rather than the derivations.",
    "Maybe lectures could teach something. Maybe not quizzing students on the topics before they're taught in the lectures. Maybe make the pets and tests doable.",
    "It is strong because it does give a more applied approach to multivariable calculus in the sense that they give you equations and you apply them to problems rather than just doing proofs; however, this course was not smaller than Math 120 courses, the professor was okay most of the time, and sometimes great and sometimes bad, and a lot of independent learning was required.",
    "It moved very quickly, so there was a lot of self teaching involved. However by the end I did feel pretty confident on all the topics.",
    "It could be improved if more emphasis was put on examples rather than proofs when learning concepts.  Also if professor office hours were more accessible to all students, learning concepts would be a bit easier.",
    "There is a lot of material available to study for each exam, which helps tremendously if you do them. However, we still had psets due the day before exams and doing them didn't guarantee success. The grading is a blessing, especially since the three lowest psets are dropped and each exam in noncumulative. be ready to put in the work.",
    "Strength is the material is explained in great depth, other than the last unit when it felt rushed. The weakness of this in-depth explanation is that the professor often spent time proving theorems whose proofs we did not need to know, leading to added confusion on what material we were responsible for.",
    "Vidvuds is a great professor. He's so witty and relatable in the classroom, and he is very helpful in office hours. The TFs are also extremely helpful, and they also have study hall hours which is a nice way to bond with the class too. \r\nI was confused leaving most of the classes, but that got cleared up after watching some youTube videos.",
    "Moved at a slightly high pace, I felt that Green's\/Stokes'\/Divergence theorems were not taught well - content was derived from a proof, but I never received a solid explanation for when to use each theorem and had to learn how to use them from the book\/problem sets, as opposed to the instructor.",
    "Very well taught and highly organized. No complaints.",
    "This course was very frustrating for me because I felt like it was catered toward people who have already taken multivariable calculus before and had at least seen the majority of the concepts we discussed (which was definitely not a prerequisite for the course). The pace and the way things were explained was not conducive to someone like me who had just finished calc II (i.e. AP calculus BC) in high school. I did quite well in that class and have enjoyed math, but I left this class feeling generally incompetent and stupid for not being able to catch onto things as quickly as people who were more familiar with the material. Because I felt like I was always needing to catch up, I rarely found enjoyment in the work and struggled just to get through the PSET every week. This is because I had to re-read everything on my own after class, not having time to process everything that was said during class and therefore having a lack of understanding. Our prof would often say things like obviously this is what you should do or this is very simple about things that were definitely not simple or obvious. I talked with several of my classmates who had the same frustration. But this kind of attitude from a prof made me feel discouraged from asking questions about things that were supposed to be obvious and simple. I think this class would be exponentially better if our prof approached the class as if we had never seen the concepts beforebecause many of us hadnt and I was placed into this level of math by Yale College. I think the level of stress and outside work I had to do for this class, compared to the amount that I actually grasped in class, was unfair and probably the most stressful part of my college experience this semester.",
    "the course just moves at a fast pace in general, which can be a challenge sometimes when moving through difficult topics. But I did appreciate how we did have a buffer at the end of the semester from when we stopped learning new material and when reading week \/ studying for finals began",
    "One strength is that the material was taught via lecture and writing on a chalkboard as opposed to just reading lecture slides which helped the students learn better. Another strength is that the Professor brought humor into the course making it very enjoyable. One weakness is that not many engineering applications were taught for how to apply the math being learned. Another was that there was never enough time in class to do all the examples the students and professor would have liked to do.",
    "The strengths are that I believe the class covered all the material necessary and there are very helpful study sessions twice a week. With that some weaknesses are that the engagement was often minimal in class and sometimes some topics seemed to be rushed."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to my friends. I learned a lot of information and enjoyed the teacher's lessons.",
    "Yes, this is a good foundation in multivariable calculus that will serve students well in further studies",
    "Yes, as long as they are majoring in sciences because it was a well-taught class that allowed you to understand and succeed.",
    "Yes! ENAS is the best way to go if you need to take 120! It's so much fun, and it actually makes multi make sense! The TAs really help you learn too!",
    "This course is definitely better than MATH 120, but only slightly",
    "I would recommend! Prof Ozolins is a good professor, although he does move through material VERY quickly. If you don't already have a pretty thorough understanding of the topics before the lecture, it's extremely difficult to know what's going on during class. This means that a lot of the learning requires you to read a textbook from cover to cover, which is never fun. \r\nIf you put in the effort, you will love Prof Ozolins (he's an incredibly interesting guy and has an awesome sense of humor). If you don't, then you probably won't.",
    "If you have to take multi-variable calculus at Yale, ENAS 151 is a much better alternative to MATH 120.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for engineering students needing to take a multivariable calculus course. The material is presented in a more straightforward way than MATH 120 and the problem sets and practice exams do a much better job at preparing students for the exams. Additionally, the intimate setting of having only one section allows one to better get to know the other students in the class. In comparison to MATH 120, I was quickly able to form a study group with others.",
    "Yes; the professor is very helpful and understanding and the material is manageable.",
    "If you have to take Multivariable Calc then it's not gonna be great either way, ENAS 151 vs Math 120. May as well take this one, it's less proofs and in a nicer building. The Prof. is a fun guy.",
    "Yes, if you take it with the right professor. As much as I love Vidvuds Ozolins, if you are someone who needs good explaining, he isn't your guy. The other professor who teaches this, I hear, is quite good though. Still worth taking if you feel comfortable with independent learning.",
    "Yes, I chose it over math 120 and was happier because of the clarity of the instructor and the textbook.",
    "Yes, it is much better than math 120.",
    "I would recommend this course over 120 any day. I did below the average on my first two exams and did relatively better on the final and ended with a much better grade than I would've in 120. The exams are each weighed differently, depending on how you do relative to the other ones and the psets are also very generously weighed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course over MATH 120 based off of what my friends in that class have said. I really enjoyed ENAS 151 and thought the class was engaging and taught me extremely well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is graded fairly, structured well, and generally is free of the ambiguity that comes with Math 120 and the inconsistency across professors,",
    "I loved this course. It's the best I've done in a math class at Yale. It's tough, but very rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course - it teaches multivariable calculus very well to those who do not particularly prioritize a proof-based education.",
    "Yes. WAY better than math 120. Much better teaching, more skill-oriented mindset. The only thing is that it meets during reading period and the pace of work is a bit relentless. Would recommend though, you learn a lot and it's more manageable than math 120. Also Professor Ozolins is awesome!",
    "TAKE THIS OVER MATH 120!!! As someone who took both MATH 120 (and did horribly) and this class (and did well), I would strongly recommend this class. First of all, Vidvuds is an amazing professor who is good at teaching, makes himself available, and is also generally a fun person to learn from. Also, the material is much easier to grasp in this class and the fact that you get a formula sheet during exams makes it so much better than MATH 120, which makes you memorize tedious formulae.",
    "No, I would not for the frustrations I had as stated above.",
    "I would recommend it for students which have a strong interest in engineering, and a background in physics. I had never taken a physics class, even in high school, and definitely struggled to keep up a lot in this course.",
    "definitely take ENAS 151 over MATH 120 - the exams aren't cumulative (besides knowing basic concepts), and Vidvuds is an amazing professor. You can't go wrong taking his class",
    "Yes because it teaches topics that multivriable calculus in high school doesnt teach and is a very informative class that engineering students need to form the bedrock foundation of their knowledge as they proceed forward with their studies.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are a STEM major, if not there's no real need."
