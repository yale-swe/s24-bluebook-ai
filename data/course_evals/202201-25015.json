I wish that the projects had more directionI think a defined site might really help. furthermore, \"stories and counterstories\" was such a broad term that things felt quite disjointed. while readings were interesting, they felt like they barely intersected with the actual work we were doing in class. I know this class was meant to serve as an introductory studio, emphasizing breadth over depth, but this just made me feel ungrounded and lost at points.\r\n\r\nwhile opening up a design studio to everyone from first-year college students to graduate architecture sounds like it might be cool in theory (learn from your peers!), I feel like this was just too broad of a range to bridge"
