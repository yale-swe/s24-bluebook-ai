   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot about collectivism, accompaniment, getting over ourselves and just Doing the Work, fighting for more just systems, and calling ourselves and others to our full competence. This has been a very holistic class that has really taught me about the relationships and comparisons necessary in order to create the world we imagine.",
    "I learned more about myself as an ER&M student at Yale and in general the ethnic studies community.",
    "This course made me realize that our studies and struggles are not subdivided into separate entities, but are rather constantly connected and changing. More than that, I realized why ER&M is connected to everything within our university, even if these connections seem impossible. I learned about Ethnic studies as a discipline, it's history, why it is so important, and the attempts that the university has made to silence it. I learned the vocabulary I need to describe how race operates in our world, how white supremacy operates, how neoliberalism operates. I honestly learned so much that I have a hard time articulating it. No class has ever taught me such fulfilling skills and knowledge before.",
    "After taking this course, I have a deeper understanding of what it means to accompany other marginalized groups in our collective fight for social justice.",
    "I learned a great deal about the history of ethnic studies and about how to apply the theories we learn in ER&M to our everyday lives. It was definitely one of the most applicable classes I have taken, which I am very grateful for.",
    "This course is quite unconventional in its form, purpose, and general feeling. As a junior seminar, it brings together people in the major in unexpected ways. It covers a broad swath of topics, readings, and in-person experiences that are related to ethnic studies. At a larger level, I think this course helps answer the question what are attempting to do as ER&M majors?"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings were interesting, if a little long. We had amazing field trips to museums and shows, but it cut down on actual discussion time in class. The reading responses were the perfect length and those assignments really helped me synthesize the material.\r\nThe final project was not my favorite because it did not really pull together everything from the class, but it was still interesting.",
    "This course pushes ER&M students to think beyond Yale and to really engage with the term \"accompaniment,\" which I thought to be such an appropriate focus for what we should be striving for as students of critical ethnic studies, as people trying to change institutions like Yale. And because we talked and read a lot about accompaniment, I think starting the class immediately with our accompaniment projects will get us to dive deeper into our weekly discussions of the texts.",
    "The strength of this course is Professor HoSang. He came to class every week ready to engage meaningfully with all of us. His feedback on our assignments was exceptional. The way he organized the syllabus - I swear, everything came back into a perfect loop, the syllabus was actually so perfect and well planned it's kind of scary to be honest - how did he do it?! The mixing of more theory heavy things with art was also perfect and it made me realize the power of music and art within subordinated spaces. The field trips, guest speakers, everything about this class was so well planned out, it was an amazing course, I wish everyone had the chance to take it.",
    "Strengths: the readings were extremely insightful and interesting and class discussions were very engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: at times, there are a considerable amount of readings assigned",
    "Strengths - interesting readings, great discussions in class, amazing professor, great field trips and out-of-class activities\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - none I can think of!",
    "The syllabus and course are structured very intentionally. It is truly one of the most engaging courses I have taken and actively seeks to connect to the real world. The weekly responses are also structured in a way to make you really engage and question the material."

    "YES. You learn a lot and you have a lot of great experiences. Also lol you have to take this if you're an ER&M major so... have a blast. It's very good.",
    "yes take it with DHS hes the best professor ive ever had at yale and best person",
    "I feel that this course more than any other I've taken has given me ideas, ways of thinking, and hope for the future that I will take forward to everything I do. Professor HoSang is phenomenal, the class is phenomenal, and I would highly recommend it. Professor HoSang is my favorite professor I've had, and I know that I am not the only one who thinks so. He cares so deeply about our learning and puts so much effort into getting guest speakers, organizing field trips, etc. The accompaniment projects were an absolute highlight for me - besides being incredibly fun, they gave us the opportunity to do work that was meaningful outside of Yale, which is not an opportunity I've had in any other class. Walking into this class was such a joy every week, and I always left feeling happy and excited. I would take this class with Professor HoSang again if I could.",
    "YES!! 300 with HoSang was one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale and reminded me why I'm an ER&M major.",
    "YES! Especially with Professor HoSang!!",
    "Absolutely. Probably the most intellectually stimulating class Ive ever taken at Yale.",
    "Yes 100%. A great class, especially when taught by Professor HoSang. It helped me pull together many of the different strands and pieces I have learned over my time in ER&M, and I am very happy to have had the opportunity to be in the class.",
    "It is a required course for ER&M so yes. I did talk about it to my non-ER&M friends and they seemed to want to take the course too.",
    "Yes! If you're a major it's going to be a requirement, and you probably won't be able to take it unless you are a junior\/senior in the major. Take with HoSang is possible!"
