                "Flexible online format",
                "Strengths: great Professor. He cares a lot about the class and the students. He also developed multiple ways of engaging with the class apart from the usual tools. For example, I liked how he used edstem.org to post questions. This made the course easier to follow.",
                "The class videos were far too long",
                "Topics toward the end of the class were not explained well. Student's should have more independence in learning R and there should be more of a focus on teaching statistics theory.",
                "I thought this course was very thorough and in depth. Professor Meyers made sure that he was clear and organized with all of the material and I appreciated that. I was frustrated more often than not with the course though. The Canvas quiz format with participation questions ensured that we were following along with lectures and understanding material, however, I saw no benefit from these survey questions. I received zero feedback on the work I did and found that these surveys resulted in lectures taking much longer than a lecture should in a normal live-lecture format. I wouldn't mind this if I received feedback for my work, however, with the lack of feedback I found I was just answering the questions just to answer them and really not processing information. The questions became an added pressure throughout the semester because they would hurt my participation grade if I didn't complete them. I think the questions had an adverse effect for me than what was intended and I hope Professor Meyers reevaluates using them in the future.",
                "This course was great! Professor Meyers was informative, caring, and genuinely wanted us to have an as-least-stressed-as-possible semester. The material was presented in a palatable way, allowing for a greater depth of understanding and ability to master the skills required in R to succeed in this course.",
                "Because of the asynchronous component of the class, I felt very disengaged. I found it difficult to make sure I was truly learning the material, even though I worked collaboratively with other students and asked questions on Ed Discussions.",
                "Strengths: The workload was not too rigorous, and the problem sets allowed for application of the lessons we learned in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course as a whole was rather disorganized, and it did not seem to be structured to be conducive to student learning. The content was basic, which is understandable given this is the most introductory course in statistics, but at times, it felt like I was not really maximizing the opportunity to learn as a student. The midterm exam was scheduled the morning immediately after a break day, which was strictly advised against by the administration, and when asked on Ed, the teaching staff dismissed these concerns saying that the exam \"had already been scheduled\" (as had every single break day and the Yale academic calendar). Instead, the professor provided the option to take the exam two days early with less than 24-hours notice, the same day that our campus faced a major tragedy. Despite each Canvas quiz asking for student feedback, it felt as though nothing was changed with regards to the course, and frankly, I was immensely disappointed by the end of the semester. I wish I had better used 1 of my 36 credits at Yale.",
                "I realized this semester that don't learn well with asynchronous courses. I also felt like the use of R distracted from learning the actual statistical concepts.",
                "Strength was doing the lectures and having them recorded to rewatch later on. I honestly thought the hw should have been a little harder. I felt like it was too straight forward to get the overarching concepts, but it wasn't until the end of the semester that we starting overlapping in concepts more. The exams in my opinion were much harder than the homework, and I was not prepared for the first midterm.",
                "Strengths: online learning was generally smooth, and content flowed in a logical manner. Recorded lectures were engaging!\r\nWeaknesses: At time class was a bit disorganized, as well as sometimes being a disconnect between lectures and homework.",
                "In the virtual format, the format of the lectures was effective. They were delivered through canvas quizzes that allowed us to follow along and do practice questions relating to the lecture videos. It was taught asynchronously, meaning we could watch the videos when we wanted",
                "Strengths: The material is mostly well-paced, the psets were fair, and the recorded lectures were still fun somehow\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only problem with pacing is that the last few topics felt a little rushed and there was a big gap between psets and exams",
                "Strengths - the course moves at a fairly slow but steady pace. The material remains interesting without being too challenging. It is a great intro course. Weaknesses - Don't expect to learn too much R in this course. You will only learn the very basics.",
                "This course doubled the amount of expected class time, having recorded lectures that were given in a quiz format. It was very poorly formatted in that students could only learn material through quiz questions that they often got wrong or did not know how to do.",
                "The asynchronous learning was great.",
                "Definitely felt as though the class could have had a little more structure in the second half as the material sort of became jumbled and harder to keep track of.",

                "I felt that the quiz/flipped classroom structure got slightly redundant at times particularly because the canvas quizzes didnt have any stakes",
                "I think it was nice that it was asynchronous but also that made it less engaging because practically no one came to the live office hours or discussions. In person, the class will be more engaging.",
                "This course is a good introduction to R, but falls short of actually teaching statistics. I don't feel as though I've gained any statistics intuition, and the structure of the course was frustrating at times.",
                "I feel like this class was one of the only intro courses I've taken that actually felt like an intro course. Unlike courses such as the intro bio sequence, stats 100 does not assume any prior knowledge of R/statistics and moves at what I considered an entirely reasonable and appropriate pace. The homework was very representative of what we learned in class and I think contributed well to my learning, but the tests were difficult.",
                "The course was decently organized, and did teach me a lot about introductory level R.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, much of the material on the midterm and final was disconnected from what we spent our classes learning. We'd learn a bit of theory in class, never get any reinforcement on it in the homework which focused on application, and then get slammed on the midterm and finals by theoretical questions we were not well prepared for. Additionally, the course was pretty un-engaging overall I get that basic Stats is never going to fascinate,  but the structure of recorded lectures made a less than interesting subject a real slog.",
                "strength: awesome material, i liked the format of recorded lectures in small bits. I also enjoyed the quiz structure that had you follow along by answering questions. Ed discussions was also very useful.\r\n\r\nweakness: During exams, the initial time was not flexible for people taking thus course from different timezones.",
                "The course is organized and taught pretty well, but may benefit from having things like collaborative sessions for students",
                "The pre-recorded lectures allowed students to work through the material at their own pace. I found the review questions incredibly useful because they helped me learn AND retain the concepts from lecture. The problem sets were very fair. I'd make two major suggestions for the course: (1) a faster turnaround for graded assignments (problem sets often took several weeks and I would thus make similar mistakes on subsequent PSets) (2) a faster lecture pace at the beginning of the course and a slower pace at the end of the course.",
                "I think the quiz format of the lectures was a major negative for me since it meant my first introduction to the material was quite tiring and took a lot of time. This was basically like doing a small problem set with each lecture, and while I'm sure it was good for active learning it did make the class much more work than a normal lecture. The constant \"Greek\" metaphor seemed a bit overdone and weak, it was super helpful for recall. That said, Ethan's use of many, many example problems was super great. The whole team, including TA's, was very responsive to questions on Ed discussions. We didn't get a ton of information on the format of the tests until the week of, but they were all very fair and reasonable. The actual lectures were well presented and simple to understand. The Psets are reasonable and well designed. The final project was great."

It made attending a virtual class effortless and helped me in my learning process. I loved that I had many opportunities to speak to Professor Meyers and other TAs when I had questions . Ed Discussions were also a great tool for me in getting help, and my questions were answered very quickly by Professor Meyers so I really appreciated the platform. However, again the participation grade in the course required students to ask and answer questions on Ed Discussion, which again turned something that was suppose to be for our benefit and make our lives easier, to something that was a serious pressure throughout the course. I didn't find myself having enough questions to fulfill the participation requirement with Ed and couldn't answer questions for other students because Professor Meyers would answer them too quickly. By the end I was asking empty questions just to get my participation points and I saw many students doing the same. This made Ed filled with an excessive number of repeated questions and truly unhelpful questions. To put this problem in perspective, my other similarly sized classes that used Ed had 62 and 152 questions, while S&DS 100 had over 500.",

I will admit that I was perhaps bored because I had already seen most of the material taught before, but that doesn't deny the fact that this class had a lot of unnecessary busy work associated with it that made it one of my most time consuming courses (more time consuming than S&DS 230). Bottom line is that you should take statistics level 100 because the material is vitally important in the modern world, but I would only take it with Professor Meyers if you need a lot of repetition and reviewing of concepts throughout the course (the busy work I mentioned).",
                "Yes! I thought it was a great introduction to statistics, although I took AP Statistics in high school, so the material may have been a little easier for me. Professor Meyers was informative, caring, and genuinely wanted us to have an as-least-stressed-as-possible semester. The material was presented in a palatable way, allowing for a greater depth of understanding and ability to master the skills required in R to succeed in this course.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course, as it stands. I hope that in non-pandemic times, this class would be better and more suited to student learning and engagement. I found that taking this class asynchronously was boring.",
                "Honestly, just take something more interesting.",
                "If you're looking for an intro statistics class, this one was good!",
                "Yes! this is a great intro to stats from someone who has never taken a stats course in their life!",
                "Yes! Great intro to stat and R, both essential skills in many fields of study!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I think this is a good intro level course to take.",
                "I would definitely take this if you want a chill introduction to stats. The workload is manageable and the psets are fairly straight forward.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning about Statistics and has not taken any courses in Statistics before. If you have taken Statistics courses (e.g. in high school, in another semester), there are probably more advanced classes that would be better for you. Otherwise, this is a fine introduction.",
                "Yes - this is a great intro Stats course. It is not too difficult, but it is still interesting. The Prof is very engaging, and this course sets you up well to take other Stats courses.",
                "Nah",
                "Yes, it is a great class to learn how to do statistics.",
                "Yes, If you want to take a first-class in data analysis and get a grasp of an easy computer language this is the way to go. This class gives a great basic understanding of a lot of interesting things.",
                "Yes! It taught me what I needed to know, and it wasn't a massive time commitment.",
                "Yes-- this class is essentially exactly what you sign up for. It's perfect for someone with zero statistics background or anyone who needs a QR but wouldn't consider themselves a QR type of person. It's difficult at points, and the work is very constant, so best not fall behind. But at the end of the day, it's a pretty standard course. Prof Meyers had a strange Covid plan (including mandatory quizzes for every recorded lecture), but I don't foresee this becoming an issue in the future.",
                "It is definitely a good primer for statistical concepts which have applications across post fields. As such, I would definitely encourage people to take a stats course if not this one",
                "I think its valuable for a baseline understanding of statistics for whatever field youre going into and its a nice introduction to coding using R.",
                "I would not recommend this course. It was difficult to actually develop statistical intuition and the course was very dependent on the R programming language. I appreciate it as an intro to R, but as a statistics course, it should be reworked.",
                "Yes! Take this if you want an introduction to statistics (and/or R, like I did) that moves at a good pace and doesn't give unreasonable amounts of work each week.",
                "If you want to learn introductory statistics and R, this class is a decent way to do that. It won't be fun, and it won't be that interesting, but these are very valuable skills. The course work isn't hard, but be wary of the midterm and final which can mess up your grade if you aren't careful. Take the class if you feel you need to or want the skillset, but maybe shop around other Stats courses too like YData or the SDS 101-109 series.",
                "Yes, statistics helps ground your intuition and questions in data. Very important",
                "Yes, take this course if you are interested in statistics or need it as a prerequisite class",
                "If you need a gutty qr",
                "Yes! Prof Meyers is kind, and this is a great, low stress intro.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! This class is a great way to get a basic understanding of some principles of descriptive and inferential statistics. There is a little bit of coding involved, but prior experience with coding is absolutely NOT needed. The exams are fair and problem sets help reinforce lecture material without being too burdensome. Moreover, the abundance of TAs/peer tutors makes it really easy to ask questions about the material or coding errors.",
                "Yes, but keep up with the lectures. Falling behind kills."
