                "I absolutely loved this course. Dr. Shanahan is an amazing instructor, who really cares about his students, and structures the course so that the entire work process is a learning experience. I learned so much about how to take a history course, on a technical level. More broadly, the content is fascinating for anyone interested in a history of American citizenship and immigration policy.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of American citizenship. I also improved my historical analysis skills and my ability to conduct original archival research.",
                "I gained more knowledge about the legal, social, and political developments in the United States that led to the patterns in immigration history that we see manifesting in our present.",

                "I think this course could benefit from meeting more than once a week for less time. It was a bit hard to focus for the entire period at times, but that's not a critique of the course itself or Dr. Shanahan's teaching style (for which I honestly have no improvement suggestions).",
                "This course is great overall, and the reading workload is manageable. I really appreciated the check-in assignments along the way for the research paper, which really broke up the process into manageable chunks and reduced the stress pretty significantly.\r\n\r\nLater in the semester, I felt that some of the classes were a bit repetitive thematically, but everything was interesting.",
                "We covered a large, diverse range of historical topics, which I appreciate. We also read very diverse authors, which I enjoyed. For weaknesses, we were assigned a great deal of reading, so it was sometimes difficult to get to everything in depth - perhaps if we had less readings, we could engage with each one more deeply.",
                "The course was wonderful. I loved the way it took us through different periods in history, giving us a good survey of how the idea of citizenship developed. I would have appreciated spending a bit of time at the beginning of each class situating ourselves in history - discussing what time period we were in, the developments that had happened prior, and world affairs that may have impacted decision-making."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in getting a broad introduction to the field of American legal history from the perspective of citizenship and immigration law. It covers a very large time period and so moves very fast, meaning it is hard to go very in detail about any of the particular subjects  but the projects provide an opportunity to do that, and all the units are so interesting that I wouldn't give any up for the sake of going slower.",
                "Yes, definitely. Especially for anybody interested in the idea of American citizenship, and how it relates to other identities and historical forces.",
                "I would - it is a great seminar for anyone interested in immigration history, especially if you are interested in legal history. Professor Shanahan is very kind and very well versed in this area of study, so he is a great resource to get connected to.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Shanahan is incredibly supportive and knows when to ask the right questions to spur discussion. The course is well-structured and well-planned, so assessments are always conducive to learning and are not overly stressful."
