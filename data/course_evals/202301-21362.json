                "Perhaps if it was a smaller class, more students would participate. Professor Padro was great though! The feedback on p-sets could be improved.",
                "The structure of the exams and psets was conducive to understanding how economic papers relate to economic and political development, and the topics looked at in the class - ending up with autocracy and democracy - was good. However, I think if the whole class wasn't structured around papers it could be better.",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed Prof Padro's lecture style (he's very animated and you can tell passionate about what he studies), the problem sets themselves were very fair (clear expectations and helpful feedback in grading) which were then extremely fair when it came to exams. Weaknesses: Only 3 problem sets, which in hindsight was actually fine but it would've been nice if there was a 4th optional one for more practice/feedback.",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures and Prof really knows what he is talking about. Weaknesses: not much incentive to do the readings or engage with the course because so few assignments",
                "Strengths: Gerard. A sober, humble, and caring academic, a true intellectual.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could design course content with more gradient (include other harder but also important points), talk more about things we cannot learn from books (share more remarks from personal academic experience and the academic norms that are invisible from the outside etc).",
                "I loved this course. There wasn't too much overarching structure or a sense of broader conclusions we were supposed to derive, but I don't think that was the point. Instead it was focussed on engaging with contemporary economic research into the politics of developmentwhich it performed very well.",
                "Taught very well. The professor was great at explaining things and very efficient, never went too fast. We were all supposed to participate but the class environment didnt facilitate participation all that well.",
                "Strengths: great practical skills \r\nWeaknesses: course is a little repetitive",
                "Strengths: Fantastic professor, great assignments, he really does a great job to make sure you actually learn the material! Take the class!",
                "Strengths are that its low workload and good practice for getting an intuition for econometrics. Weaknesses are that the lectures arent the most engaging because youre just going through the papers, and there isnt much variety.",
                "Strengths  prof Padr is so enthusiastic and engaging, he really cares for his students to learn the class. \r\nWeaknesses  more hand-holding at the start of the class to teach us how to read a paper if you dont have a lot of stats background.",
                "I didn't learn much from this class. We read a bunch of economic papers instead of studying the subject of development.",
                "Prof. Padr is such a great and entertaining lecturer who knows so much about these strands of literature. He alone makes this a great econ elective. The workload is also very lowyou read 2 econ papers per week and do 3 psets total throughout the semester. Sometimes I found myself wishing that the course went a little faster/in-depth since the topics were so interesting. Also, the psets, midterms, and final were all a very similar and predictable structure, which made preparing really low-stress. That said, after a while, I didnt feel like I was getting that much out of the written work- most of the value was the lecture and reading interesting papers.",
                "The assignments are incredibly understimulating and predictable. You won't learn very much in this class.",
                "Well organised, learned a lot about applying the more theoretical parts of econometrics",
                "I liked this class overall but the lectures often felt redundant when they just recapped the papers we had been assigned. The lectures definitely did include extra additional information and analysis, but a lot of class felt like I was just having the papers summarized to me, which made me feel like it was unnecessary to both read the papers carefully and come to lecture. To improve the course, I would spend less time in lecture recapping the papers and their conclusions and focus more on the methodologies used because I found those to be the most difficult to understand.",
                "Strengths of this course was the professor! Very nice guy and teaches in an engaging way. Weakness was the time of the class.",
                "Great prof",
                "Strengths: Exposure to various insightful literature on economics and politics of development - I genuinely underestimated how great this would be before actually taking the course. \r\n / \r\nWeaknesses: Prof goes off on tangents. But honestly it doesn't feel like that big of a deal and they're interesting tangents so eh.",
                "strengths \r\n-great professor\r\n-great & helpful assignments (problem sets and lectures were designed to sufficiently prepare us for exams)\r\nweaknesses\r\n-grading of assignments felt strict at times and was not clear how marks were deducted based on the feedback given\r\n-it would be helpful if the readings for each class/ week were added as assignments in canvas; it was unclear what readings we should do for each class as the lecture files were not numbered in the same way as the actual lectures",
                "The professor was engaging and humorous, and the presentations summarized and analyzed economics papers.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion for improvement is having a review of the needed econometric skills at the beginning of the semester. This way, analyzing the papers (such as interpreting their regressions) for the problem sets and lectures will be clearer.",
                "Professor Padro is a great lecturer and the expectations for the exams in this class are very clear.",

                "Absolutely. This course had a very low workload (three \"problem sets\" and two in class exams). Do not be deceived, however. Each test/problem set was rigorous and forced me to think about the papers it was on. The learning to workload ratio was super high. The real reason to take it is Gerard, though. He was sweet and brought a lot of enthusiasm to class, even on days when it was freezing cold and hardly anyone showed up.",

                "Yes, great transition course between introductory econometrics and the higher level classes later in the sequence.",
                "It depends on what you're looking for. This course provides a very high-level view of the sources of economic development. It basically taught me that good institutions lead to development, and good institutions form by having politicians that aren't corrupt and are held accountable by voters. I didn't come away with more technical economic knowledge about growth accounting or the productivity of different sectors, etc. The emphasis was definitely more on the political science, so if you're into that, then go for it.",
                "Yes great prof good material",
