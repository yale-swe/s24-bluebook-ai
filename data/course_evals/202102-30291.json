We also explored several specific processes as ways of better understanding the general trends and pathways. We also learned how to perform molecular docking, which is super helpful and relevant (in many research situations -- in fact, it became super helpful to me in my summer research).",

One thing especially I learned was the process of drug development and alteration. This was especially interesting as I hadn't gotten the oppurtunity before to explore this pharmaceutical of medicine.",
                "I have learned some of the most important concepts for biochemistry- amino acids, protein studies, DNA and RNA molecular structure, fats and carbohydrates, and respiration mechanism under the scope of biochemistry (glycolysis, citric acid cycle, electron transport chain). In addition to the textbook materials, hands-on drug design project really had me engaged fully into the world of biochemistry. As I ran the softwares to simulates and analyze the novel drug, I have found myself immersed in the wonderland of biochemistry and indulged in the sanguine sensation upon promising data from the novel drug I have developed. Asides from course experience, I learned to be able to express my understanding for science more clearly and organized from class participation (answering questions in class or providing some of my thoughts). Moreover, from the drug design project, I have learned the perspiration and diligence are what makes a science project possible.",

                "Strengths -- very interesting material, presented in a clear way with a focus on broad patterns and trends rather than tons and tons of memorization. super relevant skills (ie molecular docking) and cool class project!\r\nWeaknesses -- None!",
                "The course was interesting and fast-paced. The summer nature of the course did restrict the amount of material which could be reasonably covered, and it was unclear how much the reading factored into the course. I think a more concise, focused set of readings could be helpful, and overall more time would also be helpful as lectures felt very busy with a lot of material covered.",
                "As a 5 week course, this class obviously had a lot of information and it was taught it a very approachable way.",
                "I think the large final drug project that we worked on throughout the entire course was a massive strength for the course. I think there should be more opportunities for extra help and office hours to better absorb the knowledge in this course.",
                "This course provides students with not only the well-structured biochemistry course but the hands-on experiment to solidify students' knowledge. Besides from this, professor Collins provides office meeting hour by appointment, which could further the learning experience for students beyond the classroom.\r\nLittle suggestion: the direction for drug design activity would be more helpful if it provides a detailed example images of each procedure.",
                "I think the course was a bit poorly planned. The first half went by very slowly and was just review. The latter half of the course had so much material crammed. There was literally three times as much reading as there was in the first half.",
                "Great course, well-taught, packed with information. Make sure you have the time for this course.",
                "Strength was Professor Collins, who singlehandedly carried the whole course and catered to all our academic needs. Does not need improvement.",
                "Professor Collins is a fantastic lecturer and you can tell how much he cares about each of the students. I can't recommend this course enough, especially after having had generally negative experiences with other premed courses at Yale. Taking this class during the summer was a great call, because the class size was only 30 people we could ask questions, attend 1:1 office hours, etc. Professor Collins managed to make the virtual format engaging, organized, and effective for my learning.",
                "The course abs lectures were structured well ! Homework assignments were at times a bit confusing but definitely manageable",

                "Yes, if it is a requirement or if you are just interested in Biochemistry it is a lot of material to cover but it is very interesting and feels much more productive than organic chemistry because there is more learning and understanding, along with a greater degree of applicability of what is learned.",
                "Yes I would, I like the succinctness of the syllabus within the 5 week period. I also enjoy the course very much which was a major factor in my evaluation.",

                "Yes, it is necessary for understanding the basics of life science.",
