                "I entered the course with zero knowledge about Japanese literature and the postwar era. I learned the history of the postwar era and how themes like shame, alienation, and femininity manifested themselves in the Japanese literature of the time. After the war, many Japanese were disillusioned with \"traditional\" Japan of the prewar, the imperialist Japan of the war, and the occupied Japan of the postwar. This crisis of Japanese identity trickled down to the level of the individual.",
                "Gained a much better understanding of Japan, postwar Japan, and authors writing during that time. Improved critical reading skills. Built an appreciation for different perspectives and time periods. But reading fiction is also just great for your soul and general happiness, and I think the enjoyment I got from that aspect of the course was the best part of it. Novels set in postwar Japan can feature some pretty heavy topics, but the act of reading a new book each week and then discussing it in a comfortable, open classroom setting (that was thankfully not overintellectualized or forced) added joy to my weeks this fall.",
                "I gained a fairly comprehensive overview of postwar Japanese literature and a grasp of the historical context surrounding the literary movement.",
                "I gained knowledge about literature that came from the aftermath of World War 2 in Japan. Learned how to engage with many texts to find themes and motifs which sparked discussion during class."

            "comments": [
                "The biggest strengths of the course were the syllabus and the small class size. Each week, we read a different book from the postwar era. All of the books were captivating and they always resulted in fascinating discussions in class. The books also moved chronologically, so we could trace the development of postwar sentiments over time. The small class size allowed us to have lots of back-and-forth conversations between students. The mixture of undergrad and graduate students elevated the discussion from the perspective of an undergrad. I have no suggestions for improving the course.",
                "Strengths: Course format is great, read a book of fiction each week, write a few hundred words about it before class, and discuss. A book each week may sound cumbersome, but most are pretty approachable and I enjoyed the reading almost every week. It provided a nice change of pace from other work; Professor Goddard, whom everyone calls Tug, is great and sets the perfect tone for class discussions; the books themselves are for the most part really good, and I'm glad I exposed myself to many new authors I hadn't heard of before; weekly response papers are open-ended, mostly graded for completion, and give you a few weeks to skip if you're overloaded. Weaknesses: Books could be a little dark? But that's what I signed up for, and there was also something beautiful about how sad some of them were. If you really think you won't like postwar topics, I'd take Tug's Japanese Literature 1970-present course since I understand those works' themes tend to be lighter. We also spent a week reading a translation of a more academic nonfiction text, and while I see how that might add value and a little variety to a literature course, I think I would have much rather have spent the time reading another book of fiction or a new author on the syllabus.",
                "I enjoyed that students' ideas were always the driving force of our discussions; it never felt that we were regurgitating information that Professor Goddard was telling us. I do think that the pacing was a little bit tiring, but this did allow us to cover a more vast selection of books. I also think that the length of the final paper (3,000 words) did feel quite daunting and that more guidance and structure could have been included in the instructions.",
                "A very fun class overall with a small class size helping to make everyone have meaningful points."

                "I would recommend this course to anyone who appreciates literature. Reading so many texts from such a concentrated and intellectually rich place and time is a unique experience which you should not pass up. As a STEM major, I always regretted not being able to read books during the semester and this course filled that void for me and then some.",
                "Yes, 100%, and highly. My favorite class this semester. Reading about how authors process as interesting a moment as postwar Japan was valuable, and Tug has created a class atmosphere that allows you to appreciate and digest the literature without scrambling to beat some meaning out of it for a harshly graded weekly prompt or compete with classmates for a participation grade. In the best way, our discussions felt like book clubs: they allowed you to contribute ideas to the larger group in a friendly setting and constantly reminded me how great it was to read and discuss fiction. Even if you don't know much about Japan or East Asia, I found that reading fiction (even when topics can be dark or heavy) each week in this class helped me de-stress and refocus on the joy of reading and learning.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Goddard is very kind, understanding, and attentive to his students. I feel like he always made students feel at ease and made sure to remind students that he is always available as a resource.",
                "This is an amazing class taught by an amazing professor, who has such a deep knowledge of Japan and Japanese literature. I learned so much from Tug and highly highly highly recommend this class. The books read in class are also extremely interesting and are popular for a reason. Authors like Oe Kenzaburo, Mishima Yukio, and Tanizaki Junichiro are some of the many authors read who are highly regarded as some of the best authors in Japanese and Asian literature.",
                "Yes, it is a course suitable for both beginners and research-oriented students."
