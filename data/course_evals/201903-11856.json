   "comments": [
    "I learned about legal practices across the world and legal terminology in spanish. I became much more comfortable writing responses in spanish and watching\/listening to videos.",
    "As a native Spanish speaker and an aspiring lawyer, I am so grateful to have learned many many legal terminology and ideas in Spanish. I not only learned about very theoretical legal concepts and definitions, I also was exposed to a lot of different Spanish and Latin American media that increased my understanding of the content. For instance, we watched a lot of contemporary videos like an interview with SCOTUS Justice Sonia Sotomayor - shortly before I attended the campus event with her. We also watched a newsroom discussion between different Latin American professors and scholars discussing the recent turmoil in Ecuador, Chile, and other countries. This video was followed by an insightful discussion that shed light on many issues I've thought about since living in Venezuela. Additionally, we compared different countries' constitutions and each of their approaches to controversial topics like abortion. This class was thought-provoking and challenging all semester in a way that really resonated with my interests and passions.",
    "In this class I learned about the legal system in both the United States and in Latin American countries. I learned vocabulary relating to the legal system, I learn procedure on how legal problems are dealt with, and I learned a broad range of topics relating to legal implications.",
    "awareness of modern political events in latin-american countries, and lots of legal definitions\/themes\/concepts in spanish",
    "I learned legal concepts in spanish and how the legal system in hispanic countries works.",
    "I definitely became more aware of consistent errors I was making in my writing with this course's homework assignments. Beyond some very surface level knowledge of law in Spanish, I can't really say I learned much more with this course.",
    "I learned a lot about the laws and judicial process of many different Spanish-speaking countries.",
    "Familiarity with the semantics and structure of legal systems in Spanish speaking countries.",
    "Good overview of the mechanisms of the legal systems of latinamerica and beyond.",
    "I bettered my Spanish vocabulary and grammar.",
    "I learned about the legal system of Spain along with how this system relates to the current events of other nations.",
    "Fun and varied class. Improves one's command of everyday legal vocabulary, and exposes one to a variety of present day controversies.",
    "Learned about the law in various Spanish speaking countries. Gained insight into different worldly perspectives and history of the law."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The classwork is pretty light and not very challenging. The grading of non-written work seems very subjective.",
    "This course has many strengths. It combines legal theories with contemporary media including readings, TV episodes, videos, and interviews. It is also very interactive and it forces us to draw from personal experiences. I also find that allotting a week for us to do our assignments really streamlined the work for us because we had ample time to ask questions and do outside research for each essay. I do wish that the course workbook could be available online for our convenience, however this is not necessary.",
    "The strength of the course was that I was able to learn about a whole lot of different topics regarding legal implications and how these different topics proceed in a legal setting. The weakness of the class was that often times it was just a lecture about a legal procedure and I felt as though there was a lack of conversation during class.",
    "strengths: low-stress, encouraging for even students not as confident in spanish-speaking abilities to speak up and engage with material. appreciated that the main assignments were written responses, a big oral group presentation, and a final essay, as exams would have been highly stressful and not that productive in helping me learn legal spanish. no weaknesses!",
    "Strengths: we learned both spanish and how to apply it to the legal professional area.",
    "This course was poorly organized. There were not very many speaking opportunities, partly due to its leminar format and partly due to the fact that Prof. Carreras did not do a very good job of engaging the class. Most of her homework assignments were busy work, and were not L5 appropriate (they were way too easy; not a good thing because they were time consuming every single week). I felt like she should've assigned fewer, more difficult assignments that are actually relevant to the course. The course was also far too long. At an hour-15 twice a week, I cannot stress the amount of dead time we had in class. We would also do busy work often in class as well, making the class feel even more pointless altogether. Profesora Carreras is extremely knowledgeable, but unfortunately did not really engage the class very well. I also think that it should be more clear that this class is not necessarily \"a seminar in Spanish,\" as I expected it to be. Instead, it felt more like a continuation of a language learning class that was being taught through the lens of law. This might be what some people are looking for, but I was looking forward to taking a class in Spanish, the same way we take classes in English. This kind of mentality became apparent in homework assignments where we were tasked with watching a video and responding questions. The questions were always basic aural comprehension questions along the lines of \"what did he say,\" \"who is he,\" \"what does he work as,\" etc. as opposed to more interpretive questions that would've kept the class more interesting and level-appropriate (not to mention that the videos were mostly irrelevant to course materials in the first place.) You could also tell that this course was more interested in the continuation of developing language learning skills (as opposed to applying them) because the rubric for the final paper was entirely concerned with proper grammar, readability, organization, etc. and doesn't actually focus on the development of a claim\/ argument, the way any ordinary final paper would in a seminar taught in English. Overall, I think I was just looking for something that wouldn't feel like a waste of time, but this class often had me mad at 9 am on Tuesdays and Thursdays because it felt pointless. It is an easy A tho, if that's what you're looking for. Just be ready for it to be annoying.",
    "It is difficult to participate in a 25 person class",
    "Potentially interesting subject matter but incoherent curriculum and assignments unrelated to spirit of course.",
    "Good course for learning new things but not so much for learning Spanish.",
    "Improvements can be made in lesson planning, ensuring each lesson has a clear objective and path.",
    "Great class and the material poses a different way to learn and further Spanish ability.",
    "I liked the current news that we read because it was very relevant and interesting. The class reads were a hit or miss for me. Some were great and very interesting as well. Others were too dense to comprehend in just one class in English, let alone Spanish.",
    "Very fun and interesting course. I particularly enjoyed the presentation and the fact that the written assignments were based on current and up-to-date articles. I might only suggest some interactive activity or a mock trial to take the engagement even further."

   "comments": [
    "If you are looking to complete a L5 spanish with the least amount of work, this is a great option. However, lectures were often not that engaging and grades seem somewhat subjective.",
    "I would recommend this course to Spanish heritage\/native speakers and learners alike because it is intellectually challenging, pushing us to think as legal writers, and scholars. I would also venture to say that there is something for everyone in this course since we cover a wide range of topics from criminal psychology to theft to hacking.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in learning about the legal system from Spanish and Latin American point of you. Someone who is interested in writing about the legal system and about their thoughts on legal procedures should definitely take this class as there are many opportunities to write.",
    "yes!! even if you have 0 experience in legal issues or themes, this was a great L5 course to take because the material is interesting to students from all disciplines, professor is super sweet, and class encourages all who want to speak up without pushing\/forcing anyone to speak when not comfortable, in a way that by the end of the class everyone speaks up anyway.",
    "Yes, it is a very good Spanish course and you will learn both Spanish and legal concepts in class.",
    "Depends on your intentions, but I probably wouldn't recommend. It is a gut, but it's also annoying because it's literally a busy-work class. If you're looking to improve writing skills within the context of law, however, I think I would recommend. The course doesn't do much for speaking and reading, but because we have writing assignments every week, you definitely catch on to common mistakes and become more conscious of them. Just be ready for the writing assignments to take up time and feel pointless.",
    "Yes, Professor Carreras is a gem and this course is really interesting!",
    "Not to a student looking for a substantive course in Spanish, but perhaps to someone looking to fill their requirement.",
    "Yes. It was a great course.",
    "Yes! The class is great, the professor is kinds, and the material is interesting.",
    "Definitely, if one seeks to practice a lot of reading and writing in Spanish, from a variety of countries. This course's hidden gem is that it draws on both Latin American and European sources, thus exposing one to a range of styles.",
    "Yes, the material was interesting and the professor is engaging."
