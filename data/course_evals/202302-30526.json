We grew as a class together, guided by professor Hierro. There was a wonderful variety of material from readings in theory, scientific studies, documentaries, news articles and guest speakers who were leaders in their respective fields. I appreciated the thought provoking assignments which prepared us for class and allowed us to reflect on previous discussions. Overall, this was a very well designed and executed course.",

The classes moved by very quickly, and professor Hierro cultivated a welcoming and impressive intellectual environment. I felt that my classmates and I were really working together in discussions to obtain a deep understanding of the material in a way which was both fun and satisfying.",

Not only are these tools helpful in my own analysis of past movements, but they allow me to be more critically engaged in current issues that I care about.",

I will also use these insights to guide and inform my personal social justice activism."
