                "This class taught me a lot about the current state of migration politics in the Americas and about the methodologies that scholars and activists use to study migration. I also learned a lot specifically about the work of migrant-led organizations, which was the topic of our semester-long project.",
                "Through this course, I learned about the socioeconomic and political conditions that affect migrants in the U.S., as well as the politics and tactics of migrant-led organizing. The course emphasized the role of state-sponsored enforcement mechanisms inside and outside the country, which prevent migrants from either arriving in the country or building a life here without fear.",
                "Through a semester long group project with a migrant-led activist organization, I gained the skills of working with my group members on a project that required me also conduct interviews and juggle lots of different types of writing work. This writing work required us to conduct various types of research and knit together the course themes. I also enjoyed the readings we did, and learned much more about migrants, their journeys, their struggles, and also their vibrancy and agency.",
                "My work and research in this course highlighted varying migratory spatialities as sites of violence and pain infliction on journeying livelihoods. I examined the nature of migrant shelters along the migratory circuit as sites of collective power whilst simultaneously being sites that are susceptible to the ongoing state-criminal nexus. Even more so, the interviews and field work I led centered the everyday forms of carework and community organizing that are fostered during times of pertinent sociopolitical exclusion.",
                "Learned about migrants, intersectionality in the Americas, and forces of migration and immigration, especially from a Latin American perspective.",
                "I learned many personal stories and intersectional aspects of migration in the Americas.",
                "This course gives an amazing look into the migrant experience on every level  political, economic, social, historical, personal and creative. Every reading was amazing.",
                "Through this course, I was able to engage with the intraregional politics of Southern Mexico. This is an important insight personally due to my background as a Mexican immigrant who is now living in the United States. It was a personally fulfilling class because I was able to speak to organizers in Oaxaca and work with them to bring a digital archive to life.",
                "I gained a lot of historical and cultural insight about the everyday lives of migrants.",
                "A newfound definition of borders and citizenship, an overview of immigration policy, and an understanding of the politics surrounding migration."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: working with an organization for our final project was very meaningful; readings and videos assigned were insightful and interesting\r\nWeaknesses: large seminar didn't allow for engaging whole group discussions and participation; could have allowed more class time for working with our group for the final project; could have spaced out the deadlines for the final project out more since it felt crammed at the end; completing all the readings, writing weekly reading responses, and working on final project was difficult to balance at times",
                "The course had a great syllabus and great instructors. Professor Camacho's knowledge is really unmatchable, and I am grateful that I was able to take a class with her before graduating.\r\nIn regards to how the class might be structured in the future, I would suggest that the course either be a seminar or a lecture rather than a combination of the two. The \"leminar\" format wasn't what I was expecting when I enrolled, although I understand that it might have been the only way to accommodate the large number of people who wanted to take the class. I think I would have been more engaged if the class had been a discussion-based seminar OR a lecture with a separate discussion section.",
                "Professor Camacho is an incredible instructor, with deep knowledge on the subject matter and a strong commitment to migrant justice. The reading selections were also excellent, as they provided a wide range of narratives and insights. The one aspect that could be improved is the balance between the course readings/weekly responses and the migrant-led organization project. There were points in the semester where the project could have been addressed more and worked on in class. Overall, this course was phenomenal and essential to understanding contemporary migrant organizing efforts.",
                "This strengths of this course include the course readings and themes and the final project. However, the course could benefit from more clear organization and perhaps more realistic deadline-setting.",
                "The course materials and group project were definitely the highlights of this course. The materials were engaging and informative, and the project was meaningful and rewarding. I think this course may be improved by taking in place in a true seminar setting. I felt like the small lecture setting was not particularly conducive to meaningful class discussions and engagement despite the materials and lecture content being so robust.",
                "Strengths: class always had interesting thematic discussions, research project allowed for creative freedom, encouraged group discussions were engaging\r\nWeaknesses: group project could have benefitted from more structure (i.e. groups we work with could have been groups the Professor and TAs had a previous established connection with)",
                "Strengths: the instructors are so passionate and clearly love teaching the course. The material was interesting, and the project was a nice alternative to a final paper. Weaknesses: communication with the organization we were assigned was very difficult, and the class was better suited to a seminar style than the lecture style it ended up being.",
                "Strengths: The readings for this class are amazing and give a wide range look at the migrant experience. Professor Camacho is also amazing and so knowledgeable. \r\nWeaknesses: The lecture-seminar style kind of didn't feel that conducive and slides would've been helpful.",
                "The topic was one I was passionate about and many of the immigrants stories were engaging, but the course became repetitive after a few classes.",
                "I loved the themes of this course and the teaching team was very kind. I would have liked to maybe have shorter assignments rather than the one large, hard to complete project, though.",
                "Neither a strength nor weakness: I signed up for this class thinking it would be a small seminar, but Professor Camacho ended up admitting everyone (about 30 people). They ended up trying to keep a seminar-style format, but I dont think that was very effective for the course. I think either a full lecture that meets twice a week or a smaller class would be more effective for class discussions.",
                "Strengths are that its not a high workload but I learned SO MUCH. It was so eye opening to be looking at the migrant experience through so many lenses. The readings were all great. Professor Camacho was amazing. And the final project is actually a super cool opportunity. The only weakness I think is that if the classroom were set up more seminar style I think it wouldve been maybe even more engaging.",
                "Due to the large size of the class, sometimes discussion was difficult to begin. However, I think that this was more because of the physical space we were in where the instructor spoke to us in a lecture-style classroom. I think that this course is best suited for seminar discussion. This does not take away from the fact that I learned so much from all the other people that took the class who otherwise would not have been able to get a spot if it were a seminar.",
                "Although collaborative, the large leminar class made it difficult to have engaging and meaningful conversations about the work we read/analyzed. It was easy to get distracted. The topics we covered were super relevant and significant to my learning, but I felt they deserved more discussion (because of how important they are).",
                "Strengths: Students are given the freedom to interact with the weekly material from an academic perspective as well as a personal one. The weekly themes also helped ground my approach to the reading materials and understand the learning objectives.\r\nWeaknesses: Difficulty engaging all students into a whole group discussion."

This course covers a great variety of topics, from the border to resistance efforts. Professor Camacho is an excellent instructor and will share substantial insight into these course themes.",

I would also recommend this course to anyone interested in completing a rigorous final project that grants you the opportunity to work with and learn more about the landscape of migrant-led organizing by working with a migrant-led organization with you and and your group.",

                "ER&M 387 Migrants and Borders in the Americas, as taught by Ezra Stiles Head of College Alicia Schmidt Camacho, is a seminar that employs a migrant-centered approach to the examination of human mobility. Discussions regarding the ethics and methods for social research, including oral interviews, cultural analysis, and social documentation were underscored, ultimately leading to the completion of a personal research project that touched upon mobility as a material and embodied process that is inextricably intertwined with layered pluralities of violence. If this is something that would be of interest, that I would recommend.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if it was a smaller seminar. The topics are super relevant and, although it can be hard to discuss some of the topics, it was super special to have a space where we could acknowledge and understand the difficult but very real lives of immigrants.",
