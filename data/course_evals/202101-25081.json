                "strengths: extremely interesting but occasionally mind-boggling lectures. The HW is more chill as compared with lecture, and the tests are like slightly harder versions of the homework. Overall the work balance seemed very appropriate, especially as Diana's first time teaching it. Office hours feel very communal and Diana is great at guiding you to finding problem solutions.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: Lecture can go a little too quickly sometimes, but you just have to learn to be very attentive so you don't zone out and loose track of what's going on entirely."
