We underwent some rehearsals, some acting exercises, some physicality exercises, some solo work, collaborative work, etc. \r\n\r\nI feel more adequately equipped to approach acting. I now have tools for approaching the script, the table work, the on-the-feet work, the rehearsal, and the fine tuning.\r\n\r\nI thought I developed my acting and my technique.\r\n\r\nIt is very much a class where you get as much from it as you put in.",

                "Hal is very patient, which can be very helpful or can be abused by some. We fell behind this semester because so many came to class unprepared and it set a precedent that dominated the pace. So, if other students aren't involved the class as a whole will be much less exciting.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is that it does not take place in a theater/rehearsal space. We used two separate classrooms where we had to clear the chairs and tables. I think you can act anywhere, but I do think some spaces are more conducive to risk-taking and acting rehearsal, and these spaces were quite inconvenient.\r\n\r\nHal covers a lot of ground in this class and I'd honestly say that you can get a good sense for all the concepts despite the speed of it, but if you fall behind as we did it can be confusing.",
                "It is a really good acting class and I have become a better actor from taking it.  However, it took up a lot more time than I anticipated since it is a lot of class time and you have to do a lot of prep work before class. I think it would have been better if we had more time in class to practice our work."
