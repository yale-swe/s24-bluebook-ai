                "By the nature of learning a language, the experience was simply not as productive over Zoom as it would otherwise have been. Something is lost when there is no body language or real-time feedback to assist in communication. One adjustment which I found successful was the replacement of the final skit with a film presentation. With a skit, it would have been difficult to act and coordinate with other students, but the film presentation was a solo act.",

If there's anything I felt like I was missing, it was the opportunity to try to interact with others, besides my professor, in French.",
