                "I developed skills about early modern reading habits and the ways in which reading and writing have changed over various time periods.",

                "Strengths: Reasonable amount of reading each week; shorter readings were especially helpful for focusing on particular themes and centering class discussions. Professors were extremely welcoming and encouraged us to be honest about the difficulty of the readings, our opinions on the topics involved, and extracurricular connections to the text. Generous grading which emphasized experimentation and engagement over formal correctness.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses (??): No discussion posts or similar checks on reading, so undisciplined students (like me) can find it easy to slack off and not make the most out of the rich readings. It is wholly possible (though obviously uncommendable) to complete all of the assignments without ever having to engage with the class discussions or readings.",
                "Cathy and Eve were the best professors for this course. Both were so engaging, empathetic, knowledgeable, and kind. They brought modern perspectives on Renaissance texts and had such intention when developing the curriculum. This class made me think about reading and its purpose unlike any other English class at Yale.",
                "The professors are absolutely amazing and I think they do a great job of allowing you to choose how involved with the course you want to be. Because they are so engaging, most people did a lot, but if you get behind it's a bit easy to stay back.",
                "NO WEAKNESSES! All the strengths of this course lie in Cathy and Eve as they are indeed the most inclusive and generative instructors who make sure everyone around the table is heard.",
                "I loved the selection of readings we had in this class because they facilitated engaging and interesting discussions."

            "comments": [
                "YES ABSOLUTELY. Cathy and Eve are wonderful, and the class wouldn't be the same without their care, curiosity, and approachability, but even on its own, the concept of this course is sorely needed in the English department. This course is a meta-study of the purpose of reading and allows us to investigate our assumptions about English as a literary language. It's also intensely fun; the readings are diverse and interesting, discussions are lively and closely shaped to student interest. Please take this class. It will make you a better person.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "I definitely would recommend it. This is a great course for any English major trying to get their time period requirement, but also an engaging not too difficult course that is still interesting.",
                "I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this course to anyone who would like to critically engage with the syllabus and reading requirements created by the English department. We were actively examining the hierarchical power structures and influence of reading by tracing its early modern origins and this class questioned my entire perception of literature! I honestly don't say this about most courses in the English department but I felt so seen in this course as the seminar allowed all students to bring their subjective selves into all the Renaissance readings. I came into this class wanting to fulfill my Renaissance requirement and left wanting to learn more about early modern work in relation to modern rhetoric on literacy!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was unlike any English class I've taken at Yale so far. I still remember the first few weeks when we discussed the development of the alphabet  it really shaped my understanding of how reading and writing came to be and what struggles early modern readers were facing."
