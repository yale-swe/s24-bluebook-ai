                "This course helped me see where I needed to improve in my writing. Obviously, the readings were challenging, but that forced me to improve my close reading skills and really pay attention to language on a micro-level.",
                "This is a fantastic class!!!! If you can, TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR ELIAS!! You get the chance to dive into some fantastic works of literature that are great in and of themselves, but are particularly significant in the development of English literature. Professor Elias does a fantastic job putting the canonical texts we read in conversation with contemporaneous and\/or modern works in a way that illuminates what makes the canonical texts, and the texts they influenced or were influenced by so good. Professor Elias is one of the best teachers I've ever had, and he manages to strike a rare balance between being kind\/encouraging, and really pushing us to be rigorous in our analysis. You can tell that he is genuinely passionate about the texts we read (the Canterbury Tales in particular), and I was always left with the feeling that he is genuinely interested in what we have to say, and that he is thinking deeply about our points. Professor Elias also provides a ton of feedback on your writing in a way that really helps you improve."

                "Strengths: Professor Elias was amazing! His feedback was so clear and so helpful; I really felt as though his feedback was meant to help us get better and improve our writing (as feedback should!). Class discussions were always very lively, and various opinions\/interpretations were always encouraged and discussed. The texts were quite interesting and engaging (even for someone who wasn't initially in love with the idea of reading Middle English poetry). The essay prompts were also very thought-provoking!\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "I think some variation in how the course is run day to day could be improved, as it became a little monotonous having it be the same each time. Also I loved the attention to modern variations of the classic works we read, so more things like that would be great!",
                "It was a very good foundational course and had interesting discussions and feedback. It was somewhat the same for the whole semester, could have benefitted from some variation.",
                "I really enjoyed how Professor Elias had us focus on small sections of readings. For example, when we read Shakespeare, we would spend the entire class discussing only one or two sonnets, which was useful in terms of close reading and analysis. I wish we could have had more time with Paradise Lost since it was the last reading for the class, and since the epic itself is so long. It sort of felt like we were racing through the books towards the end of the semester, but I understand that we have a limited number of weeks to get through so many things.",
                "This class does a fantastic job at teaching the canon, but putting it in context of non-canonical works in a way that provides a much fuller picture. You also write a lot, and you get a lot of feedback, which is fantastic if you want to improve your writing."

Even if you are not interested in Middle English literature, this course is a great way to push yourself beyond your comfort zone and get some great experience in analysis (with fantastic guidance and feedback from Professor Elias).",
                "Yes! Especially if someone is interested in these works.",
                "Yes, the reading was informative and the discussions were productive.",
                "I took this course because one of my friends recommended it to me, and I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is willing to take on a challenge and improve their reading and writing. Although this course is a lot of work, I benefited from it immensely, and I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of reading, as well as the variety.",
                "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! Particularly with Professor Elias!!! He is fantastic and makes this class particularly fun and engaging. I definitely became a better English student and writer, and I learned a lot."
