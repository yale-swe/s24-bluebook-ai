   "comments": [
    "I learned how the financial system works and an intricate understanding of the 2008 financial crisis. I enjoyed the course and became a better writer following it.",
    "Much more insight about the factors that went into the Financial Crisis than I ever would've had if I hadn't taken the course.",
    "I have a much stronger grasp on the causes and ramifications of the financial crisis than I did before taking the course. Professor Metrick made me reevaluate my preconceived notions on the crisis and helped me understand it in a whole new light. With 36 pages of writing in total over the course of the semester, I also got invaluable practice writing and researching.",
    "I learned about the long-term and proximate causes of the Global Financial Crisis, the set of policy responses of the US federal government, and the continuing impacts of the crisis in Europe. This entailed diving into the structure of the US financial system, e.g. subprime mortgages, intermediaries, securitization, etc. I also learned how to write different-length economic analyses, ranging from 3-page memos to a 12-page research paper.",
    "Professor Metrick offers a new, comprehensive way of looking at the Global Financial Crisis that would be hard to find as easily laid out or as persuasive anywhere else.",
    "I feel like this class gives you a very comprehensive review of the global financial crisis. You come out of the class really knowledgeable and with opinions on many events.",
    "Overview of the financial crisis - its causes and consequences.",
    "how to write econ papers \r\nhow to read econ papers \r\nthe value of independent studying",
    "This course helped me develop the analytical skills necessary to evaluate macro-fundamental developments and shifts in the regulatory system of American finance. Furthermore, we learned many of the causal mechanisms of the global financial crisis and how decades of a Balkanized and lax regulatory system combined with an evolving financial sector to create the conditions perfect for this economic disaster.",
    "I received an in-depth analysis of the Global Financial Crisis by some of the world's experts.",
    "A balanced insight into the global financial crisis by looking at a variety of sources",
    "Critical thinking about Economics in a global setting: how different actors interacted to create the GFC, how we responded, and the work ahead.",
    "I learned nothing in this class.",
    "This is a great course to learn about the intricacies of financial crises and key measurements. Its a good way of getting introduced to the literature on these topics.",
    "I went into this course with almost no knowledge about finance, and minimal knowledge about the financial crisis of 2008. I learned an incredible amount about the drivers of the crisis, case studies on specific firms and situations, monetary and fiscal policy responses to the crisis, the worldwide impacts, and the current position of the US economy.",
    "Learned quite a bit about the Global Financial Crisis, the leadup to it, and its aftermath. Definitely picked up a few quite useful concepts about, for instance, the repo market and the Fed's unconventional monetary policy in response to the crisis, as well as obviously a very detailed history of the events themselves. Overall, though, I'm not sure I got quite as much out of it as I would have hoped, as much of the financial environment today is quite different than it was before the crisis (probably for the better lol.) A very solid class, though, in which you can expect to learn a lot about the history and context of the GFC.",
    "Knowledge on the GFC, who was responsible, why financial crises arise, policies to tackle them, general intuition and knowledge on finance-related topics.",
    "The course takes a very in depth look into the financial crisis and as a result I felt that I understood with greater clarity its causes and consequences.",
    "I learned a lot about the 2008 financial crisis, of course.",
    "Global financial crisis",
    "This class significantly informed by understanding of the GFC, founding it in facts and knowledge of the events from first-hand participants.",
    "I gained a solid understanding of the 2007-2008 crisis."

   "comments": [
    "The course was engaging and incredibly interesting. The modules were well designed and Metrick was a very good lecturer. Additionally, we covered complex topics that required no prior knowledge to comprehend.\r\n\r\nMy only drawback was the lack of interaction between MBA students and Yale college students. There was not much time for collaboration or interaction.",
    "Getting speakers that personally dealt with the Financial Crisis was a very interesting experience and should be kept as part of the course.",
    "Strengths: exceptionally taught; flipped format is conducive for learning; fascinating subject; well organized; lots of opportunities to ask questions\r\nWeaknesses: lost some of its momentum in the last quarter of the class - might benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the crisis's ongoing consequences",
    "Strengths: Metrick is a *great* professor -- engaged, brilliant, eager to get to know students. He manufactures complex examples and scenarios to explain a core concept with remarkable ease, and his genuine excitement regarding the material bleeds through his lectures. Weaknesses: I didn't love the flipped classroom, but it wasn't a huge impediment to my learning. Geithner is also not a super engaging lecturer, but it was sometimes cool to get his thoughts on the crisis.",
    "The online lectures were at times tedious and could become either a time crunch to do the day before or easy to forget until day of when the online quizzes would ave already closed - if the point of the quizzes is engagement, why close them midnight before the class??",
    "Professor Metrick was an amazing strength for this class. He is so knowledgeable and helpful and makes the material accessible to anyone interested in the topic. I personally liked writing the memos as it forces you to learn about different topics within the GFC. \r\n\r\nI did not love the response papers (about books and FCIC report) as they were more difficult to write and graded more harshly. Nevertheless, I learned a lot.",
    "Clearer syllabus",
    "Strengths: Metrick is the best lecturer I have had at Yale. What a voice!  Sometimes you think, he must be mic'ed up. Nope! That man's voice CARRIES. Underwood style. He is very funny and charming and clearly THE expert on this subject. The quizzes, also, make sure you have engaged with the online lecture material and all the writing benefits your understanding of the crisis phenomenally.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was little incentive to come to class after I got the full Community Contribution points. Before I got full points, there was still the potential shame of getting your answer put on the screen and you weren't there. For that reason, I went every day. I never got my answer put up. Shame.",
    "I do like the quizzes and everything but I feel like the quizzes should be based on readings so people are more incentivized to do that.\r\nI really dislike the flipped structure.\r\nI honestly never went to class because it just seemed like the management kids were just trying to flex their knowledge all the time",
    "I think the course could be improved by covering more of the key concepts in class rather than on Coursera. After all, we didn't sign up to take a public source video series online. That being said, the online videos were very helpful, I just wish our lectures could be more interactive with learning taking place in the classroom rather than at home.",
    "The strengths are that it is super comprehensive and goes into detail.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are that not many people come to some lectures as the entire class can be taken through materials uploaded on Canvas.",
    "Strengths: Interesting readings and topics, classroom discussions.\r\nWeaknesses: I really hated the fact discussions of the topics papers were about were held AFTER the paper was due. This does not only massively decrease students' attendance (less incentive to go as the essay has already been submitted) but leads to more frustration for those who realize they made a mistake.",
    "This class was a waste of everyones time. All of the assignments were writing based but the TAs didnt even take the time to read them so grading was totally arbitrary. I think the TAs also didnt know anything about writing so the minimal comments they did provide were useless anyways. Lets be honest, most Yale College students are better writers than the random SOM bureaucrats they pulled out of the woodwork to help grade for this class. This class either needs to a) ditch the papers or b) get teaching staff who actually know how to write. That is the fundamental flaw with this class - I wasted countless hours writing papers to be evaluated by finance PhDs who dont know the first thing about writing. The YC students in this class should have been grading the teaching staffs writing instead of the other way around. The lectures were also mostly online so im not sure why I ever went to class. Metrick was cool but I dont think he realizes what a disaster the teaching staff side of this class was. The teaching staff (especially Roz) sometimes didnt even respond to emails. Some of their comments on papers were just factually wrong too. What a disappointment. I have never written a negative review for a class before but this one warrants it.",
    "At first I was hesitant about the flipped classroom style of the course, but it turned out to be FANTASTIC! The video lectures are very well made and it helps to have them to rewatch and refer back to throughout the course. The only thing is that watching them and taking notes can be pretty time consuming, but if youre excited about the course material, that shouldnt be a huge problem.",
    "The course's number 1 strength is Metrick: he's a powerful and knowledgeable lecturer, an approachable person, and someone who's just really really dedicated to both his teaching and his research. At the same time, I often found that it wasn't worth going to class even as much as I enjoyed the lectures. Most, if not all, of the content you need to do the assignments is on the course modules and in outside readings that you have to cite in order to do well on papers among the undergrads. In fact, the undergrad curve is super tight and clustered at the high end; it seems like the grading is really lenient, which makes it difficult to even determine where you are in the curve (which they only release once--halfway through the semester.) I ended up Credit D-ing the class because of the opacity of the grading scheme, but that was probably a mistake because I still had to put in the effort to do the papers outside of class, and I always hated skipping because the lectures were interesting--I just didn't have to go and thus scheduled things in place of the lecture. Lessons for you, then, are: (1) take it only if you're willing to put up with the obnoxious grading, and it's not worth Credit D-ing; (2) go to lecture when Metrick is there because even if the material doesn't seem immediately relevant to a paper you'll always learn something; and (3) understand that you're not gonna suddenly understand the modern financial system through this class because it's changed so much since the crisis, so know what exactly the subject of the class is.",
    "Strengths: clear videos, Metrick is an engaging lecturer\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of feedback on written assignments, Q&A style of lecture\/flipped classroom was unengaging, could not follow many of the Q&As, grad students asked questions that were beyond the level of undergrads. Would be better if lectures focused on content rather than just answering qns for 1h 20min. Didn't have much feedback on grading over the semester as well, everyone got very high scores on assignments and it was worrying that we don't know where we stand mid-semester.\r\n\r\nMaterial on the course seemed to only provide one side of the perspective, that the financial crisis was caused by macro forces, while government and Wall Street did not have much responsibility. Would appreciate two sides of the perspective and perhaps more insights on who was responsible, what were the questionable moral decisions, etc.",
    "The passion of the professor and the fact that the material is taught through online modules freeing up lecture time to discuss the material in greater depth. But because the class is mainly graduate students, there is an assumption of familiarity with the jargon which is not necessarily the case for Yale College students, which can make the first few lectures hard to follow but this quickly resolves itself.",
    "This course was incredibly well facilitated, and is one of the most well structured and administered courses I've ever taken.",
    "I liked how the course videos were recorded, so that class time could be used to answer questions."

   "comments": [
    "100%. This course is incredibly interesting for anyone who is interested in understanding how our financial system disintegrated in 2008. Economic majors should take the course to understand the perils of bad macro policy while those interested in politics would find understanding the ramifications of long term macro trends engaging. Nearly all majors in political science, economics, and history should take this course.",
    "Yes, many times the factors that led to the Financial Crisis are misunderstood and this course sheds light onto many of the myths.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The subject is fascinating and Professor Metrick is an exceptional speaker - informed, humorous, and enlightening.",
    "Yes! I didn't have much background in economics prior to taking the course, so I had to work hard to understand the concepts and terminology that permeated readings and discussions. But, once I did, I found the class remarkably rewarding, and I feel like I understand the GFC in a significant degree of depth. Metrick is an awesome professor.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed this course immensely and would recommend it to another student not only for the material of the course but also for Professor Metrick who was fun and engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student attempting to work in the financial world. Knowing what happened in the crisis is important to any field that tangentially touches finance. You will not understand the current political climate or regulation without understanding the causes and consequences of the crisis.",
    "Yes - a good way to build financial understanding",
    "Absolutely take this class. If you watched The Big Short and think you know everything about the 2008 financial crisis, take this class. Because this class will teach you that the crisis was not just a result of big banks acting recklessly, it wasn't just the elite acting against the interests of the working class. It certainly was a bit of that, but there's so much more.",
    "Yes good overview of financial crisis, also more qualitative than quantitative",
    "Yes! Learned a lot about the gritty details of the financial crisis, as well as the financial system in general. Great guest speakers, Metrick is a great lecturer who seems to know pretty much anything you could ask about.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, regardless of a background in economics or finance, who wants to learn more about the financial crisis of 2008 and how it happened, what happened, and how it influenced other countries' economies and continues to influence the global economy today.",
    "Yes, it is an excellent course for anyone interested in the topic.",
    "Yes, if the student is interested in the GFC and doesn't mind writing a lot.",
    "Avoid this class at all costs. You only have 4 years in Yale College - go learn something actually interesting instead of wasting your time studying current events and prostituting yourself to the idol of pre-professionalism. Also, you will waste dozens of hours writing papers for this class that the TAs will barely even read.",
    "Yes! Professor Metrick is a very engaging and passionate lecturer and it is really cool to get insight from Secretary Geithner as well.",
    "Yes, but only if you're willing to put up with the annoying grading and understand that the course material is very tailored to the crisis itself and less focused on broad concepts relating to the modern (i.e. post-08) financial system.",
    "Yes if you have some knowledge on finance beforehand, if not it might be quite challenging but still possible. Many written assignments (4 memos, more if you wanna do well because they count the best 4, 2 6-page papers, and 1 12-page paper).",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to people interested in economics and those who generally want to understand the crisis, it is one of the most engaging and well taught classes I have taken.",
    "Yes definitely take it. Metrick is an awesome professor and you get to learn a lot about what caused the financial crisis. Going in I thought the banks were responsible for the crisis but after this course, I'm not even sure who to blame for the crisis.",
    "I have recommended this course and will continue to do so.",
    "Yes! The Great Recession and its ramifications are such important topics."
