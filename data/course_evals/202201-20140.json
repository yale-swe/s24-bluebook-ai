Its surprising to see how innocuous stories can contain hidden agendas and can unconsciously influence you. This course uses 17th-century French printed works to demonstrate how arguments can be made more convincing using elements outside of the logic itself.",

                "Fun 17th century French works to read. The prof is really engaging and the passion rubs off on the class. Theres also deep questions about the need to interrogate the presentation of our current media and how they unconsciously influence us. The readings are usually pretty short, but there are reading responses up to twice a week (not always) which is a lot of work added up. The papers are also deceptively long due to the 1.5 spacing he demands. The Beinecke visits and the guest speakers he arranged were fantastic, but this course might need handouts from time to time to remind students of key points.",

People curious about newspapers today and their affects on Society should also consider this class. Anyone who wants to write to a large audience with the intent to persuade should also take a stab at this.",
                "One hundred percent yes. The content was always interesting (it was really cool getting to read literature straight from the 17th century) and easy to interact with, Professor Schuwey is absolutely amazing when it comes to leading discussions, and I found my mind to be blown every day by the conclusions from our classes.",
