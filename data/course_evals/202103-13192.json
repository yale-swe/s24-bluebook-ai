                "This course allowed me to not only learn about a number of health activist movements, but also to think about the historical and social contexts under which these movements emerge and about how inequities in health reflect and reinforce social and economic inequality. I gained insight as to what makes movements more or less effective and learned to be critical of even the most successful movements.",
                "I learned how to critically analyze primary and secondary sources as well as how to discuss them in a class setting.",

                "I learned the breadth of health activism throughout the twentieth century! I also gained lots of confidence in speaking in smaller, upper-level seminars where I was able to have the space to participate while listening learning immensely from my peers. It was also the first time I was able to go digging through primary sources and letting that inform my essay rather than the other way around. Overall this class was an amazing experience!!",

            "comments": [
                "The content is very interesting and important to learn, but I do wish we had more readings written by (and addressing) people of color throughout the course",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Created space for us to critique different movements\r\n- Each meeting of the seminar offered us different ways to engage with the material- watching clips, reviewing as a small group, doing a small bit of research. It felt very well organized! \r\n- Prof. O'Donnell was always very accessible to meet and talk through any confusions and provide advice for how to structure our thinking\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The syllabus focused predominantly on the activism of white, wealthy communities throughout history. Rather than holding one week that focused on community health activism that highlighted the work of communities of color, I think it would be beneficial to incorporate those narratives across every week - for example, including examples of reproductive justice activism in our conversation on abortion, etc. This would also provide us with more concrete examples of working outside of the system, since the focus of the course was predominantly on working inside the system (in my opinion!)",
                "Strengths: The course content is fascinating, the syllabus is well structured and exposes students to a diversity of health activist movements, the final paper is a good opportunity to pick a topic of interest and explore it in depth, readings are super manageable and interesting, there are ample opportunities to engage with the class, Professor O'Donnell creates an engaging, yet low-stakes classroom environment, visit to the Cushing Center\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The usefulness of the peer reviews varied, expectations as to what exactly was expected of the op-ed assignment could have been clearer",
                "The material is niche and interesting. A great group of students led to really great discussions. Prof O'Donnell is amazing",
                "I think the structure of the course as case-study based was a huge strength, along with the guest speakers and the visit to the Medical Historical Library. All of these aspects allowed us to delve into the topics more in depth. However, I think a major weakness was the fact that it largely centered on white activism, which was a disappointing element of the class. I was hoping we would talk more about intersectionality within healthcare activism.",
                "All strengths, and no weaknesses. Professor ODonnell is so kind and caring, and the workload was perfect. Nothing felt like busy work  everything really helped create a full picture of the history of health care in the United States as well as efforts to reform the system. All assignments also helped increase engagement with the material and lessons.",
                "All of the topics that were covered in class were amazing and always led to very engaging conversations. I know there are only so many weeks in the semester but I think it would have been cool to have a unit dedicated to mental health and the Black Panther Party respectively. This has been one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale thus far. The readings that were assigned were very manageable and clearly intentional. They did a great job of spurring thought-provoking and fluid conversations. The only minimal weakness of the course I could think of is I would have appreciated a little but more feedback on writing assignments, but other than that I loved this class!",
                "This class was a survey course of many different moments in time, and I really appreciated getting to learn about so many different issues. I also thought the workload was very fair and lined up well with the pace of the semester/class. Professor O'Donnell was also very understanding that this semester was still extremely difficult for many people, which I really appreciated. That being said, I think we were talking about the same questions every week (is it possible to work within the establishment? or should we only work outside the establishment?) without getting anywhere. I would have liked to see more readings talking about examples of working outside the system, since only having a week to talk about the Black Panthers and the Young Lords was nowhere near sufficient to learn about all of the work they did. Also, many of our readings were focused only on white people and I wish we could have read more by authors of color on how these issues affected them. I think this led to some frustration because there were definitely weeks where we could have talked a lot about how people of color were affected by certain health issues and we did not. For example, there was no discussion of race during the week where we read about breast cancer activism, even though quickly google searching for work by women of color on how they have been impacted by breast cancer gives many results. I would add more readings and discussion on how race intersects with these health issues (and others that we didn't talk about, like environmental health and prison abolition).",
                "strengths: the overall format of the class was great - it was pretty much student-led with perfectly timed input from Professor O'Donnell that deepened the discussion immensely. Weaknesses: would've loved to see greater diversity within the authors and time periods of health activism (antebellum era, present-day) and a session on primary source analysis would've been very helpful!",
                "I really enjoyed the readings that Professor O'Donnell chose each week. I also enjoyed the opportunity to write an op-ed because I had never done so before. My favorite part of this class, though, had to be the numerous guest speakers that Professor O'Donnell recruited to speak to us. It is so important and inspiring to have conversations with real people pursuing jobs in fields relevant to course materials. One weakness of this course pertains to class discussions, which sometimes felt repetitive. Given Professor O'Donnell's expertise in the histories of medicine and health, a few guiding questions posed by her during each class would go a long way in terms of generating more fruitful, robust, and intellectually stimulating conversations.",
                "This course is well-organized and the readings were generally very interesting. It is formatted around key themes that add nuance to the history of health in the United States. The assignments were also really reasonable and always felt helpful and relevant. The major weaknesses were that the discussion generally touched on topics that are really important, like race, in a way that felt superficial. This was definitely because the syllabus did not consistently include readings that centered on people of color, even when the topic of that week seemed to call for a discussion on race. This was the first year this course is taught, and I do think this could and will be improved in future iterations of the class. I also did not feel that I received great feedback in this course, especially considering that it was a writing credit.",
                "Great readings but not a lot of discussion structure",
                "The course was organized really well. I've never had a professor that was so good at using Canvas effectively. In discussions, the environment was set up very well to allow everyone to speak and the readings selected always gave me new perspective on issues even if I'd studied them before."

The syllabus exposes you to a lot of interesting readings and the workload is super manageable if you are proactive with the final paper. Discussion posts were due before every class, but were a good opportunity to reflect on readings and themes before class and were really low-stakes. The quality of a seminar depends a lot on the students in it, but the course topic attracted really cool people and class was engaging and allowed for a lot of candid conversations about the nature of health and healthcare in the US. Professor O'Donnell is also really approachable, and makes it easy to participate in class and look forward to discussions.",
                "Yes, amazing course and amazing professor",
                "I would recommend this course because it was really interesting to investigate healthcare activism through the lens of case studies. The assignments allowed you to explore your own interests, but also develop your writing, which was helpful. There were several guest speakers which was super interesting, specifically the guest speaker from the Washington Post who came to explain how to write an op-ed. I would say that the course doesn't delve into intersectionality quite as much as I wanted it to.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Favorite course Ive take at Yale.",
                "I would say yes, especially if the syllabus is revised to be more intersectional. I feel much more knowledgeable about the history of the medical establishment and certain health movements, like the women's health movement. I also liked that our assignments could be about whatever we wanted, which gave me a lot of flexibility in picking topics I was really interested in writing about.",
                "Yes I absolutely would!! Professor O'Donnell was amazing and I think the major themes we studied in class are NECESSARY for anyone going into the medical field, or remotely interested in public health!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Applying a historical lens to the medical establishment and health care activism and advocacy in twentieth and twenty-first century America affords people the opportunity to better understand long-standing issues as well as potential remedies to some of our countries most pressing and devastating problems regarding unequal access to health care. This course also makes students reckon their own definitions of \"health\" and consider the fact that a majority of factors that inform and shape health outcomes are located far outside the walls of a hospital.",
                "I would recommend this course if the syllabus is modified to be a bit more inclusive. I think professor O'Donnell is great and the topic is really interesting, I just would feel uncomfortable recommending the content as it is, since I do not feel it is really representative of different perspectives.",
                "Yes!",
