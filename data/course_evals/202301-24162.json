I mean, the new student lecturer each day made this class so fun, and the 30-45 minutes spent just discussing thoughts and questions with Professor Bercovici were so interesting. I learned about the origins of the universe, solar system, eyes, human civilization, and everything in between.",

                "It was a very informative course, i came in knowing nothing about the origins of the earth or climate, but now i know a lot. Great course to discuss various mysteries  of the Earth.",
                "I acquired a general overview of scientific origin theories. Topics ranged from cosmology (Big Bang, galaxy formation, star formation, etc) to biology (origin of photosynthesis, unicellular life, multicellular life, animals, etc) to anthropology (origin of humans, origin of civilization)."

            "comments": [
                "This course's strengths are that new daily student lecturers kept things interesting and allowed students to give a formal presentation about something that interested them with relatively low-stakes. With this class, you can really explore your interests with your presentation and make the origin topic you choose your own. Each student has a different way of presenting the origin topics and their interests outside of the class are really conveyed in their discussion of the topic they pick. Through this class, you get to build a close relationship with Professor Bercovici and the other students in the seminar, and it generates a lot of extremely interesting discussion.",
                "Prof Bercovici is fantastic",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed how we all got to focus on specific things. Weaknesses: Sometimes I felt as if I didn't really get any guidance regarding how I should present the material.",
                "Really fun class! You just get to learn and talk about cool science stuff and enjoy learning it without having to worry about taking an exam. Really brings the fun back into science :)",
                "Strengths: open format, professor, degree of autonomy within the course\r\nWeaknesses: as a stem major, I hoped to go into a bit more depth\/for things to be slightly more technical, but I understand that the course is designed to give a broad overview of most major origin hypothesis rather than explore a few origin hypotheses in detail."

                "YES. Professor B is awesome and the course is great because you can learn without stressing about extremely difficult exams, etc. You get to actually engage with the material",
                "Take this class! It is so much fun and it is an amazing opportunity to get experience in EPS without being afraid of not understanding everything. Through this class, you get to hear about a little bit of everything, from geology to biology to history. It's structured to encourage students to ask questions, and is just so interesting overall.",
                "Absolutely recommend it to anyone",
                "I would because if science is not one's speciality, this course is a great entry to that.",
                "Yes. I liked the instructor, very chill and well informed. It was cool getting the opportunity to talk to him and learn from him. The summaries can be stressful, but overall, its a chill and very educational, and overall njce experience. He is also understanding when life events pop up, so that makes it an even better  class to take.",
                "Absolutely! Prof Bercovici is so knowledgable and is a really good teacher. He explains complicated topics very well so that even the least science-experience people can understand. Every class was like a TED Talk, learned so much and had a great time!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, although I would not recommend this course to a stem major unless they are interested in receiving a broad overview of many different scientific topics, as some of this course may be a review. However, I think this is a really great, interesting course. I really enjoyed how individualized the coursework is; students can really focus on what interests them and study a topic of their choosing in great detail.",
                "YES! This course was one of my favorite so far at Yale. I learned so much and enjoyed every class."
