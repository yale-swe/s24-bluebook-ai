                "GLBL 430 taught me more than I can say! This course gave me a thorough grounding in the principles and practices of peacebuilding, particularly through its thematic focus. I learned the chronological progression that underpins most every peace agreement (e.g., bringing warring factions to the negotiating table, pursuing disarmament, etc.). I also learned about the wide and intersecting range of conditions that are necessary to sustain peace. Furthermore, this course introduced me (particularly through the work of Sverine Autesserre) to incisive critiques of peacebuilding orthodoxy.",
                "This course was incredible. It truly changed the way I look at the real-life applications of peacebuilding, what peace means, and how I seek to approach my career in the future. We learned about the logistics of how peace treaties are enforced from someone with years of life experience, and had our eyes opened to the current debates in the field and how they related to historical examples. I truly learned so much."

                "This course invites students to engage in robust conversation about how to build and sustain peace in communities ravaged by conflict. I really appreciated having the opportunity to share my perspective and to learn from Amb. Williams and my peers. Amb. Williams assigned a wide and innovative range of projects. Creating my peace road map, for example, solidified my understanding of the concepts we had discussed in class. It was also amazing to learn from Amb. Williams' firsthand experiences. Our class discussions would often depart from the syllabus which reflects the open forum that Amb. Williams facilitated, though I understand it may not complement everyone's learning style.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Williams has a lot of cool stories and experience to share with regards to peacebuilding. I also think the course was structured in a good way as it first started out discussing causes for conflict, and then examined peace building on the ground in various ways.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We ended up not getting to a lot of important parts of the course (presenting our midterm projects, discussing key readings) due to each seminar not following a strict schedule. I also didn't really find value in the \"students presenting readings\" aspect of the course, as it felt like it took too long and I would rather simply discuss the readings.",
                "Strengths were the syllabus (incredibly detailed, great mix of theoretical and practical), discussions (expansive and thoughtful), and, of course, Ambassador Williams herself, who imbued the class with so much energy, experience and knowledge. Weakness was sometimes the organization but it was only because we got pushed back because we had such great class discussions."

                "Yes. Everyone should take this course to gain a greater global perspective, understand current conflicts from a experienced lens, and really relate theory to  practice. Exceptional class that was incredibly fun and engaging."
