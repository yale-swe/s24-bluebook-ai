I'm so grateful to Yale and Profesora Sab for the opportunity to expand myself intellectually and personally as I try to meet and exceed my goal of Spanish fluency.",

                "This was the best language course I have take so far. Profesora Sab is remarkable. I hope you can give her an award for going to extraordinary lengths to make her students feel comfortable with speaking in Spanish during class and for having the most reassuring personality. She posed very thought-provoking questions. In this class, I have seen my intellect grow significantly through Profa Sab's instruction and personality.",
                "Professor Lourdes Sab was great and the content was interesting especially towards the end of the semester. I wish the course had less graded homework and assessments.",
                "Strength: Professor Sabe is a very engaged professor who is committed to ensuring her students are prepared not just for class material but also for adopting the Spanish language and culture; Detailed feedback\r\nWeakness: Although the class is 1.5 credits, there is still a lot of work and not a lot of time to complete it; Little opportunity to catch up if you fall behind",
                "A strength of the course is the frequency of work in order to keep using spanish, however a weakness was lots of busy work which was also graded harshly, making it not enjoyable while completing.",
                "This class was really well designed! The daily workload was fairly consistent and we followed the syllabus nearly perfectly. The cultural and historical elements were especially enjoyable and important during this phase of language learning.",
                "Strengths: The high level of engagement and constant, consistent practice pushed me to improve my Spanish speaking skills. Even though this class was a lot of work, it definitely forces you to grow as a language learner overall.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes big assignments like essays, special projects, and exams were back to back in the syllabus. Standing alone, each project is very helpful and conducive to learning, but when all these big  assignments are so back to  back, it  actually winds up hindering students learning and progress. I would recommend a revision of the syllabus layout so as to  avoid these back to back occurrences.",
                "I was able to apply material learned well and understood conceptual focuses. I could have been more engaged and worked more on my oral skills",

The downfall, though, was that it was really difficult to establish relationships with peers, and made the class seem more independent than my previous in-person classes have been."
