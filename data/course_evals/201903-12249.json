    "I learned about architectural, art historical, literary, and social perspectives on Chartres Cathedral (and cathedrals in general) in the 12th-13th centuries.",
    "This was a very unique class. I don't think I will every have the opportunity to study one monumental object like Chartres Cathedral in such depth again. Through this class, I definitely gained a greater appreciation of religion, and how religious buildings function both artistically, philosophically, and theologically.",
    "This course was humanities in its most interdisciplinary and far-reaching form. I learned and read about art history, literature, iconography, philosophy, history--all through the lens of Chartres Cathedral.",
    "Learned a great deal about the Middle Ages and iconography more generally",
    "I learned about Chartres Cathedral, one of the most celebrated buildings of the medieval period: the liturgical function, its architecture, its role in French culture and society.",
    "A tremendous course-- Professors Bloch and Jung are perfect complements in terms of style and expertise, their expansive knowledge of the Middle Ages funneled masterfully through the lens of Chartres Cathedral. Like the Medieval philosophical approach of Scholasticism, they provide a unity sometimes elusive in Humanities course and here aided by the veritable \"memory palace\" of Chartres."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "While both the professors were very knowledgeable and made class interesting, the main weakness of this course is that it was effectively a lecture despite being marketed as a seminar. The professors had to teach a lot of material in class, but we were left with basically no time to actually discuss it.",
    "While this was a seminar, a lot of class time felt lecture-like at times. This was fine because Professor Bloch and Jung were fantastic, but I wish we had more time to discuss the readings, because otherwise they felt kind of ancillary.",
    "I think there are some slight improvements that could be made with this course. It is the first time it is being taught so I understand everyone was working things out. I would have appreciated maybe some more small assignments or milestones with the final paper, just to better understand where I stood in the course. Both professors are extremely knowledgable in their respective areas as well as lovely and approachable. The material was very enjoyable and thorough.",
    "The strengths were the instructors--Professors Bloch and Jung were amazing. They are truly experts in their fields and so dedicated to teaching as well. They brought their wealth of knowledge and excitement for Chartres and medieval history to every class, and made everyone just as excited. The course was very well balanced between the two professors, and watching the two of them interact was also just really funny.",
    "The lectures usually covered a good deal of what readings did, and although they were quite interesting, it would have been interesting to have more of a discussion rather than a presentation about the material"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would but I would make them aware that it is not really a seminar and also that the entire grade in the class is composed of one assignment.",
    "Yes, I would recommend that anyone interested in art history, medieval history, or medieval literature take a course with Professors Jung and Bloch. Our classes that dealt with the Bayeaux Tapestry and cathedral choir screens were particularly enjoyable and allowed both professors to show off their knowledge. They're extremely affable and want their students to succeed.",
    "Yes! 'Interpretations' changes every year, but the two-professor, multidisciplinary format of the course is always a win.",
    "Yes, if interested in cathedrals and iconography",
    "Yes! Both professors are amazing and there are so many elements of medieval culture which are embodied in the one cathedral.",
    "Certainly! The course would be a pleasurable additional class for a new Humanities explorer or a seasoned student of the Middle Ages, literature and architecture."
