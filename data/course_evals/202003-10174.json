We participated in field work as a class and independently to collect specimens, and were given the tools and instruction to pin and dry, or preserve in ethyl alcohol the various specimens we collected. We also had access to specimens from the Peabody museum as well as those kept in the Sterling Chemistry Laboratory. This course provided numerous opportunities to gain hands-on experience in the field of entomology.",

                "This class was a lot of work, as making an entire collection required a lot of time outside of class, but it was super fun. There were weekly quizzes, which required a decent amount of studying to prepare for in order to memorize a lot.",
                "This course is a lot of work.",
                "This lab course was one of the best I have ever taken at Yale, and I can only imagine it would be far better in a typical year. The course this year suffered from COVID restrictions preventing us from visiting Florida to capture insects, as would occur in a typical semester. As such, there was a higher reliance on quizzes and lower reliance on the insect collection portion of the curriculum, which is understandable yet disappointing (although not Dr. Wells's fault!). However, every attempt was made by Dr. Wells and Sarah, the TF, to reduce stress, up to and including dropping a quiz, making the quiz in election week virtual to reduce anxiety, changing the requirements for bug collection throughout the semester, and offering frequent outings and office hours to collect and help prepare bugs. I would point out the course's organization as a slight weakness: the first week of insect ID, for example, we had to differentiate between six orders, while the material on the last week covered four orders but dozens of families. As such, I would recommend a more even distribution of work per week to help out. Besides that, I experienced nothing but happiness in this class, and felt it to be one of the highlights at my time at Yale.",
                "The hands-on interaction of this course made it very engaging and gave inherent practical application to all that we learned. Class field trips to various locations to collect arthropods enhanced the experience of this class as well.",
                "The professor and teaching staff were clearly really passionate about the subject and did their best to make it engaging. I also appreciated the flexibility and things such as the bug blogs since we couldn't do as much collecting this semester. However, in general with a couple exceptions, the quizzes were really hard. There were too many families to memorize, and I ended up putting far more work into the lab than the main class itself.",
                "I loved this class and think it was taught very well. The class gave me a sense of community during the pandemic and both the professor and TA were very friendly, personable, approachable, and helpful. The quizzes were fair and the collection project was very fun.",
                "Great course. Creating the insect collections is awesome",
                "Strengths: I liked that we were able to be in person, and I really enjoyed the field trips we took. I thought the weekly quizzes, while relatively work-heavy, were a great way to keep us on top of the content. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had a couple more opportunities to collect insects as a class."

                "As mentioned, the reorganization of this course in response to COVID-19 was unprecedented and mostly beneficial, although I am saddened to have missed the opportunity to visit Florida. Dr. Wells did the best she could despite that, and changed the curriculum to be something that I would still consider fair, enjoyable, and as close to the full experience as possible given the circumstances. Her options to assist virtual learners, as well as students who took a little longer to pin insects, were truly remarkable, and I applaud her flexibility on the quiz material (such as dropping a quiz and providing extra credit on most). Because of this, I would say that this course dealt with the restrictions of COVID-19 very well.",

It would've been nice to have an open book final like the main class, just since there were so many different families to memorize. Overall, I thought the professor was accommodating and did her best to listen to students and move things around due to the pandemic.",
                "I took this class in-person, so it felt mostly like a normal class. A few remote students took the lab virtually, and at the end of the semester we all took the final virtually. The TA uploaded high-quality pictures and videos of arthropod specimens for us to classify on Canvas. The videos were the next-best-thing from seeing the specimens in person.",

                "I would recommend this course wholeheartedly to an EEB student, and even to non-EEB students with an otherwise light workload. Marta is the nicest professor I have ever had at Yale, period. She cares so much about each of her students, especially those in her lab, and is full of so much energy: from her collection of bug ties to her cricket-themed ringtone, it is clear that she radiates passion for insects, and by extension, any student in her course. She truly wants each and every person to succeed, and makes herself available, even by phone, to give advice on how to make the best collections possible. This course is time intensive, and will require you to attend outside of the weekly lab hours in order to complete a collection if you are not well-versed with the practices of a biology lab going in. I estimate I spent around 10-15 non-lab hours pinning insects, and another 10 or so catching them. However, you get to catch bugs! Many comparisons to Animal Crossing notwithstanding, I felt incredibly excited when I stumbled upon a mantis, monarch, and rare caterpillar to add to my collection, and it is easy to get wrapped up in the fieldwork. I can't imagine how more exciting it must be to do the same in Florida, although I imagine that would be much more time-intensive. Thus, if you have the time and want to live out your dreams of becoming a humble bug collector, I recommend this course. Just know that you may need to spend more time on it than you think.",
