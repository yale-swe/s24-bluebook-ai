    "This class introduced me to a whole new field of study.  Everything was new and exciting. We read seminal texts in the philosophy of science",
    "The class exposed us to new areas of philosophy such as epistemology, philosophy of science, and philosophy of language. Grad students and prof. landemore helped keep the discussion at a high level and this was stimulating.",
    "I gained the ability to think more critically about some difficult text and about advanced philosophy.  The class also helped me contextualize my work in political science in the body of literature of philosophy of science, which I think is important for anyone in the major.  Working on a project in Wikipedia helped me sharpen concise summarizing of information.  Also, reading required efficiency, especially the week I was asked to present on readings.",
    "I learned a lot about the variability in truth and the difficulties in finding truth through science."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: excellent readings, discussions\r\nWeaknesses: wish it was taught more as an intro to philosophy of science. There is a lot of jargon that we did not adequately explain at the beginning",
    "Main strength was the exposure to a wide range of texts in philosophy of science. We talked through seminal thinkers such as Popper and Kuhn and Lakatosh, so this was an effective survey of the philosophy of science literature.\r\n\r\nMain weakness is that we didn't cover any of the authors in depth, not did we ever really have productive conversations on the philosophy of science. We hit all the key names and topics, but we never had a constructive discussion or did we make progress on these themes. For example, we could have spent many classes talking about the difference between the natural and social worlds but this was only given a few passing comments throughout the semester. The Wikipedia assignments did not add to the course, and only distracted from the material.",
    "I think the strengths were the people in the class and the texts, as well as Prof. Landemore's leading of the seminar.  I always left class feeling either enlightened or excited to tackle a problem that hadn't fully been answered.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness was that it felt like certain projects, like the Wikipedia project, were not well articulated in their organization at all points, so students were all over the map with when they finished aspects of it.  But, I did appreciate that Prof. Landemore was understanding in this regard and also attribute it to the mix of grad and undergrad students.",
    "The readings for the course were fantastic. Class discussions were also good. I think I would have liked a little bit more feedback throughout the semester though because all of the assignments were due the last week of class or during reading period."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!!!!  This class attracted 50% PhD students and I learned so much from them and from Professor Landemore.  I feel like I can pursue social science research with a much more critical eye now",
    "I would recommend this class only to another philosophy student who has an appetite for things like epistemology and philosophy of science. The material will be too dense and challenging for students not serious about theory.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a view into this particular realm of philosophy and who is interested in how it applies, or doesn't apply, to politics or political science.  But, beyond that, I think the questions and applications are broader and worth considering for majors in any area.  One gets out what they put in to it."
