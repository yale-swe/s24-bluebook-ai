I thought that the split made sense and it made my engagement with the diseases higher.",

            "comments": [
                "I think that this course is really good for non-science majors who are wanting to learn more about biology without taking the intro bio sequence. It was a challenging course conceptually for me since I hadn't taken a bio course since my freshman year of high school, but I think that it was a very good and important course for me to take.",
                "it would be a lot easier if section time was spent reviewing the lecture (bio) material instead of doing unrelated readings and spending section time discussing those",
                "I think this course would be much better if it covered a much smaller range of topics and went much more in depth instead. In every unit, I felt like I had only the vaguest, most surface-level understanding of the content. A lot of the time, I was just memorizing phrases without knowing what they meant. This class says it has no prerequisite but it felt like it was geared towards people who had some kind of background in biology.",
                "Kind of difficult for non-stem students to engage with. Course content gets really technical most of the time, and goes in detail in a way that I think is very intimidating and difficult to track for the average student. Memorization gets tough because of how in depth you need to know material. Course wasn't all bad, but at its core not approachable.",
                "Strengths: discussion sections, TFs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the material was really hard to me to grasp sometimes, and I felt like lectures could be more engaging or clearer. Readings sometimes felt unnecessary and there was barely any discussion of the social or political role of epidemics like HIV.",
                "Strengths: Interesting readings that tackled immunity and contagion from both biological and social lenses. The field trips were really fun and engaging, especially the trip to the Medical School. The first half of the class was really balanced in terms of content and examinations/Psets. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures could be really dense at times. It would help especially in the second half of the course to break up the content more or have less content, especially in the tolerance/immune regulation lecture. I also felt that the level of difficulty on the Quiz and Presentation was much harder than that of the first half of the course (Psets and midterm). Having more details on the grading of the Presentation and what is expected would have made this part of the course even stronger.",
                "Strengths: You will be extremely knowledgeable about the immune system by the end of the semester. The final exam was open note and easy if you prepared well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NOT A GUT. Many humanities majors take this class expecting a gut. Professor Kavathas' slides are not arranged well and can be confusing when coupled with her rapid lecturing style. Section was the only thing pulling me through.",
                "strengths: very holistic, cover a lot of bases\r\nweaknesses: advertised for non-STEM majors but this is inaccurate. goes very very into detail and if you don't have a good biology background, not a great course to take",
                "Strengths: You can tell the professor really wants her students to learn and has implemented many support systems for that to occur.\r\nWeaknesses: Students should be warned that this course is not necessarily for humanities people; the scientific content is pretty intense.",
                "I think that the only comment I have for this class is that it's not a STEM class for humanities major. It's a very intense science course that goes into a lot of the detail and knowledge that you might want to know before the class. The content would be good if it was not advertise as a class for non-stem major.",
                "Great structure of lectures -- very organized\r\nWish the lectures were just a tiny bit more simplified for non-science majors",
                "Strengths: great material, the professor was really kind, and super passionate \r\nWeaknesses: learning the material felt like drinking from a fire hose but overall felt manageable",
                "This course was great overall! I am not an MCDB major and I still felt like I was able to understand a lot. \r\nI felt the booklet was often confusing and I gained much more from watching the lectures and rewatching them on canvas than I did from reading the booklet. \r\nI felt the quiz was unnecessarily specific, and I while I went to all of the lectures and studied before the quiz I still felt like I couldn't answer many of the questions. Next year a study guide (similar to the midterm study guide) would be helpful for future students.",
                "This course was highly disorganized and hard to follow, and the exams tested uber-specific information that did not feel relevant to the information that we learned in lecture. I thought this course would include more social science aspects of how diseases impact society, but lectures were very science-heavy while discussion sections were sociology-heavy--the two were never synthesized in exams except obscure questions on the midterm and final that didn't seem relevant at all. The quiz was extremely difficult and it felt like nothing I studied for appeared on the exam. Grading was very harsh and strict, if you don't follow her guidelines on the presentation exactly she will take points off (font size, # of slides, info included). Although Paula was very nice, this course felt not tailored to non-STEM students--the info we were learning felt extremely advanced and too in-depth at times. The lecture slides were extremely hard to follow and not well-built. The only good thing was that the final exam was open note--the final exam questions were so specific that if you didn't write the entire booklet down you would miss something. I felt very stressed about this class despite it being called a science gut--THIS IS NOT A GUT! Take at your own discretion",
                "Strengths: A lot of support from the TAs and professor and comprehensive and rich curriculum that allows you to view the immune system through a biological, social, and historical frameworks.\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the readings were a lot and we didn't really know what to expect from the final exam",
                "The course is excellent. The readings the professor assigns are mostly from a booklet she made, and they present the material in an informative and engaging way. There are two main goals to the class, to learn about the more sciencey side (the function of different parts of the immune system) and the public health side (think more humanities type readings about how pandemics developed and how they affected culture). Both are interesting, but some might find one side more engaging than another.",
                "The material is very interesting in class and in readings. The discussion sections were very useful for going over material, since the lectures especially in the first half sometimes felt a bit rushed. There was a lot of material but it all fit together in a bigger picture which made it easier to learn.",
                "This course is taught very effectively and clearly and well organized.",
                "The course could be improved by having better organized slides and information and by choosing readings which directly supplement lecture content.",
                "This course is not geared for non-stem majors as advertised. The lectures are far too quick and the feedback for assignments is sparse and not as helpful as it could be. Along with this, I feel that the grading was too harsh at times, especially when assignments were graded by the professor instead of the TFs.",
                "This course was extremely accessible to students who had difficulties with science in the past and accommodations were made by a wonderful professor and great TFs.",
                "Strengths: I appreciated that the psets challenged me to think about and review the recent materials from lectures and found them helpful while I was reviewing for the midterm and the final. I also really appreciated the booklet, which took some pressure off noting down everything in lecture and provided helpful summaries of our discussions. The booklet was very helpful when I was completing psets and reviewing for the midterm and the final. I felt that the class was challenging but usually a manageable workload for a non-stem major taking it as my fifth class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think a fourth pset would have been more helpful for reviewing than a quiz in the last week of the semester. Part of the reason I decided to take this class was because there was only a midterm, a final, and an essay. The essay was changed to a quiz halfway through the semester, and throughout the semester other assignments on the syllabus were shifted around. I would have appreciated more consistency in the syllabus so I knew what to expect while taking the class at the beginning of the semester. Though the booklet was very helpful, sometimes the wording and organization was confusing. I would have appreciated it if some of the complicated biological processes were spelled out from beginning to end in a step-by-step format. Sometimes acronyms were used without including what they stood for or what they meant, which was confusing. I could usually resolve my questions by googling but for a class that asks a lot of students who were mostly not science majors, this felt like extra effort that would have been better placed trying to understand the concepts rather than trying to puzzle through confusing wording.",
                "Strengths: does not dumb down material, even though many non-STEM majors take the class; sections help us digest material; grading and assignment expectations are fair yet understanding, considering many students have never taken and will never again take an MCDB course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the slides sometimes seemed like they could've been reordered to go in order/explain a new concept step by step and thus facilitate better learning.",
                "Stengths: the discussion sections helped me learn the topics more and I enjoyed the readings\r\nWeakness: The lectures were very boring and there are not many opportunities to review what you are learning in class and actually applying them"

                "I would recommend this course. Professor Kavathas is amazing and the course is a great learning environment. In my opinion, this is the perfect class for humanities students in the sciences. My TA, Gabriel, was also one of the best I've had in any course.",

                "Maybe, if you have a strong biology background or are a STEM major. I struggled a lot with grasping the material as a non-stem major and was never really confident in what I understood/didn't know. It was definitely not a gut for me.",
                "Yes, but not if this student is interested in an easy science credit. This course is challenging in the breadth of content covered. There is a lot packed into lectures.",
                "THIS IS NOT A GUT. Trust me on this. Will you learn a ton about the immune system? Yes. Is that information fascinating? Absolutely. But is this an easy course? Not at all. You will have to invest time and energy into learning about biological mechanisms which can be very confusing if you are not coming from an AP Bio or college-level background. I am grateful that I took this course because I learned a lot. But it was harder than I has expecting.",
                "yes if they are a STEM major and can keep up with a very fast-paced class",

                "Yes, quite interesting!",
                "Yes, its definitely not a gut, but overall the experience was great and totally worth it!",
                "Yes! Keep in mind while it is very accessible for non-stem majors it is not a gut. It is very doable, but you will have to study for the midterm and put work into other assignments for the course. But it is a great way to get a science credit and learn deep and relevant information about the body and medicine. Professor Kavathas is also great.",
                "I was just taking this class to get my last science credit, and it served that purpose. It was more challenging that I expected it to be as a class geared toward non-science majors. Expect to have to understand the concepts more than memorize them, which is good for actually learning but made the class more challenging. Overall though, it was an engaging course and the workload is pretty light. So if the topics interest you, I would recommend it as a science credit that isn't bland.",
                "Yes if you are interested in the nuances of the immune system",
                "Yes, it is a great class for non-science students. It provides you with comprehensive knowledge of the immune system and equips you with a necessary biology foundation.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to a student looking for a science credit, but I would warn them that this class is not a gut. Especially in the first few weeks, the class moves quickly through a ton of scientific terminology, but it's nothing that someone without high school bio can't handle. It's well worth it, though  after a few weeks you feel like you have a fleshed-out understanding of the immune system that can be very satisfying. None of the memorization felt gratuitous.",
                "Yes if you are interested in the subject. It is a pretty information dense class which can be a bit overwhelming but also really interesting. Theres a lot to study for the midterm and final, but there isnt a lot of work throughout the semester. I really enjoyed the class overall and am definitely glad I took it.",
                "Yes, it is a great course for non-science majors to learn about the immune system and how our body fights diseases. This course greatly improves science literacy.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in medicine or the immune system, but would stress that this is not a gut.",
                "I would recommend this course to a stem major or anyone interested in immunology. However, for a non-stem major looking to explore or fulfill a science credit, I would definitely not recommend this course.",
                "Yes, because this course is a guarantee you will learn something every day and be challenges but is a manageable workload.",
                "I would recommend this course. I'm an American Studies major and took this course for my science credit. I've been frustrated with SC/QR credits before because it can feel like a waste of time, especially if you aren't learning much or it doesn't feel very relevant. This class struck a good balance of being somewhat challenging generally without demanding excessive effort. The psets were reasonable, and the open-book final was very helpful. The closed notes midterm was challenging, but in the end it forced me to understand concepts from early in the semester which ended up being important throughout the rest of the semester. At the end, I felt like I learned a lot. That said, the class was a little disorganized and the workload was pretty demanding (3 psets, a quiz, a presentation, a midterm, and a final). I took this as my fifth class, with an already heavy-workload semester, and I don't know that I would recommend that.",
                "Yes! The workload was very manageable, yet the material learned was rich.",
