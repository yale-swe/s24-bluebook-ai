                "Though much can be said about the Directed Studies program, I am most certain that you've already been told of both its difficulties and advantages. As someone who comes from a STEM-oriented public housing on the East Coast, I feel like DS: HnP section allowed to me to get an incredible grasp on the aspect of ancient writing that is often forgotten about by the education system. The best way I can show this is through example: Though my public education helped be learned of both Plato and Homer as important writers from Ancient Greece, it is only through HnP that I was able to learn of Thucydides of Athens--a figure just as integral in the development of historical writing as Plato and Homer were to philosophy and literature respectively.",
                "Above all else, my communication has become far more clear and economical under Professor Schettini, and this has helped me better articulate complex material both in section and my paper-writing. Professor Schettini always provided me thorough feedback on my papers, and also provided ample office hours time to discuss the course materialwhich gave me countless outlets to improve throughout the semester.",
                "Dealing with people and points of view which I believe to be wrong, but cannot easily demonstrate to be so. One betray's his position and his legitimacy when one allows his passions to dissolve his coherency. Also, dealing with skepticism in a gracious and diplomatic manner. There are such things as stupid questions, I believe, but a question's stupidity does not disqualify it from deserving an answer. (Or perhaps the hubris of this paragraph means I did not learn anything from this class at all.) \r\n\r\nI also gained the standard DS view of the history of the West. Elementary stuff, rather."

                "The strength of HnP is its ability to introduce you to writers whom you might have never even heard of, much less read about. By the end of the course, you *will* have an amazing grasp at the various ideas that make up modern politics, and the ancient writings that have trailblazed the field of historical thought.\r\n\r\nReally, there are only two points of contention that this course has: \r\n1) the sheer volume of literature you will have to read. As of writing this course review (December of 2023), the entire DS department is trying to condense \r\nthe amount of reading you will have to do. Unfortunately, the program is already as brief as it can be---and its simply the fact of life that the works you have to read are the bare essentials you need to understand ancient historical and political thought\r\n\r\n2) responsiveness of instructors. This is not a jab at the quality of DS instructors, because ALL instructors doing Directed Studies are experts in their fields and will help you understand the material. Rather, it is just the sheer size of the program that causes responsiveness of certain instructors to be slightly hampered. Do not take their unresponsiveness as an insult---instead, just empathize with the amount of work they have to do to keep the discussion afloat.",
                "The variety of authors this course offers, and its philosophical consideration of history itself (what is history? who is a historian?) offered a more multifaceted approach to the past than I had ever engaged in before, and was greatly enjoyable. In terms of improvement, I would have appreciated slightly more targeted, less lengthy readings on some weeks (specifically, the latter portions of Herodotus and Tacitus); I continually wished that I had more time to spend with the text, and I believe our in-class discussions would have been richer had all of us focused on the same, but fewer, events.",
                "I think DS H&P is great, and I thoroughly enjoyed the course load. My honest opinion: I do not have any suggestions for how to improve it, other than maybe spending less time on Herodotus\/Thucydides and spending more time on the Roman historians. The Roman historians, and their differences, was something I disproportionately reviewed in preparation for the examand I think I could have benefited from at least one or two more sections on Tacitus\/Livy\/Polybius\/etc.",
                "I really found no weaknesses in this course. Schettini is great in all regards (especially office hours - we had many interesting discussions outside of the specific questions I asked about papers). He gives really good paper feedback advice, and you can tell puts care into his class structure\/curriculum.",
                "Certain students tended to derail the conversation with equivocation, ponderings, and injections of personal opinion that beared neither productively nor appropriately on the discussion. But, in the interest of diplomacy and edification, perhaps learning to deal with this type of person is in my interest."

                "In the words of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, the writing of history is necessary for preservation of \"the colors of man\". If you are even slightly curious as to what drives people to preserve lessons of time, then I would highly recommend doing DS.\r\n\r\nAnd if you want the greatest experience, I would HIGHLY recommend taking it with Professor Glauco Schettini. He is responsive, highly erudity, and (most importantly) CARING. There have been numerous times where I was blown away by the sheer amount of essay feedback I have received on assignments I submitted to him, and the quickness with which he delivers such feedback is mind-numbing. H&P was by far the course I enjoyed the most in the Fall track --- and that is in large part due to the epitome of anti-hubris that is Professor Schettini.",
                "Yes. The breadth of historical context this course provided offered a sense of intellectual grounding that I will gratefully carry as I move forward in studying humanities.",
                "Absolutelyand I would recommend DS to any student interested in the humanities. While the workload can at times be challenging, it is ridiculously rewarding. I had the experience of being in the presence of great professors and students in my sections, and it improved my way of thinking to a considerable degree.",
                "Yes!! Schettini was such a warm and wonderful professor, who facilitated really incredible class conversations. I had such a good time in various debates with my classmates, and Schettini guided us towards ideas we found engaging. You can tell that Schettini cares about you and wants you to succeed. Very much recommend, but there is a lot of reading (though this is the class I skimmed the most and still could have solid conversations about).",
                "DS gives you thousands of years of Western tradition in a little over a dozen weeks. It is therefore not for the faint of heart, and even the sturdy-hearted will have trouble keeping up at times. \r\n\r\nH&P is probably the most relevant of the DS tracks. This is good, because students are interested. This is bad, because students often are interested most in the application of classical ideas to contemporary issues, which veers the discussion away from trying to find out what the author is saying and towards evaluating what exactly he is saying. Not that evaluation isn't important, only that it involves establishing another set of (contemporary) values, when the point of a class like H&P is to trace the development of sets of values through history. I found the process of ascertaining an author's intention far more gratifying than when we veered into the contemporary, if only because then we started to resemble a classroom and less a political round table. (Again, there's a time and a place for everything... just maybe not here.)"
