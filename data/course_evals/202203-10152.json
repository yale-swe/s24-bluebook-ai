                "This was an exceptionally strong course. The basic structure was pretty standard (translate this passage, then answer some questions about grammar/style), but Thomas executed it perfectly. I felt pushed in class, but never put on the spot. Also, the exposure to secondary sources greatly deepened my appreciation for all of the material that we covered in class.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I could think of is the inclusion of the Republic  not because it was exceptionally difficult (although some passages were absolutely brutal), but because there was virtually nothing in the way of commentary. The Lysias had such an extensive commentary that the switch between the two works felt like going from a tricycle to a Harley-Davidson.",
                "Strengths: the texts Thomas chose (Lysias 1 and Plato's allegory of the cave) were very fun reads. The commentary project (in which you translate a selection of text and write a three-page commentary) was also a really creative assignment and good preparation for those of us who plan to go into classics for graduate school. Thomas also held an optional section for prose composition which was very nice.\r\nWeaknesses: the only weakness with this class is the jump in difficulty between the Lysias and the Plato. The Lysias text comes with a very generous commentary (M. Campbell) and is generally quite easy Greek; however, we had no commentary (Thomas did look, but could not find one) and Plato is much harder to read and understand, for both grammar and content reasons, than Lysias. So, there was a really big jump in difficulty. I understand that the instructors get to choose which texts are read for GREK 131; my hope is that both texts chosen have an accompanying commentary. I suppose another weakness is that we moved through the text pretty slowly at times, which was frustrating for the Lysias but justified for the Plato.",
                "I think the course could benefit from a second text that, while more challenging than the Lysias, is more similar. The shift to Plato's Republic felt very dramatic, and I think a text with more thorough commentary would be more helpful for students.",
                "Strengths: Munro was engaging, clearly knew the material, and was very helpful. He was very generous with his time. In addition to preparing portions of Greek, we often had to read a brief article or a text in translation. These readings enriched the experience. Also, I think Munro assessed difficulty levels well: for me, Plato was a bit of a jump from Lysias, but as we worked through it, I realized that it wasn't an impossible task. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish the additional assignments were emphasized a bit more, since I think they helped us contextualize what we were reading from Lysias and Plato."
