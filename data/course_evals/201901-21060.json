I also think that having two graders instead of one might eliminate any bias that might occur (related to feelings about the topic, the writing style, or even the student). \r\n\r\nFor the first semester of the project, I think it might be beneficial to make the final assignment a 10 page draft, rather than a draft OR an outline. I think having a 10-page draft plus an outline of the remainder of my thesis was a lot more helpful than having just an outline.",
