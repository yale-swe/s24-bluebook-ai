    "None. Sure, there were a few new theorems but no insights or skills. Anything I actually learned was from wikipedia, since Jones can't teach.",
    "I memorized three proofs of major theorems in real analysis, and gained a sense of how to use estimates to solve some cool problems.",
    "Challenging proof based course on calculus",
    "I learned the fundamentals of real analysis, and various tricks and skills to help with writing proofs and solving problems.",
    "This class is a good introduction to a lot of different analysis topics, forcing you to learn a bunch of different topics at a fairly deep level.",
    "I learned some concepts in analysis (Cauchy sequence, continuity, compactness, etc.). Also learned about Brownian motion.\r\n\r\nA lot of it was review from math 230."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Jones was by far the worst professor I've ever had, and I don't see how he could change. The course doesn't teach you anything; you would learn more from a few hours reading about analysis theorems online. To allow students to learn more, *assign homework*. The presentations only really teach the presenter how to do that specific problem; the rest of the class is left clueless. Lectures taught me nothing; review sessions taught me how to ace the tests. This is not what a Yale class is supposed to be like. One question that showed up on both a midterm and the final was to recreate a proof that Jones did *incorrectly* in lecture.",
    "The lectures could be clearer and better organized. Overall, I found them pretty hard to follow and felt like i didn't fully grasp the material. I also found that not needing to hand in the homework every week made me lose some of my motivation to really do it.",
    "The course was very poorly organized. Homework was never collected, which was nice but not beneficial to continuous learning. Professor Jones wrote things on the board without finishing his thoughts or ever stating that he was about to disprove the thing he just wrote, which made it very difficult to follow and easy to write down false statements and wind up very confused. The only time I ever learned anything was at the review sessions. Professor Jones had more review sessions than any other teacher, and went through problems very similar to the problems on the exam very thoroughly. This was nice.",
    "Exciting lectures  but often tests were loosely related and wry challenging",
    "I don't think the course could be improved.",
    "The strengths are that the class does go over a huge amount of material and forces you to learn a good portion about good proof writing and basic analysis. The hard part is that this class's tests don't heavily rely on the material taught in class and you need to spend a lot of time to learn the material for the test.",
    "The tests are not really about the lecture material (the problems are the same year to year and tend to require bizarre tricks that you will learn by going to office hours). In my opinion, this should change.\r\n\r\nI enjoying giving presentations, especially on Brownian motion."

   "comments": [
    "Worst class I've taken, no contest. Also it's a gut. The only critical thinking needed is to determine which half of the things Peter Jones says are false. He's someone who is great at telling stories like a grandfather, that are probably not true and definitely not useful, but are entertaining when you ignore the fact that this is a college class.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. If you took MATH 230 & 231, this course doesn't teach you anything new, and it doesn't go deep enough that you can't just skip into a better analysis class.",
    "This class if okay. Professor Jones is really nice and really interesting (he knows a ton of random things) but his lectures are not very organized or clear. He is better at explaining things in office hours. However, he will often make small mistakes in his proofs that can make it hard to follow. He also tends to go off on tangents and goes very slowly which can make it even harder to follow. However, he gives you 3 years of past exams before the tests so you can do well by just going to lots of office hours before the exam and mastering the questions on the old exams. Overall, I don't think the class is very hard or too much work, even though the material itself can be pretty challenging, but I also didn't feel like I learned as much as I have in other math classes. The most worthwhile part of this class was getting to know Professor Jones, who is super kind and dedicated to his students.",
    "No. The class was too poorly organized to teach you much beyond three heavily emphasized proofs and a few specific problems that if ever useful, will have enough differences that you still won't know how to solve them, and if you do, it won't be because of this class.",
    "Interesting material, just make sure you go to the review sessions - theyre critical for the tests.",
    "Yes, it is a good foundational mathematics course.",
    "If you're interested in majoring in Math, you probably need to take this course.",
    "Definitely not if you have taken math 230. Otherwise maybe, but I think you might want to jump straight into one of the higher analysis classes if you are serious about learning it."
