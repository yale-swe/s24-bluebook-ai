                "I actually read all my readings. DeRose plans the syllabus to be reasonable, so I feel like I could actually grasp the views of the thinkers on the syllabus. This is a blessing at a university that likes to pile on work in the name of rigor in a way that makes it impossible to critically engage (or retain) anything. This is really important and other courses should follow suit. The biggest weakness of this course was that despite a class of 12 or less there was very little discussion or interaction. The few times we were asked questions was really engaging and fun and I wish there was more of that."
