I witnessed how my writing had many mistakes and logical problems and learned how to solve that.",

In class, we learned the many ways to develop an argument about a topic of non-fiction and it was absolutely fascinating to me how people write so differently about not so different topics. I learned how to take inspiration from authors, how to listen to my gut and take chances with my writing, and how to listen to feedback and edit in an effective way.",

                "The main strength of this course is the structure of it. Reading many examples of good writing for homework, discussing those examples during class, and then writing really helped me learn. I also loved how we submitted the first draft, received tons of feedback and workshopped the essay, and then composed the final draft. The plethora of feedback was crucial to my learning. The essays' due dates were also well spaced out, making the workload less daunting. It was a very well-paced class with an effective structure to teach.",
                "The class had a fantastic spread of readings and I really liked when we got to read the works of our peers. Another strength was that we had a lot of support- the professor felt very accessible, there was a student writing tutor assigned to the class, and we would get a 24 extension for our papers if we worked with a writing tutor. However, sometimes the analysis of different readings got a little dry.",
                "The detailed feedback on my essays was always very extensive and very clear. I cannot think of any way this course could be improved",
                "I thought the essay topics were all very interesting and the discussions in class were very helpful and I learned a lot through them.",
                "Honestly, I got way more out of an online English class than I thought I ever could. I appreciated that we were encouraged to keep our cameras and microphones on because I think it allowed us to become more comfortable around each other. Another strength could be the vast variety of pieces that we read - it allowed us to develop our own styles from the many different authors whose works we read and also learn how to effectively get our points across. Occasionally, we would spend a long time on a small part of an article and this could get tedious and boring. However, I think this is one of the challenges to online learning where the professor has trouble \"reading the room\" and cannot tell when he has lost a bit of our attention.",
                "Strengths of this course would include regular workshopping opportunities so you can receive feedback from the professor and other classmates on your writing. You really get helpful feedback since it is a capped seminar and we would usually workshop a few students each class."

                "I felt like the small class size and seminar format really made me engaged. The general gesture of raising your hand to speak on zoom worked well since it prevented people from talking over one another accidentally. I also liked how the professor would call on students to keep people engaged.",
                "Although we were on Zoom, most of our discussions went pretty smoothly. For the most part, my professor did a really fantastic job inviting in people to speak and directing the conversation in a very natural way. The only thing that could be improved is that sometimes the questions felt a bit too pointed and then there would be a bit of an awkward silence while everyone sat there muted.",

We were able to have productive discussions and become friendly with one another quickly. Since it was such a small class, I wished we could have met in person, but I understand that covid guidelines strongly discouraged this. It just would have been nice to meet the people in my class face to face."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially with Professor Sexton. The class very well structured and used a very effective way of teaching. The class would read examples of great writing for homework, discuss those examples during class and learn about the techniques used, and then the students would write their own draft. There was always tons of feedback on each essay draft from the professor. Essays would also get workshopped by the class which was so useful to hear everyone compliments and suggestions for improvements. The due dates were well spaced and I felt like the workload was manageable. I felt like this is a class everyone should take to improve their writing and also change the way they read other writing.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was refreshing, challenging, and engaging. I loved so many of the pieces that we read, and I felt like I was exposed to so many different kinds of writing besides academic essay writing. The writing assignments we did made me reflect on my own life and experiences in a really profound way, and I'm genuinely proud of the writing I did in this class. The essay grading format where you do a first draft that's ungraded, get feedback, and then rework it for the final graded draft felt very conducive to improvement. I would note that since this class is about writing and reading modern essays, I would recommend it to students who want to explore a new avenue of writing rather than focusing on academic writing. I think students who are more comfortable sharing their writing with their peers would get more out of the class as well.",

                "Yes. I absolutely loved this class, and I cannot imagine how wonderful it would be without the pandemic. I grew as a writer, reader, and person. I am better at taking criticism and learning from my mistakes.",
                "Absolutely! The writing prompts are really interesting and you really get to know your classmates through their writing. Professor Sexton is such a wonderful person who provides very clear feedback on your writing and never fails to make each class enjoyable."
