                "Professor Jensen's great, super knowledgeable and helpful.",
                "Strengths: Kind and knowledgeable professor\r\n\r\nWeakness: The psets use R, which is fine, except for the fact that we don't learn any R in class. Also the TAs don't seem to hold frequent OHs. Also it's the end of the semester and none of the psets have been graded yet.",
                "Feedback was far and few between throughout the semester, making it hard to evaluate your progress. The amount of cooperative group work might also be tedious for students who prefer to work alone.",
                "The lectures were pretty engaging and helpful. There was very little guidance or feedback surrounding problem sets which made them very stressful.",
                "Strengths: The course material was fairly interesting, and Professor Jensen was a great teacher. Weaknesses: The problem sets were very Stata-heavy, and it would have been helpful to have more support from the TAs in terms of working with Stata. We also received very little feedback over the course of the semester -- none of our problem set grades were ever returned to us. In addition, I would have preferred there to be less of an emphasis on group work, since it was hard to coordinate over Zoom and group projects don't always result in a fair distribution of work among students.",
                "Professor Jensen is amazing. The course workload is very manageable and encourages collaboration. Faster feedback on grades would be great.  The problem sets are great applications of the material to real world data.",
                "The topics we covered were quite interesting, and Prof. Jensen is highly engaging and clear in his explanations of the material. Some weaknesses: the first couple of psets were difficult since they required quite a bit of R/Stata knowledge which a lot of us didn't have (BUT Prof. Jensen listened to our feedback and changed the following psets), and the scheduling of TF office hours at the beginning was not consistent which made it feel like there wasn't a lot of support (there was also no discussion section so it was hard to meet other people in the class). Also, the grading is super slow--we still don't have any grades for the psets.",
                "It was an amazing class! Very relevant! Only issue was it took a long time to get grades for problem sets (I still dont have a grade for any problem set)",
                "Jensen and his style of teaching and the organization of the class and the assignments are the strengths. Perhaps one thing that could have improved is the student engagement but that certainly wasn't Jensen's fault but instead, covid, Zoom, and students not turning their camera on were the main reasons for this. Hopefully, this would be solved in-person. I assume Jensen's class is very fun and even more interesting when he's lecturing in-person.",
                "The content was very enjoyable, however I was underwhelmed by the brevity of the psets. I would have loved to do deeper dives into development during psets",
                "Strengths: interesting concepts, no required readings \r\nWeaknesses: extremely difficult problem sets with very little guidance, did not receive grades on the problem sets until two days after finals period ended, no feedback on any assignments so improvement was impossible",
                "Strenghts: Professor Jensen is incredibly knowledgeable about development and it's super informative and fun to hear about his own research experience, as well as his interpretation of the latest literature on development. The psets were often difficult, but I ultimately found them rewarding because I was able to apply my data analysis skills to real development data. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish there were more consistency in terms of pset difficulty/length. A major weakness was how long it took for us to receive any kind of feedback. By the last day of class, we've only received 25% of our grades in this course (and that was from the midterm). None of the pset grades and comments were released until finals were over. Files are rarely posted on the date previously announced. It looks like the TFs didn't even grade the psets until finals are over. And given that this class doesn't have discussion sections, it makes me wonder whether having 3 TFs is even necessary. Additionally, the pset instructions are sometimes vague (partly because we were dealing with messy real-world data), and it took a lot of going back and forth between Professor Jensen and the TFs to figure out what exactly is expected of us.",
                "Strengths: the class materials are very interesting and have helped me look at the bigger picture of international development and understand the link between different factors (income, health behaviors, etc) related to poverty.",
                "Strength: interesting topics and the professor is amazing\r\nWeakness: learning r is hard",
                "Perfect topic, perfect professor to teach it",
                "Strengths: Professor Jensen was great! He made lectures fun and gave little anecdotes from his work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The handwriting of the professor was difficult at times to read. The class wasn't very organized/assignments were unclear at times.",
                "Great Professor and fascinating material",
                "Strengths: Prof Jensen is a very entertaining lecturer and pretty understanding as a professor, no textbook/coursebook/readings (ie most financially accessible core class for GLBL major), pretty interesting course material, really fair exam, presentation was fun\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets weren't really related to course material and we never practiced R or Stata in class, rarely talked about anything outside of solving poverty through credit, insurance, etc. even though development economics is a really broad subject, doing a group presentation AND group final paper was unnecessary, also we never got grades back except for our midterm until literally right before grades were released so the midterm was my only gauge for how well I was doing in the class all semester",
                "Lectures are mesmerizing and while the problem sets are challenging, they are very fun!",
                "Strength: Prof. Jensen is an excellent teacher and makes hard concepts like Theil's entropy, Gini coefficients, informal insurance, measuring inequality and poverty (gap), etc. very easy to understand. His lectures were very engaging, and he always had some hilarious story that was usually related to the course. It was wonderful to learn these topics, and I would recommend even non-majors to take this course. Also, Professor Jensen is just so qualified to teach this course, because he actually did/does a lot of research that pertain to the topics you learn in class (very much in the realm of development economics). One of the TA's was just so helpful and kind and was great as well.\r\n\r\nWeakness: PSet grades didn't come out until after final exam, although that wasn't so bad because he made sure you had learned all the topics in the PSets and gave us an easier time for the latter PSets because the first one was sort of difficult with learning to use Stata. Some TA's didn't seem to have an idea of what was going on with the PSet questions.",
                "Professor Jensen is incredibly knowledgeable in his field and has such command over development and the concepts relevant to the field that his lectures are always interesting, engaging, and easy to follow. You will learn so much because he is such a fantastic professor who is looking to help in any way possible.",
                "Strengths: Jensen is one of the best lecturers I have had in my time at Yale, and also seems to care deeply about the well-being and understanding of his students. Class format was also very engaging and watching Jensen write out the notes in real time kept my attention (difficult online + after spending way too much time on Tik Tok).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grades were not provided for any PSETs until the end of the term, which made it difficult to gauge your own performance, and the PSETs also covered completely different skills/material than what we were looking at in lecture. Additionally, we were not evaluated on anything covered in the second half of the course, which also felt fairly unorganized and without a central thread. TAs were basically non-existent.",
                "The strength is definitely Prof. Jensen's teaching style that made hard concepts easier. But the course would do well with some more organization.",
                "Strengths: professor is amazingly supportive, knowledgable, caring, and lectures were always interesting. Material was great to gain a foundation to the field of development.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: material could be covered more in-depth/more challenging.",
                "Strengths: Professor Jensen is clearly brilliant. He had some of the clearest, most well-organized lectures that I've ever listened to. He made a point of slowing the pace enough that we could actually spend enough time digesting the material. The psets were rough, but I'm counting them as a strength because ultimately I think that experiencing the throw-them-in-the-deep-end approach will be helpful for me one day. The coding skills that I built on in Professor Jensen's class were valuable and will be useful beyond just this course. Another strength were Professor Jensen's stories! I'm coming away from this course honestly a bit inspired. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The biggest weakness was really the lack of feedback throughout the semester. That and the lack of support for R tutoring. Office hours with TAs were not at all useful and there weren't any other places designed for undergrads to get better with R. Trust me, I looked. This might be an area that Yale generally can look into more -- additional resources for general coding questions. I was really looking for some hand-holding with the basics and couldn't find anything to fit that need."

There isn't a ton of work, though you have to get through a couple of group projects. Overall, it's a good class, especially if you have to take it anyways for the Global major.",
                "Yes (required for global majors) but even if you aren't, Jensen is amazing and you learn a lot about development economics that is often scarcely covered in other courses.",
                "Yes. It is a requirement for GLBL, but Prof. Jensen makes the material very interesting and is honestly a terrific and kind instructor. However, it can be quite disorganized at times.",
                "Yes! Professor Jensen is really cool. Good if youre interested in seeing the data around development in action",
                "Absolutely! I assume you will be taking it because you are a Global Affairs major but even if you're not and you just wanted to take one of the Global Affairs major's core requirements, you should probably take this one. Jensen is great and the material is very relevant to some of the prominent and pressing  (but also feel-good) issues in the world.",
                "Yes, if you're a global major or interested in developing countries and data this is a great course.",
                "Only take this if it is required by the global major. I loved the professor and he was really sweet and funny, but the entire course was a disaster. The problem sets were completed in R, and the training for R was very minimal while the problem set was extremely complex. I spent hours on end trying to figure out the problem set myself, and office hours with the TA was not very helpful. We were given little guidance on the problem sets and it was so frustrating to try and figure it out when I had four other classes that I could not postpone. Also, we did not receive grades the entire semester. At the end of finals period, the only grade I had on Canvas was my midterm. The grades for problem sets, our group presentations, and our final paper came back two days after finals period ended. It was hard to gauge how I was doing on problem sets and how I should improve.",
                "Yes, especially with Professor Jensen who's just such an approachable and cool person. The course opened my eyes to topics relevant to economic development that are also incredibly applicable to other courses. But I wish this class had better organization and provided more timely feedback in terms of assignments and exams.",
                "This course is the WORST course of the Global Affairs Major. Take it only if you have to. Jensen is a great person, but the course is horribly organized. You get no feedback on any assessments; you learn a bunch of pseudo science; and you complete some horribly designed assignments.",
