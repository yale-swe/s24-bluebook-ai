                "I learned an incredible amount from this course. The topic of the course is too often overlooked in courses at Yale. I learned how to engage with literature in a way that questions the intellectual assumptions that the work makes. I became acquainted with some canonical literature on the topic, such as Orientalism. I further developed my critical thinking skills through the vibrant class discussions about the novels we read in class, such as The Other Americans.",
                "I read a lot of interesting Arabic literature and really enjoyed the informal debates with my classmates.",
                "I developed perceptions of orientalism and discussing the \"other\" in literary analysis. This has helped me view and critically dissect portrayals of ethnic groups or general marginalized groups and minorities in works of literature and art. Prior to this class, I hardly questioned intention and effect in the portrayal of marginalized groups by western thinks and the repercussions it carries.",
                "My Arabic reading comprehension improved greatly. I became more confident speaking in modern standard arabic, especially around more advanced and nuanced topics. I learned a lot about Orientalism and its effects on historical and present-day literature.",
                "this class introduced us to classical Arabic novels but also contemporary writings in English which have been translated to Arabic. We read Edward Said's Orientalism, we watched a film about Paul Bowles, and we wrote weekly discussion posts relating what we read to other topics in the form of a short paragraph. This class has been a great opportunity to learn about Arabic literature and become a better reader, speaker and writer.",
                "Arabic reading, writing, and presentation skills. I developed great insights into the identity of the Arab other in the West and how this identity is often faced with great prejudice and stereotypes that affect many lives negatively.",
                "This course opened my eyes and changed my perspective regarding the treatment of Arabs in western literature and media. It goes into depth about orientalism and the skewed image propagated throughout the world of races and ethnicities, which have become widely accepted in society. This course developed a lot of my questioning and close reading analysis skills as we read and interacted with many books that handle this topic.",
                "This was the best Arabic course that I've taken at Yale so far! Professor Elbousty is extremely passionate about literature, and it shows in the way he teaches the class. I loved our in class discussions and that the professor encouraged everyone to participate. I have developed much knowledge into the nature of the relationship between the Global North and the Global South. I have read amazing literature, which I am genuinely happy about. This course has amazing capabilities for engaging students. I loved coming to class every day and discussing the readings. It keeps you very immersed in Arabic and feels like you're actually a researcher examining this mysterious nature. Thanks to Dr. Elbousty, I have developed critical literary skills that granted me the tools of fine examination of different pieces, which could then be applied to studying the Arabic literature from the scope of orientalism."

            "comments": [
                "Professor Elbousty is definitely the course's greatest strength. He makes sure to bring everyone into the conversation and is so passionate about the material. Above all, he supports and cares about his students like few other professors I've had at Yale. The class became a community really quickly and the environment was very welcoming and warm. \r\n\r\nI think any improvements to the course would involve changing the texts on the syllabus. Most of the works we read weren't originally written in Arabic, which didn't feel fitting for an Arabic course -- I think it would be good to either go back to teaching this course in English as in the past, or teach the class in Arabic with a heavier focus on Arabic literature (rather than English novels or complex theory translated into Arabic). My favorite book of the semester by far was Season of Migration to the North -- the literary quality of the book was very high as compared to the others, and it was a great experience reading an Arabic classic in its original language and improving my Arabic through that. I would love if the whole semester was books like Season of Migration to the North. The other thing I would have benefitted from is more feedback on my work and language skills throughout the semester -- perhaps having a paper during the semester that we get detailed comments on, rather than just the final paper.",
                "Really no weaknesses. The small class size and the instructor, as well as the fascinating topic, are really the greatest strengths.",
                "Strength: Interesting class discussions and literature\r\nweakness: Reading Orientalism in Arabic was incredibly challenging",
                "Its strength is that it covers a very live and topical issue in the Arab world today: otherness and orientalism. It does this through a wide range of literature. I will say, the only weakness is that the list of books needs to be revamped because many of the works are Arabic translations of English works. The class would shine much brighter when working with originally Arabic books. Nevertheless, this is a product of the rush to switch the class into a language credit, so it is in no way the fault of the instructor. Overall, a good class.",
                "The main strength of this course was the in-class discussions. Professor Elbousty always facilitated the conversation well and had interesting comments to add. I liked the structure of one person leading the discussion each class, and enjoyed the times when I led. The in-class conversations were incredibly meaningful and engaged, and added a lot to my understanding of the readings. The midterm and final assignments were very manageable and I appreciated the freedom to explore my own research interests. There weren't any huge weaknesses. The readings were a lot, a times a little too much to realistically handle on a busy schedule, but I was able to catch up in class because the discussion leader often summarized the readings before we discussed. All the books we read were excellent and it was relatively easy to find online copies in both English and Arabic.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Elbousty is one of the kindest and most caring professors. he will go out of his way to ensure that every student is able to learn and thrive in the classroom. The material was quite engaging as well. Class discussions were also quite lively and there was a very inclusive environment where every student felt comfortable to freely speak about their opinions and how they viewed the readings.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The class time was slightly inconvenient as it was during dinner, but that is a logistical issue, not really pertaining to the actual class.",
                "No Weaknesses. Great class! The strength of this class is Professor Elbousty himself as he is a great mentor and teacher. He gives his best to his students and I cannot imagine anyone else teaching the course. It was very engaging to read the primary literature and get to discuss our insights with the many other students in the class (which often generated super interesting conversations from various point of views). I also greatly appreciate the presentations and the final paper as that helped me dig deeper into a specific topic I wanted to research coming to the course.",
                "The course does a great job of immersing you in different schools of thought. It also blends history with philosophy to examine a fascinating and important topic that is usually not dealt with properly.",
                "Strengths: such a caring, kind, knowledgeable, committed, genuine, and fair professor in Dr. Jonas Elbousty. Without a doubt, Yale is lucky to have Dr. Elbousty as a professor. This guy has a fascinating power that can drive literary passion through all students of his class. He is a world expert in research on Arabic literature and knows much about the topic of orientalism first-hand through his interaction with other great researchers, like the late Edward Said. Another large strength was the engagement of the students in the class, from whom I learned so much. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None."

                "Yes! Elbousty is amazing and the class is very interactive and manageable",
                "I would recommend this class for its importance in engaging with sociopolitcal notions of \"otherness\" through Arabic literature. But this comes with the warning that this may be more driven by politics than literature. Nevertheless, it is still carried by literary analysis.",
                "Yes! It was definitely challenging from a language perspective, but if you have a strong background in Modern Standard Arabic I would definitely recommend. Professor Elbousty is an amazing teacher, my Yale experience wouldn't be the same if I never had a class with him.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I think the Professor does a great job of ensuring that every student is able to learn in the classroom, and will go out of his way to do so. Additionally, the format of the class is very open-ended, meaning that students are able to suggest new readings, debates, discussion topics for us as a group, and the professor is very open to that.",
                "Yes!! If you are Arab you have to take this class. If you are not Arab you should definitely also take this class. Professor Elbousty is the best in the Arabic department and he cares so much about your progress and well-being as a student in the class and outside the class. The topics are intellectually engaging and the sessions would pass by so quick.",
                "Most definitely! Elbousty is a great teacher and this course is brilliant. A must-take at Yale if you have any interest in Orientalism, the history of the Middle East, or imperialism. We learned a lot throughout the semester and had the opportunity to engage with texts that we wouldn't have otherwise. This class was the highlight of my semester.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is able to take it. This class allowed me to take a deep dive into Arabic literature from an orientalist perspective, in a way I had never been able to even as a native speaker. I learned to truly engage with Arabic works which I would have otherwise not been able to. This course was amazing. It was highly structure. Student engagement was facilitated by Professor Elbousty. \r\nThis class confirmed to me that taking any class with Professor Elbousty is as precious as a gem. I would recommend his classes highly to anyone."
