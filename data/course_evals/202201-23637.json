Also, you have access to the Yale art gallery to study screens with one of the world leading experts, it's just such a cool experience! Literally, no weaknesses. Perfect class.",

                "Strengths: Amazing professor, getting to see Japanese screens in person, fun material. No weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: The professor Mimi, the object-based learning style, interesting content. Also loved the structure--rather than longer essays, we had shorter \"Brief Notes\" due throughout the semester, which were open-ended and allowed us to pursue whatever areas of interests related to the course's content that we wanted. \r\nWeaknesses: the classes could feel long and hard to get through, but that is difficult to avoid with a 2-hour 9am. We always had a short break in the middle, which helped."

                "Most definitely!! Professor Yiengpruksawan is extremely knowledgable and engaging, asking us tough questions and giving insight into how screens were used and viewed. I really enjoyed the beauty of screens, and also that there is such a unique topic to explore Asian art.",
                "Yes, definitely, especially if you would like to learn more about Japanese art.",
