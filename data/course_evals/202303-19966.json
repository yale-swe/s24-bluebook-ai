The course content was interesting and the feedback received from Maeva was really helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A course called War Today attracts a certain demographic of students (something to keep in mind). The course's reading could've been ordered in a slightly different way to be more engaging.",
                "Some of the readings were very interesting, and I especially liked \"They Say/I Say.\" That format of writing everything as an argument helped me make my writing much more interesting and inspired, and I'll make sure to keep using it throughout my time in college. The seminar style of the class was great for meeting people and going in-depth into the assigned readings. The final project being relatively light (considering it comes after the research paper which is a much heavier load) is definitely appreciated.\r\nI did not like some of the aspects of the 114 format. There seemed to be some vague key terms we were supposed to understand that were not very clearly defined (i.e. \"problem\") that were ultimately important in how we were supposed to write our essays.",
