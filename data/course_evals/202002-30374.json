    "Even though this class was online, I still feel like I learned a lot, and there was still a great classroom community. I can't really think of any improvements; the class moved very fast at times and I wish we had a little more time to digest the concepts, but that can't really be helped since we only have five weeks to learn a semester's worth of material.",
    "Strengths: Instructors are very kind, engaging",
    "I think the strengths of this course is that the assignments all build towards making sure the student has a good knowledge of italian. I wish we had more speaking practice though.",
    "It was taught very well and I was very engaged with the material. Teachers were great and made the online much better than it should have been. \r\nOne weakness is that I feel we are sometimes graded on the absolute number of mistakes made (presentations and temas), so it is sometimes better to not do more and risk making more mistakes. The course was still very well taught, though.",
    "This course was taught online and it was great! The assignments and class activities helped me understand the material. The course goes very fast through the material and you're expected to learn and practice a lot on your own, but that was very manageable when studying from home."

    "Yes! I enjoyed this class and I learned a lot, more than I expected for 10 weeks. Even though it was online, I still had a great experience.",
    "Yes, Anna and Deborah are terrific professors. You will have a very fun time taking this class.",
    "Yes, but I would recommend trying to take it in person.",
    "I recommend this course as a great introduction to Italian, especially if it's taught online. It's intense, but you can be flexible with when and how you learn the material. You really do learn the language, but it's also one of the best ways to get the language requirement out of the way.",
    "Solid yes. Italian is great at Yale."
