                "The tests aren't too bad in terms of content, but there is not much time so you feel rushed while taking them. The small mistakes can add up, and there isn't much time to review your tests since you only have 50 minutes.",
                "I think the professor was kinda receptive to feedback in terms of lecture and started incorporating more worked out problems and such, which was very helpful. In addition, the use of diagrams and flow charts made everything much easier to understand. However, I think she tended to steer off topic a lot with related things that we would not actually be tested on and that usually made the material a bit harder to understand. I would also say get rid of the group work because it usually led to two people doing everything while the other two just fell behind, especially if it was a group with no cohesion.",
                "I think the reading quizzes are a good idea but turn out to be a lot. It's a pain to have to take a graded quiz on the lecture topic before learning it in lecture - I think it'd be better to do the quiz on the topic after lecture. Also the final turned out to be very excessive (~20 hours). I don't think it was intended to be that long but it was way too much and added a stressful surprise at the end.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, lectures were pretty good and I learned well in them.",
                "The strength was that the class size was small.\r\n\r\nThere are several weaknesses. The lectures were very unengaging and there seemed to be no reason to attend the lectures because there was no new information learned. The only way to learn was to try and understand from the textbook and Google supplemental material. There was also no clear way to test your knowledge, minus the exams. There were problem sets assigned, but the questions on the problem sets did not resemble the questions asked on the exam.",
                "Parts of the course were rushed and comprehension wasnt always 100%, lots of learning on own.",
                "The strengths were the lectures, availability of the professor, and the homework. The weakness was the testing of skills learned - exams were very difficult and fast paced.",
                "While the class covered lots of material, lots of the material that we were expected to know was barely covered in lecture. Lectures attempted to give an overview of what is covered in the textbook, but the examples given were not to the level of difficulty that were often see on exams. While I wanted to like this class, the class seemed unnecessarily difficult at times and I wish that we were given more guidance.",
                "there were very few strengths to this class other than there was discussion section and recorded lectures available, however, there were many weaknesses. The lecture slides were very disorganized, confusing, and poorly explained, meaning that referencing them after lecture was not helpful. The exams were unnecessarily long, tedious, and covered material that was not taught in the course. Feedback was not implemented and was often gaslighted and dismissed by the professor. The course material itself was quite hard and pairing it with a disorganized and unhelpful class and professor, the course became extremely difficult to navigate. Due dates for material were not consistent and often resulted in confusion.",
                "This was Davis's first year teaching and there was a lot she could have improved on. All three midterms were too long to fully complete in the given time, and even though students told her after each exam that it was too long, she did nothing to fix this. The final was given in a take home format and she said it would take 4-8 hours to fully complete. However, it took me and perhaps other students 16+ hours to finish and submit, and during the exam she did not provide any helpful guidance, despite putting information on the exam that we had not fully learned in class.",

It is not. The material isn't much more difficult, but the exams are written so that you have very little time to think about each problem. And since the exams are worth a majority of your grade, this class quickly becomes stressful (even if you think you understand the material).",
                "absolutely not. This course was the worst experience I had a Yale. The professor was very unhelpful and often gaslighted students when told that the exams were unfair. The lectures were often disorganized and pre-lecture quizzes often covered material that wasn't included in the reading. The textbook and the TF were the most reliable sources in this course, but there were many times were the course material in the class was not even covered in the textbook. This course was the absolute worse course I have ever taken here and it's not because of the course material. I was aware that intro chem was going to be a difficult class before taking it, however, the problem lies with the professor. I strongly advise for other students to either avoid this class altogether or please wait for another professor. You do not want to take it with this one. You will be relying on yourself for all of the course and the material covered in the course will not be close to the material covered in textbooks.",
                "Most students taking this class are taking it as a requirement.
