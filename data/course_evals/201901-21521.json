This lecture provided an incredible amount of information about mental illness and it further enhanced my passion for the mind and the way it works. I hope I retain a good amount of this information because it was so interesting and will probably be very useful in the path I take in the future.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor is knowledgeable and available, material is interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures and slides are not very engaging, and neither are reading responses.",
    "The lectures are very dry and youre just expected to copy down the slides to your notes, which doesnt seem like the most effective way to learn the material. The midterms ask questions that feel unreasonably specific, and theres no application of concepts - its merely regurgitating facts.",
    "Strengths: I enjoyed the weekly readings for our response papers. They were interesting and helped me understand the relevance of the course content in the real world.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought the review paper could be restructured. I think the page requirements for each given section should be more flexible, to account for the fact that any given book or movie will provide different information for analysis.",
    "Strengths: Topics are super interesting, material is available readily\r\nweaknesses: Prof Joormann can be hard to understand sometimes- takes a long time to get through the day's lecture. Tests are worth way too much of final grade",
    "None",
    "could provide recorded lectures to review or for when a student misses a day of class.",
    "Teaching: not engaging, dry facts, though interesting contents.\r\n- class strongly related to contents in the textbook, which facilitated learning, but also made the class less engaging since the exact same concepts were covered - doubling up on topics...\r\nVery fair exams, testing the basic knowledge, not too much unnecessary detail. well organized syllabus.",
    "The content is interesting but I think the lecture could be a little more engaging.",
    "The course has a wide scope of topics (I felt that everything in the DSM and considered a mental illness was touched on), but the depth of study is extremely shallow. I did not feel I learned significantly more than I would have taking intro psyc.",
    "Interesting information but boring lecture.",
    "Strengths: really interesting and applicable course content. Prof. Joormann did a great job in conveying a lot of information each class in an engaging way. Very reasonable course expectations--exams were fair. I am certain that I will use the knowledge gained in this class in many different aspects of my life and career.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would rather have read more scientific articles for the reading responses. I enjoyed the book I read for the paper, but I wished that I could have written a more open-ended paper about my thoughts and reactions to the text as opposed to following the strict format dictated by the assignment.",
    "Strengths: Interesting material, fair coursework load, good preparation for exams, interesting readings for discussion questions, PollEv questions to help go over the material\r\nWeaknesses: Despite the fascinating material, some lectures were not engaging. I would also recommend changing the course name from \"Abnormal\" psychology. I also wish there had been more warnings in advance about triggering material that would be discussed during lecture.",
    "Interesting subject matter, lecture not terribly interesting.",
    "I enjoyed this course and the content was very interesting. Prof. Joormann is kind and engaging. The only improvement could be not starting new lecture topics at the end of class, as it often became hard to keep track of notes and topics when they didn't align consistently with the class days.",
    "Grades are too heavily weighted toward the exams, should be more evenly distributed between book\/movie paper and assignments (and exams).",
    "It is interesting material, but it could be delivered in a more engaging manner. We just went through powerpoint slides with bullet points, and a lot of people lost interest quickly. The amount of people there for lecture was about half or even a third of the amount of people who showed up for the exams.",
    "strengths - low work load\r\nweakness - very poorly run review sessions",
    "It's a large lecture, so not a lot of student engagement. Not to say that the lectures aren't interesting - they are - but a huge lecture is still a huge lecture.",
    "The lectures are packed with information, but I wished they weren't presented as factsheets that could be learned from the textbook but more thought-provoking arguments and narratives.",
    "I would change the lectures to be a bit more exciting though the material was great and the professor had an immense wealth of knowledge",
    "Interesting information",
    "Lecture was not really helpful. I did well on the tests just by skimming the book and lecture slides.",
    "strengths: interesting content, well taught, engaging, interesting reading material\r\nweaknesses: boring at times",
    "Pedagogically, I thought the course was very well designed. Exams were fair and helpful, and the lecture slides were a great mixture of raw information and expansive context. The reading responses and the papers we were responding to were very helpful for engaging with the material in the real world. The final paper, an analysis of mental illness experienced by a character in a book or movie, was an excellent way of integrating this material into our experience of the world around us. Additionally, on a public health level, I think the class serves an important role in giving students tools to identify mental health issues that people in our communities may be experiencing.",
    "Good lectures, exams were fair and stuck to lecture material",
    "Jutta is not an engaging lecturer and spends an hour and 15 minutes harping on the same simple point.",
    "Strengths:\r\nWeaknesses: lecture content could be more organized; they mostly restated the DSM most of the time, which made it hard to stay engaged.",
    "I thought it was well taught.",
    "The course is good overall. It's not too challenging at all. Certain topics are more interesting than others, so at times the class is interesting; other times it is somewhat boring.",
    "I think it could have been more connected somehow and also could have been more engaging. It tended to just be like a summary of the DSM for many different disorders.",
    "Class should relate more to book.",
    "great class! fair, interesting, not stressful",
    "This class was boring",
    "The lecture style was very dry and uninteresting, even though the information should have been interesting. With Professor Joormann, such an expert in the field, I would have found the information so much more if she had included anecdotes from her own experience with the information. Most of the time it felt that the information was a regurgitation of the DSM, rather than a lively presentation of exciting information.",
    "The strengths of this course are that the TAs and professor are very responsive to questions and meeting to discuss topics outside of class. The weaknesses are that the lectures were often not very engaging. However, the Poll Everywhere questions, videos, and guest lecturers helped with this. The professor often read off of the slides and sometimes was a little hard to follow. Additionally, the material taught on the various mental illnesses was very surface level. If one had taken AP Psychology in high school or Intro to Psychology here at Yale, this class would probably be very repetitive and boring. The exams were very straightforward (multiple choice and short answer questions) and non-cumulative which was very nice given the amount of illnesses and etiological paradigms that were covered.",
    "Weaknesses are the fact that each lecture is formatted in the same way: a disorder, symptoms, potential causes, and treatments. This format gets dry and makes classes feel long and tough to sit through. The material itself is interesting, but the lectures are structured in a less interesting way.",
    "Strengths: Prof Joormann is great, the course material is interesting, and the class is not too difficult.\r\nWeaknesses: The course is a brief overview of a lot of topics, so we didn't go too in detail with a lot of the disorders.",
    "great course",
    "I love how the course was structured. Everything seemed very organized as we learned about the different disorders. It was very easy to follow the lecture. However, I wish we had more assignments that could help our grade out instead of relying on 2 tests.",
    "Strengths are that it was a very interesting course and the teaching staff was very helpful with office hours and review sessions. The weekly reading response was also helpful in helping students think about the outside material they read for the class. Overall great course, wouldn't change a thing!",
    "The course content was very captivating, and the reading responses are actually very informative and interesting to do. I would look forward to doing the reading responses every week, which would offer a new perspective on a certain disorder or how a person copes with the disorder in their daily life.",
    "strengths: the class is super easy \r\nweakness: you won't get much out of the class",
    "The lecture is interesting, but only if you attend. The TAs are not very visible and keep canceling their office hours.",
    "Strengths: the overviews of each disorder are very detailed and provide a lot of important information about them. The course also uses a lot of case studies and videos which helps with the general understanding of the disorders. Also, the course made a point of never being judgmental about any of the disorders which was good. Respectful language and attitudes were used throughout.\r\nWeaknesses: I (along with many other students) found it frustrating when Professor Joormann would start a new topic\/new set of lecture slides when there were 10 minutes left of class. I would recommend either better pacing or simply ending class early.",
    "Exam's are worth too much of overall grade. Difficult to show true comprehension of material by 2 exams. Textbook is dull. Joormann's lectures are quite interesting albeit lengthy.",
    "Strengths are that it is interesting and expectations are clear and straight-forward. A weakness is sometimes the 75 minute lectures can feel a little long.",
    "The lectures werent super engaging but the material was interesting. The grading in the class seemed very fair.",
    "I think the powerpoint slides could be a little bit more structured.",
    "The strengths of this course are the reading responses and the material we get for those. The TedTalks and articles are very interesting to read. Another strength of this course is the information learned in it. A weakness is the way the information was presented in lecture.",
    "The main strength of this course is that it teaches you about mental illness have affected nearly everyone either directly or indirectly. I also really enjoyed the videos that we watched in class because it helped make the textbook material more real and more memorable. I also really benefitted from having the Poll.Ev check in questions because it helped me check my knowledge incrementally, which is so helpful when it finally comes time to review for the larger midterm and final. It helped you realize along the way what you knew well and what you didn't.",
    "The course could be improved by updated lecture slides, and clearer lecture structure.",
    "it could have been improved by more discussion of the lecture rather than simply reading off of the powerpoint notes. The course is less engaging and it prevents people from wanting to go to class when the lecture slides can just be read. That being said the information covered in the class was interesting and I personally enjoyed going and listening.",
    "The midterm was specific and did not show learning levels.",
    "Interesting course content.",
    "There was so much material that it could be difficult to follow sometimes, and sometimes it was hard to engage with the material since it was only presented one way.",
    "Strengths- interesting subject matter, manageable workload \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- lectures could be boring",
    "Taught straight off the lecture slides, more engagement",
    "Jutta and her slides are the biggest strength of this course. She just makes it very easy to understand, and she's a funny lecturer. Her assignments were engaging and helped us understand disorders better.",
    "Good class. Interesting lecture and good professor",
    "Seriously improved... how are exams worth 80% literally does not make sense",
    "I think throwing something else in there besides the two major tests worth 80% of your grade would be appropriate.",
    "The textbook and the professor's lectures covered the same material. I would have appreciated if the latter was more engaging. The professor also did not follow the class according to the syllabus and it was confusing at times on what material should be covered in a week.",
    "The strengths of this course rely on the lectures. Prof. Joorman is super nice and makes the lecture very engaging and human.",
    "While the material in this course is interesting, the lectures are very boring. Dr. Joormann is not very engaging and does a lot of repeating exactly what is on the slides.",
    "It was straightforward and interesting.",
    "Lecture were not super boring. Professor Joorman seems really passionate and is a pretty good lecturer and brings in her previous experiences as a psychiatrist to tie into the lecture. Weaknesses are that the lecture slides are kind of disorganized and don't explain as much (highly recommend going to lectures and taking notes)",
    "Very solid survey of psychopathology, I would not change anything about this course.",
    "It's not a lot of work and the lectures are really interesting! The tests are reasonable and the reading responses are interesting to do",
    "some material\/videos were obsolete, but overall great textbook and lecture selected material.",
    "This course was over all conducted very well. it would be nice to have some sort of sample study questions before exams.",
    "The class was very poorly organized, Professor Joorman's lecture's were confusing and not engaging, the reading responses were interesting but felt disconnected from the course, depending on your Tf, you got almost no feedback.",
    "I thought Professor Joorman did a great job lecturing! The class was well-organized and the assignments were good.  I would say in the future maybe deviating from the textbook a bit more and covering more recent developments\/anecdotal stories etc. would help connect the material together more.",
    "more engaging lectures",
    "I greatly enjoyed the content of the class, and the assessments were very reasonable. I did find the weekly responses quite disengaging, and I wonder if it would be better to require some more analytical assignment that occurred less often (for example, every 2-3 weeks).",
    "It's a great lecture to take for students who don't have a lot of extra time. Very minimum requirements, and great content.",
    "Strengths: readings for responses were interesting and always added to the lecture and textbook info\r\nweaknesses: often ran out of time in lectures which sometimes meant missing out on information",
    "strengths: very detailed, very nuanced, a good intro course\r\nweaknesses: started very slowly, did not cover as much ground in each topic as we could have--maybe the details could have been decreased in order to cover more ground (i.e. we barely touched personality disorders) and i still would have been okay with it since it is a 100-level course",
    "Professor Joormann did a great job of teaching us whats important to know about where the field is at but also where society is at in terms of mental illness. This could've been a cut and dry informative class but it went beyond that to critique and discuss. I particularly enjoyed the material for the reading responses because of how eye-opening it was and how it added to lecture.",
    "Strengths: the content is genuinely interesting, and important to learn about (at least in my opinion). \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures are very disorganized. (Often what is being spoken on is not in line with the slide \/ you aren't sure what exactly you're supposed to know and to what depth \/ are told you'll learn more about something later etc). Additionally, each test is worth 40% of your grade which can be very stressful because they are mostly multiple choice.",
    "The professor dwelled on a lot of basic subjects quite often.",
    "The course materials and reading were interesting, but the lectures and TFs were overwhelmingly unhelpful. The lectures were super disorganized, and we were perpetually 15 minutes behind, so every class was finishing an old lecture and starting a new one even if we only had five minutes. The TFs split the lectures, so no one really knows what's going on. The grade in the class is basically your grade on the midterm and final (each is worth 40%), and you are never properly prepared to take the tests. I was really interested in the subject this course focused on, and I did manage to learn things from reading the textbook and readings outside of class, but I was disappointed by the class itself.",
    "The strengths of the class is that everyone can relate to it on one aspect or another, at some point in the semester. Also, it includes videos that show what the disorders look like in real life. Something that could be improved is that the class is too boring. One can easily fall asleep through lecture and wake up and probably haven't missed anything.",
    "Not have 2 tests be 40% of grade",
    "The tests could be worth a little less. 80% is made up by two exams.",
    "I think the format of the class is good and very engaging. The material was interesting and the exams were fair. I would say it could have been slightly more challenging, in that the exams tested at quite a surface level. Additionally, I would suggest that the lecture slides had everything that was needed to know, and this meant class attendance was quite low so I would suggest implementing different methods to encourage greater class attendance (like maybe 10% of grade coming from in-class participation quizzes).",
    "I thought the course was great. Jutta Joormann is an amazing instructor.",
    "Good pace and well spaced assignments.",
    "Strengths: interesting subject material, fair grading system\r\nWeaknesses: lectures have no logical flow (often jump between subjects and it's difficult to keep material straight), delivered in a quite boring way, way too much tiny material that you *may* need to try and memorize that doesn't feel very important",
    "The weight of the exams (40% each) should be lowered and there should be more emphasis on papers\/ a paper.",
    "The class is interesting but the lectures are not very engaging",
    "lectures a little dry at times",
    "The strength of this course was the manageable workload and how accessible the content was. The weaknesses of this course was having the majority of the grades relying on only two exams.",
    "It is hard to get engaged with such a huge class size, so maybe add a section once a week.",
    "A strength was the Professor Joorman was an engaging lecturer and the TAs were very available for questions. A weakness was that it seemed unclear to me which textbook readings to do to support learning on what topics.",
    "More examples of questions that may be presented on the exam for better preparation.",
    "Strengths: good modern videos\/interviews and interesting subject matter\r\nweakness: some lectures had so much information that it was hard to digest\/not as fun as when the class is broken up with videos\/activities.",
    "The course delivers formulaically on what it promises, but lectures are not especially rich, engaging, or surprising, and the course is not designed for intellectual challenge. In the future, I think it would be better if the lectures moved into the disorders more quickly (rather than spending so much time on introductory material that someone could get from an Intro Psych class), and if they offered fresh perspectives on mental health activism or how cutting-edge psychopathology interventions are developed.",
    "I think a strength of this course is the variety of material that it covers but I think the course is a bit unclear about what is covered in examinations.",
    "A strength of the course is its thorough discussion of various disorders. I thought a weakness was the timing; it seemed we spent an unusually long time on the background of abnormal psychology. I believe the history could've been covered in a single day and the fascinating articles Prof. Joormann had us read every week could be mentioned more in lecture.",
    "Strengths: great lecturer and the text book used is great and very detailed. Discussion sections would help a lot more with engagement.",
    "The material was interesting but lecture was slightly boring.",
    "The course has very interesting content and Professor Joormann is very clearly knowledgable and passionate. I think it could be improved by switching up the lecture styles to keep them engaging since they were all conducted in the same manner. I also think it would be helpful to spend more time on etiology and other things that people who took intro psych knew but those who didn't did not."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course because I did not feel involved throughout the semester.",
    "Yes, this was a very interesting class and it really feels awesome to have learned all I did. The workload is not bad and exams are not too difficult either.",
    "Good class to Credit\/D, but if youre taking it for a grade, the midterms ask very specific questions from lectures that requires detailed studying. Also, the lectures are long and not very engaging.",
    "Yes, I thought the course material was very interesting and gave me the tools to think critically about how mental health is talked about and treated.",
    "Yes! But the tests are worth way too much- 40% of your grade for one test is crazy. Otherwise great 5th class",
    "Definitely!!!!!",
    "Great Credit\/D",
    "Yes, an interesting introduction to clinical psychology. Maybe not as interesting to those who have taken intro psych courses.",
    "Yes, because the contents are interesting, but the class is not taking a lot of time and is not too challenging.",
    "Depends on what a student is looking for. If they know this is material they want to learn about then yes, but if they are considering other psychology courses I think there could be others.",
    "If there were a different instructor and curriculum, yes. The subject matter in itself is extremely interesting and important. The way the class was taught, though, was unhelpful and uninteresting.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to all students. Most people know someone who has a mental illness, and this course helps provide historical, psychological, and clinical context to this major public health issue. Course expectations are reasonable, and lectures are interesting. Particularly for people interested in medicine, this course is a must-take!",
    "Sure! It's a pretty interesting class. I recommend it if you're looking for a good social science credit, fulfilling your psyc major requirements, or are just interested in learning about mental illness. I would, however, warn students interested in the class that there can be upsetting and\/or graphic material sometimes, which is to be expected in a course about mental illness.",
    "Take it for an SO credit or as an easy psych elective if you're a psych major. I think I went to class twice all year. Make a study guide based on the lecture slides (they get posted on Canvas), study that, and you'll do well on the exams.",
    "Not a bad 5th credit. Interesting subject matter. Might fall asleep during class.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes if you are a psychology major and need to fill a core requirement-- this is interesting and also relatively easy.",
    "Yes, especially if interested in psychology",
    "I would if you are interested in a week by week look at disorders",
    "It's interesting",
    "It's a pretty good gut or fifth class. Material is inherently interesting, but not presented as so.",
    "yes, good course and not too hard if you have a difficult workload otherwise",
    "I think this knowledge is important for everyone to have.",
    "Good 5th class.",
    "Yes. fun",
    "Perfect Credit\/D\r\nPerfect 5th class",
    "It is a good gut but if you are a psych major or want to learn abnormal psych I would not waste your time.",
    "Only if you're actually interested in learning about psychological disorders; otherwise, it can get very boring.",
    "Yes. It is super interesting",
    "I would recommend this to a student who is really interested in abnormal psychology or to a psych major - or to a student who wants a fairly interesting course that isn't too intellectually demanding.",
    "It is a good class if you just want to learn about what constitutes disorders based on their actual diagnosable criteria. I found this kind of bland, but if you're into that, go for it!",
    "Yes, it's a good fifth class -- fairly interesting material without too much work.",
    "Yes, very informative class.",
    "yes! interesting material applicable to everyone,  minimal courseload, a class to take for you even if you're not a psych major",
    "Classic Yale gut",
    "No, not really. The information should have been interesting but was presented so dryly that it was uninteresting, and thus hard to learn.",
    "Sure",
    "No.",
    "Fantastic class. Jutta is incredible. Easy grading. Def study for the tests though.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as a nice, easy social science or 5th credit course. The professor often read off of the slides and sometimes was a little hard to follow. Additionally, the material taught on the various mental illnesses was very surface level. If one had taken AP Psychology in high school or Intro to Psychology here at Yale, this class would probably be very repetitive and boring. The exams were very straightforward (multiple choice and short answer questions) and non-cumulative which was very nice given the amount of illnesses and etiological paradigms that were covered. The TAs and professor are very responsive to questions and meeting to discuss topics outside of class. The lectures were often not very engaging. However, the Poll Everywhere questions, videos, and guest lecturers helped with this. As long as you went to class and took notes and studied a fair amount beforehand, you would do very well in the course. They also curved both exams which was nice. The final paper was also very straightforward and could be done on the movie of our choice. Overall, I liked that the course was easy and straightforward. The only thing was that it was often boring and not engaging at times. From what I have heard about Intro to Pysch and deciding between the two, my experience with the course has made me glad I took Abnormal Pysch.",
    "Yes if you are interested in learning about humans. However, sit in on the first few lectures and see if Jutta's teaching style fits with you.",
    "Take this course if you are looking for an easy 5th class.",
    "Yes. Very good class.",
    "Yes! The workload was manageable, and the class itself was super interesting and engaging.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any other student at Yale. It was super interesting to learn about and the exams were accessible as long as you studied!",
    "Yes, a great introduction to the field of psychology and incredibly informative. I came in as a STEM student looking for my fifth class, hoping it would be laid-back and interesting, and that's exactly what it turned out to be. The reading responses are low stress, the paper is actually fun to write (as you can do it on a movie or paper), and the exams are straightforward if you have paid attention to the material. The professor herself stresses that you don't have to go to class if you don't want to, and instead you can read the textbook for a more in-depth look at the disorders. However, I found at times that material she stressed on in class was more likely to be on the exam. Sitting in class can be boring at times, as she reads off of the powerpoints for the most part, but the videos and reading responses make up for that as well. Overall, it's an interesting lecture that is great as an easy fifth credit.",
    "YES 100% if you want an easy class to get an A\/A-. Not very hard class at all. you won't get much out of it though even though I did learn some cool facts.",
    "This class is advertised as a gut but definitely isn't. You can choose not to show up for lecture, but you really have to know the material to do well on the tests. Take it to learn more about psychological disorders, but  be willing to keep up with the class or you'll fall behind and be screwed.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning more about psychology and mental disorders. This class is a great introductory overview for anyone looking to learn more about how various factors play into determining a diagnosis (or not) in a person.",
    "If you are looking for an easy and interesting class, this is a great choice. I hadn't taken intro psych and was completely fine. If you already have too much of a psych background, I could see it being a little boring.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student, Psych major or not. The material is fascinating, presented clearly, and the workload is very manageable.",
    "It was an interesting class & not super difficult! If you need a social science or just another class to fill your schedule then take this!",
    "I would be wary of taking the class because it has a 40% midterm and 40% final grade distribution. If you do poorly on either of the exams, it is really hard to otherwise raise your grade.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this course. It has a very manageable workload and you learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course because the information is very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is genuinely interested in learning about a wide range of mental disorders. This course emphasized breath over depth, but did require knowing some more complicated etiologies.",
    "If you do the slightest amount of work, you'll be fine and the material is interesting",
    "Yes I would. The class material is interesting and cool to learn about. It is a very standard psych class however there is not very much work at all. That being said the professor spends a lot of time just reading off of the powerpoint which can be dry. The class is super manageable.",
    "Yes extremely interesting material",
    "Yes, good course",
    "I would because the material is very interesting especially if you are interested in psychology or mental health.",
    "Yes, because it gave valuable insights to mental disorders that could possibly be experienced",
    "Yes if you're looking for a low workload class that is actually cool.",
    "Yes, it's important to have an understanding of stigmatized topics, and politics always overshadow daily struggles in this category. The sciencey and historical aspects of the course are interesting, but it's really interesting to learn about the diagnoses and understand why people act a certain way.",
    "Yes. Great psychology elective. Very interesting",
    "I took this class hoping it was a gut but was seriously wrong. I mean if you count easy A- as a gut then yeah, otherwise, this class is pretty bs. I didn't go to class once and came out with an A-. A midterm, final, paper, and like 8 reading responses. The paper is a book report that was honestly so unnecessary. 10\/10 would NOT recommend",
    "I would, like i said really interesting stuff. wanted to go to class.",
    "Yes, it is at times disorganized, but the material covered is very interesting.",
    "YES! I think more people need to understand more how people with mental disorders are affected. There are a lot of misconceptions out there and this course helped me to clear them out.",
    "Yes. It was interesting and straightforward.",
    "I recommend this course to someone looking for an interesting fifth class! The weekly reading responses are interesting and don't take that much time to do. The tests are straightforward and fair.",
    "Yes if you are okay with learning a lot of info",
    "YesI think it is important that all students learn about mental health and its associated illnesses.",
    "No",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Great fifth course, the work was super manageable, and the lectures are really interesting :)",
    "Yes! Great overview and Professor Joormann is extremely helpful and accommodating. Workload isn't bad as long as you keep up with readings\/attend lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class as a gut, or fifth course to take. it genuinely serves this purpose very well. very surface level content but important and interesting to learn none the less.",
    "No, this class was a poor survey class and ultimately a waste of time",
    "Definitely! I'm not a psych major, but I feel like the material I learned will remain useful and applicable and is really important in our world. The class has a low workload and the lectures are interesting.",
    "very interesting topic",
    "Abnormal psych is an interesting course with a very very manageable workload. I highly suggest this class to all majors",
    "Yes, because of its intriguing content, but overall low workload.",
    "I would recommend this because I feel like it gives a good overview of disorders in a digestible way.",
    "I would, but be actually interested in clinical psych. The tests do have a fair amount of detail; significantly more difficult than a highschool psychology course. The tests are mostly from lecture--not 50\/50 lecture\/textbook as advertised. There will always be a couple of questions from the textbook but the lecture is far more relevant.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Abnormal psychology was a really interesting class and I feel like I learned a lot. Professor Joormann is great and the material is important for people to know. I really liked the structure of the course and enjoyed taking it.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Especially with the prevalence of mental illness in our society and the toxic climate at Yale, learning about and beginning to understand mental health is so so so important. I can't stress that enough. I think this class helped me understand so much about aspects of society as well as aspects of the struggles of people I know. There's so much work to be done on reducing stigma around mental health and treating mental illness but I think we should all start with a survey course like this. If not for understanding yourself, do it to contribute to understanding and caring for others.",
    "If you need a fifth credit, this isn't a bad choice. You will, however, need to put in the time to study for the tests (each 40% of your grade) and attend rather disorganized lectures.",
    "It was interesting and not that difficult.",
    "Yes, it was a good class to credit D.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless you're really good at taking tests and don't mind teaching yourself the material. People say that this class is a gut cuz there isn't much work, but since your grade is based on your midterm and final, a lot of students don't do as well as they'd hope because the midterm and final have questions on them that are never covered in class. If you're just looking for a 5th class, you're better off taking something else.",
    "yes, it can be a little boring sometimes but the workload is super manageable and it can be interesting sometimes.",
    "Yes its a very interesting course with minimal. Great Credit D option given the course content.",
    "No",
    "yes, i would recommend highly",
    "Definitely. Abnormal psychology is so cool!!!",
    "Great Credit\/D",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student because it covers extremely important topics on mental illness and really helps change perceptions of mental illness.",
    "Yes! Take this class whether youre interested in psych or not. Its as much of a gut as youll get here... if you show up to lecture and study somewhat for the 2 tests youll be fine. Reading responses each week take 15 minutes max. Great class, lectures are interesting and easy to follow",
    "Yes, I think everyone should have a basic understanding of psychological disorders.",
    "Yes, it provides a good set of knowledge for understanding mental illnesses to educate oneself on the topic for further work in this field and even for students simply interesting in learning about it.",
    "Eh, for the psych major, sure. Otherwise, there are better courses to be taken imo",
    "Yes, it provides useful interesting knowledge and insight surrounding mental disorders",
    "Yes it is an interesting class and not too much work.",
    "yes",
    "Yes! This course could be taken by any student at Yale regardless of their major because it helps one understand the vastness that is mental illness and how it affects so many of our most vulnerable. By having background knowledge in this area we can better understand and sympathize with those struggling with mental illness.",
    "Definitely- the lectures were fun and organized.",
    "Yes, this course was great to take after psychology 110 to learn more about disorders specifically. Since the workload is manageable it does not take away from the amount of time you out toward other courses.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student. The class is very organized and easy to follow while teaching interesting topics.",
    "Yes. If someone is interested in psychology and mental disorders, this course greatly enhances one's understanding of many different types of mental illness.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in mental illness or even just in psychology, you should take this class. It's incredibly interesting.",
    "I would recommend this lecture if you have little experience with psychology and are looking for a lighter 5th class. Much of the material is either common sense or will be forgotten after the exam. Lectures delivered on what they were supposed to but not much more; they were mostly dry, and overlapped a lot with Intro Psych.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are at all interested in learning about abnormal behavior.",
    "Yes, I think abnormal psychology is very relevant to today's society and the mental health movement. The discussion on eating disorders was great for a generation that's growing up with social media.",
    "Yes, light workload but gives you a lot of info about disorders.",
    "Very easy class that covers interesting material, but not super engaging.",
    "I would recommend it if they were interested in learning about the disorders covered in the class in a general way but not if they wanted to focus in depth on a couple.",
    "I must confess: I did not much enjoy this course. As someone coming from a background in the hard sciences I was frustrated by the sometimes hand-wavy and constantly fluctuating diagnostic criteria of clinical psychology. Additionally, I wish more time was devoted to discussing which of the treatments we know work and which treatments are more hopeful Hail Marys. I am unsure, however, if my complaints stem more from nature of psychology or the specifics of this course, so it is difficult to tell if you would share my views. Regardless, the fairly light workload of this course and the *ridiculously easy* (multiple choice!!) exams could provide reason enough to take it."
