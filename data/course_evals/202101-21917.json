The class moves really fast which I know can't be changed as there are a set amount of topics to cover, but It seems like we moved on before I was ever able to understand the previous topic. A small annoyance, but section is hard to focus through as it's a bit long (75-85 mins), maybe add a 5 min break in the middle?",
