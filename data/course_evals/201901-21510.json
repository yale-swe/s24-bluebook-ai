    "Strengths: Professor Jackson is great. Very nice and kind, very open to office hours and providing help with essays. He doesn't make the class super strict, which actually encouraged me to read all of the books because I wanted to show up to class with something to say.",
    "Although this was a seminar, class was taught like a lecture, with mostly the professor touching on important themes and making comments on certain passages. Students mostly contributed a comment or two and spent most of the remaining time listening to Jackson.",
    "Maybe if there were more class discussions than lectures."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! The books aren't that long, and most of them are pretty good. Professor Jackson is very nice, open to office hours to bounce ideas off for papers, and you will become familiar with not only Brazilian literature but themes present throughout all literature.",
    "This course was good because its rare to find a class that focuses on contemporary literature, and even less so on books that are not first world. But I feel like we didnt really get to engage deeply with the books, and it felt like any other English class despite the uniqueness of the subjects and themes we were dealing with.",
    "I would definitely recommend this. The readings were quite interesting and gave a good idea of Brazil specially in the past century.",
    "Yes, you learn a lot."
