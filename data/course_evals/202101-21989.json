I also learned how to program and apply different visual effects to the 3D models we created in both methods (ex: reflectiveness as cubemap in scanline or simulated rays in raytracing). I also learned about the history of computer graphics, and looked at various examples of how the field progressed in the movie industry over time.",

Also enjoyed learning about the global history of these processes being developed, as well as insights into computer graphics and ethics."

Class notes are easy to follow, rich with fun diagrams and real-world examples in animation and movies. Homework assignments feel extremely satisfying - you write code to produce images, fractals, and videos. Final project is also amazing and gives students a lot of creative freedom.",
                "More assignments would have been useful. I appreciated that we dove deep into Ray Tracing, but I would have liked to have had assignments on more advanced topics like Photon Mapping.",
                "The problem sets take a long time and can be frustrating when things don't work out, but it's rewarding to know how to implement these algorithms and techniques. It would be great if there were more opportunities for peer collaboration on the problem sets, rather than just on the final project. I found the lectures really interesting, particularly the discussion of racism and history in computer graphics.",
                "The course is organized and Prof Kim does a great job of keeping the lectures engaging and interesting. The TAs/ULAs were also very helpful with problem sets.",
                "Strengths definitely include the lecture format and easily readable notes, as well as the accessibility and helpfulness of office hours and the TA's. IF more TA's were available to hire, then I'd always recommend more for any CS class as they can be a round-the-clock endeavor, maybe cover a few of these extra days.",
                "I really liked the sequence of topics; it was really great to understand scanline before tacking raytracing (it seems that the textbook does this in the other direction). I felt that topics in this class built upon each other really logically.\r\n\r\nLoved seeing film clips throughout, with applications of the techniques we were learning about. Prof. Kim's anecdotes are great!\r\n\r\nPacing of the class was perfect, I thought. I felt it was really effective that Prof. Kim wrote out his notes by hand for each lecture, especially for diagrams and pictures; usually with preprepared lecture slides, it's easy to get lost while trying to follow along. \r\n\r\nFinal project was really effective at getting us to apply a whole lot of concepts in a single, manageable undertaking.",
                "The strengths of this class are definitely the problem sets and the final project, which is creating a 10 second movie. The problem sets were practical and engaging, and I really enjoyed being able to create a creative product at the end of the course."

Watching from a screenshared iPad allowed me to see a lot better than when I'm sitting in a lecture hall and squinting to see the board. \r\n\r\nI liked the option for partner work on the final project (not sure if that was covid-specific)."

The material is super challenging, but Prof. Kim does an excellent job of breaking down every topic and I felt like I came out of the class with a deep conceptual understanding of the content. The problem sets are particularly challenging (much less guidance is offered than in 223 and 323 and the programs require a different \"style\" of debugging) but extremely rewarding  you get to build a ray tracer from scratch!! How sick is that!!!",

                "Take this! Absolutely fantastic, definitely difficult.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in computer graphics, this is a fantastic course. It's definitely not an easy course, but it covers a lot of interesting material.",
                "Yes, as long as you have the required CS/math experience. Knowing C will help you work in C++, having some basic experience with matrices will definitely make your life a little easier as well. This course is very much worth it as a CS major-- there aren't very many courses that are both technically rigorous and allow you to produce multiple artistic artifacts through CS. The projects are both intense and immensely rewarding.",
                "Yes, definitely. I learned a lot and am now very interested in Graphics. It is a great CS elective especially if you like C/C++ and if you have any interest in art or animation. The final project was fun and I appreciated having that over an exam during finals week.",
                "Yes, IF they had the previous mathematical background and were interested in Computer Graphics and also had a lot of time to dedicate to the course. All of those are pretty much prerequisites for this, but overall it is very rewarding.",
                "Yep, definitely recommend this with Prof. Kim! I've heard some people are intimidated by the math you need to know for this class, but with 202 you should be totally fine. It's also one of the few CS electives in which you get to do a final project, and one of the even fewer in which you can work on something artistic. Be warned about the raytracing pset, though... you really should start that early, like the staff will keep telling you."
