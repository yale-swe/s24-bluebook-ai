                "I learned a ton about the ethical decisions that factor into environmental policymaking on a state and global scale. I developed greater thinking capabilities after learning about different examples of technologies to combat climate change and their repercussions, as well as the ability to think into the future when considering the moral obligations we have to future generations.",
                "I gained a better understanding of Kantian, utilitarian, and land ethics perspectives and learned how to structure a philosophical argument. As an environmental studies major, this course helped me flesh out my resistance or support of specific techniques and ideas by presenting various perspectives.",

                "We face many environmental challenges, from geoengineering and bioengineering, to toxic wastes and the preservation of nature. But it is not enough to know about these problems at face value. We need to investigating them with a firm ethical foundation in order to know WHY they deserve our attention. From there we can better respond accordingly from a place of conviction and empowerment. As such, the positions I crafted during this course will better guide my decisions, not only for my environmental career, but also my daily life. I highly recommend students from ALL majors take this course during their academic journey.",

We covered utilitarianism, Kantian ethics, virtue ethics, Leopold's land ethic, Deep Ecology Movement, geoengineering, etc., and focused on people like Aldo Leopold, Peter Singer, Tom Regan, Bill McKibben, etc. We learned how to answer questions and argue using a certain perspective (utilitarianism, land ethic, etc) as well as how to counter that perspective.",

                "Strengths - Latham is an outstanding professor and speaker. The course is well organized and balanced in workload. The readings all feel relevant and interesting. \r\nWeaknesses - The timing of the midterms felt off both times.",
                "The section for this class was amazing. Lots of great discussions. The lectures were good, but it was apparent that the course was relatively new due to some of the organizational changes. Will definitely improve over time.",
                "I found that the assigned readings often did not present rigorous philosophy or get much into theory. I also found the lectures generally uninsightful and at times repetitive between weeks. They seemed generally as if they were not at all prepared in advance. The course readings were also quite disorganized. It was difficult to know which were assigned because the syllabus and folders did not match up.",
                "The lectures are very compelling, and the discussion sections are productive. The only weakness I see in this class is that the lectures and readings are redundant to one another. There is too much overlap between the two. I think this class would be more effective if the readings and lectures covered different aspects and examples of their shared topic rather than them both diving into the same things.",
                "Weaknesses: this class approaches environmental ethics from a western philosophy lens, and only sways from that for one week when the readings focus on ecofeminism, racial environmental justice, and indigenous environmentalism. It is void of the storytelling that makes Professor Latham's other classes so interesting, and does not cast a very wide net, nor does it provide nuanced solutions or insight into age-old environmental issues.",
                "The lectures were very boring and disorganized, never any notes or slides. It was hard to know what would be important for exams. 1h15min felt like way too long, and it often felt like Prof. Latham was running out of things to say and just trying to fill the time. It's easy enough to do well without going to lecture, which is nice, but I'm disappointed that I didn't feel like I learned anything. Also, this class was very narrow in its scope. We mostly read the perspectives of white western men, even though there's a vast literature of indigenous and ecofeminist work we could draw from. The one lecture about ecofeminism was cancelled, and the material wasn't on the exam, which made it feel like Prof Latham didn't take that area of study seriously.",
                "- engaging lecture",
                "strengths: Professor Latham always brought interesting topics to discuss in class. Also, the readings were super interesting and I looked forward to them every week\r\nweakness: I thought there could have been better engagement in lectures (attendance was poor, but I made an effort to attend every class because I genuinely enjoyed the class). I also felt like sometimes the class was a bit unorganized (would have loved a picture or notes on the board instead of a straight lecture)",
                "Strengths: \r\n Professor Latham is a great lecturer and incorporates relevant real world examples to each concept\r\n Good grounding in Western philosophy\r\n Works great as an introduction to ethics for EVST/EPS students / an introduction to environmental topics for ethics majors\r\n Interesting readings that are manageable\r\n Responsive TAs that make an effort to help out students\r\n Really good, relevant range of topics discussed\r\n The exams reflected the course content well and had no surprises\r\n Professor Latham was great at fielding questions from students\r\n It's clear looking at last year's content and this year's that Prof Latham made an effort to change/improve the class and he was clearly committed to improving it\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n I think this course should ground students in inequities in environmentalism first before diving into each topic so students begin with that lens in their tool kit as opposed to learning about feminist and Indigenous perspectives after the second midterm. This is especially important for students who might not be aware of environmental inequalities or discrimination. Having those readings to reference later when considering things like geoengineering and obligations to future generations would be so much more useful and add a lot of depth to the discussion\r\n Including William Cronon's \"The Trouble With Wilderness\" as a reading would help when discussing anthropocentrism/non-anthropocentrism and ideas of preservation/conservation\r\n I think the reading responses should count for 10% of the course grade. It's a great way to measure participation and reward students for the work they're putting into the class beyond six hours of exam time.",
                "The midterms and final are heavily weighted but if you stay engaged in the lecture, you should be okay.",
                "Better attendance by classmates (perhaps with a participation grade structure?). It was not fair to the professor nor the better engaged students to have only half the class show up on a given class day. I greatly appreciate the recorded lectures, but in-class participation is key to this type of material. The more voices the better.",
                "Although the content was interesting and complex, I struggled to develop my own critical thinking and nuanced perspective for the exams. I wish there was more emphasis on how we can imagine and critique the philosophies rather than just what the philosophers thought.",
                "Timed essay exams should not be handwritten. Maybe eliminate the timed portion altogether and make regular essays the primary assignments.",
                "Too many topics, not enough information",
                "Strengths: very interesting topic. Weaknesses: lecture is rather unengaging (especially because it was at 9 am when I took it). Theres really no engagement except for a bombardment of readings that the professor then briefly talks about during lecture.",
                "I liked the syllabus in that the readings and topics were all good, but it could have been more neatly tied together and engagingly organized.",
                "Strength: the lectures are very engaging, and the coursework is very manageable. The exam questions are somewhat predictable, so this course is relatively low-stress. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the instructions for the weekly readings can at times be a little bit confusing and unclear.",
                "Strengths: This course covered a good bit of ground in terms of connecting some foundational ethical theory to specific topics. The start of the course was really helpful in forming that ethical basis, and these were some of the most informative weeks that forced me to learn to think in a new way beyond just applying intuitive thinking. TFs were really nice and accessible, and Professor Latham has a wealth of knowledge. Readings werent too long and were helpful. Reading the Land Ethic and arguments of important philosophers like Singer was a good aspect of the texts.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes lectures felt a little bit like a list of fun facts or conflicting arguments than a comprehensive summary of the debate over specific ethical issues. There was definitely room to be more technical in terms of interpreting environmental events through a specifically ethical, rather than just general right-or-wrong, lens, and more technical mechanisms of things like geoengineering would have been helpful to see as well. I think this may be limited by the cross-listing policy, but this class would be stronger with more philosophy student TFs, as non-philosophy majors taking the course tend toward ways of thinking that already fall in line with environmentalist critiques we are already aware of. More specific readings on Kantianism would have been good to better establish the reasoning behind such a dominant philosophy of environmentalism as it exists.",
                "Weakness was that this wasnt a class for the instructor since most of the stuff was new to him as well",
                "Strengths: This course covers a lot about environmental ethics, good for someone interested in ethics or the environmental field. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures could drag on, especially since they were early in the morning and we spent a lot of time repeating certain topics. I think the course could be improved if lectures were shortened to 50 minutes.",
                "This course was organized well in that the readings were well supported by the lectures and discussion sections.",
                "This course presents many interesting subjects regarding environmental ethics and I think that the order in which the different topics are presented works well. I do wish that there was more of a variety of assignments besides the weekly reading responses and the midterms. I think that it would help student engagement if, for some of the topics, students had assignments that would allow them to explore more deeply how the content studied is relevant in the world (besides what is talked about in the readings and during class). I also think that if the class time was clearly structured with the first 30 or 40 minutes being lecture and the rest being discussion, students would feel more inclined to participate. Also, I wish that there was more focus on learning how to write a philosophical argument because that is a large part of the midterms and finals. It would be nice to analyze the techniques of writers from the readings and what makes their argument effective or ineffective.",
                "The readings were interesting and helpful to learning and section was beneficial.",
                "This course is phenomenal as is, the only change Id consider is maybe adding a participation component so more people would actually come to lecture.",
                "The strength of the class are the topics and the themes themselves. The weaknesses are that it does not feel very intro-friendly since our only grades are philosophical arguments which we do not touch upon in class. Also, the lectures could be a bit more interesting by having slides. Finally, there should be some other form of grades besides just exams: for instance, for our participation or weekly discussion section.",
                "Very interesting material. Overall, intriguing class.",
                "Poorly organized",
                "The course is overall fine, but structurally/organizationally could use some work. The latter half of the course is very interesting, and the first half of the course is necessary to understand the second half of the course, but the first half of the course is pretty abstract, and it would be worth considering how to make the first part of the course more engaging.",
                "This class was so interesting and really built up arguments and understanding from the ground up. Class was spent talking through readings and explaining different sides of arguments. I really enjoyed section as well, and students were quite engaged with the conversation. Lecture never had slides, which was nice for some, but also could have been helpful for others. Some of the readings were a bit long and tedious, but most were interesting. I think there could have been more application of the material to other debates or projects.",
                "Strength: every week I was learning something new and considering perspectives I had never considered before. very engaging and deals with wide variety of topics\r\nWeaknesses: some weeks we would talk about the same concept/topic as was introduced previously. maybe finding more topics to cover or more different points would be helpful"

                "NO- This class is not going to help you solve the world's environmental problems, and does not encourage action. It is a lecture in which the professor asks for student input, so much of the time in class is spent listening to other students",
                "No, if you want to learn about environmental ethics you're better off taking a philosophy course or an EVST course. This class was very poorly organized, narrow in scope, and un-engaging. I guess if you're looking for a gut or an easy 5th class this might be it, but it felt like a waste of time for me and I was disappointed by the lack of organization or direction in the individual lectures and throughout the semester. It didn't feel like we got anywhere.",

Readings are really interesting but the class really isnt organized to facilitate learning outside of those intense readings.",
                "I would, only if he/she is interested in this particular topic to some extent. I come from a philosophy background and have an interest in environmental issues and very specifically wanted to learn about the philosophical foundations of that.

Professor Latham is super knowledgeable, and the combination of background ethical theory and case studies is effective. Tests arent all that scary and help apply concepts, and the course content is fascinating in general. Environmental studies majors should have an exposure to this side of environmentalism at some point, and this course is generally effective at starting the first steps in that direction.",
                "Environmental majors should take this class",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in Environmental Studies or learning more about ethics. It's a good way to learn about the history of environmentalism and how people's understanding of nature and conservation/preservation has changed over time. It also introduces you to a lot of environmental writers and philosophies from the humanities side of Environmental Studies. Otherwise, this information might not seem relevant but could be a good gut.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. The course content was very interesting and has allowed me to approach environmental discussions from a different perspective.",

                "Yes, this course is a great introduction to the philosophy surrounding environmental issues, and is taught in a suitably beginner-friendly manner. The course addresses directly every topic from traditional ethical theories all the way up to ideas and issues being explored presently.",
                "Yes, but only if you are truly interested in the intersection between both. It can be truly captivating, but the exams are sometimes not incentivizing or feel accurate to what you know.",

                "This was the second time that this course was taught, and although the topics were engaging, a few topics seemed to be repetitive. Examinations were based on students' ability to make philosophical arguments, but this type of writing was not discussed in lecture or in section very much. The lectures themselves were focused on more abstract concepts relating to environmental ethics/issues, similar to Bioethics and Law, but the exams did not reflect the learning well in my opinion. If you are not familiar with philosophy or already have a background in environment, I can see how it can be difficult to take this class because \"novel\" and \"creative\" philosophical arguments are considered for the A range.",

There are many different ideas of what is \"right\" in environmentalism, and it is a good skill to have going forward for just about anyone how/why to judge different actions in different scenarios, as they pertain to climate change and sustainability.",
                "I think this class is so important and I wish I had taken it sooner. For environmental studies students especially, this course laid the groundwork for understanding the challenges in the field and the current proposed solutions. I learned the various factors that go into making solutions/decisions to these issues, and the ethics behind them. Though some of these things were previously intuitive, I found it really helpful to be introduced to structured arguments. I know I will use this information as I move forward in the field. For non-majors, I think this course is still really interesting for considering real-world issues using philosophical arguments. I liked how all the philosophy was tied to real-world problem solving.",
                "Yes! So important to learn about the ethics of everything especially the environment"
