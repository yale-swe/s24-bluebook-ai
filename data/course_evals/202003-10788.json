This course is amazing and teaches you the fundamentals of architecture. The weekly sketchbook assignments help you internalize what you are reading and learning from lecture. These assignments (and later, design projects) helped me understand architectural elements and improve my drawing (not to mention experimenting with different mediums such as charcoal, graphite, and ink).",

                "More often than not, especially with the homework prompts, I felt that this was more of an art course than an architecture course. I wish it was more analytical than abstract.",
                "Strengths: you can get by just fine without doing any of the readings and the assignments were fun to do.\r\n\r\n Weaknesses: there is no grading system. I knew this going in but thought that they would at least give us clues about our standing. They did no such thing (even after the final project, they had nothing to say about where we stood in the class). This means that your TA's will have complete power of your grade and if you are not on their good side then there's no system that you can rely on to ensure that you are being judged based off of your work. Additionally, how this class is organized is that there are lectures and section meetings once a week. Each week, you do an assignment that's discussed in the section. This section is just a time where the TA's openly (and sometimes in a very disrespectful manner), criticize your work. I think this class can be improved by ensuring that these TA's have the appropriate training on giving feedback. Another aspect of this class that does not make sense is that the weekly assignments are completely unrelated to the material covered in lectures and to previous assignments. This means that each week, you start from scratch and figure out what you have to do, then get criticized for it in sections. This made no sense to me at all. They also say that they put improvement into consideration when grading the class and god forbid if you do well early on, you could possibly be doomed for the rest of the semester because you have set the standard too high. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the lectures, they were mostly pictures of different beautiful architectural figures that the professor liked and talked about. We had zoom classes where they played a prerecorded video to us. Because of this, there was NO engagement in the class and their proposed solution to this lack of engagement was to force us all to have our videos on (and we would be marked as absent if we did not have them on throughout). I don't believe that policing us so closely (especially in these times where not everyone has the same access to wifi) was inappropriate. \r\n\r\nNow, onto the biggest weakness of the class, it was extremely American-centric, which is fine. In fact, we sometimes had references from places in South America and Europe as well which is great. However, each time these places were mentioned, the Professor would go deep into where each place is located whereas anytime we had pictures from places in Africa, they were mostly referred to as \"somewhere in Africa.\" I thought this was extremely wrong and hope that it can be corrected for the future versions of this class.",
                "The section was amazing, and the lectures were interesting to listen to.",
                "The lectures truly could not be improved. Professor Purves is one of the most thoughtful, eloquent, and innovative thinkers I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. His approach to architecture really inspires his students to think deeply and question prior assumptions, whether or not they have any previous experience with architecture. \r\nEvery week, students worked on their own drawings and design assignments and submitted them to be reviewed and discussed in section. The biggest weakness of this course was the lack of organization for sections and assignments. The TFs were working hard to do their best to communicate what they knew, but it was clear that assignments were not really planned in advance as much as they could be, and deadlines were not clear until they were much sooner than most classes. But the real issue is that we never received any sort of grades, certainly not by midterm, and not even now (weeks after our final assignment was due). Very late in the semester, right before finals, we got one progress report, but this was after an entire semester of weekly assignments that students all put an immense amount of work into, and they were never graded. We were told that we would hear from our TFs if we were \"struggling\" but that if not, we would not receive grades and should just trust that everything is fine.",
                "Lectures, TA meetings were great, but the lectures felt loosely related to the drawing assignments, but still really enjoyed them.",
                "The strengths of this course include the smaller section meetings with TAs, where you can receive personalized feedback. The only weaknesses of this class pertained to COVID-19 learning practices.",
                "Very calm and interesting class. Material is very interesting and weekly assignments are not too difficult but challenging enough to require observation, creativity, and effort. Fantastic professor. Sections were easy to participate in. It would be great if students were able gauge their grade or progress throughout the course. Some weeks have a big amount of reading, though they are never discussed. Also, it would be nice to see the class look into more non-white and non-male architects.",
                "The course could be more clear on attendance policies and the general logistics on the syllabus. However, the class was wonderfully taught and we were encouraged to collaborate and do independent work. I loved having the opportunity to see the work of other students and I was constantly inspired by the lecture content.",
                "The professor and TAs were great\r\nThe lecture style got a bit repetitive",
                "Strengths: The weekly sections were helpful in keeping track of the course and the professor's lectures were well-organized and thorough. \r\nWeaknesses: No grades were entered into Canvas throughout the entirety of the year, this made it very difficult to track your own grade which frankly is frustrating. The only way to get an inkling on your grades in the class was you would receive an email from a TF if your standing was getting low. Given that we had weekly assignments, it would be very nice to know how we were doing on these.",
                "All of the instructors and Teaching Assistants were very engaged with the course work and were able to provide ample critique and feedback. However, they were very unreceptive of student's circumstances when it came to deadlines and engaging with the course, despite being a difficult semester.",
                "I loved, loved, loved the lectures! The readings were great, though I wish we could have discussed them. Also, I didn't get a single grade back all semester, which was a little bit nerve-racking. And for all but the Plattus guest lectures, I wished we had just gotten more Prof. Purves.",
                "Strengths: interesting material and helpful TFs. Weaknesses: Lack of a clear grading system.",
                "Strengths include the lecturer, who was obviously incredibly knowledgeable, engaging and passionate.",
                "The strengths of this course are the lectures and drawing assignments! The communication with the students about expectations and assignments could be improved, however. Especially with the paper and the sketchbook flip-through-- we had no clue what was required until very close to the due dates which brought a lot of unnecessary stress and frustration.",
                "Strength- our skills were based off the previous week which helped continuous growth. Weakness- final project wasnt related to anything all year",
                "The strengths of this course is basically everything about this course. Professor Purves is dedicated and enthusiastic to architecture, and he truly makes this class a top tier class. Another strength is the practice with looking at architecture and being able to take the details you learn about in lecture and putting them to paper. I really enjoyed the artistic assignments of the sketchbook assignments and design projects. The curriculum is very well thought out, and truly flows together nicely. The only weakness of this course may be the variety of assistance between the TF's. Some TF's helped cultivate students more than others: I wish I got more guidance from my TF's personally.",
                "The course was structured and organized very well. Alec is a wonderful professor, as his lectures were always interesting. The sketch assignments and design problems were also very fun to work on! However, when it comes to section, I wish students received more direct feedback and critique. I felt as if I never really knew what areas I should have been improving on, which was frustrating for each successive sketch assignment.",
                "I enjoyed Professor Purves' teaching style very much - very efficient and thorough. I also enjoyed all the sections and the feedback we had.",
                "Professor Purves is one the greatest strengths of this course. It is a great opportunity to learn from a thoughtful and experienced architect who has traveled the world and uses all his photographs in the lecture. I also think the drawing assignments are a great way for you to learn how to represent architecture on a page by hand, or practice\/improve on drawing skills you may already have."

                "The lectures were excellent, even virtually. There was come confusion about whether students needed to be in attendance synchronously and if so, whether their cameras needed to be turned on at all times, and I would really encourage the instructors to clearly state these expectations at the beginning of the semester. Students cannot be told, past midterm, that they will receive failing grades without their cameras on, with absolutely no knowledge of such a policy. Many earnest, hardworking students had not done so, and this was a very strange complication that felt quite unfair to the students. These complications over grading felt really hard for students, as this course did require many assignments every week, and did not quite follow through in giving feedback until it felt too late, and believe this is symptomatic of the online reformatting.",
                "Not much more could have been done, in my opinion, the Professor and TAs did an incredible job being accommodating to the students and tailoring the assignments and lectures to the students.",
                "They were really strict about attendence considering this was a lecture course. You were marked absent if your camera was off. I don't think that's fair, given that they don't know what people's homes lives are like, plus since the lectures are recorded people could just watch them later.",
                "The lectures are prerecorded, but we must be present in class to watch them. I think the lectures should either be live (recorded for students to review if needed) or prerecorded without the expectation that the students be present during a specific time.",
                "Access to recorded lectures was extremely helpful, especially for students who could not attend the live lectures. However, there was a lack of clarity regarding attendance. At first, I assumed attendance would not be strictly graded, though it was mentioned later that students are required to attend live lectures. It was a bit confusing for students in different time zones who could not attend.",

                "I think the recorded lecture component was the most effective in making this semester less difficult. I appreciated having the opportunity to go back and rewind the lectures; however, the two reviews of the semester were announced a week prior. The short notice could have proved difficult for my schedule, given that the final review was 3 hours.",
                "More one on one check-ins, even if it were to be virtually.",
                "I'm not sure the lectures had to be mandatory (attended synchronously) - there was not much engagement anyways since we were just watching prerecorded lectures anyways. A better format could be to watch the lectures on our own time and then optionally come together to discuss or ask any questions regarding the lectures.",

                "We used a virtual whiteboard called Miro that allowed everyone to look at their group's drawings better, that was a helpful improvement than just using a PDF with everyone's drawings.",
                "I wish that Teaching Assistants, as well as the professor in the future, is a little more lenient when it comes to engaging with the course, especially if its an online semester.",
                "All of it worked! Perhaps we could have gone on a section-wide socially distanced walk?",
                "I believe this class is meant to be taken in an in-person setting, consequently the virtual version of the course often lacked in conversation.",
                "Lectures and online review of our work was very well executed.",
                "Being required to keep our videos on in class felt unnecessary. We're watching a recorded lecture, not participating in a discussion. I'm not sure what keeping our videos on really accomplished? Certainly I can understand being encouraged to keep our cameras on, but sometimes it is unnecessarily uncomfortable or challenging (personally I had a back injury that made it really difficult to sit upright for the whole lecture, but this is definitely more of a challenge for people in other time zones).",
                "Class sections were a huge success.",
                "I really enjoyed using Miro as a pin-up board for our sketchbook assignments, as it made it very helpful to view when one of the TF's was sharing their screen. The pre-recorded lectures often ran over time, but they were more focused than live lectures. However, sometimes the professor would want to ask a question to the students (or we would want to ask a question to the professor), and either the question never gets asked or there is confusion in what it is in reference to.",
                "Online lectures were successful, as they were also posted on Canvas which allowed for future viewing. I would say that online sections could be improved a bit. Maybe the TAs could have been more interactive in teaching us sketching methods and techniques, for example.",
                "The recorded lectures were very helpful for our learning during the pandemic.",
                "I really enjoyed the sketchbook and final reviews, I think the entire teaching staff did a great job adapting those events in the online format."

                "I believe the Architecture department is filled with great people who are very knowledgeable and accomplished within the subject. However, I would not recommend this class. An art class could cover the objective of the assignments, and another architecture or history class could give a better overview of social impacts.",
                "No, please don't take it. I thought it would be a good humanities credit but it wasn't. At least if you decide to take it, make sure you know hwy you are doing it. If it is for a humanities credit\/ good grade\/ low workload just know what price you could be paying. You will not learn much and your grade will be in the hands of someone else who could easily mess it up. Please think hard before making this decision.",
                "Yes! Not too much workload, interesting lectures, amazing sections and TAs. You don't have to draw well. The TAs are very encouraging and nice. People don't tear you apart during reviews\/crits and always try to find a way to compliment you, while still giving you enough feedback for improvement. Students from a diverse background. You don't have to be an art\/arch major.",
                "Yes, it is a great intro course to see whether you want to become an Arch major.",
                "I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in design \/ architecture at all. I took it as a senior and it was one of my favorite lectures at Yale. Alec Purves gives such rich, thoughtful lectures with beautiful slides!",
                "Yes, it was nice to draw.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to other students. It's perfect for those who have a creative background, but don't want to just take an art class. I acquired applicable, real-world knowledge from this course.",
                "Yes, a fantastic introduction to architecture. Kind professor and TFs.",
                "Yes! this class was not related to my major or future career at all but it was so fun and taught me so many helpful new ways to think. 10\/10.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It's a great way to explore the artistic side of Yale, to learn a little about Yale's architectural history and work on your drawing and sketching abilities.",
                "Yes - changed my views of the world Iive in.",
                "I would highly recommend this course! The workload is not high if you do the assignments correctly (you are supposed to constrain yourself and be efficient with drawings - you are rewarded for your design\/drawing choices rather than being good or perfect at them). I had a ton of fun bonding with classmates and our great TAs in section - it was so awesome to see others' perspectives and design\/drawing choices.",
                "Yes for sure especially if you have even a bit of interest in architecture\r\nThis course teaches you a lot",
                "This course is required for the architecture major I believe but for students outside of architecture wanting to get a glimpse into the architecture, this provides a good idea of the thoughts and emotions behind architecture and an extremely basic introduction into drawing. If you're looking for a class that teaches more how to build a building or the more mathematical or engineering side, or how to draw buildings, I would suggest looking at other classes.",
                "I would recommend this course to those who plan to pursue Architecture professionally.",
                "Absolutely. I love buildings, and I already knew I did, but even if I didn't, this class would make me.",
                "Yes! I learned so much and really enjoyed class!",
                "Yes",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! This course truly was a miracle this semester, as it inspired me to do more artistic stuff during the semester, which I missed during my four years at Yale. Truly a great class for anyone in any year (except first-years, who cannot take it ). I loved the sketchbook assignments, the design projects, and all the discussion sections showing off our work. It also inspired a more architectural interest in me, and I look forward to taking two more architecture classes my last semester!",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Even if you're not majoring in architecture, this course is a great introduction to different buildings\/spaces, and how they serve us. You learn about why certain styles came to be, and you certainly gain an immense appreciation for architecture, as it is everywhere and simply unavoidable.",
                "Yes! This was the perfect introductory course to architecture.",
                "Yes, if you have any interest in architecture even if you don't plan on majoring in it."
