The way the course was taught encouraged students to stay on top of the material with weekly quizzes that were low stress (much appreciated!), but also encouraged connection of topics week to week. Between comparing different model organisms or putting together larger pathways between different concepts studied, the insight gained into developmental biology was great.",

                "A strength of the course was the historical tour through foundational experiments to demonstrate the original questions, observations, and conclusions as a background for why the subjects like Spemann's Organizer are discussed. \r\n\r\nA  weakness of the course the focus/reliance on memorizing a list of signaling molecules. From the student's perspective, it's seldom clear what the significance and function are, especially since many are involved in multiple pathways. This might be helped if there were a reference sheet in the course with an overview of the critical ones to remember.",
                "A lot of the information was so in depth that it seemed impossible to memorize and was extremely unnecessary. The material seemed interesting though.",
                "The content is very interesting. However, the grading of exams is extremely harsh, and it can be unclear what instructors want out of students. It reached the point where I felt that regardless of level of preparation or mastery of the material, I didn't feel confident taking the test. Even if I felt good about all my answers, I never knew how it would be graded. I enjoyed learning about the material very much, but the exams were extremely discouraging.",
                "Strengths: not much day-to-day work besides preparing for weekly quizzes and studying for exams; material was rather interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there was a LOT of memorization in preparation for the exams; not as applicable to human development as I was expecting",
                "Strengths is the depth of the material, you learn a lot about the developmental process. Weaknesses included struggling to understand and dissect the most important concepts from the lectures to know for the exam. There was so much material that it was difficult to condense everything for the exams.",
                "This course has many strengths. Professor Scott Holleys lectures are particularly impactful since they are clear, logical, present information at a measured pace in an understandable way. The course is extremely well taught and that TAs only make the job of learning easier. \r\n\r\nThere are few weaknesses I can identify and most of them come from the experience of being a student rather than anything I can say about the course or people. Some lectures were confusing, sometimes I didnt get everything down in my notes, but this isnt really a problem with the course.",
                "it was organized",
                "The strengths were really comprehensive lectures, and the fact that they were recorded. The recordings enabled review of the lectures that were long and very dense in terms of material, so it was very helpful to have. Additionally, the quizzes encouraged students to stay on top of the material in a manageable and relatively low stress way. The biggest weakness was the lack of feedback outside quizzes. I think since COVID meant exams were often administered at varying times, not knowing performance was tough, though the material was relatively exam specific and didn't really impact preparation for the next.",
                "strengths:\r\nContent is very interesting, Scott Holley is an amazing professor and his lectures are engaging\r\nweaknesses:\r\nExams could be brutal at times, Prof. Kankel is a less engaging professor and because there are no slides for his lectures, that material is very difficult to study for especially if you end up missing a lecture",

The studies we do/did, the questions we ask/asked, the logic we use, all in the context of understanding how organisms develop across so many life paths. This is a beautiful course.",

                "Yes! I think this course is hard because there is a lot of material covered that is very detailed. However, I think it was well organized and so interesting. If you are interested in the biological sciences it is a must take, the material and professors were engaging and all the topics are so relevant to the clinical field. Especially in the age of huge development in biotech, understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with development, as well as the experiments done to find answers that have changed the field, is huge asset to anyone hoping to move on in this field.",
