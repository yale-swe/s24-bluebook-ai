From geoengineering to evaluating IPCC reports, to conservation efforts, origin stories from a wide range of indigenous cultures, and more, this class was very eye-opening.",

Through the readings and discussion, my preconceptions about nature and the ways humans engage with nature were challenged. I questioned the underlying assumptions I and other scientists have had about the environment, and learned to more clearly articulate my opinions on such topics. I was provided with many different perspectives through the coursework, and my writings skills were also further developed."

                "Strengths- the in-class questions were very engaging and thought provoking. The workload was also very reasonable and allowed for enough time to develop our own perspectives on the readings in time for class.\r\n\r\nWeakness-I wish we didn't rush through the close-reading of the books covered in class. I felt there was a lot more to breakdown that we didn't have time for.",
                "This course introduced me to a variety of environmental humanities readings, including those from indigenous groups that I had never been exposed to before. The readings pushed my understanding of these topics in new ways. One weakness of the course was the limited style of assignments that we completed. I would have liked to write reading responses each week with a certain direction or instruction.",
                "This class was very strong in discussions, readings, and the progression of topics. It was also a very warm and welcoming learning environment. Perhaps the only thing I would improve would be the guidance for the close reading paper, with maybe more time to practice close reading in class.",
                "I felt that that this class was the most well-organized to facilitate student learning -- the challenge of assigning the right amount of work, such that the topics were engaging and rich but not overwhelming, was met, and in fact this course exemplified what a good syllabus should be for me. The readings were a manageable length and always brought in something new each class. I also loved the varying forms of media, including essays, movies, plays, and more. Because there are no pre-reqs, however, students could definitely be on different pages in terms of background knowledge, but I found that this brought interesting perspectives to the classrooms. Having taken a decent amount of environmental courses, I did feel that I was better able to offer insights/opinions -- maybe I would recommend this course to older students. We had reading responses due each week, which I think were good for promoting thoughtful reading, but seemed a little disjointed from the classroom. On the other hand, our paper topics were tied in very intentionally. Perhaps there could be other small assignments that would be more engaging."

This course pulls together many different perspectives and disciplines to allow for productive discussions of climate change. If you are not confident in your ability to contribute to conversations due to lack of knowledge, this course will guide you and show how many different backgrounds can be important to the class discussions.",
                "Absolutely! The class readings felt meaningful yet manageable to digest, and Professor Lindskog breaks down the complex topics discussed in class in such a clarifying way.",
                "Absolutely. This class will force you to deeply critique all of your pre-held conceptions about what being a \"good environmentalist\" looks like, or even what \"the environment\" means, and how we should relate to it. These are not just academic questions - you will walk away with an understanding of the profound implications of these questions as societies make critical decisions for development and future action in the face of the climate crisis.",

                "I loved this course so much, and as a senior, could easily say it was my favorite course at Yale. Students in this class seemed to really thoroughly digest the material through the discussions, and always had something interesting to say. Furthermore, students were constantly referencing previous classes' readings, a sign of consistent engagement and a reflection on the quality/organization of the assigned work. A warm and personal classroom environment was established via check ins at the start of every class, which made everyone much friendlier and more willing to participate. I always looked forward to attending this class and doing the readings! I felt like I received a very comprehensive education on the environmental humanities, and left with a new foundation/lens for environmental science. I think anyone interested in the environment, from any perspective, would benefit from this class, since we challenged basic assumptions and discussed the environment from so many different angles/mediums."
