This class helped me develop personal taste regarding other short stories, practice giving feedback on others' work, and knowledge about where to begin when I'm trying to write my own story.",
                "I learned how to closely examine short stories in order to see how writers developed characters, plot, structure, and vivid descriptions. I took these observations and learned how to implement them in my own writing. By the end of the course, I completed a full short story inspired by one of the readings earlier in the course.",

Not a flaw of the course, just my own attention span. Michael lets us sit outside in the warmer weeks, which absolutely helps a lot.",
                "The course was strongest when we got to debate about whether we felt a story worked -- my favorite stories we read in class were the most controversial. I think it would be good to lean into that, reading more unconventional stories or works that have been publicly criticized.",
                "This course is absolutely fantastic, a highlight of my time at Yale. Its strengths lie in the professor's insightful teaching, the choice of stories we read for inspiration, and a collaborative and welcoming environment of students. It would have been nice to submit a draft of our short stories earlier on in the semester in order to produce a more polished second draft, but that is my only recommendation.",
                "The structure of the course -- writing exercises that lead to writing a full story -- was a huge strength. I appreciated the time to get my bearings before jumping in. The reading list was fantastic, and the workshops were very helpful. The only improvement I could think of would be having a revision -- there's obviously not time during the semester, but it might have been nice to have a revision due during finals period so that we could implement the workshop advice.",
                "Prof Cunningham is incredibly kind and personable. He holds weekly office hours for his students and will always send you additional materials to read and discuss. The other students in this class were also engaged and talented writers (but that shouldn't discourage someone from applying to the course). However, there was a noticeable lack of diversity in the class. Every single student was white, which I thought was the one true draw-back of this course. We did not have a variety of perspectives when discussing the works, and certainly not the works that dealt with topics of race."

If you have any interest in learning to write fiction, to improve your writing quality, and read fantastic short stories, take this class. I was nervous to take this class since I'm not an English major, but it was a good mix of English and non-English majors. Almost everyone in the class was new to writing fiction, so we were all at a similar level to start.",
