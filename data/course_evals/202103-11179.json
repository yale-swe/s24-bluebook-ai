Overall, while my level of Russian is still painfully basic (which is on me) I feel like I have a more solid grasp on the key concepts. In class, there was a lot of emphasis on reading aloud and practicing dialogues, which I found extremely helpful. I am able to read more quickly and understand sentences better now."

                "I wish the textbook included more explicit explanations of grammar, if I missed a single day of class it was hard to catch up because most grammatical subjects were discussed verbally",
                "I liked the short quizzes before big unit tests that we had at the start of the term. I also really appreciated the listening comprehension exercises, especially on grammar. Prof Dolgova is really kind and receptive to feedback and is always more than happy to talk to you after class/answer questions. I never felt stupid asking a question in class as she reviews and explains the concepts. I thought that grading was incredibly generous and constructive, focusing on allowing you to learn and pick up the concepts (e.g. I dont think they double-penalise mistakes. They also go through key mistakes in class, which is really helpful!) Finally, I really appreciated Prof Dolgova recording and letting us identify our own mistakes in the oral. I found it very instructive and extremely useful to hear yourself speak Russian.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that it wasnt always clear when/what homework should be submitted. This was especially when a unit test came 2-3 days after the official set of 9 homework worksheets had been completed. The class didnt always do the same worksheets at the same time, with some completing it earlier or later. There was a similar problem with knowing when tests (especially oral tests) would be. These didnt bother me much. Although a little clarity might have helped with planning, I dont think it really affected my learning much."
