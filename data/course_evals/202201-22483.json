            "comments": [
                "Strengths: easy A\r\nWeaknesses: no learning occurs. The ratio of time spent working on this class:physics material learned is abysmal. Lecture is incoherent. The textbook is too sparse for an intro physics course. No feedback given over the span of the course, almost no grades were submitted.",
                "Very unorganized course and the teaching structure is very poor.",
                "We didn't get a lot of our graded materials back so didn't know what we had in the class for a long time. Prof Sweeney was very understanding with covid and having to miss class so adjusted policies accordingly",
                "Very clear instructor communication in lecture; good feedback in grading. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Recitation consistently had confusion where it seemed the TAs were unfamiliar with the problem and weren't certain in how to approach it.",
                "More timely grading - we were taking exams that featured questions from quizzes that we never got feedback on, so I made the same mistakes twice without knowing any better. Also, as a student coming in with no background in physics, I lacked a conceptual understanding of almost every topic we covered, and didn't feel like I gained any of that from the lectures OR the textbook. That made most of the course feel like I was just doing math problems that were best solved via memorization.",
                "Strengths: the TFs were extremely helpful in solidifying my understanding of the content covered in lecture, and I found that the problem set questions were well-set up to get students accustomed to those concepts and related formulas by increasing the difficulty from the warm-up to the integrated problems.\r\nWeaknesses: I found myself having to teach myself much of the material; besides this, I would have appreciated that the recitation problems have more clear-cut solutions as the abstract ones made it difficult to study for the weekly quizzes.",
                "The course is very disorganized. The TFs are quite unfamiliar with the material although these material should be basic for them.",
                "Strengths -- the organization of the second semester of the introductory physics sequence for the life sciences was better organized than the first semester to facilitate student learning. Midterms were fair and recitation problems were generally engaging/interesting. The final exam being optional was also a great aspect of the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - grades were not returned to students (especially quizzes) within a timely manner, making it challenging to study for midterm exams.",
                "I felt that the topics covered in this semester of the introductory physics sequence were much more applicable to the physics lab sequence than those we covered in PHYS 170. Professor Sweeney taught each lecture very well, and I appreciated the increased frequency of board lectures (vs. lectures taught using slides). While there is an additional level of convenience associated with using lecture slides, board lectures are better for pacing and student comprehension as we are able to follow along with the professor in real time. \r\n\r\nThe reading responses and recitation problems were helpful this semester, though I found the textbook difficult to navigate due to its heavy use of lengthy equation derivations without explicit indications of which final equations should be used. A simpler textbook (or chapter summary) would be beneficial. Lastly, the coordination between TAs and the professor was decreased this semester relative to last semester, and feedback on our assignments was often delayed or missing entirely. This made it difficult to gauge our understanding of the material. A more efficient grading system is essential for future renditions of this course.",
                "The strengths were the multiple opportunities to be evaluated/to reinforce concepts. The weaknesses were the lack of communication from the professors and TAs, particularly the lack of grades after the midterm.",
                "This class was such a mess, since the fall\r\nPeople went to the DUS and chair of physics department, not much changed \r\nNo true information/knowledge was gained \r\nThis class really needs work!",
                "The strengths are the ability to get participation grades, the weaknesses are the lack of physics knowledge gained for the class. I never received a single grade back after the first midterm which made the second midterm very difficult to study for as well as never receiving any grades back for the problem sets.",
                "strength: \r\n- problem solving , recitations were very helpful. I learnt the most during these sessions, from my team mates. \r\n-psets graded for completion was really good because i was able to try out questions and bravely make mistakes to learn. this was especially important given i have never taken physics prior to this in high sch or college.\r\n\r\nweakness: \r\n- there are no answer keys for anything, so we can't actually verify our understanding. I learn from being able to look at worked solutions, so hopefully this will be done in future cohorts.",
                "Professor Sweeney is great and the content is very interesting, but at times, the course was in dire need of better organization and more transparency.",
                "The course was very well-organized and had a consistent schedule that ensured that all the physics concepts were properly understood and practiced on a weekly basis, which certainly aided in obtaining a clear understanding of the physics concepts, especially as the course progressed and new lessons built on previous ones."

I would've switched after 170 had I felt I learned enough physics in that course to switch to 181, but I didn't feel that my background was sufficient. 171 may be easier grade-wise (depending on who's teaching, this will surely be the case if Prof Sweeney is running the course)",

                "No, but this is most likely a class you have to take. If nothing else, you can get a good routine down by going to office hours to do the problem sets, memorizing the problems from recitation for the quizzes, and then writing those problems down on your note sheet for exams. It's very very possible to do well in this course, but don't expect to learn too much physics along the way.",

The biological applications explored in this course are interesting, but they do not always generalize well. That being said, PHYS 171 does follow a more typical physics curriculum than PHYS 170, and the lectures are helpful for navigating corresponding labs in PHYS 166L.",

                "Yes, if it was better organized. Professor Sweeney is lovely and cares about students genuinely learning.",
                "Its a really well set up class for premeds hoping to fulfill their requirement. All very fair grading and lots of opportunities to do well.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student as it teaches fundamental physics concepts in an interesting and intriguing manner and utilizes real-world scenarios to aid in understanding the lessons that are taught. Additionally, it integrates many biological concepts with physics lessons."
