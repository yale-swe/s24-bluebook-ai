Perhaps because of the temporal range covered by the syllabus readings, our discussions sometimes focused also on the intersections between a given text and the culture (of readership, etc.) into which it enters."

In my senior spring, it was my third of three Tuesday classes, back-to-back with another 1h50m seminar, and it ended after 5:00 PM. I could name the (many) specific strengths of the course, but perhaps I say more by mentioning that I left the class, each week, feeling rejuvenated and excited."
