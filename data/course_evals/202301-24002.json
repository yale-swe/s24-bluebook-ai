                "This course could be really fantastic if the professor chooses to teach it again. However, In its current iteration, the first month or two of the course was pretty rough due to a combination of bad readings and bad discussions. On the readings side of things, I think Frankenstein and Klara and the Sun are actually poor choices for the class. They were by far the least engaging pieces of writing we looked at, and I think the time could be better spent examining the other texts on the syllabus more closely or replacing them with something else. Likewise, I think that Avatar is a poor choice for this class, as it is a fairly stupid action movie. Turning to the discussions, I felt that the discussions in the first part of the course were consistently lackluster for two main reasons. First, I think that the professor's choice to have student-led discussions created a worse experience more often than not, and that we would have been better off with him leading it. Also, Discussions improved markedly when he made us put our electronic devices away during them, but this change wasn't made till the last few weeks. Third, I think that the discussions could be improved by making them more technically oriented, as students would regularly make claims that were disprovable by existing evidence, but that were taken as arguable due to the noninclusion of more technical sources.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the latter part of the course, I think the potential of what this class could be really shown through. This is in large part due to the syllabus. The Overstory is probably the greatest book I have ever read, and Story of Your Life\/Arrival is also incredible. The one caveat to this is that I think The Overstory is a challenging text to approach in an academic setting, as it is so mind-bogglingly vast, and so special care needs to be taken as to how to structure conversations about it. Also, as mentioned above, discussions were really good when they were electronics-free and led by the professor.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the assignments. I think that the essay prompts for this class were probably the hardest essay prompts I have ever been asked to respond to. They were often overly complex and had stipulations that limited my ability to think deeply about the subject at hand. I would encourage the professor to spend some time looking over the prompts in order to make them more approachable and intellectually enriching.",
                "This course meaningfully improved throughout the course of the semester. As soon as we started having classes with laptops closed, the difference was night and day. While having student-led discussions was interesting, it caused classes to be very hit-or-miss depending on how organized the students running that particular day were  some days were incredible, like when the whole class was split into two groups arguing for and against a topic, and some days were dull. If the professor planned the discussions for next year, there might be more consistency.",
                "Great media selection, lots of opportunities for leadership and groupwork",
                "I think many of the essay prompts in this class made little to no sense to me as they used a great deal of non-absolute language and were oftentimes too broad to be able to execute properly.",
                "Strengths of this class include: very high engagement, very interesting subject material, low workload, eager classmates, a delightful humanities class. A potential weakness of this class would come from the student itself. If you are one who does not like to participate in class discussion or talks, then you would not be making the most of this course. To improve this, I suggest signing up for this class with the intention of participating actively.",
                "This course had little to no weaknesses.  There was a lot of reading and work outside of the classroom, but it was all interesting and made the class discussions amazing.  I loved getting to know my classmates and diving deep into each book we read together.  It was just a fantastic class in general.",
                "I really enjoyed the books that are in the courses curriculum. The in-class discussions were also very engaging. While reading the books, the readings could be quite long and take a while to finish.",
                "Classes were not as dynamic as I would have preferred. While the conversations were interesting, I sometimes felt like the class did not emphasize them. The wiring prompts also seemed somewhat constrictive sometimes."

The main thing this course has going for it is great readings and films to enjoy, and being surrounded by a bunch of other first-years to discuss those texts.",

You will develop a greater understanding for other life forms and our role with them. You will be able to question and assess humans and how your own life may plays a part in others. This is a great humanities class that adds touches of philosophy to help you question what it means to be human.",
                "Yes. Favorite class of all time.",
                "Yes, the content was so unique and important in this time of technological growth.  We learned to love nature and be wary of AI.",
