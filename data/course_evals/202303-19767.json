                "This was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Alex is an amazing teacher and dedicated equal effort to teaching and letting us create. It was super enjoyable, really helped me experiment with my creativity, and taught me a lot about the history of printing making",
                "Despite already having spent a semester doing silkscreen through an abroad program, I learned 10x the skills in this class. Not only did we learn about the basics of silkscreen printing and how each part of the process can affect the outcome (screen mesh size, type of paint, size of reference image, etc.) but we also got to learn different styles of printing (index color vs. cmyk), techniques (split fountain, overprinting), in addition to the field trips we took to the YUAG and the Haas Collections Library. Aside from the amazing skills and wide range of topics we discussed, I absolutely loved the fact that we had roughly 4 projects, each that let us explore something different: first printing with a larger group\/collaboratively coming up with a design, printing with a partner, CMYK printing, and then the option to do a textile print or keep working on whatever technique intrigued us most from the semester. Finally, I loved that this class was half undergrad, half grad students. The size and mix of the two student types made for such a rich environment for learning and feedback, allowing us undergrads to form working relationships with grad students and vice-versa.",
                "Basics of silkscreen printing, including how to do digital color seperations, ink mixing, different exposing and printing techniques, and printing on different surfaces. The artists visits and class field trips to Haas were really awesome and inspiring, and Alex is a great professor who always has good feedback for his students. The assignments are very self-directed, so you get as much as you put in. As an undergrad, it was also really nice to work with the MFAs (they made up about half the class) and get their feedback on my work during crit :)"

                "The strength of the course is the ability to direct your entire relationship to the course. The more you buy in, the more the course will give you. The only weakness would be the constraint of time--you have to get the work done during class time and monitor hours in the print studio, but this is not really even a constraint unless you want to spend 8+ hours on the course each week.",
                "This class was such a joy! Despite some challenges in the studio delaying some projects, I think we had the perfect number of projects throughout the semester that each covered different techniques. Alex is a great teacher and there was a good balance of learning and doing in the class. The only weakness is one semester isn't enough honestly.",
                "Strengths: range of techniques\/styles learned, time spent looking at art collections to further our knowledge of different printing types\/artists, carefully crafted project topics that were open-ended while allowing for structure (e.g. had to print with a partner, experiment with CMYK or index color, try printing on new types of paper\/textiles, etc.), flexibility with deadlines (especially when the vaccuum on the light table or the sink needed maintenance), the overall collaborative energy of the class, and, finally, the fact that Alex organized various visiting artist-type sessions for us, whether it was talking to a printmaker, making paper from scratch, or learning about monoprinting from a group of visiting artists. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: time! That is something entirely uncontrollable, but I just wish we had more time together! This was by far one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "More monitor hours\/open studio time during finals would have been nice, but other than that the course is awesome."

                "150%. Even if you've never tried silkscreen, never done any type of printmaking, or even have no art background whatsoever, I still encourage you to take this class if printmaking is something you're interested in. The creative process of coming up with an idea, separating it into the right layers\/learning about how to create the right matrix out of your idea, printing it onto a screen, and then printing is a labor of love and learning. I fell in love with screenprinting more than I ever thought possible, and I recommend this class to anyone who wants time to hone their craft\/love of screenprinting further."
