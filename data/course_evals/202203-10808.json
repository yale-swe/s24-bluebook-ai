When we had midterms, we also had psets that same week and it made it incredibly stressful to study for the exam",
                "The strengths of this course is that it is designed in a way where material builds upon each other.",
                "Oftentimes, our class felt behind other sections of the same course and we had to rely heavily on peer tutors to help us navigate the material. This class was taught at a very fast pace compared to what I have heard from other sections, and it felt as though the book was regurgitated to us each class. I felt that I had to teach the material to myself as opposed to having someone teach it to me.  Sometimes, the material had to be retaught to us from the tutors as it appeared concepts were presented to us incorrectly and at times, was just wrong. I don't think our instruction was particularly strong, however, I felt the problem sets were definitely helpful tools to see what I did and did not understand from class. I don't think we had enough time in class to engage with example problems that we would see on the assignments.",
