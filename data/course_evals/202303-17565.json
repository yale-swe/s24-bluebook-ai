                "I learned about a lot of American history that was breezed over or not taught in high school. I developed critical thinking skills and some writing skills from the clear and in depth feedback on assignments. This course challenges popular narratives of US history and examines why those narratives are the ones in the public eye.",
                "GREAT survey of US empire -  most of which you probably haven't learned about in K-12 (Filipino-American War, lavender scare, occupation in Puerto Rico, thanksgiving protests... covers the foundation of the American empire to now... but somehow manages to go deep in each module!  \r\n\r\nYou also learn to write a college paper, analyze primary sources.",
                "I learned how to look for agency, bias, and important details in old texts and how to relate them to current issues and what makes an American.",
                "In this course, I learned about different perspectives on what a true American looks like throughout history. I learned how to critically analyze historical texts and understand the perspective of the text's author and their motivation for writing the piece.",
                "This class zoomed in on notable moments in American history that in some way considered the question, \"What Makes an American?\" Some of these were events I was already familiar with from HS history (e.g. Chinese Exclusion Act, 9/11)  in 031, I studied these with more depth and/or from different angles than I was used to  but many topics were completely new to me (American Indian Movement, desegregation \"busing\"). We read sources before each class (anywhere from one to three hours of reading) and engaged in biweekly (as in twice a week) Socratic seminars on the texts. There were also a few writing assignments, all relatively chill, that allowed me to understand what it meant to write for a history class.\r\n\r\nI walked away from the class with a nuanced understanding of American history, esp as it relates to nat'l identity. Specifically, I realized how deeply engrained white supremacy is in our nation's core identity.",
                "This course provides a thorough examination of \"American Identity\" and what it has meant to be \"American\" at various points of U.S. history. I learned how  to meaningfully engage with peers in a seminar-style format. It was clear since the beginning of the class that this type of discussion is a skill that must be developed, and we remained mindful of that objective throughout the semester. We learned how to effectively craft historical arguments through writing, discussing, and producing a public-facing work for our final project. Finally, we learned how to thoroughly conduct peer-review, which I found to be one of the most useful skills that has not been highlighted in the other classes I have taken.",
                "By taking this course, I developed my historical analysis skills and my ability to articulate my thoughts and contribute to conversation in a seminar setting. This course allowed me to evaluate primary and secondary sources that were presented in many different mediums and use that evaluation to approach the course questions and main ideas. This class encouraged me to voice my opinions and developed my ability to engage in a productive conversation, building on others' thoughts and questions. It also improved my writing abilities with constructive feedback from Professor Akiboh and my peers. It illuminated the nuance and complexity behind studying history, and thus also explored historiography and the value of seeing how we study history.",

                "Strengths: Professor Akiboh is knowledgeable, passionate, an very understanding with deadlines. Many of the sources are extremally interesting and lead to the conversations with classmates being deep and thoughtful.  The seminar is very well mediated. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the sources are very long and repetitive",
                "AMAZING writing credit, very manageable course load for first-years with a lot of support from the professor. Discussions will open your eyes. I am so glad I took this course in my first semester! To me, the best way to learn about US history, most of which happens overseas in colonies and occupied territories whose histories continental Americans often go their entire lives without knowing.",
                "Strengths: hits a wide and important variety of subjects in US history\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of reading that seemed unmanageable.",
                "This course had very engaging and relevant readings. I think what made the class special, however, was the group discussions during class and the sharing of our takeaways from the reading.",
                "The readings can be long sometimes but are almost always engaging enough to make them worth it. + you end up touching on nearly all of the sources during the in-class discussions, which are also very engaging. I am a rather shy person, so I sometimes found it difficult to find an opening in the discussion to state my contribution. This is more of a personal issue though lol, and I feel I got better at it over the course of the semester.",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. Organized incredibly well - We had access to all of our readings since the beginning of the semester, our projects were explained with plenty of advanced notice, each assignment had a clearly outlined objective, and each class session was well-structured.\r\n2. *Very* lenient deadlines\r\n3. Great sources - the readings were very interesting, relevant to the topic, and were a phenomenal for prompting in-class discussion\r\n4. Diverse array of projects - Ranged from argumentative briefs to creating our own lesson plan for U.S. Identity today to creating a public-facing work, and more\r\n5. Thorough and precise feedback - Not only did we receive incredible feedback on each assignment with clear ways on how to improve, we also received equally thorough feedback whenever we reached out for help for preliminary ideas on our assignments.\r\n6. Mindful of different historical terminologies that might reinforce harmful ideas (i.e. slave vs. enslaved person)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nn/a",
                "Strengths- interesting readings, good classroom atmosphere, coursework actually helps and isnt just busy work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- this is probably the same with every seminar but there are some show offs that talk just to talk. Thankfully, we are graded are quality over quantity.",
                "I believe that this course offered a very interesting look on American history and highlighted various topics that are extremely relevant to understanding our country's modern day social  and political climate. A weakness for this course would be the lack of communication regarding expectations for assignments, as I found that the rubric often did not reflect what the instructor felt were factors in receiving a better grade."

                "I would highly recommend this course Prof Akiboh is amazing and the format of the class makes making friends in the class easy. As more of a STEM person this class has been by far the best history class I ever have taken relevant, informative, and focused on ideas and conversation rather than memorization. The conversations are interesting and you can get by while very loosely skimming many of the longer sources as long as you come prepared with ideas to talk about.",
                "YES. HIGHLY recommended for anyone interested in history (fills in the gaps you may have from school regarding US empire) or who wants a writing credit but also to do history simultaneously. TAKE THIS COURSE (I know everyone says it, but it's TRUE!) \r\n\r\nGORGEOUS writing credit. Just make sure to ask for her feedback on your thesis/outline BEFORE you write essays for her.",
                "YES! This was such an interesting life that made me question some misconceptions I was taught earlier in life.",
                "I definitely would because this course provides a perspective of American history that is not traditionally covered. In addition, I would recommend that all students take this course because it forces us to consider what new version of American identity we can conceive of in order to unify our country going into the future.",
                "Yes, absolutely. It opened my eyes to the vastness of American history (you realize just how much gets left out of standard curricula, perhaps due to malice, perhaps due to the fact that there is simply too much history to be able to cover it all) & Prof. Akiboh is a great professor who loves her job & cares about your learning experience.",
                "YES!! If you find U.S. history and identity interesting, or even if you have never taken a U.S. History course, I HIGHLY recommend this class. You will be taken into fascinating and impactful moments in U.S. history, and even if you have learned about these historical moments before, I can guarantee that this class will help you challenge and refine your understanding of them. The in-class conversations are engaging and well-mediated, and this class will help improve your skills well beyond your knowledge of U.S. history (critical thinking, evaluating different sources identifying potential bias, writing clearly, conducting peer review, and much much more).",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because it serves as an effective transition for first year students to feel comfortable in college seminar courses. Not only that, the course material is engaging and prompts interesting conversations about the history of our nation and its negative past. This course allows students to improve their writing, speaking, and historical analysis skills in a comfortable setting with compelling sources.",
                "YES!! Very interesting course, you learn so much not just from the readings but also from fellow classmates!"
