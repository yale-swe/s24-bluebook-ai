Because of the small class size and discussion-based structure, there is always opportunity to ask questions or contribute to the class dialogue. The homework sets and reflection tasks are designed to encourage you to connect the material to your own life. I didn't feel that the class had any notably weaknesses. Maybe the technology week could have been moved closer to the end of the semester, around the time when we started thinking about the final project."

Although it is probably helpful to have been introduced to some concepts in linguistics, you certainly do not have to have taken a linguistic course to appreciate the studies covered in class, especially because Professor Burns elaborates on them with examples in non-academic contexts. If you are at all interested in how linguistic variation arises, how linguistic variation indexes social meaning, language and gender, linguistic profiling, code-switching, etc., you should take this course.",
                "Yes! This course is fascinating and not taught often at Yale, so if you have the opportunity to take it, definitely do so.",
                "The content you cover in this class is super interesting, and it's great to learn about what linguistic research actually looks like. I would highly recommend this class, except that the work is VERY backloaded. I would expect to spend a LOT of time working on your final project."
