                "I learned alott about the rood causes of illness in people of low SES.  We learned about the negative effects racism has on health.  we learned how low SES permeates all aspects of health.= as well as  upstream and down stream solutions,  we learned how industry abuses low SES communities for financial gain",
                "Loved the videos and discussions on racism and how it permeates through society. \r\nI learned how to discuss social issues in a more academic way",
                "I now have a solid understanding of the social determinants of health.",
                "General understanding of social determinants of health",
                "critical thinking",
                "Learned so many new concepts that i have personally noted but not been able to see in a formal way.  Especially about disparities and racism.",
                "1) Understand health equity and social justice research in the context of public health research, practice, policy, and intervention.\r\n2)Learned how structural bias, social inequities and racism undermine health and create challenges to achieving health equity at organizational, community and societal levels.\r\n3)Understand relevant social and behavioral science theory and methods and be able to apply them to design studies to assess the influence of social and structural determinants of health.\r\n4) Aware of neighborhood Influences on Health.",
                "This course has provided insightful knowledge about health disparities and how socioeconomic status plays role in health. Through various models and practical examples it become easier to understand the concepts. Various factors like racism, equality, justice, place etc that are linked with population health and their consequences on low income population have been very well described in this course.",
                "How the injustices faced by minorities in re health go much deeper and wider than inequality in the access to medical services. They affect all aspects of life, beginning at birth and affect the course of lives \r\nThe need to overcome silence, shame, stigma is central to addressing many illnesses and and should be a focus of any intervention\r\nThe lectures about how to go about doing a study to focus on the person as well as the data left a lasting impression",
                "social determinants of health, extent of stigma, critically evaluating research/studies",
                "In this class I learned how to conduct, assess, and incorporate research into social determinants of health in the public health context. Coming from an advocacy background, many of the principles and perspectives we discussed were familiar, but the readings, lectures and discussions gave me new insights into how social science methods support public health work. I learned how to measure the key social determinants of health and how to connect various determinants to one another, as well as how to factor them into epidemiologic study. I also learned about the science that explains the impact of stress as a pathway for determinants of population and community health.",
                "Conceptualise SBS in health",
                "I think my most important learning from this course was that health is impacted by upstream factors that are outside the invidious immediate control. Delving deeper into these upstream determinants of health was very interesting and helped me reframe my thinking around health disparities.",
                "I found this course to be a helpful review of concepts I learned in undergrad several years ago.",
                "How to develop qualitative studies.",
                "I gained knowledge in social determinants of health, health disparities and socioeconomic and psychologic determinants of health. I found this course very eye opening and interesting.",
                "I have a loose understanding of what the role of social and behavioral sciences is in the study of public health, but don't feel I know how to apply what I've learned outside of the academic setting.",
                "I developed insights into challenges to achieving health equity, developed an appreciation for social determinants of health, learned about the physical and psychological health impacts of stigma, bias and structural racism; qualitative and quantitative research to study population health; gained an understanding of barriers to equitable care and the significance of social capital/cohesion as well as levels of needs assessment and intervention including methods to designing policy and intervention; and the tools to better articulate what I learned",
                "Overall framework and concepts on SES. Good understanding of the drivers of health disparities.",
                "I am very much interested in upstream changes in public health, this is the word I learnt in class and made me more resolute on this kinda approach.\r\n\r\nWhen much discussion happened on racism and the sheer inequity I was surprised, as it was a new perspective for me where in India we have caste but the inequity is more on socio economic terms. Reading the class paper on the types of soils analogy for fascism and the reasons for continuing the institutional racism was insightful.\r\n\r\nThe socioeconomic factors and their evaluation based on the topic of interest and also the stigma and behavioural response of the population at study was very fascinating.",
                "I learned about basic concepts of SBS, about SES, and about some models.",
                "I gained an extraordinary and  deeper grasp of the social and behavioral determinants of health in this course.   Dr. Ransome is an extraordinary scholar and instructor who provided an exceptional overview of large scale dynamics as they relate to health disparities in the USA and elsewhere.  I learned new concepts like allostatic load, \"upstream and downstream\" interventions, and the role that policy and government could play in promoting greater health for all.  The insights about health disparities gained in this course have favorably changed my outlook on public health to the extent that I now want to pursue the social and behavioral determinants of health tract during my MPH studies at Yale.",
                "- Knowledge about relevant theories and models in SBS\r\n- Real life examples (readings, papers, videos) enhanced the learning experience\r\n- Op-ed writing and relevance \r\n- Materials shared classmates offered great pieces of knowledge too\r\n- Group discussion\r\n- Safe spaces : respectful, non-judgemental, inclusion for all"

These actions nicely supplemented the materials being covered in class, and yielded greater clarity of concepts being covered overall.   Lastly, I began to read the American Public Health Association's resource materials more rigorously overall.",
