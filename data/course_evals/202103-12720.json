Understanding environmental mismatch and tradeoff as key lenses through which both biological and cultural evolution influence how medical professionals look at disease. Drawing reaction norms and SOAP notes. Questioning What is a Disease? What is a Patient?",

Our discussions of the evolutionary underpinnings of communicable and non-communicable diseases provided key insights into both the biological, social, and societal determinants of health."

                "This class necessitates high engagement. There really isn't a way to get away with not doing the readings\/watching the lectures (which I see as a good thing, as I usually don't do readings if I can get away with it, but I learned so much from doing them for this class). That being said, sometimes there were readings and recorded lectures to watch, and they tended to overlap. I don't feel that I benefitted from absorbing the same content in both formats. It was very helpful to turn in the final paper in pieces (topic then outline then draft then final paper etc.)",
                "Strengths: the in-class discussion of the material from the homework really drove home key topics that were important and made those topics stick\r\nWeaknesses: the weekly assignments sometimes felt like busy work and the feedback wasn't really there.",
                "I think the biggest strength of this class was that discussion was almost entirely led by the class interests and what they had chosen to focus their homework responses on. This kept the content relevant but everybody did their own research into topics of particular interest to them which helped us get to know the class better as well as expanding our exposure to different topics",
                "Strengths - builds a new perspective through which students (especially those interested in pursuing medical fields) can evaluate medicine and disease. It's mostly upper level E&EB students who are taking the class because they want to (not a pre-req or a major requirement), so everyone knows the basics and is willing to contribute. Freedom to explore fields of medicine and disease that you find most interesting and comment\/evaluate them through the ideas learned in class. Knowledgeable professor that invites everyone to contribute new ideas and lead discussions. Ideas for the final paper come out of these discussions, and the length of the paper lets students think about how evolution might be playing into a selected disease\/phenomenon.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Might not be a weakness for some, but workload is high (if you enjoy it, you enjoy it though!). Almost every class had a reading\/video lecture to watch and then write a 2-4 page commentary. Engaging and valuable, but definitely takes time.",
                "I really loved this class and it has definitely been one of the most engaging courses I've taken at Yale. The mixture of the online lectures, readings, and assignments helped me better grasp concepts and deeply analyze different case studies. Learning about what my classmates had researched also gave me a variety of other case studies and examples to consider."

                "Yes! This was my first seminar style STEM class at Yale and I really enjoyed the collaborative structure and small class size",
                "Yes! The workload is high, but very well worth it. Especially for students looking to bring a unique perspective to their future medical careers, the course really culminates an E&EB education and applies it to a fascinating field of study. Take if you get the chance, Ogbunu is amazing. Though maybe be careful if you have a heavy pre-req course-load that year.",
                "Yes! For students interested in considering the biological mechanisms of health inequality, mismatch, and global health, I think this class is necessary."
