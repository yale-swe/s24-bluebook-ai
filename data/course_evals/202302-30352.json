There were additional reviewing class and supplemented material to help us understand and master the knowledge, which was absolutely effective. The professor was humorous and inspiring. He gave us video illustrations, which was helpful to our learning and at the meantime caught our attention tightly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets (assignments) were a little bit difficult for me. Oftentimes I failed to work them out.",
