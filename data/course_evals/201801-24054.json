    "This class really reinforced what I previously learned in healthcare economics & policy classes, but allowed me to go into greater depth on the business side of the health sector. It gave me a greater appreciation for the complexity of the healthcare system and the major players' motivations on why they do what they do.",
    "I learned about how doctors, insurance companies, drug companies, the government, and individual consumers all interact in America's super complicated healthcare system. This class helped me look at the healthcare issue from different angles: historical, sociological, and economic. It was a really informative class.",
    "Given the seminar format, I mostly learned how to think about and approach certain healthcare issues. Though I also learned factual information, understanding all of the involved parties and why reform is so challenging was the main skill I gained (which is obviously super important).",
    "I learned a lot more about the healthcare system, the major players and their incentives. I also learned more about how to think about these decisions as different parties in the healthcare sector.",
    "Insight into the complicated, interdependent network of providers, payors, and consumers of healthcare. Taking this course in conjunction with a public health course certainly demonstrated how the business and politics behind healthcare can make the production of more equitable outcomes difficult. \r\n\r\nA course that, due to its content, was a bit discouraging in seeing how our healthcare system has developed and changed over the years in a general trend of devolution, but is also a course that has motivated me to consider involving myself in policy work.",
    "In this course, we identified the different components of the health care system in both the private and public sector, and learned about their respective interests and motivations, along with how to identify conflicting interests, and policies that could help us take steps towards a more ideal health care system."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very discussion based, collaborative, great selection of readings, good workload (engaging but no overwhelming)\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like the ending could have used more summary to go over and synthesize all the complicated things that we learned over the semester.",
    "I thought the class was very strong. I like the discussions, readings, and the assignments were fun to write. For weaknesses, I would eliminate the \"on call\" system since I think it made the natural flow of discussions a little more choppy. I also might consider going a little more in-depth about economics (I thought the business part was a little under-represented). Those are both pretty minor, however. Very good class!",
    "The course was well structured and the discussions were really engaging. The assignments were really relevant and I liked the flexibility of the topics and form. There isnt much I would change in regards to the structure of the course. The change in the oncall system to limit how much people who were responsible for the readings dominated the conversation was good.",
    "Format of the course is great. I can't imagine teaching this in a non-seminar format.\r\n\r\nI think outside of the comments we had supplied in our course evals during the last class, I don't have many comments on how to improve the course.",
    "This course brought together people from different academic (and personal) backgrounds, and seeing how we could agree on certain proposals or policies was hopeful. I wish the course had ended on a more upbeat note with a panacea for our tottering health care system, but that might be merely wishful thinking."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, but only if you plan on doing further study on the subject. If you only have a passing interest in healthcare, a less intense lecture may be a better route to take.",
    "Absolutely. Ted is amazing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student who is interested in healthcare. I've learned so much about how the healthcare system works: the different players and how they all interact. Ted's a great discussion leader and really engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you are looking for an environment to explore healthcare reform and have interest in the subject, this is a great class. It's not a lecture, so if you want specific facts to write down, this is not the right setting. However, if you simply want to discuss interesting policies, etc. and learn how to approach the issue, this is the class for you!",
    "Yes- this is a fantastic course on the American health system and what is being done to change it. It provides a good overview of all the different players and how different influcences converge to create the system we currently have. Ted creates a good learning environment that is relaxed but also engaging and informative.",
    "YES! Take it. You will learn so much about the way our healthcare system has developed into its current form, as well as discussing ways we can reform it. Crucial for anyone interested in policy work and\/or getting themselves involved in the healthcare sector."
