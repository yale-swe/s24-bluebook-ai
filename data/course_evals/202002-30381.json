    "I learned more grammatical structures including gerunds and participles. I also broadened my vocabulary.",
    "I became much more comfortable with many aspects of Russian grammar (I am especially thinking of participles, time expressions, and short-form adjectives). I finally feel like Ive mastered all the cases, and of course my vocabulary has expanded (marriage and furniture words come to mind). The final project also had me practicing translation from Russian directly into English, which I think was very helpful  I intend to continue reading Russian texts, perhaps even tackling higher-level works, so its good to develop this skill. Of course, I am better at writing in Russian, and can create more realistic-sounding dialogue for a wider range of contexts. Also, since we were shown pop music and childrens stories and poetry as supplementals in class, I believe I understand Russian culture better  especially the special fondness for Putin and his calendars. As for special insights  I think that once you figure out which prepositions require which case and really memorize them, your life learning Russian will be much easier. It really does come down to understanding the rules. Sometimes when the rules are vague it helps me to use context.reversos selection of sample sentences to figure out when to use, say, imperfective or perfective. Our professor showed us online resources like learnrussian.rt.com with many useful exercises as well. Practice is key!",
    "I improved my written and spoken russian."

   "comments": [
    "This course had a very small class size. That made it so we were all highly engaged and participating consistently. Everyone spoke and asked questions during every class. I'm glad the class size allowed for this kind of engagement.  The course had a lot of homework, but it should due to its accelerated nature.",
    "I still feel it went too fast and was not flexible enough, though this is coming from someone who had a part-time internship and also had a lot of dental appointments during the last week, so my experience probably does not match that of the average YSS student. I found that it took me four hours of solid work a day to keep afloat in class, which coupled with the aforementioned internship and my time zone made me very tired...I often had to fan myself in class or else I would fall asleep since my room is warm. Anyways, Im not completely sure how to improve this without compromising the value of the course  I understand it has to give students this volume of information at this pace. I still have some suggestions, anyways: I would add more quizzes, and be more specific about what they are testing (sometimes I would study for one aspect of a quiz only to get totally blindsided by an area I didnt expect to have to study), I would force students to review older material more often (otherwise, students would focus on new material to be more time-efficient with their studying, and then forget about the old vocabulary and grammar conventions), and maybe use easier supplemental materials (Truthfully, when it came to that Winnie-the-Pooh cartoon, I could barely follow along). The strengths of this course are many, in fact: I found annotation enormously helpful and I wish there was even more of that, in fact! I love the practice tests, and I think the balance between listening, writing, speaking, and reading is near-percect. Lots of the supplemental material was made much more digestible with docs providing transcriptions and translations, and the flow of the course is consistent (theres a pattern that repeats each week).",
    "I think the course was well taught overall but there could have been better communication betweeen the grader and the professor to facilitate more effective feedback from homework. Due to the compressed nature of the course, daily homework assignment are substantial and get quite tedious."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. This course builds on your knowledge of Russian, particularly the grammatical structures of formal speech. It was a small, engaging class and I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is only taking one other YSS course or no other courses. It really is a time investment, and although I found the course highly rewarding and I absolutely do not regret taking it, I did find myself frequently wishing for more break\/rest time. I did enjoy the fast response time when it came to questions, the freely available office hours, the material, and so on. I genuinely believe that Russian is one of the better languages to take in college and I think it is a beautiful language that by learning, will give one access to a whole world of culture (and will make learning other Slavic languages so much easier). For those with the time and energy, I would definitely recommend this course."
