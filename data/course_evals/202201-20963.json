I completed an intensive research project on a topic of my choosing, which required me to learn about subjects including language, politics, anthropology, economics, and art in the context of Bahasa Indonesia and Indonesian culture. This course prepared me well to travel to Indonesia and continue my research. \r\n\r\nThe main focus of this course the semester that I took it was on Indonesian diaspora. So, I learned a ton about the different experiences of Indonesian immigrants in America/around the world. There were also fascinating guest speakers who were all Indonesian diaspora themselves (an SOM student, a local restaurant owner, and a musician). We also visited West Campus to look at the YUAG collection of wayang kulit (Indonesian shadow puppets).",

She is one of the coolest, best instructors at Yale and she does such a great job of tailoring the study of Bahasa Indonesia to each student's interests. \r\n- Format: 1 full-length class a week and 1 30-minute, one-on-one ngobrol-ngobrol (chat) w/ Bu Dinny about your project topic. The weekly class is great for learning about general Bahasa Indonesia topics and the ngobrol is the absolute best way to practice your language skills in an applied, challenging setting. \r\n- Field trips/guest speakers\r\n- Fair (& relatively lenient) grading\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Absolutely none this class is literally perfect.",

If you want to gain an in-depth understanding of a language and culture that is super different from ours (in America), take this course/all levels of Indonesian @ Yale (especially w/ Bu Dinny!). If you are willing to put in the work (and even then it's really not that much...), you will get more out of this course than almost any other at Yale.",
