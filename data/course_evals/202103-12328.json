                "Zhou Lao Shi is an excellent teacher. The textbook is well-organized, and the class is run like a tight ship. It was usually pretty clear what the expectations and assignments were. However, the downside of all this organization was the very limited amount of time devoted to developing spoken/casual Chinese. I don't think practicing formal grammar patterns out loud counts towards this. I understand this stuff is useful if you want to go into formal/business settings, but I wish there was a much stronger focus on developing everyday Chinese vocabulary. This would be useful for reading certain kinds of modern Chinese literature as well. And also from having spent time in China, understanding Chinese people is an area of huge difficulty. There was almost no practice on that. Finally, this class is so organized that it becomes very easy to figure out how to get good grades without too much effort. It felt like many homework assignments required way too much time (like 3hrs between many classes), yet the payoff in learning was limited because the assignments were too easy or repetitive. The same goes for testsI thought they made it too easy to cram/use notes, and I didn't feel forced to really learn the material well.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging class, interesting topics that increase your Chinese level \r\nWeaknesses: Too many vocab words every night, makes it hard to retain vocab",

                "I mean you pretty much have to take it to move onto electives, unless you do a Light. I don't think it was my most productive semester of Chinese learning by any means. If you have the option and it makes sense in other ways, just do a Light. I think I would have benefitted a lot more if I was learning this material while being surrounded by a Chinese language environment.",
                "Yes, I've noticed such an improvement in my ability to understend authentic chinese content like news articles and tv shows.",
