   "comments": [
    "The investment and financial analysis skills were great. It was helpful to learn about how to draw up a pro forma for a standard residential real estate deal.",
    "Gained a greater appreciation for the various aspects of real estate. Was a wonderful survey course of the history of property laws before transitioning to case-based real estate investing analysis.",
    "Great course that covers a lot of the financial basics around real estate. Very informative and guest speakers great addition to the course.",
    "Knowledge about Real Estate and life lessons about careers in finance!",
    "Great introduction to real estate finance even exploring some economic history on the topic. Learn how to write a case based essay. How to  conduct real estate analysis. Pro forma model etc.",
    "I was introduced to real estate law, I learned a little about the professional field of real estate, and I dipped my toe into real estate finance.",
    "I learned about the history and relevance of real estate in the economy and society, as well as knowledge of investments and various jobs and industries in real estate. I learned how to write about real estate as well as develop models.",
    "We read some real estate theory and discussed laws, and then spent the latter part of the course discussing investing.",
    "This course was a great combination of learning technical skills and more conceptual stuff. Technically, we learned how to evaluate a real estate transaction and learned many of the different components that go into a real estate deal. Conceptually, we got to the very root of why property rights are a part of our society, how real estate adds value to society, and what private property confers on a society. I definitely learned a lot in this course.",
    "A broad look at the theory of real estate as well as more in depth analysis of how property rights spread across America and helped forge society as we know it today. Additionally more hands on analysis of individual real estate cases taking place in the modern property market.",
    "I developed insights into real estate as both a profession and a field of study."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I definitely think the strengths were Mr. Powers as a professor, he is amazing and has lots of real experience and is still very involved in real estate. Weaknesses lie within the overall outline of the course, as it was a little disorganized and sometimes, expectations were not made readily clear. It definitely is more about the history of real estate, etc. and not finance\/modeling so keep that in mind.",
    "Very interesting course that forces you to think about society and real estate in a different way.",
    "This was an amazing class!!!",
    "The series of guest speakers was fantastic. Unparalleled in any other Yale course Ive taken in 7 semesters. I wish we had a bit more time to learn about the careers of some. But overall a fabulous addition to the seminar.",
    "This is a great survey course of the real estate industry, and Professor Powers does a fantastic job of bringing in very interesting guest speakers to talk about their careers and experience in the industry. Professor Powers himself is very interesting to talk to, though I felt that sometimes class stayed a little bit on the surface level, and I was wishing to get a little bit more into the nitty-gritty.",
    "This course was a lot of fun. I loved the in-class discussion and the materials that we read.",
    "Strengths: The Course did a great job of combining the technical side with the conceptual side to allow critical thinking while also possibly preparing someone for a career in real estate. The workload was reasonable. Professor Powers brought in some very special guests which enhanced the in-class experience. The use of case studies and the discussions in class about them definitely fostered understanding of concepts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's hard to do the transition seamlessly, but the Course in many ways felt like two different classes and just like jumped to the more technical investing side midway through. If there's a way to fix the transition that would be great. I also wish the course spent more time discussing real estate as a business in terms of why many of the players are family enterprises and are very insulated. We learned how a firm would make real estate investments, but it would've been great to learn why real estate firms look the way they do.",
    "I loved this course. I thought it would be too finance-oriented but the skills you attain in this class are applicable to everything from development to foreign policy. If there were any criticism, it would be that there could have been more of a bridge between the first and second parts of the course.",
    "I thought the course was very well taught and had both breadth and depth. There is little I would do to change it."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are interested in real estate development or investment.",
    "I would recommend this. It pushes you out of your comfort zone and is unlike any class that is offered here.",
    "Absolutely would recommend if you have any interest in real estate at all! Accessible to students of all backgrounds as a large portion of the course is policy-based.",
    "Yes! Very informative course and Prof Richards is great.",
    "Yes yes yes!! This class is so great. Any knowledge in this class was valuable",
    "100%! Completely under advertised course. Excellent speakers with unbeatable knowledge of the field. Mr. Powers takes considerable amounts of his own time to help each student learn these very useful skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student who is even thinking that real estate may be a possibility in their future. It's a lot of fun, and you meet a lot of cool people.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. It was both educational and super enjoyable.",
    "If you have any interest in real estate, this is a very fun look at the field. You get some theoretical grounding and then look at real estate from both legal and financial angles. Mr. Powers is entertaining and extremely knowledgeable, and he lets the discussion stray on tangents appropriately. I especially liked the case studies, which let us apply investment principles and think about real life choices.",
    "I'm a big fan of residential college seminars. They allow you to learn from someone who has accomplished a lot outside of the classroom. There is no one more qualified than Professor Powers to talk about real estate and he genuinely cares about students and wants to teach them. If you're interesting in real estate at all, definitely take this class. No background or prior experience necessary, you will come away feeling like you learned a lot.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely. I would especially encourage people not geared towards a career in finance to take this course, as I believe it to cover a lot of the aspects of finance that are most applicable to people's lives.",
    "Yes. For anyone who is interested in property rights, real estate, or the history and implications of these two things, it is a great course."
