                "Best class I have taken at Yale. Only weakness was vagueness of grading on first essay and midterm exam; could not tell what was needed to improve my writing or grade. Wish the TFs had given a rubric beforehand\/ more specific writing instruction\/feedback on assignments and exams.",
                "Strengths: Professor Barringer is an absolutely incredible lecturer with a wealth of knowledge. Each class was almost like a podcast. Barringer would skillfully and eloquently connecting specific works with the history of British\/London art and Britain\/London. The YCBA and having access to seminal works in the art of London\/Britain in section and for the two papers is such a unique opportunity. Weaknesses: readings didn't always feel that useful and as a non art history major some advice on how to answer exam questions would have been helpful before the first midterm.",

                "I would recommend this class to everyone. The subject matter is super interesting and relevant because of the expansiveness of the British empire as well as its impact on American culture. This class is also just so much fun. Every lecture was supremely inspiring, and Professor Barringer is a phenomenal teacher.",
                "Yes. Best class Ive taken at Yale. Barringer is a treasure, so is TF Galdone. Honor to have taken this class. Its completely changed my trajectory in my HSAR major (I am now specializing in British art).",
                "1000000%. I'm not an art history major, and this has by far been the most enjoyable class I have ever taken in my life. I left lectures speechless. Sections consisted of looking at and discussing incredible works of art in the YCBA galleries and from its archives. For our final project, I was able to look at specific items from the collection as well. I feel I can now somewhat confidently discuss British history, art and many key artists, and I've gained such an appreciation for British art. Please take this class if you have an opportunity and are at all interested in art.",
