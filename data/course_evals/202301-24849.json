I learned to analyze film through a critical lens with particular focus on the body and the physical form.",
                "I learned so many cool things from the course! Key skills regarding film analysis and terminology, but also a lot regarding how to apply theory to textual interpretation of film, which was a really exciting skill to learn.",
                "This course developed my skills in film analysis and interdisciplinary research.",
                "The class discusses a wide range of films covering many different topics of how bodies are represented through film. Some of the material was challenging but I was able to learn something from each film. The course also covers a lot of German film history which was intimidating at first as I had no background with this subject but it was incorporated well into lectures and I always felt like it helped me understand the films more and was important to discussion.",

                "I found the professor, Sophie Schweiger, particularly engaging, as she clearly was passionate about German/Austrian film and highly knowledgeable on the topics we went over in class, and she was also very accommodating and sympathetic to the individual needs and concerns of students, as well as being responsive to feedback. Because of this, I found the classroom environment to be very welcoming and open, both for the graduate students from various schools who were enrolled in this class and for undergraduate students like me who had perhaps not taken any film classes before. I liked the one-film-per-week/biweekly discussion post structure of the class and the flexibility of either being able to watch the films in a group setting together or alone, and greatly appreciated that this wasn't a barrier to taking the class, since I (and several other students) had scheduling conflicts preventing us from regularly attending screenings. I feel that maybe the course could have been a little more structured and maybe more time could have been devoted to discussing/planning our final papers in the last few weeks, since it is a fairly large undertaking and not all of us have experience writing film-related academic papers.",
                "I can only really think of strengths here. Professor Schweiger is awesome and the course was brilliantly conceptualised, planned, and delivered to us in a way that appealed to lots of different skill levels with film analysis and primary areas of interest. I enjoyed every week of the class and only wish it could have gone on longer.",
                "I hope the class discussion could be more informative and engaging",
                "at times discussions could hit a standstill and it would be difficult to be engaged, maybe a more structured approach to the class (stipulated discussion microtopics, mandatory turn-taking etc) could help pace the class",
                "A great strength of this course was that great sensitivity was taken toward the material covered. \r\n\r\nSince the course had an enrollment that was interdisciplinary, it might have been helpful to have a shared vocabulary list/set of terms to discuss the technical dimensions of the films."

                "Yes, if they are at all interested in film, German culture and history or German film specifically, since the syllabus covers a wide range of media and types of German film, although the content matter can be heavy at times.",
                "Absolutely! It was very informative, exciting, well-taught, and an overall enjoyable learning environment to be in.",
                "I would recommend this course to those who do film studies, comparative literature and German literature.",
                "Yes. If you are interested in studying film or representations of bodies in any form, this class is amazing and one of the favorites that I have taken. The class can seem intimidating but the class is well designed to make these films more accessible. Some of the films are difficult to approach but I found it rewarding.",
