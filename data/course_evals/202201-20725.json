I also learned a tremendous amount of information regarding the attitudes of modern-day Italians with respect to some key issues, like the Shoah, sexuality, and immigration. I really appreciated the opportunity to break off into small groups, as that was the most conducive to learning how to speak and pronounce things in a lower-stress environment.",

                "Strengths: It's evident that Giovanni's personality aligns well with teaching. His ability to lead a class discussion is truly impressive. Even in the more awkward, silent moments, he did his best to move the conversation along in a productive manner. I thought that the presentations at the end of each modules were extremely helpful in doing an analysis of what I learned from each unit. Another strength of this course is Giovanni's willingness to write out common phrases and\/or unknown words on the blackboard in an attempt to help us learn words that may be unfamiliar.\r\nWeaknesses: I don't really think this course had any major weaknesses other than my general distaste for Canvas discussion posts. I think a lot of the conversations that we had in class veered from what was mentioned on Canvas, so I think they're not necessarily vital to the course. I also think there could have been more interaction with the other students, whether that was collaborative projects or homework assignments, so I could interact with students in a lower-stakes environment than live lessons. Lastly, the printing of readings is not necessary, as most students annotate on their iPads nowadays, but it seems that that was subtly phased out throughout the semester. Other than that, it was a great course.",
                "I loved this class. The seminar setting made it very easy to feel confident participating. The topics were interesting and the professor was great!",
                "This course had a good level of at home work and in class discussions were enjoyable.",
                "This was a wonderful course! It provided us all with so many opportunities to discuss Italy and its history and culture in very rich ways. My favorite part about it was the diversity in media, which included films, guest speakers, poems, novels, and music. With regard to areas for improvement, I would say there could be a greater focus on classmate interactions in the asynchronous discussions.",
                "Ioi",
                "This course provides a great overview of the literary and cultural forces at play in several key historical periods of modern Italy. I would highly recommend the course.",
                "Lots of conversation practice. \r\nPerhaps more grammar review would have been nice."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It was a great way to improve my speaking skills. I think different L5 classes with different professors have different focuses, and the focus of this course was definitely speaking and feeling comfortable conversing, which was extremely helpful. I also think that Giovanni was a major perk of this course, as he is an extremely understanding and kind professor who truly wants to see the students in his class learn the material that he studies. The course covered a broad range of topics, and we even got to meet with some pretty interesting guest speakers\/conversations, which was great!",

                "Yes",
                "Sure, to improve conversation skills."
