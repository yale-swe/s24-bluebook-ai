                "Course introduces subjunctive mood in the present tense, irregular preterites, commands, and the future tense. Vocab. topics include chores, nature, celebrations, and health to name a few.",

                "Weaknesses: WAY too much work",
                "I would have liked to go over grammar concepts in class more, rather than just vocabulary. I also would have liked if we were given a clearer rubric of grading. For many assignments the grade we received felt very arbitrary. Also when we submitted writing we were not told exactly what was wrong with it which was not helpful.   However, we had a lot of practice speaking and presenting which was good.",
                "A strength of this course is that you learn a lot in a short amount of time but that requires a lot of work, which sometimes amount to busywork.",
                "Some strengths were quick grading, a comprehensive and readable textbook, and engaging in class assignments. I also appreciated asynchronous Wednesdays. I didn't love memorizing presentations, but I don't necessarily see that as a weakness.",
                "One strength was having an asynchronous day to work separately on our Spanish work. A weakness was the amount of memorization needed for weekly presentations when memorizing specific Spanish sentences is not helpful for retention or for becoming a better Spanish speaker.",
                "Strengths of the course are that we had a consistent schedule where we did presentations every Friday. We also practiced speaking a lot through Lingua meeting which was helpful. Another strength was professor Maripaz who was super kind and understanding throughout the semester. Weaknesses of the class are that it can become repetitive at times.",
                "A strength of the course was the homework and textbook. Past Spanish courses I have taken did not give effective homework but I felt the assignments in this class were extremely helpful. We learned new concepts on our own at home and practiced them the next day in class. A weakness of the class was the lack of access to corrections on the homework. Many times the correct answer was simply given without any explanation if a question was answered incorrectly.",
                "The public speaking assignments could be a lot of stress for students at times. Mixing these up by having students sometimes write poems or songs might make this easier. VLH assignments are fantastic.",
                "Strengths: This course was remarkably organized. Grades would be uploaded in a super timely manner, and the syllabus helped us know what the assignments were way in advance. Also, class time included lots of speaking practice, which greatly improved my language skills. I liked the diversity in assignments that kept anything from being too old + the amount of notice we got to complete everything. I also loved that Wednesdays were asynchronous because it made the everyday classes much more manageable.\r\nWeaknesses: People come into the class with varying degrees of exposure\/comfort with Spanish, and I don't think this was accommodated super well. The professor would ask questions, and people who were good at comprehending Spanish would answer while others were left in the dust. As someone whose background with the language was very shaky, I would have liked if the professor could have found ways we could still participate even if we were not as fast as the other students. Also, there was a big emphasis on memorization in this class. We had to memorize and recite lots of presentations, which I don't think is the most helpful way to learn a language. This course was also very expensive with a $100+ textbook and LinguaMeetings that cost $40. The LinguaMeetings particularly were not worth the additional financial burden.",
                "I thought there were many areas for improvement in this course. I do not think that the online VHL homework should have been graded for accuracy because this put the pressure to use other resources to do perfectly on it rather than using it to test our knowledge and allow us to make mistakes in order to learn. I felt we were severely lacking practice in grammar. We often would read about tenses in our textbook but really did not get enough practice whatsoever in class.  I think there were too many reading and culture activities in class and we never got to have the correct practice actually speaking and writing the language. More grammar drills and lessons would have been helpful. I also really did not like how we were forced to memorize for our presentations, this created a lot of unnecessary stress. Lastly,  I wish there were smaller quizzes on vocabulary and grammar rather than three big tests that encompassed a lot of material each."

It is a good review course that helps to cement conjugations, sentence structure, etc. into your head. All in all, the workload was reasonable and it never felt too hard.",

                "If you have placed into spanish 2, I recommend waiting a while and starting at spanish 1. If you do you only need to go to spanish 3 instead of spanish 4. College language classes are not as fun as high school ones tend to be, and even if you like language learning the pace is aggressive.",
                "This course is fine if you need to get a language requirement out of the way. It is not particularly fun or interesting, and it meets every day except asynchronous Wednesdays. But, you leave the course with improved language skills which are well worth it.",
