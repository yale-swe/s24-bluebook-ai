    "I learned how to integrate, series and sequences, calculating volumes, polar equations, and parametric equations.",
    "I learned how to learn the material beforehand and practice it in class. I also learned various functions of calculus.",
    "New math techniques",
    "I learned how to connect lots of calculus concepts into one problem.",
    "I learned the skills taught in the second year of calculus. I also learned how to take simple ideas and apply them to more complicated projects.",

    "I relearned integral calculus, which I had taken in high school but wished to re-take in order to firmly establish my own mathematical underpinnings before pursuing a STEM degree.",
    "I learned more calculus",
    "I developed my calculus skills",
    "Problem solving",
    "I learned about calculus. Also, this course was new for me in the teaching style - as I was learning on my own a lot more.",
    "I learned how to use integrsl calculus effectively and about the uses of csalculus. i also develeoped more study habits",
    "This course expanded my knowledge of integral calculus and advanced differentiation.",
    "how to learn material on my own",

   "comments": [
    "-Difficult topics were too close to the end (polar coordinates, for example)",
    "This course teaches topics that are interesting to learn.\r\nI don't think the flipped classroom idea is good since I like it better the the professor teaches the topic.",
    "Homework gives great feedback, review sessions are very useful, peer tutors make the class survivable.",
    "I found the course overall to be interesting, but didnt find the groupwork helpful.",
    "I thought the structure of the class was great. One place it could be improved is if the professors engaged more with the problem sets, offering to go over certain problems or problems like what is seen on the problem sets.",
    "I didnt like the flipped classroom",
    "It was very well organized.",
    "I felt that the course was really fast paced. I felt that my two lecture a week approach was not the best for me. I maybe should have opted for the 3 classes a week style",
    "Exams were a lot more difficult than homework assignments",
    "The strength and weakness of this course was its format: minimal lecturing supplemented by a majority of time spent working in small groups on problems pertinent to the day's material.  While I was apprehensive about this format at first, I believe it aided my own engagement with the material and facilitating more ingrained learning.  The downside of such a format is that we often did not have time to finish or go over the answers to at least some of the problems on a given day, meaning we received little feedback on all the iterations of a given concept with which we may be confronted on an assessment.",
    "I enjoyed the way my teacher structure the lectures with packets",
    "I think that my teacher was good, but I thought that the course could have been more engaging, perhaps with more practice problems.",
    "Not enough explanation",
    "I like working with other students. However, sometimes, I feel it would be helpful to have the professor teach more.",
    "the class could be made more interesting, with more interesting examples",
    "I feel that the quantity of material covered in the course was just right. I also think that the preclass explorations were helpful. However, the problem sets were usually more difficult than what we learned in class. I also wish that there was less group work and more lecture.",
    "I like the packets handed out in class. But, if I hadnt taken calc before I would have been extremely lost",
    "The strength of the course is that it focuses just on integration so most of the topics just build on previous knowledge, which is how I learn best. A weakness is that some more difficult topics that were not as related to everything else we learned, like solids of revolution, were rushed and I felt that spending more time on them would have been helpful.",
    "The use of printed lecture notes by the professor was very helpful and made sure no important information was missed."
