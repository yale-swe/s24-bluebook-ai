                "This course is unfairly hard. It is only 0.5 credits, but the course load is not reflective of that at all. Either the credit needs to be 1 full credit, or the course load needs to be decreased. Most course work was tedious and not necessary, so decreasing course work is definitely doable.",
                "There are no strengths. Solely weaknesses. \r\n\r\nThe class is unrelentingly harsh, filled with trick questions, abuse of break day policies, and \r\n teaches you nothing. There is no practical knowledge on how to properly write lab reports or to learn the material: if it isnt in Naramshins desired way (which sometimes rejects scientific convention) you will suffer academically. \r\n\r\nThe class eats up hours of time, even in a virtual format. There is no oversight on Naramshins absurd policies and pace of work: pre-lab quiz, post-lab quiz, and lab report all due on the same day. To top it all off, the rigor and stress of the class is masked as Naramshins passion for chemistry. This is anything but true. He has single-handedly transformed chemistry into a harsh discipline instead of an interesting one. Every day that Naramshin continues to teach is a day that students are pushed farther and farther away from chemistry. If the goal is to turn people off from chemistry, Naramshin is a superb pick. \r\n\r\nI refer to Naramshin synonymously with the class as he is the driving force behind its awful structure. He is singlehandedly responsible; he refuses to let TAs stray from what be thinks is best, removes points if you dont follow his specific (and scientifically incorrect) rules.",
                "The quizzes I think are too hard overall. With all the prep for them, I still think they are quite difficult.",
                "Strengths: some of the experiments were interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: the instructor is not very helpful or responsive to problems; the lab reports take a ridiculously long time to complete; the number of videos required for each class is ludacris; grading is somewhat unfair; lab reports are dinged more points for wrong significant figures than actually having wrong answers; lab report grades also vary greatly by TA so be wary of that; quizzes are nearly impossible to complete in the time limits and the material covered on the quizzes was often mentioned in passing in one of the millions of videos.",
                "The strengths of the course are the TAs and the breadth of the experiments we get to do. The weaknesses are that it is not exactly aligned with the general chemistry syllabus, so you work on something in lab before seeing it in lecture.",
                "S: Individual TAs doing lab. Easy to get help.\r\n\r\nW: Not actually doing the lab.",
                "This course was very well-organized and structured.",
                "Strengths: instructor is readily available to help students, lab reinforces concepts learned in chemistry class, a wide variety of skills are taught, course materials are very organized\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no partial credit seems to be given on quiz questions that have multiple parts to them. Why? \r\nThe workload is a lot - maybe too much - for a half-credit course. I spent more time on this class than some of my one-credit classes.\r\nIt takes a long time to receive feedback on assignments and quizzes. I think there was only one lab report graded by the middle of the term. It's hard incorporate feedback if we don't receive until two weeks later, after which we might have made the same mistake on the week before's quiz or report.",
                "This class was very organized, with the lab manual being a great resource! I was also very appreciative of the formatted lab reports so we knew exactly what to provide. I believe the timed quizzes were given with too little time and on topics that were not clearly presented and/or present in the lab manual/pre-lab videos. It also took a long time to get feedback on lab reports, so I didn't know how to improve for the first three lab reports. \r\n\r\nI took Chem 163/7 in the fall/spring. This course does not align well with the lab. I often found myself self-teaching the concepts of the lab because these courses do not align. I didn't mind teaching myself but feel others would benefit more if the courses aligned their topics to occur consecutively or have the lab portion follow the topic background in lecture.",
                "The course was well adapted for the remote format. I wish we had more time for the pre-lab and post-lab quizzes.",
                "Dr. G and the TAs were very passionate about helping me learn Chemistry and keeping me engaged. Also, the fact that some of the labs paired up with each other was nice because it gave a week off from lab reports and lessened the workload for the class. However, one point I didn't like about the class were the weekly pre-lab videos we had to watch. While they were very informative, they took way too long and made the day before lab much more stressful, since not only did we have to watch the videos, but often had to do pre and post labs and at times the lab report as well.",
                "Seems very redundant in the virtual lab format.",
                "This course could absolutely be improved by in person class. Also, pre lab lectures were lengthy and often repetitive to what we watched our individual TF do. This meant that we'd often have 4+ hours of instruction per week for a half credit course which seems excessive. I hope this could be rectified by just having in person lab. Additionally, the pre and post lab quizzes were also excessive. They just added stress with minimal value for online learning.",
                "Strengths: The TAs were great and make the lab run smoothly \r\nWeaknesses: Dr. G is terrible and adds additional, unneeded stress to the experience. In addition, all the labs were the exact same as when partners were allowed (before COVID) so the labs took twice as long for us to do since we had to do them all alone.",
                "One weakness of this course is the difficulty of the lab reports. Completing the lab reports was very tedious and the questions asked did not aid my understanding of what the experiments entailed. Focusing on more relevant questions and calculation would make the course more enjoyable and less stressful.",
                "Virtual lab is very difficult to be engaging.",
                "The strengths of this course was the preciseness of the content and explanations provided in the pre-lab lectures, as well as the experimental setup videos that we watched prior to each experiment's live virtual lab. The engagement during virtual lab sessions was also a strength of this course. The lab reports and quizzes supplemented what was presented in the videos and the zoom lab sessions. The course could be improved by lowering the workload, as well as ensuring that each person has understood certain experimental techniques, as the lab was conducted virtually for some.",
                "This course was not engaging. The variability in the grading as well as the inconsistency in concepts was frustrating beyond belief.",
                "A standard chem lab course. Very helpful to have so many experiments and lectures recorded, useful in preparing for experiments and filling out lab reports. Thorough feedback provided on lab reports and quizzes, however, feedback was very late. I almost never had the chance to learn from my mistakes on previous lab reports. Quiz feedback was a bit faster though.",
                "Honestly, virtually, it was kind of boring. There were a lot of pre-lab videos which got the concepts across very well, but sometimes felt too long but that was necessary for the content. My lab section felt like it just rehashed all of the information and was simply to get data to then write the lab report. 80% of the lab report feels like busy work and 20% is actually understanding the data and helping my understanding of chemistry. However some of it was useful practice for exams.\r\nHowever, the course is very useful if you are in Chem 165 because it is synced perfectly and provides very useful concept review.",
                "Some strengths of the course were that the online lab was a small group that could be interacted with easily and that the data was always accurate because it was gathered by a TA.\r\nThe largest weakness of this course was that it was supposed to teach chemistry via hands on lab experience, but it was in-fact virtual.",
                "I think that I had a much better experience in the class once I realize how helpful office hours were. I think that it would be a lot better if the recorded lectures were also live on zoom, so that students could ask questions in class, but I don't know if that would be optimal because students are already going to normal chemistry lecture.",
                "This course is so hard, there were pre and post-lab quizzes every week that are timed. There is normally not enough time to answer the questions fully and to the best of your ability.",
                "I love Dr. G's passion for chemistry. However, the lab reports are incredibly difficult and tedious. I do far more work for this course than any other course, and it is frustrating that this course only counts as 0.5 credits.",
                "The course was very helpful in that the material aligned with the content of the lecture class. This made studying for both classes easier.",
                "There is too much time commitment for this course. Start the course earlier so that we can have adequate breaks during midterm week.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- The course aligned very well with Chem 165\r\n- office hours were readily available and very helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The grading for the lab reports differed per TA\r\n- Points were taken off for components that did not reflect our knowledge of the course (e.g. giving the graph a title that took off 6% from one of my lab reports)\r\n- not enough time for lab quizzes - could not complete all the questions in time",
                "Quizzes are unfair and based on material not always taught- virtual lab was not engaging and repetitive of pre recorded videos.",
                "A lot of tedious work. Grading was extremely strict for no reason.",
                "Strengths: the recorded lab lectures and the lab videos were incredibly helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The quizzes were given too little time to complete and added unnecessary stress to the course. The course definitely does not feel like a half credit course with the amount of work we had to get done.",
                "It can be a very fun course, however, it is drawn back by the unreasonable expectations. Even though the course is a half credit, it had a similar workload to my 1 credit courses. This could be improved by lowering the workload for an already complicated subject.",
                "Strengths: Taught very well and lines up especially well with general chemistry. The content was tricky at times, but I always thought it was a healthy challenge. The different experiments were set up well to facilitate a better understanding of whatever concept we were discussing.\r\n\r\nWeakness: It was quite a bit of work for a half credit course. I felt that lectures and assignments could be shortened because it became borderline busy work and repetitive.",
                "This course was a lot of work for a half-credit class. There were usually two quizzes per week plus a long lab report (except for some weeks) and many videos. The videos helped a lot, but the quizzes were hard, required a lot of memorization, and didn't feel helpful or very similar to the lab reports. There is a lot of professor support which makes the course better.",
                "This course has a lot of work and time commitment for being only .5 credits, having be worth a whole credit would be nice.",
                "More additional assistance after lab, such as office hours from TAs.",
                "The workload for this course is extremely high for only being half a credit. It takes away from actually being able to learn and understand what's happening.",
                "Im sure this would be great in person but it was just hard to focus online",
                "Since it was a virtual format, it was not as fun as doing experiments yourself, but my TF and Dr. G. tried their best to still give us a good education",
                "Strength: Learning a lot of chemistry and how to apply it.\r\nWeakness: The grading seemed very inconsistent across the different TFs. Also the quizzes felt impossible to finish on time as you had to type out your work which required symbols and canvas buttons and other features that wasted time. The quizzes also required the memorization of certain things that did not seem like there was a need to memorize.",
                "I like that the TAs grade but sometimes they can take off points for sig figs that were actually using correct rules, but we cant bring it up to Dr. G because he would no allow us to change the grade without him looking at the report first. Otherwise dr g was actually pretty helpful during office hours this year remote if not a little condescending at times.",
                "Workload is high, but Dr. G is always there to help. He is always there to help.",
                "The quizzes make sure that I am fully understanding the lab content. However, with very limited time I felt really rushed especially with having to input equations into Canvas. The lab reports are a bit long, but they challenge me to think critically about my findings.",
                "Again, lab is a course that should obviously be taken in person to get hands on experience with the techniques we learned. However, strictly from a zoom format I think that the lectures and run through of the lab procedure live were a helpful addition to the prelab lectures. I dont know how I would run the course any differently. It was run very well given the circumstances.",
                "This course was simply not engaging: multiple hour-long lectures every week and virtual labs that made the experience very difficult to get through.",
                "I think a strength of this course was that it was taught well by the teaching team. A weakness of this course was that it did not align with chem 167 at all, meaning that we would have to learn topics in advance in order to do the lab quizzes successfully. I think this could be improved if the course communicated with chem 167 more than it does currently.",
                "I wish it was in person and that the prelab videos were shorter and more succinct.",
                "strengths: the lab works very well with the corresponding chem lecture course and helps to solidify understanding of chemistry principles\r\nweakness: students are given very little time to do the quizzes as they are timed, its difficult to finish them in time",
                "Strengths are some of the TA's who always try their best to teach content beyond the lecture videos, the lecture videos themselves are sometimes very helpful not only for this class but also for the lecture course. Weaknesses are the arbitrary and unclear grading, at times needlessly long lab reports, and the quizzes which are inexplicably difficult.",
                "I think that this is a really valuable course that teaches us the fundamentals of the chemistry lab. However, I think that it's definitely equivalent to more than 0.5 credits.",
                "The structure is nice, and there are a lot of resources for help.\r\n\r\nThe weakness is that it is very time consuming, and there's a lot of repetition in the lab reports. Sometimes the quizzes ask for seemingly unnecessary details, so pay attention to those.",
                "graders are too strict and are too picky. hard to actually try to learn when grading is so tough.",
                "This course is a lot of work and way more than .5 credits worth of labor, but very beneficial if you are considering lab work",
                "The virtual lab was not interactive enough and I don't feel it improved my lab skills. The lab reports take forever and are graded very harshly, and the quizzes are extremely difficult. So much more work than my 1 credit classes but it was a half credit class",
                "Strength: very organized \r\nWeakness: a lot of work for 0.5 credits",
                "Although the course meets once a week and is only 0.5 credits, I think that the course should be worth much more because of the workload. Taking two quizzes and handing in one lab report every week on top of all of the other coursework was very challenging to do, especially online. I think that the fast pace of the course made it hard to learn to understand and it was more learning for completion.",
                "This course was good considering it was remote lab. It was organized and I dont think much can be improved.",
                "The course could be improved with more time for the pre and post lab quizzes but is good with showing a strong lab report.",
                "Perfect course, the virtual setting was a little unengaging. But there was nothing to be done about it! The current situation is not ideal.",
                "This course definitely teaches you a lot. You gain some solid knowledge about chemistry concepts within the lab setting, work ethic and time management skills, which are all very valuable. With that said, I do find this course to be incredibly demanding, especially for only 0.5 credit course. Though it was possible to do a lab report, prelab quiz and postlab quiz within the same week, it was quite grueling and draining to keep that up throughout a whole semester that had no breaks. Personally, I think there could be some reworking with the logistics of this course to be a bit more reasonable for students. Overall, this lab class is organized, thorough, and interesting for sure.",
                "very hard to engage (especially online), very mundane and monotonous - did not feel like I was learning",
                "Strengths: Dr. G\r\nWeaknesses: virtual format",
                "I think the strengths are that it really teaches a lot of valuable practical skills, and being in the lab is really interesting and fun. The weakness to me is the amount of work outside the lab especially in the form of quizzes, I feel like that does less for my learning and stresses me out more.",
                "The prerecorded lecture videos were very useful.",
                "Strengths: Dr. G posts prelab videos that are excellent in helping you understand what to expect (and also great for reminding yourself what happened during the lab when you're writing your report.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Gen chem... it's too varied in the topics that it hits, you may be learning a lot of things for the first time, and it doesn't help that you can lose points on your report for the smallest errors / missed detail (double - no, TRIPLE check those sig figs!). The most stressful part was probably the prelab/postlab quizzes, but work hard on your lab reports and it should balance out nicely!",
                "CHEM 136L is almost too reliant on the strengths of its Teaching Fellows. I had an amazing experience with this course only because my TF was so engaging, enthusiastic, patient, and kind. While my excellent TF made the course both enjoyable and enriching, students' experience with the course should not be completely decided by the TF they are assigned to. Here lies the weakness of this course. The actual foundation of it does little to involve students as the lab reports themselves are formulaic and designed to test whether you're able to name-drop details of the procedure rather than whether you actually understood the content. The quizzes are similarly confusing, once again focusing on minutiae like the color change of a specific liquid. Moreover, the pre-lab quizzes often include calculations that were briefly touched on (and once not mentioned at all) in the pre-lab reading. Often, only after doing the lab report (so a week after taking the pre-lab quiz) would I understand how to answer some of the pre-lab quiz questions. This makes the course itself feel like a chore, rather than encouraging deeper enthusiasm for and understanding about chemistry, it focuses on whether you can memorize obscure facts. Perhaps that's the intention with the class but I don't think it should be.",
                "Doing lab online was extremely difficult as there was a large challenge as I felt a large disconnect from the lab reports when I am not the one doing the lab. It sometimes felt like we were being asked too much for something we had only watched videos on.",
                "Strengths: It's well organized, and it reinforces some of the topics you learn in general chemistry\r\nWeaknesses: While Dr. G provides pre-lab videos, the content that is tested on the pre-lab and post-lab quizzes is not always presented in the pre-lab videos or the manual. You either already know some of the content, or you don't.",
                "This class is very assignments and quiz heavy, and I think it wouldve been nicer if participation during the actual lab had had a bigger part in grading.",
                "I found that I spent most of my time on quizzes scrambling to format my work in Canvas-- maybe a file upload would be an easier way to submit work",
                "Strengths: certain TFs were helpful, satisfied premed requirements\r\nWeaknesses: everything else",
                "It takes really long to get the grades back in this course, so if you do not know what you messed up on in one assignment you will not know how to correct it until weeks later. Some assignments took a month to be graded and are always given back so late.",
                "Strengths: I think the biggest strength of this course is that it's broken up into sections, and that the section T.F.s are extremely helpful (or at least mine was) when I had questions regarding the course material. Additionally, even though he has a reputation for being tough, I do believe Dr. G has each and every student's best interest in mind. He always makes himself available to teach students when they don't understand something, and I believe he has a true passion for chemistry.\r\nWeaknesses: There were many weaknesses with this course, but I don't believe that many were specific to 136 vs 134, especially since 136 was online for me, and 134 was in-person. The quizzes were considerably more difficult than last semester, but I think that overall, they were fair. As always, there is a severe disconnect between the amount of work required for this course and the amount of credit you receive. I don't know how many students have to say this for Yale to listen, but it's honestly disappointing that they are still under the assumption that this class should be worth half of what a lecture is worth, especially given the fact that I consistently spent 5x the amount of time on lab than lecture. I know that specific change is larger than a decision that Dr. G can make, but it would be wise for Yale to reevaluate the rigor of this course and accredit students accordingly. Secondly, I do believe that there was inconsistencies between how the T.F.s graded lab reports  I believe I consistently produced equal-quality lab reports, yet, my grades varied up to 10 points. Lastly, I think that the purposes section on the lab report is redundant and not at all conducive to learning. The point of it is to make sure that students fully understand the methods and objectives of the experiment, but that is well-covered in the quizzes and the rest of the lab. Instead, it ends up being a place where you lose points over missing, quite literally, a single word.",
                "Virtual lab did feel somewhat less engaging, but it made the best of the situation. The course itself was very well run with regular assignments and clear expectations.",
                "Need to make timing of quizzes more flexible",
                "strength: it is online, no walking to to lab. \r\n\r\nweakness: bad teaching, too nit picking on grading, which deviates me from actual learning. Dr. G was not good at explanation. Besides the not so good content, his videos are long and unedited (poor quality) , also poor audio, which makes it so hard to watch.",
                "strengths: I liked how the videos of the lab procedure were coupled with the manual. \r\nweaknesses: Wasn't really sure what would be on the pre/post labs so it was hard to anticipate how to study for that. Also at times getting the lab data from the TA didn't seem that uniform and knowing what data to use for each experiment was confusing.",
                "Virtual format did not teach lab skills very well, and sometimes it was hard to stay focused during the 2+ hour lab sessions on zoom. The feedback on the lab reports was helpful, and the TAs were great at answering any and all questions about the lab and the report.",
                "The class sometimes emphasizes arbitrary skills over general concept knowledge. However, the class has very good and in-depth videos that fully encapsulate the material as well as having incredibly helpful office hours. The amount of videos that we had to watch was overwhelming at times.",
                "Pre and post lab quizzes were tedious and difficult to complete within the given time limit. The lab report grading among TAs was inconsistent.",
                "This course was very strong in terms of teaching concepts through recorded lectures and lab reports. However, I think that keeping up with due dates was really hard, especially with very strict timelines amidst varying time zones.",
                "The lab report grading must be more precise. Some TFs grade significantly harder than others which skews the curve.",
                "The strengths of this course is that there is a lot of real life application of concepts learned in chemistry. The experiments are easy to follow, but provide a good level of challenge and focus in order to succeed at the experiment. The lab videos are very easy to follow and understand. They can take quite a while to watch, which makes it difficult to pay attention for the entirety of all the videos. The calculation questions on the quizzes were still something I struggled to answer purely due to the way to input the work for the question.",
                "I really liked the pre-lab lectures but it was hard to understand fully the experiment.",
                "The grading of lab reports very much focuses on the details of graph formatting and significant figures, and I hope in the future the method of grading can be adjusted to focus on drawing logical scientific conclusions and using deliberate thought.",
                "The course was a good way to reinforce what we learned in Gen Chem II. However, the workload was very high for only half a credit.",
                "The grading of lab reports should be less nit-picky; I think we should be tested on how well we understand the course material in lab reports, not how closely we followed guidelines of the lab report for things like graph formatting and proper use of significant figures. You can easily do poorly on a lab report despite understanding all of the concepts and procedures due to improper formatting (graphs, sig figs, etc), which I don't think is a great test of our knowledge of the concepts learned in the course. \r\n\r\nPre-lab lecture videos posted online were very very helpful in taking the quizzes and understanding each lab! So is all of the background info in the lab manual and the example calculations. Also, despite being more work, the quizzes before and after lab were helpful in reinforcing course concepts as well. \r\n\r\nAlso, despite the fact that this meant some of the lab reports were very long, I preferred having fewer lab reports in total (only 6 in gen chem lab II as opposed to 9 or 10 in gen chem lab I) , because this gave us weeks off where we didn't have to submit anything, which was super nice! For this reason gen chem lab II was actually much more manageable and less stressful than gen chem lab I.",
                "Without fault to Tom or Dr. G, lab is simply not meant to be put forth in a virtual format.",
                "Strengths: Dr. G is very thorough about helping students understand and complete the lab. \r\nWeaknesses: There Post-Lab quizzes are extremely tight on time.",
                "Release the grades sooner, since one mistake made can be repeated for multiple submissions before the student realizes they made this mistake since grades took around 4 weeks to be released per lab.",
                "The class was helpful for understanding concepts taught in CHEM 165, but overall, I really did not benefit much from the class. Dr. G is nice, but I feel like I didn't take much of anything away from the lab.",
                "The workload of this course was a little overwhelming, particularly in the COVID-19 context.",
                "A strength is that it was taught very clearly which made it easier to understand. A weakness is that I did not gain any actual lab skills because it was all virtual. I cannot think of a way that it could be improved.",
                "This course was very stressful and there was very little flexibility for deadlines, even considering all the circumstances.",
                "The online format of this course was difficult as the purpose of it is to gain hands-on experience. I look forward to taking future labs in person.",
                "I would say that the support from this course was certainly a strength. The TAs always responded in a timely manner and readily made themselves available to answer any questions students had. An obvious weakness was the fact that many students were not able to actually conduct the experiments themselves due to the pandemic, but Dr. G did an amazing job accommodating to the restrictions by creating videos, which I found extremely helpful in my learning experience throughout the course.",
                "This class had so many weaknesses. There wasn't enough time for quizzes, the labs were graded absurdly (they take away a point for a word not in the past tense or if there's the wrong number of significant figures), we had hours of videos to watch each week on top of the class time, my TA often made mistakes and couldn't explain everything to us, and it was way too much work for half a credit.",
                "Through this course, I was able to visually and experimentally witness many of the concepts discussed in the accompanying lecture course. I was able to see a few of the experimental techniques discussed in the lecture course (e.g. the van't Hoff analysis, acid-base titration) performed in real time. The prelab lectures are overall beneficial for situating the week's experiments into a broader context and in order to disseminate key information in an auditory format. That being said, the benefits of this course end there. This course is simply too much work for the amount of credit that it is. The course is quite literally more work than the accompanying lecture course, even Chemistry 167. The lab reports are very involved, which is inherently not detrimental, but when coupled with the fact that there is a prelab quiz for every week's experiment as well as a postlab quiz accompanying each lab report that was often just as difficult than exams in the accompanying lecture course, the involved lab reports (up to 15 pages of work when all was said and done) become overwhelming. Not to mention, the prelab and postlab quizzes often felt more like typing tests rather than chemistry quizzes considering the nature of typing calculations into a computer. While I appreciate the sentiment of teaching all of us the applications and usefulness of chemistry in more of a real-world context, there is absolutely no reason for this course to be more work than the accompanying lecture course. Additionally, in this semester specifically, there was some redundancy in having to watch the entire experiment be performed by the instructor as well as select aspects of the experiment be performed by the Teaching Fellow in every session. However, the experiment being performed by the instructor during in-person instruction is a useful tool and a strength of the class when the class is in its in-person iteration."

                "Nothing was done in this course to support students during Covid-19. In fact, the opposite occurred: this class intentionally placed pressure on students while failing to take into account the situation surrounding them. \r\n\r\nNaramshin has made it evidently clear he does not care that we are in a pandemic nor a state of grief. Professors have approached students with kindness and honesty, but Naramshin is an exception, in the worst possible way. By failing to teach chemistry in an interesting way, he himself proves to be a failure of chemistry, and ultimately his attempts to truly establish his class with his nonsensical questions and grading scheme, are nothing short of pathetic.",

                "The small discussion style lab groups were effective. The pre-recorded videos were not necessary to succeed in the class, even if it meant a better learning outcome from the class.",
                "The pre and post-lab quizzes need to be easier and used in a better format. The canvas quiz is just too hard to write work in.",
                "The virtual lab format worked out as well as it possibly could have, and I am glad we didn't have to stay on Zoom for four hours straight. Ellie's lectures were awesome, and I loved the little tidbits she would add to keep it interesting.",
                "The live lectures by the TA's combined with the recorded lectures became repetitive. The course was as effective as it could be considering that it was completely over zoom.",
                "The precautions were fine",
                "In regards to COVID-19, I believed that the course did a good job in teaching the material.",
                "My TA, Natalie Williams, helped to keep the course engaging. She interacted with us on a personal level, put us into breakout rooms, and gave great lectures.",
                "Class was not good online and much better for understanding in person",
                "The lab lectures were pretty useless. I did not learn anything I couldn't have learned from watching the recorded lectures and/or lab videos.",
                "Pre-recorded lab videos were an amazing addition to the course. It allowed for people to visualize how the lab would proceed before participating in it. This lead to a faster lab. Online lab are an interesting but potentially detrimental change caused by COVID-19. It didn't allow the people participating in the lab to learn hands-on practices. If they wanted to learn more about the tool use, they were not able to.",
                "With a lab course, virtual learning was obviously pretty difficult. It helped that Dr. G pre-recorded all of the experiments. That said, I thought it was pretty redundant to go through the labs again through zoom. Due to poor video quality and connection, the virtual, synchronous lab sections were often just worse than the experiments Dr. G already prerecorded.",
                "The pre-recorded lab lectures and videos were great to feel more prepared going into the lab. Additionally, Zoom office hours with Dr. G were very accessible and he was really helpful and supportive.",
                "Attending lab via zoom was not very effective, I did not feel as though I learned as much as I could have in person.",
                "Dr. G was very unaccommodating in regards to break days. He made lab reports and lab quizzes due the day after break days, meaning that we could not actually rest and take time for ourselves, which was very mentally draining.",
                "My TA did a great of of keeping us engaged but it was still a long time to be on zoom",
                "Maybe it would have been useful to send some at home equipment for off campus students so they could engage with the material. The value of lab comes from the physical contact as well as write ups, so that was a big factor that was missing.",
                "The office hours were very very helpful but the videos could be a little long and tedious. The post lab quizzes were sometimes impossible because they included things we didnt learn or more points were taken off instead of giving partial credit because wedic the weight method but got the wrong answer.",
                "Having virtual lab limited the experience one could have, but the TAs made the most out of our Zoom class. The live sessions could be improved by having us more involved. Having break days along the semester was very helpful for all of us to take time off of school work, however, this course did not allow us to take break days as everything was only extended to be due after the break. I wish we could have had a bit longer extension during break days.",
                "The recorded lectures to watch before lab were extremely helpful. It gave students a visual idea of what the lab was supposed to look like far better than the manual ever did and Dr. Gs explanations of what was going on was very beneficial for conceptual understanding.",
                "The lab was not structured in any meaningful way--I was very often stressed and bored.",
                "Virtual learning in this course was a nightmare. I would forget everything done in the lab within a couple days of seeing the lab be performed, which is certainly a side effect of not being able to do the lab with my own hands. I think this could be improved if the course was performed similar to other universities, in which even the virtual students would be sent some simple lab materials in order to get a better sense at performing simple measurements with these materials.",
                "The live discussions were more effective, but the recorded lectures were not very engaging. Also the pre and post lab quizzes were difficult to do online with the math calculations on canvas.",
                "The recorded lectures and demonstrations were very helpful, especially as these experiments were not performed in person by students, so watching the experiment virtually several times was helpful. This course could be improved if the lab quizzes had more flexibility in date and time, as inevitably the night before lab would always have two very difficult quizzes as well as the actual learning of procedure, which is an unfair expectation when the quizzes could easily be opened and available earlier.",
                "Since I took this course in person, it worked really well.",
                "It was taught as it would normally be (we were less people in the class, which was very nice since we got to interact a lot with the TA and Dr. G.",
                "lab was hard to see through zoom, but my TA did his best.",
                "The virtual lab was not successful",
                "I think this for a virtual lab, this course transitioned very well.",
                "It was hard to understand certain experiments seeing them only through the screen",
                "The zoom lab classes were a bit boring but good overall considering the circumstances.",
                "The virtual setting was very good but could be more engaging.",
                "Another way to host virtual labs perhaps? I'm not too sure if that's feasible but viewing a singular lab through a screen for a few hours was not the best mode of learning.",
                "Virtual lab adapted as best as it could, there were a lot of videos but they were helpful.",
                "online format really just doesnt work - the prep videos were wayyy more helpful than actual lab",
                "Virtual format is unfortunately terrible for a hands on lab course. However, I appreciated Dr. G and my TF being there for me and offering lab report advice.",
                "I was lucky in that my experience was actually pretty similar to during normal times because I was allowed to take the class in person. I will say that due to covid there were much smaller sections, and I think that helped my learning a lot because I got to ask my TA more questions and learn more from him.",
                "Recorded lectures are amazing to review.",
                "I think doing lab online is a hard class to really implement successful learning with COVID-19. I think overall, they did their best with the lab videos we would watch every week and the meetings with the TF, but the disconnect from not doing the lab was an extreme challenge.",
                "We just watched the TFs do the experiment, so it wasn't very engaging, but we were virtual so that was understandable.",
                "Virtual lectures were nice and easy to follow. Lab through Zoom was definitely not as engaging but our TA did his best.",
                "Cant say anything really succeeded, a lot of room for improvement",
                "I think that the \"live\" participation for this course was quite non-existent in the virtual format. You essentially watched your T.F. perform the experiment and then said bye. I'm truly hoping that this course will never have to be in the virtual format again, but if it is, more engagement in the virtual format would be greatly appreciated. Even though some students don't necessarily want it, I think that being able to converse with your T.F. in arenas other than email would be better-suited towards learning.",
                "In-person lab was definitely preferable to virtual lab, but still being able to see the experiments performed remotely was much more helpful than simply reading the manual and obtaining data",
                "Quiz releases were too time constraining",
                "Online lab was not effective, I watched my TA going about here and there and then it was over. We didn't do all the steps. Actual work was replaced by just imagine this happened.",
                "Not much virtual engagement in the class, but the demonstrations of the procedures helped a bit.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures were very helpful and allowed me somewhat of the lab experience. The only con I found was that the amount of videos and the length of the videos we had to watch weekly was overwhelming.",
                "I liked the recorded lectures and asynchronous quizzes. I also think that the virtual lab sessions were conducted very well and I learned a lot despite not being able to conduct experiments in-person.",
                "It was the best that it could be.",
                "I took an in person lab and it was very easy for me to engage. I felt safe in the lab regarding any COVID concerns, and the TAs and professor were more than willing to answer any questions.",
                "I think that the course did as much as it could.",
                "Pre-lab lectures posted online were very helpful.",
                "I think the virtual labs were fairly successful, but that it was really difficult to get help on lab reports/attend office hours/get feedback. I felt like I did the class completely on my own.",
                "The live lab sessions were not very engaging. I feel like the course could have run better without them.",
                "Overall, I think it succeeded, though there wasn't really a way to teach hands-on lab skills. Again, I'm not sure how this course could be improved.",
                "Dr. G's efforts to bring lab-like learning to the students through his detailed videos and the live zoom lab sections were very admirable but it still remained very difficult to remain engaged in a hand-on class virtually.",
                "As I have mentioned before, while many students were not able to conduct the experiments themselves, I found that the videos Dr. G created were very effective in encouraging student engagement and in understanding of the material. The virtual lab days themselves were also very helpful in clarifying any information presented in the lab manuals.",

                "Absolutely not. It's a shame that this a requirement for so many STEM majors because it is such an unenjoyable class. This class itself is enough to kill a STEM major in the making. Don't let it kill your love for STEM because majority other STEM courses are not like this.",
                "This is by far, the worst class Yale University has to offer. And the worst professor they have. No wonder hes not tenured. \r\n\r\nThis class is a prerequisite so it must be taken. Unfortunately, this man is as stubborn as he is unqualified, but I would certainly encourage pointing out and amplifying his toxicity as it emerges.",
                "Yes for another premed",
                "If you have to take it, then yes. If you have the choice, then no. It requires a significant amount of work for the 0.5 credit you receive. You gain some chemistry lab skills, but those aren't worth the headache and stress the rest of this course (instructor, quizzes, grading scheme) causes.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in STEM! It is a great introductory lab course to get you going on your more advanced studies. However, it is a lot of work, so make sure you have a balanced semester.",
                "Yes, on premed track it needs to be taken.",
                "Yes - the tools are available for you to succeed in the class, but be prepared for the large workload.",

Beyond teaching me content, the course taught me about the importance of time management and being meticulous about how we go about doing our work. The course is by no means easy--you will have to put in the hard work! However, it is incredibly fulfilling, and I know I will bring the things I learned in this course to ones I will take in the future.",
                "No.",
                "I certainly wouldn't recommend online lab to anyone. In person should be better, but virtual was objectively useless.",
                "DO NOT take Chem lab if it is not required for your major. It is a major time commitment for little reward. In addition, you will feel belittled by Dr. G whenever you ask questions.",

                "If this is a requirement of your major or premed then you have to take it. If you're taking Chem167 and want extra practice going through general chemistry problems then this could also help. But otherwise, it's too much work and don't take it.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. If the other student was required to take chemistry lab I would definitely encourage them that it is not impossible. The only issue is that it is not worth taking unless it is a requirement.",
                "Yes. Compared to CHEM 134L, this course was more focused on the conceptual chemistry elements than basic laboratory practices. The experiments were especially helpful in supplementing my learning in gen chem. As a pre-med STEM student, this course was required for me, but I thought that it was enjoyable. That said, I wouldn't recommend the course for students just looking for a 0.5 credit course. This course easily has the same workload of a 1 credit course.",

Your grades are dependent on whether you get a good or bad TF grading your lab reports and quizzes. I think they are told to purposely grade your assignments harshly. It was my most stress-inducing class this semester and last. Definitely a weeder class.",

You're likely pre-med or a STEM major and have to take this course either way, but if for some reason you're going to try this course \"for fun\" look elsewhere. The lab reports are long with needlessly picky grading, and the quizzes are inexplicably difficult sometimes. You'll be fine, but don't just expect an A without putting in serious effort. I would say this course is marginally easier than 134L, but take that with a grain of salt. As long as you start the lab reports early and work hard to understand whats actually happening in each experiment, you should be fine.",
                "Definitely. Especially the experience of performing the labs in person is so engaging.",

                "Only take this course if you can take it with friends (or acquaintances you want to become friends with). This seems like a weird recommendation, but you'll need someone to complain to when the pre-lab quizzes don't make sense and someone to work on the lab reports with. Taking this class alone is just disheartening.",
                "I would not recommend this class to another student, though I know it is required for many STEM majors. It felt mostly like a lot of busy work rather than facilitating my learning. If you are someone who has never worked in a wet lab, this would be a good place to learn new concepts, but if you did many of these labs in high school, it can feel somewhat redundant.",
                "No",
                "I would not recommend this course to anyone unless they are required to take it. The workload is greater than many full credit classes despite being half a credit and the grading is often very harsh.",
                "No! There is far too much work for only 0.5 credits, and the expectations aren't always clear. The grading for the lab reports is very picky, and you are expected to follow a set of rules that you will not be informed about. However, if you're considering this course, it's most likely a requirement, so there's no use in telling you not to take it. If you put in the enormous amount of hours that this course requires, you will likely get an A, but it will not be an enjoyable experience. Good luck and may the odds ever be in your favor!",

This course has an extreme time-demand, and taking it if it's not necessary will render your semester quite stress-filled. If you want to get more experience in chemistry, I do think that taking the lecture course alone will be sufficient, or you could work in a lab on campus to get bench-work experience. If not those, then that's okay just prepare to devote hours upon hours of your free time to this course as the amount of work is quite heavy. Otherwise, for STEM majors/pre-meds, it's a necessary course, so there is not much you can do other than try your best and get through it. Best of luck!",
                "Yes, I think it's a must for anyone interesting in studying the sciences especially biology or chemistry. The lab skills are essential even if students don't always find the experiment content interesting.",
                "NO.",
                "Not unless this is a required course for the major or track a student is on. The professor's personality, the constant pressure to produce near-perfect labs, and also the pressure to understand the material immediately is not something I would put on another student. Also, the pressure of the pre/post lab quizzes was very stressful to deal with. If a student does not need to take this course but wants a lab/science credit I would absolutely not recommend that they take this course. Especially since this class is only 0.5 credits.",
                "No, I think the experience from in-person lab (which I received first semester) was much more useful and rewarding than virtual lab. If I were giving advice to another student I'd suggest they do it in-person.",

                "Yes i think its good for stem students and pre-Med.",
                "If you don't need it as a pre-req for your major, I would recommend taking it only if you really have a strong interest in chem lab!",
