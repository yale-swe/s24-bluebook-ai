Specifically, we learned about games of complete and incomplete information, and dynamic and static games. I think it was a good overview and intro to many topics in game theory. However, I will say that most of the work we did was a bit too far from reality to be really useful when analyzing real-world phenomenon. I think it's a great place to start with game theory, but if  you want to use it for analysis of real-life decisions, you will probably need more coursework after it.",

My one frustration with this class was that it sometimes felt overly simplistic, like we were spending class after class codifying the obvious. But, by the end of the semester, material went from obvious to very not obvious, so it was good that we had a solid foundation for understanding the more complex material. If you're not sure that game theory is for you, this is a great class to get a sense of what it is!! Professor Turner makes it really approachable, and his segments on political applications of what we learn are really interesting.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of the course are how clear Professor Turner's slides are, and that he doesn't ask too much of his students. Most of the problem set and exam questions could be solved using the same logic as the material presented in lecture. Additionally, I found many of the problems to be interesting and fun to think about. The biggest weakness is I think that the course doesn't do a whole lot of explaining what these things really mean. For example, you learn how to find Nash equilibria, under many  different conditions, but there isn't much discussion of why Nash Equilibria are so important/useful and what it really tells you about an action. I found that I left very able to \"solve\" game theoretic problems, but without as much understanding as to what the different types of solutions meant.",
                "Strengths: I thought the sections were really helpful in solidifying our understanding of the material. The lectures were interesting but could get pretty boring sometimes.\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe more engagement with students during class - some integration of in-class interactive activities could help.",
                "Some strengths of the course was the dedication of the TAs - day or night, weekday or weekend, my TA would respond to my many many emails freaking out about the problem sets. A weakness is the lack of examples we got in order to study for the exams - we had the problem sets to look back on, but it really wasn't enough.",
                "Taught incredibly wellprofessor Turner is great at what he does. He made material that could be confusing very straightforward and digestable.",
                "Love the material and glad Professor made it relevant to the world. In terms of weaknesses, third unit was a bit too much too quickly.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, clear lectures, good feedback, straightforward problem sets, and the TFs were great about offering help. The professor is also just a genuinely nice person, which is always a plus. Appreciated the interesting applications to real political situations. That's probably the biggest reason to take this course over the traditional Game Theory course in the Econ department.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Notation wasn't always clear or consistent. I am pretty sure the point here was to emphasize that they didn't actually care that much--we wouldn't get points off for using some weird notation so long as they could see what we meant--but in lectures I think it should be as consistent and clear as possible. This sounds minor but I think it really affects student learning. I also didn't appreciate a few of the test questions that felt like they had an added twist on them that we really hadn't covered. For instance, last question of the second exam--twist on a theme, but just felt like it was something we hadn't talked about. For some people, that was probably the difference in a letter grade.",

                "Doing the psets alone is a very difficult endeavor, as there are often questions that go beyond the scope of lecture notes.",
                "The class is very well organized into four sections that build off of eachother and go through a full range of game theory techniques. Every lecture and each section builds off of eachother. Having three exams that are focused on the three units is very helpful and makes the class manageable. \r\n\r\nMaybe something I would recommend is having a Ed Discussion board because there were several times I wish I had that space to ask an anonymous question.",

                "Great psets and very fair tests. Good resources. \r\nFelt like the class got a bit repetitive by the end and a little too theoretical.",
                "The lectures are really good and help prepare you for the problem sets, as do the problems in section. I also appreciated that the lectures were recorded so I could go back and rewatch them if I was confused about something. I think the course could be improved by including the political science examples throughout the lectures, rather than in individual lectures. They were interesting topics, but didn't feel super connected to what we were doing on the assignments.",
                "Its an introductory course so you dont need any prior knowledge of economics or game theory, but it is easy to fall behind in the course if you miss a lesson or are confused about a topic. Retention is necessary to do well in the class, so if you dont understand a topic, immediately get help or youll fall behind",
                "Strengths: The exams are not cumulative\r\nWeakness: There is not a lot of support as you do the psets so either find a group or you will struggle. It is offered as a political science focused course but the actual application side is not that present.",
                "Professor Turner is the best professor I've had at Yale. His excitement and engaging teaching style really made this course special. Pretty low workload and fair exams. Professor Turner does a great job at simplifying difficult concepts.",
                "Strengths: kind professor and TAs; they really care about you! They will work with you until you understand the material\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it feels like you didn't appropriately learn what is at the end of psets or exams",
                "The lecture slides were clear and Professor Turner speaks very clearly and takes time to answer questions. Professor Turner did a good job of covering a lot of different skills and concept in a cumulative way over the semester.\r\n\r\nI thought the structure of this class was confusing at times, where it felt like some concepts were introduced but not fully explained until later in the course, or were introduced in one lecture but then never used again afterwards. It was hard to tell what would be important to learn and deeply understand versus what was just going to be introduced and never used again. The textbook was also sometimes helpful, but sometimes now. The TFs were really helpful in addressing questions.",
                "Strengths: The problem sets are a manageable length and actually quite fun. Both TAs (Jen and Daniel) ran great sections that help you feel confident in your ability to do the work. I found it really cool when prof. Turner devoted a lecture to applications in political science, specifically when he talked about the logic behind strategic political decisions. The best times were when he offered his own opinion on some research or on some philosophical question in political science.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The exams are short (50 min each x3 = 2hr 30min total), they decide 75% of your grade, and questions were often graded as full credit or no credit. Thus, if you mess up one question on one exam you can potentially drop a whole letter grade. While the workload and difficulty of the class are manageable, you really have to be on your toes in regards to the assessments.",
                "Strengths: the PowerPoint slides are helpful, but you need to review them on your own for psets and exams to actually absorb the material beyond a rushed 50 min lecture. The professor is good at explaining concepts in different ways that clicks for different people. The psets are straightforward and the exams are fair and largely if not entirely based on the psets.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lecture was sometimes cryptic and explained things in a way that was not conducive to \"this is what you actually need to know\" learning. Discussion sections and the TFs are incredibly unhelpful. There were never any real study guides provided, barely any office hours or review sessions, basically so that you needed a strong study group to be successful.",
                "Strength: Prof. Turner is highly engaging and very knowledgeable. While lectures tend to be dense and require much focus, he does a good Job lightening the material and making it more palatable. \r\nWeakness: Sections were not tremendously useful. However, that might not be the case for you depending on your TA.",
                "This course's lectures were more helpful than the textbook in my comprehension of the material. My observation reflects on Professor Turner's engaging and comprehensive lectures.",
                "Strengths: it was interesting and the professor did a good job of explaining everything to us\r\nWeakness: Being taught new material in section was incredibly challenging for me, and every section felt like a new curveball",
                "I think this course was exceptionally structured and taught. If anything, I almost just wanted it to continue so that I could learn more game theory with Prof Turner. It is just optimized for clarity, engagement, and utility."

Many of the problems are interesting to think aboutl, particularly as you reach the end of the semester. However, I will note that if you really want to use game theory to answer real-world problems, you will need to take more coursework in the subject. The discipline is complicated and you don't get enough complexity in one semester.",
                "I would. I think I learned a lot about game theory and it wasn't an insane workload. However, it wasn't super poli sci heavy - there were only a few applications we discussed. Most of the PSETS and exams centered on the theory part of the course rather than application (which personally I preferred, but it should be known for people considering it as a poli sci-heavy course).",
                "If you think game theory would help you in your career or passion, by all means, take it. Game theory is very versatile, and this versatility is displayed in the course as well. If game theory isn't relevant to your field, like it wasn't to mine, I personally wouldn't suggest this course. It's just very intense and time consuming, and unless it'll provide a payoff (a  reference to the course), I wouldn't recommend it.",

I don't think the material is much different, but I believe the structure might be a little easier, and although we stay at the surface level, at least we do discuss different election, political strategies and principles. As an EP&E major I think this was a good course for my game theory requirement.",
                "Yes, it is a great course where you can learn something pretty useful without having to work 24/7 to get a good grade",
                "I took this class as an economics major (you can petition it to count as an elective), even though it is in PoliSci. I thought the semi-quantitative (relative to the rest of my classes) aspect of the course was a nice complement to econ, but it was also pretty distinct from my usual courseload in the applications. All in all, pretty enjoyable and more worthwhile than the economics department version, which I've heard kills all passion for the subject.",

                "Yes! It's a very straightforward introduction to game theory. Just be mindful that the third and last unit is a lot harder than the previous two, so be prepared to put in more time towards the end of the semester.",
                "Yes, it's not that difficult and a useful skill. Prof. Turner is awesome",
                "Yes definitely! Professor Turner is wonderful and presents the material in an engaging way. The workload is fairly light, so I felt like I didn't have to stress very much about the class and could just worry about learning and enjoying the class. As someone who has never taken an econ class, I think this was a great opportunity to learn the basics of game theory without having to worry about prior knowledge. If game theory seem interesting to you but you don't don't want something too econ/math heavy, definitely take this class!",

                "Yes! Great course if you like logic",
                "Absolutely, not only is it incredibly interesting but there are aspects of this course I have now found myself thinking about in day to day life. This course teaches an amazing skill",
                "Yes if you need the game theory credit id say take it",
                "Good class, easy material and you dont really have to go to class as its recorded",
                "Yes! Great class.",
                "Yes, it is a really good lecture course that will teach you a good amount about game theory without needing any previous econ or calculus. It is not too heavy of a workload, but still offers you a challenge and teaches you something new.",
                "Only if you have to take it",
                "Eh, if u have 2",
                "If you need to take game theory I would take this. If you are just interested in political science I would take a focused seminar that includes formal models in the literature.",
                "Yes! I think this course definitely deepens my understanding of an important political science tool. However, if you do take this course be warned that doing well on the psets can lure you into a false sense of security bc the tests often tested content (often theoretical) that was much harder than what was on the psets. That being said, just be sure to study beyond the scope of the psets and youll do fine.",
                "Yes, especially those looking for an interesting QR credit that isn't too much work. It isn't easy, but all of the content is doable if you try to understand it.",
                "Best professor and class at Yale",
                "Yes, I am not a math person but I still found it engaging and manageable",
                "I would recommend to anyone interested in game theory.",
                "The class falls into a routine of introducing a type of game, learning how to analyze it, and then analyzing a ton of similar games of that type. If all you care about is the grade, you can get good at this sort of pattern recognition and get by while getting nothing out of the class. However, the \"optional\" lectures are the best parts of the course and prof. Turner is really funny when he speaks candidly. Thus, I would only recommend this course if you have time during the semester to occasionally sit back and learn something cool.\r\n\r\nThe exams are 85% exactly what you've done on problem sets and 15% philosophical curveball thrown in by the professor. While the class isn't curved, the lower part of the \"curve\" is filled out by giving basically no partial credit when some part of your response is wrong. It would be more fair to simply make the exams harder, practice exploring the philosophical aspects of game theory, and then be more generous with partial credit.",
                "Yes!! If you're looking for a good, not too overwhelming introduction to Game theory, especially with how it relates to political institutions, this is the class for you! Professor Turner is a gem! He is a really good lecturer: makes things super clear, and makes things fun and entertaining. He is clearly very enthusiastic about and interested in Game Theory in a way that's infectious. My one frustration with this class was that it sometimes felt overly simplistic, like we were spending class after class codifying the obvious. But, by the end of the semester, material went from obvious to very not obvious, so it was good that we had a solid foundation for understanding the more complex material. If you're not sure that game theory is for you, this is a great class to get a sense of what it is!! Professor Turner makes it really approachable, and his segments on political applications of what we learn are really interesting.",
                "Yes! Even if you are not interested in political science, I think this is a great introductory game theory course with great real world applications. However, even Prof. Turner described this course as one he would teach first year PhD students (with certain simplifications, of course), so do not expect this to be an easy class. It will be rewarding, but it will require a lot of work and extra time going over games and their logic.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to a student looking to fulfill a major requirement or even someone interested in game theory. I believe that Professor Turner does an excellent job in teaching this course for students involved in political science and also for students with little to no experience in this area.",
                "Would definitely recommend this course! This is such an important way of thinking, and it is better taught in this class than in any other intro class offered."
