   "comments": [
    "This course is great for people who feel less than confident about their writing abilities in academic contexts. Professor Klemann is the best and teaches you how to make different rhetorical moves that make your writing more concise.",
    "I learned how to develop an original claim and be able to support my claim with primary sources and peer-reviewed articles. I learned how to make a pop-up book. I learned how to analyze a primary source.",
    "I improved my writing skills and my critical thinking skills. I learned how to read and see the gaps in research and writing in order to say something original about the work. This class definitely helped me learn how to think like an academic.",
    "I learned how to develop a debatable claim, warrant a claim, and cite evidence, and other essential skills for writing essays at the college level.",
    "I developed skills in writing that i did not have before taking this class",
    "how to write a college paper",
    "Fundamental writing skills, essential for a lifetime.",
    "I learned how to write academic papers really well",
    "I learned many writing techniques in this course. I learned how to write an introduction and conclusion for a paper, how to develop a working claim, and how to use punctuation-- properly and stylistically. I also developed a better ability to participate in academic discussions with my fellow students, and how to properly cite and give credit to the work of other scholars. I developed skills in close-reading texts and artifacts, and discovered the heavy significance that an artifact has.",
    "I learned a lot in this course. I learned many basic and advanced writing skills that will greatly benefit me the rest of my time at Yale."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of our readings, \"The Library of Babel\" by Jorge Luis Borges, felt irrelevant to the class. Otherwise, most of the readings were engaging, though I do wish more time was spent exploring some of the more complex pieces.",
    "The strengths are that I taught how to write at the college level. I learned how to craft an original and publishable research paper. The instructor was a strength too. I also enjoyed using the Beinecke. A weakness was that the class only met twice a week. I wish we could've analyzed more papers as a class.",
    "This course is very strong at giving feedback on writing and teaching how to approach writing. However, many of the ideas we discussed in class or had to write about were very complex, and I often felt very lost and confused by the material.",
    "I love how the course is held in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. The course was well-taught, and the professor was patient in answering all questions and met with students frequently outside of class. A weakness of the class is the vague instructions for the essays, and the prompts can be better explained.",
    "loved the seminar format with a lot of personal attention from the professor",
    "Strengths: learned writing. Instructor great understanding of students' busy schedules.\r\nWeaknesses: full-class meetings sometimes pointless.",
    "Strengths - professor made herself available, taught us writing lessons that could be applicable. No weaknesses at all",
    "The writing workshops helped my writing process immensely. The layout of the class fostered great discussions; we were asked questions that forced us to come up with our own ideas and conclusions. One of the biggest strengths was the freedom to write about that which you are passionate about for the research paper and our final project. This helped me to express some of my interests and it did not feel like I was being restricted in terms of a very rigid prompt. I think the course be improved with more thorough dissection of some of the more difficult texts.",
    "Strengths: Professor Klemann is amazing and you learn a lot from her. \r\nWeaknesses: some of the classes didnt seem helpful towards the current paper we were working on."

   "comments": [
    "This class is excellent if you want to become a better writer in academic settings. Professor Klemann is one of the best professors I've ever had, and she's very approachable and a good teacher.",
    "Yes because you will learn how to write at a college level in the beginning of your first year. This is valuable moving forward. Also, you can make a contribution to an existing academic conversation, which is rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is interesting and surprisingly complex. It introduced me to a niche branch of academia that I am glad I was exposed to.",
    "Yes, this course helps transition students to write at the college level.",
    "Yes i highly recommend this class to other students.",
    "yes, very engaging and useful, especially for an international student",
    "Yes to fulfill writing credit, this ENGL 114 course is a good one to choose in my opinion.",
    "Yes, especially for any student who is uncertain about their academic writing skills!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as it has provided me with skills in writing and in discussion that I can use in any other course. While very useful for future courses, the material and professor was also extremely engaging and can appeal to students who enjoy a hands-on experience while learning as we had the opportunity to discover multiple artifacts throughout the semester.",
    "Absolutely. My writing ability improved greatly."
