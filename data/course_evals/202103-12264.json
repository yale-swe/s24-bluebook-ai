                "This course focused on depictions of women through the medium of plays and writings from Ancient Greece. In taking this course, I gained a wide breadth of knowledge on classic characters (think Medea, Daphne, Clytemnestra), but also learned about women that have been tucked a little more into the margins (think Thetis, Bacchanal rites). Class discussions were wide-ranging, allowing us to practice making arguments that were out times a little outlandish, but more often than not, helpful for individuals in developing their own particular critiques or points about the text and all it contained. The writing component of this class was particularly nice in its freedom around creative pieces, allowing many of us to experiment with form and style in a way that we hadn't done before. Through these processes, we engaged more thoroughly and thoughtfully with the text. I feel I am better equipped to read plays and ancient texts now, as well as to creatively develop my own responses to literature.",
                "A really wonderfully in-depth understanding of a few stories! There were some really fascinating discussions in this class.",
                "In this class we read various Greek myths and modern interpretations regarding women who in some manner killed others. This was a super interesting class and I really enjoyed all of the pieces we read. As a writing credit, we did a lot of short writing pieces that helped in formulating specific and cohesive arguments.",
                "Read a large selection of ancient literature (mostly Greek) focusing on women characters and violence, as well as several pieces of modern reception"

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: interesting readings, good reading amounts (not too intensive, but not too light as to be eternally procrastinated), creative writing opportunities (without high amounts of stress), and good instructor (Sylva is available, incredibly kind, and knowledgeable about these topics).\r\nWeaknesses: discussions sometimes went on tangents, there were many writing assignments in the course (understandable as it was a WR credit and Sylva ended up adjusting the writing amount for us in the end, but still a bit daunting to start out with), and though feedback was easy to get, tangible grades were difficult to obtain.",
                "This course had really wonderful group discussions on the readings, and also very carefully selected readings-- some of which I liked so much that I went on to read the rest of the book. However, I wish there was some sort of introductory section, where students unfamiliar with classics would be able to be caught up on the details, or at least some readings assigned to properly understand the context and conventions that we were reading in. Despite this though, I learned a lot!",
                "Grading was sparse and inconsistent. Sylva didnt return papers quickly, and we turned in more than one paper without understanding how we were being evaluated. By the end of the term, we had only seen two out of five papers with grades. Also, the lack of prompts or differentiated assignments made it difficult to keep up engagement with the papers throughout the semester. The material and classmates were a huge plus, but Sylvas lack of structure was a big minus",
                "I really liked everything that we read but would say that the class could have been improved with more depth rather than breadth. We focused on each woman for two weeks and I think if we had done fewer women for three week units, that could have improved the level and depth of discussion.",
                "The biggest strength was the small size of the class, which led to really great seminar discussions. I got to know my classmates pretty well and enjoyed hearing their thoughts on the material and reviewing their papers/receiving their feedback on mine. Sylva did a great job moderating the discussions and selecting interesting readings to discuss. I also gained a lot from each of my individual meeting with Sylva, as she really pushed me to expand on my ideas and consider different viewpoints. The biggest weakness was the lack of consistent feedback in the class, as we got back essay grades really late in the semester so I wasn't able to incorporate feedback into my future essays.",
                "I feel like this course could have benefitted from having fewer papers but each paper being longer. That way you could further develop each topic, because 2 pages isnt a lot of space."

                "I would highly recommend! This course was a great addition to my semester, and I really appreciated the chance to engage so thoughtfully with these texts and characters. Sylva helped us develop analyses and critiques that were new to most of us (given that we came from such disparate fields of study) and was quite open to student feedback in shaping the classroom space. I also really enjoyed the chance to write creative pieces, and receive feedback on them. Sylva was also incredibly open to student accommodation, making multiple and varied opportunities for students to engage with the readings/discussions. However, if it's going to stress you out to get grades back in a delayed fashion, I'd also suggest speaking to her ahead of time about it!",
                "Absolutely! Fascinating topic, I totally understand why this class was limited to a smaller size-- it made the learning environment really friendly and personal.",

                "Yes! If you are interested in reading some Ancient Greek stories and discussing themes regarding women in the ancient world this class is great.",
                "Definitely! Really interesting material, not very writing heavy, especially for a WR credit, and good, engaging discussion.",
                "I would recommend this course if you're interested in reading more about women in Greek mythology and you enjoy having interesting discussions with peers.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone whos interested in the classics, this course is excellent for someone who loves Greek fiction. Otherwise, youd find it hard to engage with the material."
