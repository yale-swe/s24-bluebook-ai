I saw a lot of improvement between the first draft and final draft, and by the end of the course, I felt that I had written a number of full-length essays I was really proud of.",
                "Learned to be a more concise and thoughtful writer. We looked at good writing pieces and learned how they managed to make impacts on the reader, then used those techniques in our own writing. Very helpful and even though it was a creative nonfiction class, it helped a lot for my other history/writing-heavy classes.",
                "I was really excited to take this class because I loved the prospect of using writing to explore myself and make sense of my experiences in life. I was worried because I honestly don't consider myself much of a writer, but I wanted to challenge myself to write more. This class definitely did that. I became more comfortable with writing, describing, and being intentional with my words. I gained insights into my own experiences, and I got to try out different styles of writing I wouldn't have before.",
                "This course was an amazing way to reflect on myself while developing my writing skills. The amount of feedback I received for each of my drafts and final papers was very helpful in my growth as a writer.",
                "I improved my ability to write an essay and analyze essays.",
                "I have learnt how to annotate and evaluate reading material more in depth.",
                "Tools for creative nonfiction that will help me in all my future writing endeavors, ability to delve into literature and pick out techniques and strengths of authors and implement (not plagiarize) them into my own writing.",

                "I developed my writing skills through reading, analyzing, and discussing numerous personal essays of varying styles, and then writing five essays in which I attempted to emulate the techniques of these well renowned authors.",
                "I was exposed to a wider range of writing genres within the category of creative nonfiction. I also learned a lot of specific techniques in writing. Specifically, I learned how to study and internalize the techniques of other writers through reading their work and using those techniques in my own writing."

                "The readings in this class were engaging, and Craig also provided helpful feedback, particularly in office hours. I liked the pacing of the assignments; I had enough time to edit my first drafts and turn in final drafts I was satisfied with. One way this class might be improved is if we had more line-by-line feedback, but overall I was very happy with the class.",
                "You are exposed to a lot of different types of writing, so you aren't stuck to mimicking one style of writing. You really get to find a style that works for you. I wish there was more one on one interaction with the instructors in order to get a more personal sense of how to improve.",
                "Strengths: The example essays, the reading we'd do for class, the student-led discussions we'd have over the \"how\" portion of the essays beyond the \"what\"\r\nWeaknesses: I think more emphasis needs to be placed on the \"personal narratives\" portion of the class. I interpreted this as an opportunity for students to explore their own stories and get a better grasp on how to tell their narratives. I tried doing this, but I don't think this was expected despite being a personal narratives class.",
                "This course developed my skills as a writer through its heavy emphasis on revision. Additionally, by reading so many different types of essays from different authors, I was prompted to explore different writing styles within my own texts.",
                "I think this course definitely has a lot of strengths. I really enjoy the conversational energy of the classes. I enjoy being able to break down our readings in detail as a class.",
                "English 120 gave students the opportunity to engage with bite-sized pieces of great, modern literature and pick it apart to improve their own writing. The only weakness I can think of is only having one rough draft for each essay; something that could've helped me improve even more would have been having the opportunity to write and receive feedback on two drafts before turning in the final.",
                "The format of reading one, two, or three relatively short essays and discussing them in class worked well. The system of turning in a draft for feedback before turning in the final version was very helpful. And the class workshop structure was extremely useful. I would not change the class structure, workload, or essay topics.",
                "The strength of this course is the vast amount of writing, reading, and feedback we do. This allows the student to consistently improve throughout the semester.\r\nThe weakness of this course is that, because of the amount of content, it could feel rushed at times.\r\nIn the future, I might recommend cutting one of the sections, and allowing students to either produce a third draft for an essay, or to pick a category for their final essay. For example, after writing my Place essay, I had a lot of new ideas about Place, but because we only produced one essay in that category I was never able to test those ideas out"

                "Yes, particularly if you have any interest in creative nonfiction!",

                "Yes, if you don't want to take 114, I recommend taking this course. It is more creative and allows you to take it in any direction that you choose. The essays are not particularly long and you are given a good amount of time to work on them.",
                "Yes. I feel like I grew as a person and as a writer. By about essay three, I told myself that, regardless of the grade, I was grateful I took Engl 120. The class took writing from one of my biggest academic fears to a manageable homework task.",
                "Yes! This is a great course that I would encourage everyone takes. It helps you develop your writing tremendously, and is also a fantastic opportunity for introspection (since the essays are based on your personal experiences).",
                "Yes, I believe the benefits of the class are very much worthwhile considering the course's manageable workload.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this class. I think this class is a core class that all students should take as it helps you with reading comprehension and helps your to develop writing skills.",
                "Yes!! If any student is looking to largely improve their writing in an engaging, thought-provoking, fun seminar they should definitely take English 120.",
                "Yes. This course does a wonderful job developing your writing persona. If you feel like you havent exercised your creative juices enough, taking this course will put you to work",
                "Yes, certainly. It is a great class to practice and improve one's writing.",
