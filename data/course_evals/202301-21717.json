I feel that I have much better scientific literacy in biotechnology after taking the course and that I can discuss the pros and cons of pursuing particular strategies.",
                "This course is divided up in sections based on the lecturer, so various topics were covered. Among these, we first began with venture capital, genomic technologies, plant biotechnologies, etc. I think this is a great course to gain insight into the biotech field.",

            "comments": [
                "This class is very poorly organized. There is little information provided on grading, timelines, or expectations for assignments.",
                "Strengths: The first half of the course, excluding some unusual guest lectures, was generally well organized and taught across the gamut of traditional therapeutic strategies. I really enjoyed the lecture on biologics. The material from the second half of the course was super interesting--I feel that I now have an up-to-date scientific understanding of treatments for AD and DMD. The structure of the course with two quizzes, two midterms, and participation also felt fair. The quizzes were not particularly difficult.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The organization of some of the lectures was quite poor. Although the learning objectives were supposed to guide us in studying, one lecture had twelve learning objectives (none of which were covered on the final). Some professors rushed through their teaching, making it really difficult to process the molecular pathways studied. Moreover, the writing of the final was unusual. We had ten lectures for the final. There was only one question (of seven on the final) on the first four lectures we had learned. The questions also tended to be remarkably broad or to ask for hyper-specific details of binding. Because of the disorganization of the second half of the course, I have a hard time recommending it. \r\n\r\nThere are also several throwaway lectures of the course. While I appreciated having individuals in the field of biotechnology come in, sometimes their presentations were too general to be meaningful. Stressing the importance of leadership in defining what is important to succeed in the C-suite of biotech, for instance, has little meaning without anecdotes or examples. \r\n\r\nThe course also is not transparent in whether the class will be curved. It would be helpful to know some benchmark of where you stand.",
                "Due to the course being taught by different instructors, the types of questions seen on the first exam will be slightly different from the second. If the second half remains the same in the future, expect more specific questions to be asked. Overall though, the information presented was very interesting.",
                "A pretty novel course topic and the lecturers were great experts on their given topic, maybe a bit more of a structure/insight into exams and grading could help",
                "Detailed and organized development of content and course progression. \r\nStong network of support and clear rules, instructions, and communication.",
                "I liked how we got to hear from different lecturers who each specialized in a given field. This made the class more engaging.",
                "All of the professors had very unique and engaging topics. My one criticism is I wish the discussion section assignments were posted earlier.",
                "I would have liked to see more clinical examples of biotechnology (only two presented were DMD and AD) but course was great nonetheless.",
                "This was such an interesting class, and I really enjoyed the way it was taught with the papers in discussion section that matched the course materials each week. The concepts on the exam were fairly easy but the grading was difficult and for the amount of effort put into the discussion section assignments, it was frustrating that they didnt count for more of our grade.",
                "This is a very good MCDB course. I love the rotation of professors and think their different teaching styles complement each other well.",
                "I liked that it covered a wide range of subjects (drug development, plant biology, genetic engineering, climate change).",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that it has different professors that teach who are expects in the field. It is also very organized.\r\n\r\nHowever, the room where the class was located was not ideal as it was typically too hot or too cold, in addition the vents were too loud such that it was difficult to hear the instructors.",
                "Strengths: the concepts and structure of work\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like the different speakers made the quality of teachings really vary, and sometimes, it was hard to adjust.",
                "I think a strength was the topics that were discussed were really interesting. I also liked that there were multiple lecturers throughout the course. It gave the class an interesting take. However, i kind of wish that we had fewer lecturers so then we could have gotten to know them better. They were only there for 2 weeks at a time, and I think it could have given the presenters more time to delve into interesting topics. I also think that there was a lack of feedback that would have been nice.",
                "I think it is a great course to have an overview of the state of biotechnology nowadays. It would be interesting to expand the section in which entrepreneurship is discussed. For example, it would be nice to have scientific founders explain what is the intentional thinking process behind developing a project that could become a venture.",
                "detailed and very organized class lectures, well-planned weekly section discussions",
                "Strengths: the diverse range of topics covered throughout the semester made this course very engaging. Also, the learning objectives listed at the beginning of each lecture made it easier to process the information presented.\r\nWeaknesses: professors were difficult to get ahold of by email, no clear guidance on studying for assessments.",

                "Yes, I enjoyed this course.",
                "Probably not. It is unfortunate because the content of the class is incredibly fascinating, but I think the teaching and structure around the course falls short. When Professors Crews and Yannick were not teaching the class, I found the content difficult to follow.  There is generally a large amount of background knowledge that is assumed. While this might be understandable for an upper-level elective, professors seemed to believe there was a high degree familiarity with more niche areas of biology like immunobiology. And, because the class is disorganized, the second exam also felt fairly unpredictable which contributes to my overall assessment.",
                "Yes, this course if great for both premed students and students interested in grad school. The workload is not stressful and most lectures are recorded as well.",
                "Absolutely. Even as a non-bio student I was able to learn and explore biological science through a unique lens that introduced me to a new world of possibilities for the future. This course is excellent for preparing you for applications in the fields of research, medical technology, and the \"real world\".",

The experiments and scientific skills you learn are so applicable and relevant to the current market landscape and the papers each week are not only interesting and historic papers in the field of biotech, but give you really good practice at reading study results.",
                "Yes! Please take this course. All the content is really interesting, the professors are great, and it's not too much work. I learned so much from the course and I thought it was really well organized, especially the sections.",
                "Yes, it was an interesting class and I learned a lot, even as someone who is not majoring in MCDB.",
                "Definitely if you want an easyish MCDB class especially senior year that is applicable post grad",
                "Yes. This course offers valuable information about the advances in biotechnology that may not be obtained from a traditional textbook.",
                "Yes, I think it's a great source of general knowledge and gaining extra knowledge on the foundation of some topics.",
                "If you are interested in understanding how technology can be used to help treat people with diseases then yes. If you are a premed then yes because it was an interesting perspective to healthcare.",
