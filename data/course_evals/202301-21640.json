                "The course is very well organized. Problem sets and exams are very helpful in reinforcing course content and are in good agreement with lectures. Material is presented in an easy-to-understand sequence. The solar panel testing lab was incredibly helpful for understanding basic behavior of solar cells and how to test their functioning, and the final research presentation on a topic of the students choice was also a great way to dive deeper into individual interests. Given that class meeting times were always shorter than scheduled, the course would benefit tremendously from covering more topics, particularly semiconductor growth and manufacturing techniques, cell packaging, and module assembly, as all these topics are incredibly pertinent to anyone working in or studying the field, but are currently missing from the course altogether.",
                "Overall, this is a great course! The lectures were always engaging and very clear (and Prof. Xia would stop to clarify anything that was unclear), and the psets were interesting and had us apply a wide range of applicable skills. \r\n\r\nOne way the course could be improved is through increased clarity for some of the homework assignments (for example, for the outline in HW 9 what were different components we should have made sure to include?). Additionally, perhaps the lab could be done a bit earlier in the semester so that there are not 3 major assignments all due around the same time at the end. These are minor though in comparison to the overall great experience of the class!",
                "Strengths: The teaching was great and the TA was phenomenal. Good variety of assignments and a fair workload. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Homework questions were often vague, so more specificity would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: well organized, material was clearly taught, assignments were representative of material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the excel psets werent adding much to the whole experience of the learning and the course could definitely do without"

It built on concepts from previous classes and dove into a super interesting and relevant application of that knowledge. I feel like I really came away with a better understanding of solar cells and could apply this knowledge in other contexts.",
