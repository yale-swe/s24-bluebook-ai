    "This is a wonderful course taught at a comfortable pace by a professor that is invested in the general understanding of principles more than the detailed mathematics. Difficult fluid dymanic based problems are practiced in homeworks while exams are used to show understandings of important principles. Overall a very strong course with lots of learning."
