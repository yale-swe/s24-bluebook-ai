Homework feels impossible some weeks, either because you have no idea how to even start to prove something or you have to solve some ridiculous equations (learn to use mathematica for these). In general, the class is a weird mix between trying to be super rigorous in the math and actually solving games. Class is mostly theoretical while homework can get really computational. Also, office hours and section were Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, while psets would usually come out Thursday and be due Tuesday. Thus we were on our own.",
                "This course was difficult but I learned a lot.",

                "I felt like this course was designed to feel bad and make students feel like they had little direction. In particular, office hours with the professor and TA almost always occurred AFTER problem sets were due, leaving students with little guidance on working through different questions.",
                "This is a difficult course. I think the content covered is potentially useful if you're doing a high level finance or quant position, or if you're going to grad school. Otherwise, this goes more in depth than necessary. I thought the topics were interesting, but I felt like we moved through them too quickly to really grasp them. I think lectures should have had more application, because lectures were mostly theorems or proofs and then I had no idea what I was doing on homework and exams.",
                "Strengths: Hrner is a really incredible instructor and I'd take this course for his teaching alone. I also felt that the problem sets were relevant to what we did in class and really pushed how much I understood the material.\r\nWeaknesses: The exams. I just felt like there was no way I could be prepared for the exams, in particular the final after I had experienced the midterm. I had put in all the effort I could into doing practice problems from psets and past exams, but I felt really unable to apply that knowledge in the exam itself, which felt really disheartening.",
                "Honestly, everything can be improved. garbage",
                "Strengths: Prof. Horner is quite kind and enjoyable lecturer. TAs, especially Alex, were also helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While Professor Horner is an amiable and entertaining lecturer, the material covered in the course lacks interest, and the problem sets fail to facilitate meaningful learning. Professor Horner's lectures were often tangential and focused on complex theorems that left many of us, particularly those of us majoring in Computer Science and Economics (half the class), feeling left out and unengaged. Moreover, the problem sets assigned in the course were often on unrelated topics, leading to confusion and frustration. The lack of feedback on problem sets was another significant issue that further hampered our learning. Furthermore, the class's morale was noticeably poor, and this was compounded by the difficulty of the exams.\r\n\r\nTo improve the course, I suggest Professor Horner should focus on delivering lectures that are more relatable and directly tied to the course material. Additionally, assigning problem sets that are better aligned with the lecture topics and scheduling office hours at times that are more convenient for all students would be helpful. Providing prompt feedback on the problem sets would also be valuable in aiding our learning and understanding of the material. Finally, it would be beneficial to revisit the exam difficulty to ensure that they accurately reflect the course's content and are reasonably challenging for students to complete. Simply put, the class median on the midterm should not have been less than 50%.",

                "I think this class does a good job getting students to think. I think many of the homework problems were interesting, and Professor Horner was an engaging lecturer. However, I don't think that the lectures or notes made feel prepared to do the homework or especially the exams. Not enough example problems were given, and the exams were too time pressured. Additionally, psets were often posted after both section and office hours had passed, meaning we had little time and not much outside support to complete psets that were intentionally very difficult.",

Problem sets were usually released on Thursday nights and due on Tuesday in class, but TA sessions and office hours were held on Tues-Thurs. The questions could be nearly impossible, which meant that most of the time, I could only guess how to solve them, and it was only a week or two later when the solutions came out that I could see what I should have done. There was so much material, and I never knew what I was expected to learn. I thought I would have clarity after the midterm, but it was so ridiculously difficult and curved so intensely that I just continued the semester relying on the fact that problem sets were graded on completion. Office hours should be available to help students with the problem sets, and there needs to be a clearer understanding of what students are expected to learn.",

                "Strengths: the professor and teaching staff are very knowledgable in the material, which you will end up learning decently well by the end of the course. The lectures notes are also helpful. The psets do prepare you decently well for the exam material. Teaching staff were relatively responsive to emails\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures are very difficult to understand at times, mostly because they are very notation and theory-heavy. It was very easy for me to get so lost in the mathematical notation in class that I would completely miss out on the big picture b/c we would spend 45+ minutes of class talking about the justification for a concept w/o me fulling understand what the concept was to begin with. In addition, the timing of homeworks and office hours was pretty bad in my iteration of the class. Office hours were held on Wednesday and Thursdays, but homeworks often wouldn't be released until Thursday (at the earliest) and due next Tuesday, meaning that we would get a maximum of one office hours to ask questions (and at the beginning of the year, some homeworks weren't released until Friday/Saturday if I recall correctly, which would lead to no office hours before homework was due). Since the material in class is so theory-heavy, it was often difficult to apply any those concepts to the homeworks and most of the material ended up being self-taught through the lectures notes and other resources online. Exams were also notoriously difficult (in my opinion, not necessarily because the problems themselves were extremely difficult but because of the amount of problems you were expected to solve in the short time spans they gave for both exams) with averages hovering around 40% for both the midterm and final"

                "While I believe that this course may not be suitable for CS/Econ majors due to its intensity and focus on mathematical theorems, it is a requirement. However, I am pleased to hear that an alternative may be available soon. For Math/Econ students, the course seems to be more aligned with their background and interests, and I noticed that they performed better overall. However, for those of us without a strong background in mathematics, it was challenging to keep up with the pace and understand the concepts, which was frustrating.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the course could be improved by providing more guidance and support to students who may not have the same level of mathematical proficiency. This could be achieved by offering additional resources such as tutorials or workshops. Moreover, the course material could be presented in a way that is more accessible and engaging for all students, regardless of their background. Finally, I would recommend that the course be reviewed to ensure that it meets the needs of all students who are required to take it.\r\n\r\nIf you are neither CS/Econ nor Math/Econ, do NOT take this class.

                "Yes, definitely, but with some caveats. The course is taught very well, the material is fascinating (this is probably the only undergraduate economics course at Yale that teaches the proofs of i.e. Brouwer's fixed point theorem and the existence of Nash equilibrium) and Horner is a very clear and engaging lecturer. That being said, the workload is overwhelming at times, with very long problem sets and very challenging exams. So yes, I'd recommend the course, but keep that in mind when choosing when to take it and what other courses to take concurrently.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in game theory and the mathematical concepts behind many foundational game theory principles.",
                "My feelings about this course are complicated, but in short, no I would not recommend it. Horner is a fantastic lecturer, he is very well versed in the material and might be one the best living theorists, but pain associated with every other part of the course makes it very hard to recommend. The problem sets are weekly, very hard (think 230/231), often posted late, and the solution concepts are almost never taught in lecture/notesmeaning that you must go either to the TAs office hours (which are most often moved or cancelled) or read another textbook. Problem set content is therefore often very different from the exams (or at least the final, he gave us the same exam as the PhD students for the midterm), which makes it hard to prepare for the quick calculations required to do well. This is exacerbated by the fact that many of the midterm and final answer keys had incorrect answers, since those practice exams are the only place to find similar problems outside of a third party. Overall I would say take the course if you feel up for the challenge, but (especially if you have another option in your major) it is very hard to recommend it over 159.",
                "I would never recommend this class to another student. The lack of support and the impossibility of problem sets and exams meant that the class is a little demoralizing. If you have the option, take the game theory class that everyone loves. It sometimes felt as if this class was designed to be hard and for students to struggle rather than designed to challenge students and provide them with an in-depth understanding of game theory. Game theory is fun, but this class is awful.",
                "Yes  with sufficient math background",
                "Disclaimer: my review only applies if Horner is teaching again ---------------------------\r\n\r\nYou will likely see a lot of negative reviews on this page (rightfully so) because this is a hard class and the exams are very demoralizing. I think this mainly stems from how this class is advertised - not only does it require time but compared to ECON 350 (let alone other econ classes) it also requires a lot math (probability and analysis at the very least), and not just confidence in math. Without the prereqs I would imagine one to do fine in some cases but you might be better off taking 159 instead. ---------------------------\r\n\r\nBut! If you are math or econ-math or have the math background, I cannot recommend this class more and I for once in my yale career feel compelled to write an evaluation more than three sentences. There are plenty great things to be said about 159 but I imagine this class will give you much more. Even with games of perfect information (which 159 spends majority if not all of its time on and we spent half before moving onto Bayesian stuff), correlated equilibrium and minimax theorems are such cool ways to think about games. As Horner said, although exams do not involve proofs, how can a math-econ game theory class not cover the proof of the existence of Nash equilibrium? Speaking of exams and psets, while I too feel that they are unnecessarily hard, I'm sure the curve is very generous. Overall, this class is the highlight of my semester and I would recommend you to shop it if you have the math prereqs!",

                "Truly one of the classes that Yale offers. \r\n\r\nWe definitely had a professor. The professor used a chalk piece to imprint some chalk remains on the board while using his vocal chords to produce sounds that students listened to. Some define this as teaching. This is also a class where you receive problem sets that contained words similar to those uttered by the professor in these periods of time that some define as a class. Definitely, some of the problem sets I have done in my life. \r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, this course can be counted among the many that have taken place within the hallowed halls of Yale. The classroom itself had four walls, a ceiling, and a floor, as one would expect from such an esteemed institution. It was within this space that students convened, sitting on chairs and placing their belongings on flat surfaces known as tables or desks.\r\n\r\nDuring these moments of group gathering, which could be referred to as \"lectures,\" the professor ensured that information was transmitted through a process that some may describe as \"education.\" As students, we were not only given the opportunity to observe the professor's skillful manipulation of chalk but also to hear the utterances that emanated from his mouth. These utterances, which could be classified as words, were then assembled into sentences, followed by paragraphs  a true testament to the mastery of the English language.\r\n\r\nThe course materials, often referred to as \"readings,\" contained an assortment of letters, which when read, were said to impart knowledge to the reader. This knowledge was, a non-negative number of times, related to the content of the lectures and problem sets.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the course offered a unique opportunity to interact with fellow students, who could be identified by their presence in the same room at the same time, all sharing a common goal: to complete the course requirements.\r\n\r\nAs the semester progressed, the culmination of these educational components was measured through two significant events: the midterm and the final exam. These exams consisted of questions and problems that required a written response. The class average, a number impressively greater than 0%, served as an indisputable testament to the efficacy of this learning experience.\r\n\r\nIn summary, out of all the classes I have taken at Yale, this has truly been one of them.",
                "Yes, it is truly an exciting and rewarding class, especially for those who are more mathematically inclined. The work may be difficult, but it really made me feel confident in my abilities",
                "There is not much reason to take this class unless you are required to take it or you just love both math and game theory (I fell into the former category until CS+Econ no longer required 351 after I'd already taken it). You and your mental health are likely to be better served taking 159 if you want to learn game theory"
