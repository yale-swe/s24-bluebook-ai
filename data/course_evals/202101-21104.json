CHNS 120 is especially helpful because it really introduces you to complex sentence structures and vocabulary in a way CHNS 110 didn't do necessary (of course, because CHNS 110 is the very first time people are introduced to Chinese). If you're even remotely interested in learning how to speak Chinese, TAKE CHNS 110 AND THIS COURSE!",
