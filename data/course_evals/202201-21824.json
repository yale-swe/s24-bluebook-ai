                "Strengths: the papers are super interesting and relevant and Gerard is a super engaging professor with a refreshing perspective on what purpose economics should serve. \r\nWeaknesses: it's not always clear which papers are assigned which days. Sometimes it's not always feasible to read three papers before a lecture like Gerard expects, and it would be helpful to know (at least roughly) which papers were planning to cover which days. Also, the grading on the problem sets is generally lenient, but it felt super arbitrary. The grade out of 5 is supposed to correspond to a letter grade, but why not just assign a letter grade in that case?",
                "I think that the repetition of the papers was really helpful when it came to learning how to read economics papers. No other class at Yale really emphasized them as much. I liked how Gerard would go through the paper in detail during class and really take time to spell everything out for us. I wish that we didn't only have 3 p-sets worth 40% of our grade. The grading rubric was very unclear from the start and it's rather hard to get an A in this class but an A- is very doable.",
                "Prof is great",
                "Strengths: Extremely well taught, interesting material, great size conducive to learning the material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Slightly ambiguous evaluations. Felt like sometimes you weren't exactly sure what needed to be said to properly answer questions",
                "I enjoyed the structure of the class. Strengths are the way the problem sets and exams were structured. No weaknesses.",
                "Professor Padro was really engaging and his teaching was super clear",
                "Strengths: Professor Padro is a phenomenal professor and a hilarious dude. Take the class to have him. \r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "There could be more problem sets just to get a better sense of what was expected of us. Otherwise the material was engaging and very interesting.",

A lot of the papers we read really changed how I view (global) politics, and I've found them to be super relevant in other political science classes like Comparative Politics and upper level econ.",

                "Light workload and fair exams! Take it if you have basic econometrics\/statistics - will help you be a lot better at reading and interpreting econ literature",

                "Yes! You develop a better understanding of the practical applications of econometric methods and these examples are very interesting.",
