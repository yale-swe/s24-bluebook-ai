    "General overview of separation techniques: distillation, membrane separations, adsorption, liquid-liquid extraction, etc.",
    "Many general skills in viewing chemical reactors, thinking about them logically instead of as some foreign object. This course really built upon the other classes in the major, and I really appreciated the way Van Tassel teaches.",
    "Different methods of chemical engineering separations (distillation, extractions, etc.) and application of (mostly) transport principles to separations problems. Good pulling together of past coursework. Felt a bit more applied and less abstract than previous courses."

   "comments": [
    "This course was good. I feel like we covered just the right amount of material--we were not rushing through things so we got a deep understanding of the topics we covered rather than trying to cover as many chapters as possible.",
    "Problem sets didnt really correlate with knowledge gained in lecture. I care less about derivations (most of lecture) and more about applications. Especially at end, I didnt really know how to solve problems since I only had qualitative knowledge and formulas.",
    "Go over more examples that are homework-level in difficulty during lecture since much of what was covered in lecture wasn't very helpful for the homework and tests. Also, choose better homework problems. The problem sets were ridiculous since lectures didn't really help with completing them and often times the homework problems were worded incorrectly or would expect us to make obscure assumptions. This led to the homeworks taking a lot of time and effort yet I still feel like I didn't get a lot out of doing them since most of the time was spent deciphering what the problem wanted or what assumptions I should make instead of understanding the topics.",
    "I really enjoyed Van Tassel's lecturing style, he seemed to really care about the material, but there was often large disconnect between lecture material and homework, and likewise between homework and lectures and exams. Out of the two midterms, one was extremely difficult, and one very easy, I had no way of predicting what material he would test.",
    "Strengths: ties together previous subjects (thermo, fluids, transport) quite nicely. \r\nWeaknesses: scope and difficulty of course material varied widely across lecture, textbook, homework, and exams, which make it difficult to tie everything together or assess where we were supposed to be in terms of ability to solve a certain caliber of problem, or which concepts were important to pay attention to.",
    "Teaching was great."

   "comments": [
    "This course is interesting! It pulls knowledge from transport phenomena and thermodynamics and you get to see how those principles are applied to actual processes. If you are looking at this review, you probably have to take it, but it is one of the least painful upper-level chem eng classes!",
    "This was one of the better chemical engineering courses. The problem sets are very hard, but they are only assigned bi-weekly. The lectures were not overly complicated and the exams were reasonable.",
    "Don't take it unless you absolutely need to.",
    "You're taking this because you have to. If you're interested in some applied science courses, find something else."
