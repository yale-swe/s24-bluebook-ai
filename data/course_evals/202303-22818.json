                "I loved this course: in examining songs as pieces of literature and poetry, I was able to develop an understanding of the works of Bob Dylan as conveying a greater truth about the world -- often pertaining to authenticity, mortality, love, and justice -- through discussion and reflection. Further, I was able to develop a framework for understanding, critically examining, and thinking about other musical pieces as conveying a greater truth about the world, which I will take with me as a listener of music for the rest of my life.",
                "I learned how to analyze lyrics as literature. I also learned how to analyze the melodic and instrumental aspects of a song. I learned about Bob Dylan's perspectives on life, and how his views influence and relate to my own.",
                "I gained a much greater understanding of Bob Dylan and his music (obviously) but the class was so much more than just that. I really learned to appreciate his music as an art form and learned so much about this one mans journey through life, with all its ups and downs. Most of the work we did was poetic analysis of his lyrics, so I would definitely say my skills in that area improved as well. I feel like I can look much deeper into a text, and the fact that it was music we were analyzing, not just poetry, made me much more engaged in the class than I would have been otherwise.",
                "I developed strong lyrical and musical analysis skills, as well as a deep understanding of Dylan's career, musical evolution, and the changing political and social context in which he created his art.",
                "I gained a greater appreciation for close reading due to this course. I decided to take this course because of my love for Bob Dylan, and I have gained a higher appreciation for him as a storyteller throughout all different eras of his life. I have always considered myself a \"lyric person\" when it comes to music, and this class has only led to further evaluations into the lyrical content of other songwriters I enjoy. The course also led to my exploration into modernist poetry, something I wish to do throughout my time at Yale.",
                "This course helped me learn how to approach intimate readings of literature and songs. The seminar style taught me how to think; each perspective was a new way to approach a Bob Dylan song I had not heard before.",
                "We learned to critically delve into texts through Dylan's literary genius. Through each album, classmates were challenged to dissect Dylan's dense linguistic prowess as well as distinct musical flourishes.",
                "I learned how to draw parallels between the music that I listen to and real life; I learned how to find stories, politics, love, loss, and life in musical notes and isolated lyrics. I developed a new skill in musical analysis - listening critically with my ear rather than reading critically on the page - and I loved the dynamicity and nuance that this offered to my time in the course."

            "comments": [
                "S: Fantastic teaching, great discussions which other students that exposed me to different points of view about Dylan's music, very accessible professor who was always hosting open office hours where we could develop our ideas and go into more depth with him, and a fantastic selection of assigned readings that contributed to an understanding of the meaning of the songs, as well as the history behind them. \r\nW: as this was the first time this course was taught, the framework for the assignment prompts was a little bit underdeveloped, but I think that after teaching the course over more and more semesters, an intuitive framework for prompts and the schedule for listening to the songs will come naturally.",
                "The strengths of this course are the in-class discussions and writing assignments. One weakness is that it occasionally can be hard to find opportunities to speak in class. The course could be improved by limiting the time a student has to make a point. Such a limit would make it easier for everyone to speak.",
                "The class was very strong on the discussion side of things, as every class was just an open talk about whatever the assigned listening was that week. It was definitely not hard to participate and when you did, you always felt like your ideas were really being taken into consideration. It was a very cool class to have taken because everyone in it was so passionate about the class, so discussions were always very interesting. I thought the only weakness was the lack of feedback when it came to discussion posts. I would have liked a little bit more guidance on whether or not I was approaching analysis correctly and how to improve my writing skills.",
                "This course was fascinating and extremely comprehensive as we studied dozens of Dylan albums and likely hundreds of songs. The class discussion was lively and Professor Barasch guided the discussion in fresh directions with supplemental readings and media. All participants were very involved and the caliber of discussion greatly increased over the course of the semester.",
                "Strengths: I love the linear structure of the course, quite the opposite of much of Dylan's songwriting. The course followed Dylan's entire discography in chronological order. This allowed for much comparative study of Dylan's music across albums and periods. I loved the weekly song/theme analyses in the class. It allowed for me to hone in my writing and be more concise in my analysis of poetry. I also loved the major papers for the class, especially the final paper because I was able to talk about a theme which I saw across many songs throughout Dylan's career. To track a theme is to also see how it changes, and as a way to end the class, the paper succeeded in allowing for me to evaluate my appreciation for Dylan's craft as a result.\r\nWeaknesses: The course could have included more aspects of media to a certain extent. The purpose of the class, at its core, is to appreciate the craft of Dylan's words, not to evaluate his character through his actions. However, certain documentaries like Don't Look Back, Eat the Document, and No Direction Home allow for those to get into the mind of Dylan on a much more personal basis. The class could have evaluated these movies and how they succeed or not succeed in allowing the audience into Dylan's world.",
                "Strengths- fun, interesting, engaging\r\nWeaknesses- slow at times, grading was sketchy",
                "The class is incredibly well structured and allowed us to grow as critical readers of text along with Dylan's personal and musical growth. That is the class' genius. We are able to more astutely dissect his work as it grows more complicated.",
                "Strengths: great classroom discussions, open-format engagement, the concert (real world application of course material!!!!!!), office hours and the conversations they prompted\r\nWeaknesses: class sometimes bordered on hero-worship of Dylan, and I wish we had looked at him as more of a nuanced figure and recognized some of his downsides/faults"

            "comments": [
                "If you like Bob Dylan, Folk music, or just music in general, I would recommend it. It provides a fantastic framework for understanding lyrical music through the lens of literature, where a song can have just as much meaning, depth, and complexity as a poem from Walt Whitman. It was a very enjoyable class, with a great professor, and will attract people who are similarly passionate about music, but who maybe have different views about its interpretation, which will lead to fruitful discussions and the creation of complex understandings of his songs.",
                "Absolutely. This course is one of the most interesting classes I have ever taken. Analyzing music instead of other forms of literature makes this class unique on campus.",
                "I would recommend the class, particularly to people who really enjoy his music. As someone who had never listened to Dylan before the class, it was definitely harder to me to get into the material compared to some of my more passionate classmates. However, if you dont know anything about Bob Dylan, I still think this was a very cool class to have taken, and I gained a significant appreciation for him as an artist which I never would have otherwise.",
                "I would no doubt recommend this course to another student. It has to be my favorite course at Yale thus far. I now know a ton about Dylan's career, but I am also able to analyze and appreciate music and poetry of all types at a much higher level.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student under the premise that they appreciate poetic verse and lyrical content. This is not a \"gut\" course. It is not a survey of an artist's career in regards to their relation to the socio-cultural structures of their heyday. As previously mentioned, it is at its core a class teaching collegiate-level close reading through Dylan's verse. A student does not need to be a diehard of Bob Dylan or familiar with all of his music, but the student should be open to exploring the history of popular music in the 20th and 21st century in general and lyrical content on the level of Dylan in particular. The student should not be fooled with the course looking like a way to just listen to music as assignments. In-depth analysis of a multitude of songs per album is required for the class to operate, so there is a lot expected of students to be able to have a coherent class.",
                "Yes, it's a great class to take if you are interested in music, even if not a Bob Dylan fan. I was not before this class but now I definitely am. Light and fun.",
                "Yes! It was a unique class that broadened my understanding of what a college class can be. I will forever listen to music differently after taking this course."
