    "I developed a broad range of skills and gained knowledge related to coastal adaptation and management as well as state and municipal-level decision making. We utilized a range of interdisciplinary perspectives including public health, economics, sensor design as well as urban design and case study analysis.",
    "This class was useful to learn about coastal resilience and urban design strategies and how climate change adaptation strategies can also address existing urban stressors.",
    "This course introduces you to a wide range of new tools--GIS, economic modeling in Excel, use of GIS\/mapping tools in Matlab--and teaches you how to evaluate the socioeconomic\/ecological\/land-use conditions of communities at different scales, from neighborhood to watershed."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: super interesting subject\r\nweaknesses: sometimes lack of organization between students \/ tas \/ professors",
    "The course was great as it incorporated such a diverse range of perspectives and approaches into the multidisciplinary and difficult problem of coastal management. We covered a lot of breadth, which was fascinating. What was challenging sometimes was completing assignments without having as much depth and knowledge in each particular field. If the class work was more structured along with the lectures and if we had received more feedback on our earlier assignments, the class would be incredible.",
    "This class was very project based, which was a great way to learn how to apply the theories of development we learned to real world scenarios. The course could have been more quantitative and involved more engineering.",
    "The course was very strong in its content- offered a very comprehensive overview of the many facets of urban planning and disaster risk management. Readings and assignments were regularly uploaded to Canvas for reference. Sometimes the assignment requirements were unclear but Professor Felson and the TA were available to answer any clarification questions and revise assignments as needed."

   "comments": [
    "The class focuses on coastal adaptation to sea-level rise and storm surge management and employs a broad range of disciplines such as public health, economics, GIS-modeling and engineering to address these problems. The focus on CT makes the class very interesting and you learn a lot about so many different disciplines by focusing on a very important, long-term problem. Professor Felson is a leading scholar and also a practitioner in the field, so you also get to meet a lot of guest speakers that are in state-level decision making. The class was a bit experimental as it was run concurrently as an undergraduate class for the first time, however, it was fascinating. If you're interested in environmental protection and urban design, adaptation, and management, as well as utilizing green infrastructure, this is the best course out there.",
    "This course is cross listed as engineering, architecture, and FES, but it barely had any focus on engineering. All in all, it was kind of mediocre and not particularly well organized. Lectures were very general and didn't have much structure to them. That's not to say that I didn't get value out of the course, which I definitely did, but the type of student who would succeed in this course must be very self motivated to learn hard details outside of class to supplement general conversations in class.",
    "Yes- absolutely! You leave it with a problem-solving framework for tackling a municipal or multi-municipal issue, a framework that engages with different disciplines to holistically contextualize the issue. Issues could range from future storm risk to public health concerns like poor air quality or stress and anxiety exacerbated during a disaster. Overall- an amazing course that will impart a new skillset for urban planning for future scenarios."
