   "comments": [
    "The class structure was very conducive to learning the language. I think the class did a good job of facilitating conversation and engagement with the language.\r\nWith that said, I think the course required way too much work. The relentless barrage of assignments may have contributed to learning, but it made it stressful and disprportionately time consuming relative to the marginal benefit of the extra work.",
    "I like the structure of class discussions which allow us to practice speaking frequently. I think we glance over the grammar sometimes, and we could spend more time addressing questions about grammar and exceptions to the rules which are sometimes left out of the course packet\/textbook information.",
    "This courses strength was its requirement of engaging with difficult French readings to get us to really learn more advanced French vocabulary",
    "The course is very well organized, making it easy to follow the syllabus. The regular assessments allow you to track your progress. A good balance of class time was spent working on grammar and discussing texts. Also, the bank of vocabulary in the course packet is excellent.",
    "The course was always fun and engaging class discussions never failed to make me laugh! Sometimes, I wish we read a bit slower because reading was hard to keep up with.",
    "The course is well organized with interesting literature. Furthermore, there was a large focus on the spoken French, which I greatly appreciated."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is determined to learn French and pursue it further. If you're just looking to satisfy a language requirement, as I was, I would not recommend it. It was way more of an investment than I had realized going in, and there were times when I felt overwhelmed and that the commitment was not worth the gain for me.",
    "Yes; although it was a large workload, I improved my French skills a lot.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially with Professor Schneider! This was hands down my favorite course this semester, mostly because of her. She was always so energetic and so determined to teach us as well as possible. The books we read and the movies we watched were thoroughly enjoyable, and the analysis we conducted in class was enlightening and interesting. I am so much more confident in my grammar and writing after taking this course, and my love for French is greater than ever! That said, we are all different -- so take this course if you're willing to put in about 2 hours of work every other day and if you love the language. You won't regret it.",
    "Yes, if they want to keep up their French skills.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless its required for the major. I took the course to keep engaged with the language so that I wouldnt get rusty, but I dont feel as if my conversational skills really improved at all. I just learned more obscure vocabulary that would not be useful.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class to someone who takes their studies of French seriously. If you are willing to put in the time to study the texts and content properly, it is very rewarding.",
    "Yes, but the amount of work is unreasonable at times. One week can have reading, an essay, a film, and grammar exercises, among other assignments. Only take this course if youre determined to improve your French.",
    "No  it's so much work for only one credit. I took it Credit-D, which took a lot of the pressure off, but nevertheless, you will be spending 99% of your free time on French!",
    "This course is a wonderful continuation of the French sequence and allows you to build up on the base it provides you. I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in pursuing French on a higher level."
