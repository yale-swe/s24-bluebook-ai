    "I gained more insight into and understanding of Russian intermediate grammar, and definitely got stronger in terms of tackling larger-scale projects on more specific fields of knowledge (while writing everything in Russian). Of course, my vocabulary expanded considerably as well, and\r\nI can understand more casual Russian conversation. My reading and writing skills increased to match.",

    "The weaknesses of this course...I might just be a lower-level student, or this could be because I have a summer internship as well, but I found the pace of the course brutal. I barely had any free time this summer. I understand that the pace has to be this way since we're cramming in so much material in such a short amount of time, but I think going more slowly over the exercises would help. I think that the fill-in-the-blank exercises are the most useful, and more time could be spent on relative to other exercises.\r\n\r\nThe strengths of this course include highly responsive professors and teaching assistants, plenty of supplementary material to build knowledge, and simply good content in general. The exercises we do on the whiteboard help immensely as well.",
    "Strengths: amazing, engaging professor; extremely organized curriculum\r\nWeaknesses: probably just in the context of summer session, but quite fast-paced, which still has its benefits",
    "The course was excellent"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, its an effective way to spend your summer and engage intellectually. Just be prepared to spend a lot of your time working over the summer. A strong sense of time management and motivation helps a lot too.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student who's highly interested in Russian and is capable of handling a large workload; otherwise, burnout would happen.",
    "Yes! It's great that L3 and L4 still use the same foundational textbook and exercises to provide a smooth transition from L2",
    "Study every day and don't get behind on nightly homework\/vocab lists"
