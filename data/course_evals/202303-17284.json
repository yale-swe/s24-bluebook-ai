                "I developed a comprehensive understanding of the Private Equity investment class, both at a high level, and at a more in depth level for late stage buyouts. I learned and practiced applying a framework for evaluating investments. I learned about the structure of private equity funds, the history of the investments, the legal pitfalls surrounding LBOs, the importance of leadership of companies, the variety of different ways in which companies can create or destroy value, the optimal organization of capital stacks, the proper integration of investors, and how to organize claims in order to align interests.",
                "Tons of knowledge regarding PE. We went through 3 textbooks of information. Pretty much everything about PE that you can think of, not gonna list through it, but you can look at the info in the textbooks.",
                "I learned a lot from every possible perspective of private equity investing not just as a private investor but also as an investment bank, lending bank, a lawyer, business owner. The knowledge and skills we learn span across accounting, finance, leaderships, finance, investing.",
                "The ins and outs of private equity investing and the philosophy around investing in general. Technical and non-technical aspects were discussed in detail. The course also teaches important but rarely discussed topics at the junior level, such as fund structure, incentives, tax structures of different transactions, etc.",
                "How private equity deals are structured and everything that needs to be considered in order for a deal to close. This class covers (literally) 3 textbooks worth of material at a very in depth level. 2\/3 of the material is hard facts you need to understand, and 1\/3 is almost fluff, teaching you how to structure your thinking.",
                "Learned a lot about corporate finance with a focus on credit rating\/debt, company valuations, built upon financial modeling skills.",
                "You will develop a coherent framework by which to judge Private Equity Investment decisions. Professor Schmertzler's decades of teaching experience combined with his professional experience in the field make this a must take for anyone interested in not only PE, but finance in general."

                "Strengths: I feel so much more knowledgeable about PE and very prepared to speak on the subject in conversations as well as interviews\r\nWeaknesses: None (lots of reading- but it is worth it!!!!)",
                "Professor Schmertzler is the strength of this course. He is incredible and so vastly knowledgeable. The course may have been slightly too large this year with 25 students, however, and might be better in a format of 15-20 students who are more engaged on average. I think for the course to be excellent requires full student buy-in.",
                "The biggest strength of this class was the level of engagement required to keep up. It forces students to be up to speed on all the material in a way dissimilar to any other classes I've taken. While I think this high level of class participation is a great strength of the course, it could also benefit from one or two more deliverables in my opinion. The cases that we do in class are fantastic, but possibly requiring students to turn in some deliverables on top of the participation expected in class might give another opportunity to receive a grade and some feedback.",
                "Strengths: excellent professor, useful content, learned a ton.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "There could be some office hour sign ups given that there were only a few opportunities to interact with the Professor before class time.",
                "Incredibly collaborative and discussion oriented class. Very engaging and everyone's enthusiasm pushes you to do the work properly and learn as much as you can. Could benefit from additional in-person activities, though there are already many.",
                "I like the class, but there is basically no feedback on any of your work. You literally have no idea where you stand in the class or how you can improve at all.\r\n\r\nI loved the case studies. Prof Schmertzler provides you real world scenarios you need to think through by yourself, struggle, and in 90% of the cases, fail. However, I took the most out of these classes and cases. They really expose the gaps in your knowledge and what you should be paying more attention to.",
                "I think this course is excellent. Some chapter readings can be a little dense, off the top of my head I remember the reading on convertible debt felt a little confusing. I think classes are super engaging and the course teaches valuable skills for careers in finance.",
                "Incredibly engaging seminar discussion style. Prof Schmertzler likes to cold call, and the class is better for it. This level of accountability keeps the entire class engaged, but one area where this could be improved is in group work. More accountability in group work or less group work overall would likely improve learning outcomes on the whole."

                "Absolutely. It is a great class.",
                "Yes, absolutely, if you have any interest in finance or investing. This class makes up for Yale's lack of any practical courses.",
                "Yes, I think this class provides a unique opportunity to learn from a professor with an incredible amount of experience and knowledge in the industry, and the level of participation required from the course is extremely conducive to learning.",

                "I would recommend it to anyone interest in finance, regardless of the specific industry or field, as long as they have some background in terms of internships or courses as the course doesnt always cover the basics. You get a lot out of the class if you put a lot into it, which can be a lot of work. However, this is not a class in which students can slack off as the Professor cold calls for every assignment and reading.",
                "Absolutely. Whether or not you are interesting in private equity, it is a worthwhile course with a truly incredibly professor. It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes! If you want to go into an investing role, you should absolutely take this class. It teaches you everything that you can technically learn on your own, but let's be honest, you probably will never force yourself to sit down and actually do it. Don't come in expecting to learn a lot of modeling mechanics. This class assumes that you already have a working knowledge of how to build an LBO, link and operating model, build sensitivity tables, etc. The focus of the class is not modeling. It is how to look at private equity deals and see if the terms are favorable enough to invest in it. It teaches you everything you need to consider before closing a deal ranging from debt terms to anti-dilution methods. It is closer to a \"legalities of private equity agreements\" than a \"I'm going to teach you how to make an LBO and be successful in PE technical interviews\"\r\n\r\nSide note: you will be cold called in class, so you have to prep the material thoroughly beforehand. There is no slacking off in this class.\r\n\r\n A lot of the reviews say this class is a lot of work, and it is, but most of it is just reading the textbook. The lecture is used to clear up any questions you have about the material and for Prof Schmertzler to emphasize what he thinks is most important. We also do a lot of in class cases.",
                "Yes. If you're planning on going into finance, especially PE or banking, I think this course is a must take. You definitely need to commit some time out of class doing the readings and cases, but it extremely beneficial in understanding corporate finance and also builds upon your financial analysis\/modeling skills.",
                "Absolutely. Must take for anyone interested in investing."
