                "I have learned more in this capstone than in my other Yale courses combined. Early in the course, I learned a lot about how the global health system works, what issues exist, and how consultants in the real world tackle these issues. The most prominent skill early on was deck building, which Prof. Soe-Lin emphasized from the outset and continually honed throughout the course. Another frequently trained skill was interviewing experts, which I found to be very helpful as I move forward in my career. I had the opportunity to be a team leader in this capstone project and was able to learn how to effectively delegate, meet deadlines, and manage a team in both technical and social aspects. Our project ended up being very focused on statistics and data science and thus relevant skills were further developed as well."

                "Strengths: Prof. Soe-Lin is focused on making you a better student, professional, and leader. Expectations were clear, help was provided when needed, and feedback was welcome in both directions. This project felt like a real consulting work environment, which was familiar to many of us in the group. While we were nervous about this project before beginning, Prof. Soe-Lin was very comforting and empowering to all of us right from the start. This project is a LOT of work but feels absolutely worth it in the end. This project felt like it had lots of tangible impacts, honed a wide set of skills, and provided one of the best team environments I've ever had. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very high workload, will have to be the focus of your semester. Was very difficult to manage other extracurricular activities alongside this, but this project was highly fulfilling which made it worthwhile. You will be making a deck (sometimes 2) almost every week, have very tight timelines on hefty tasks, and be expected to be continually updating your knowledge and doing interviews with stakeholders and experts in that time."

                "I absolutely would recommend it, but only if you are ready to put in the work. Even an occasional slack-off will be difficult, especially as a leader. This capstone project was very demanding but equally rewarding. If you plan on taking this course be sure to take it easier on the rest of your course load. I took this with 1 elective Cr/d and 3 other <3.5 workload courses and found it to be manageable.",
                "Yes. Prof Soe-Lin is a gem. She pushes everyone on the team but also herself to be a better instructor. We all held each other accountable throughout the semester to be better collaborators and thinkers. I recommend choosing a project with her if you want to put in the work and produce something of value with your capstone. It won't be easy but it will be fun, productive, and probably the highlight of your semester."
