In the second unit, we discussed Kun and Peking style operas. In the third unit, we learned about popular music and international influences on Chinese music which was really fascinating.",

                "Strengths - manageable workload, enjoyed the movie day\r\nWeaknesses - presentations during class often just summarized the readings and not much of the class discussion worked to interpret or understand the readings past summaries",
                "Great Professor and Assignments! Fantastic Class!",
                "This course was a strong course with a great syllabus. I really liked the readings and how there was a variety of readings plus audio\/video content for each class. The professor provided quick feedback weekly for all our assignments and was incredibly responsive generally. The only suggestion for improvement I would have would be for very heavy topics like those touched upon in \"Farewell My Concubine,\" it might be useful to provide students with trigger warnings in advance.",
                "I really enjoyed this course! It was super engaging.",
                "I love how welcoming, open-minded, and stress-free this course is. The workload and assignments are friendly for non-music majors, non-history majors, non-East Asian Studies majors, and majors alike! Discussions and readings are open-ended, insightful, and not overwhelming. The professor provides specific feedback on each assignment too so you always know what is expected and can learn from your progress.",
                "The strengths are small class size, engaging material and format via discussions, presentations, weekly response consisting of what we found interesting in the readings, and the professor's organized teaching style. The weaknesses are the amount of depth that we delve into for each topic which is understandable due to the class's once a week schedule and 1:30-3:20pm time period. However, the material was really interesting to learn about so sometimes I wished that class could have been longer or could have focused on the new information using even more context and background.",
                "Strengths: interesting and engaging readings, well taught, lively discussion, broad scope of material covered (not just traditional music but also pop\/vernacular music); I really enjoyed the addition of the film midway through the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The readings each week were generally well selected and always organized around a specific theme\/topic which was helpful. I would have loved it if the class could involve more analysis of the music itself."

                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to any student interested in learning more about Chinese music. This class does a great job of covering a huge breadth of Chinese music from the Ancient times to modern day. Professor Jiang is also very knowledgeable in this subject and the amount of work she does before class definitely shows.",
                "Yes! Professor Jiang put a lot of work into the class and its syllabus. The course readings are interesting and engaging, and I really enjoyed the flexibility of the reading responses and final paper. The class worked to foster actual interest in the material rather than simply asking people to comment on the material. With its engaging nature, low workload, and flexibility in exploring, this class is a great choice for anyone."
