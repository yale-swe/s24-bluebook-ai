                "Broad exposure to key concepts in forest ecology and stand dynamics.",
                "I gained much more technical knowledge about forests, as I had come in only knowing about how forests are being used for carbon storage. I learned how to read scientific papers much more quickly through the readings of the peer learning communities and the annotated bibliography. Overall, I am walking away with a better appreciation and keen eye for forests that I would likely not have learned elsewhere.",
                "Learned a lot about tree architecture and the ways that trees can grow and change over time.",
                "I learned about the processes of forests, gap dynamics, succession, etc.",
                "I learned about forest dynamics... the way in which trees grow, disturbances, and the intricacies of how forests change and grow with time.",
                "A broad collection of very important concepts of forested ecosystem, as well as the related implications for land use relationships/issues.",
                "A completely new insight into the natural environment. I learned about forest structure, tree architecture and the human interaction with forests.",
                "I learned about forest dynamics, applied forest science, disturbance and regeneration, and climate change in forests.",
                "I learned about the biological processes that shape stand dynamics. I learned to read ecological papers.",
                "I learned so much about forests and trees. Forest structure, stand dynamics, identification, disturbance dynamics, and so much more.",
                "I learned tons of information about how forests develop through time and space and about how they interact with the world around them whether through disturbance, climate, anthropogenic influences, animals, etc.",
                "As Marlyse says, this course is forestry through a fire hose. Lots of concepts are covered in a short period, not too in depth. Terrific class overall, but certainly a good amount of time + work to go along with it. \r\n\r\nCommitments are lecture, weekly reading group, weekly place in the woods exercise, all in addition to homework of course.",
                "I learned basic forest ecology.",

                "Understanding of forest succession, nature of disturbances and their effects on stand development, and many amazing things about trees (including methane from inside the tree -- totally crazy). The course really does transform the way that you look at and interact with the forest.",

                "I learned so much about forests in this class! It completely changed the way I look at the woods. We learned about trees, forest development, threats to forests, forests & climate change, and so much more. I also improved my observational skills from the PITWs exercise.",
                "This course develops a great breadth of forestry knowledge, balancing itself between theory and application. We covered a lot of ground. This is the equivalent of a survey literature course, but for forestry. I also learned a lot about the joy of just taking an hour a week to be alone in the forest.",
                "I learned a lot about trees and forests. I learned how to think of/look at forests with more complexity.",

                "Basics of forests and stand dynamics",
                "I was able to learn so much about the dynamics of how forests stands work. We think of trees as hardy organisms that last for a long time, but a forest is not a monotonous, forever-stable landscape: it will change and it can change drastically between the span of a day to lifetime. We learned about plant interactions and communities, succession, tree architecture and growth, disturbances, forest structures and development, tropical forests, urban forests (to include fragmentation and edge effects), plant ID, regeneration and stand establishment, competition and gap dynamics, the forest floor, old growth trees, and climate change.",
                "This course provided a broad overview of forest systems. It covered the individual plants comprising forests, as well as the dynamics that change them.",
                "This felt like a really good introduction to plants, trees, forests, ecology, and environmental science in general. An important skill I learned was reading scientific papers.",

                "I gained an understanding of forest development pathways and the processes that influence them, learned how to read scientific papers, and have a greater appreciation for forest structures and compositions. I also learned how to write an annotated bibliography.",
                "How to read scientific papers and come to scientific understandings about topics in forest dynamics. Greater understanding of how forests work and why this matters.",
                "This course was absolutely phenomenal.  I learned all about forest ecology, growth and disturbance dynamics, and became much more comfortable reading, understanding, and synthesizing scientific literature.  One part of the class was spending 30 minutes each week in my place in the woods which was incredibly valuable in applying class concepts to the real world.  I entered the class knowing nothing about forest ecology and it was structured to be accessible both to students with no prior knowledge and those with some prior experience.",
                "Weekly field journals, literature review and lectures on content. Lots of information on stand succession. Also lots of guest speakers.",

Through the weekly field journals, discussion sections, and the multiple drafts of our final bibliography, this course kept me consistently engaged and learning. I especially learned a lot about forests' role in climate change over the course of this semester, which has greatly improved my scientific literacy when I read about global warming and other scientific phenomena in the news. I can now understand scientific papers much better than I did at the beginning of this semester!",

                "It definitely would work better in its original seminar form, but I'm glad that I was able to take it because it was uncapped. The student-led discussion sections could be a bit dragging at times, especially when everyone started to get really busy. I really liked the weekly forest field assignments however, having to spend time outside definitely was good for me.",
                "The main strength of this class is the place in the woods assignment where you go to the forest once a week and apply the concepts from class. It really helps to put all the theoretical stuff into context.",
                "This course aligned with my philosophy on learning, and I appreciate that we had multiple different ways to interact with the course material. The course moved slowly, though, and I would have been more engaged if the same topics hadnt been repeated multiple times.",
                "While the course had a large class size, lectures were engaging and interesting. The staggered nature of assignments was extremely helpful. There was a lot of support for students struggling.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- a lot of TFs and hence a lot of support available\r\n- professor/TFs excited and enthusiastic about sharing their work (that is not the case in every class)\r\n- introduction to a variety of topics within forestry\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- disorganized at times\r\n- peer learning communities felt less required than a traditional discussion section and there was no accountability if others did not show up or came late",
                "Strengths: Guest lectures kept things really exciting and I do think the midterm was a pretty fair evaluation of skills and knowledge from the class. \r\nWeaknesses: I think it'd be awesome if there could be more engagement during lecture. I liked one guest lecture we had from David woodbury where he had polleverywhere questions so frequently to keep us engaged with the material. Otherwise I also think the lectures could benefit from more video material or other. With so many people it is really easy to just stop paying attention. Also the fact that it was a 9am was brutal.",
                "The topics were very interesting, and the teacher is amazingly considerate.",
                "Strengths: I really liked going to the forests weekly to observe how my place in the woods changed and grew as the semester progressed and as the seasons changed. Marlyse was very chill and relaxed about grades, and I really appreciated her making the finals exam more accommodating with open note/no time limit exam over a four day period. Perhaps a final review session (especially since the exam is cumulative) would have definitely helped. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nIn the ways that it could be improved, I think it was little difficult to stay engaged with the subject especially because Marlyse would sometimes go off topic about certain things when lecturing on lecture material. I also remember when I was studying for the midterm, I hopped on office hours for a TA, but he was not able to answer questions about the lecture material and just referred me to the slides instead. It was a little hard communicating with everyone in our forest group to meet in person and to discuss the scientific articles, but I also liked the leisure to do that compared to mandatory discussion sections. Mandatory discussion sections make it a little difficult to engage with the material and have fun / get to know classmates in a more relaxed manner.\r\n\r\nOffice hours was also only held Mon-Wed, although my TA (Grace) was really good and responsive with her emails and even met up with me one on one to discuss feedback on the midterm.",
                "No improvements, I loved this course. It was well organized, flexible, engaging, and had a good workload. I really like the group reading sessions in place of a section.",
                "This course is a great survey of forest science, with room for students to focus on preferred topics and get hands-on experience.",
                "I loved the place in the woods assignment and learning community. The main weakness is this course would be better suited as a smaller lecture, because the logistics got pretty insane and took away from the learning experience.",
                "Strengths: loved the discussion groups, weekly reading responses, and weekly field journals. Awesome way to keep the class engaged even though it was a big size, and all of those small 1/1s were easy ways to make sure people's grades stayed high despite examinations. Going to east rock for my field journal was my favorite part of the week. Very easy class to get a good grade in as long as you keep up with the quick weekly assignments. Also, Marlyse brought in lots of guest lecturers which was fun. \r\nWeaknesses:  A bit all over the place, and the readings could have been chosen/organized better.",
                "Strengths - great content, very engaging lectures and phenomenal TAs\r\nWeaknesses - lectures often moved waaay to fast, weekly reading groups often felt ineffective",
                "I'm not sure how much of my dislike for the course was related to my general lack of interest in ecology (which I discovered ~week 2) or the course itself. This was the first time it was taught to such a large group, so it was pretty disorganized. I also found it a lot more work than I expected- weekly field journals, super dense readings, a final exam and project which took a long time, etc.",
                "Strengths: basically everything about the course. Marlyse is super responsive to student feedback and clearly cares about improving her teaching (she mentioned off-hand a couple times how she had checked in at the Poorvu center for teaching and learning to make sure her assignments and class format were best constructed to meet her learning objectives; oh yeah she's also really into learning objectives). Course content is super fun and interesting; especially if you don't have any forestry background, taking this course will totally change the way you look at forests. I had a really positive reading group experience (although not everyone did), and I think establishing a culture of 'everyone will do the reading and be engaged' in the first couple weeks is really important. The readings are scientific articles, which were tough for me, but knowing that everyone else would do the readings and knowing that we would have interesting, meaningful discussion about them kept me motivated to read as the course went on, and I got busier. The reading group is so easy to blow off, but your experience of the class will be so much better if you take it seriously.",
                "This course just wasn't for me. I wasn't a fan of the discussion groups because I feel like nobody really knew what we were talking about (me included) and the whole thing was just a way to see what we should put in the reading responses. I never felt like I learned how to properly read scientific literature. We were just thrown out into the deep end and I sank, unfortunately. Sometimes lecture would just be so confusing that I lost the energy to focus anymore and I left feeling like I learned nothing. I don't know how it could be improved though because I'm pretty sure the problem is me with this one.",
                "it was a great class",
                "strengths- lots of info in every lecture\r\nweakness- lack of organization sometimes",
                "Really excellent crash course in forest ecology. Totally transforms the way that you look at trees and the forest. We're lucky to have a class like this available at Yale. Fantastic lectures from Marlyse and great guest lectures. \r\n\r\nThe course did a great job of distributing the workload throughout the semester, rather than loading it all at the end. I agree with Marylse's approach of having us hand in several iterations of the bibliography so we didn't procrastinate.\r\n\r\nThe class is way more work than most people expected, and the midterm was fairly challenging. Reading scientific papers is tough if you don't have a science background, but still doable for students who don't usually read science journals!",
                "I liked the weekly reading responses in our group discussions, and I enjoyed doing the field journals. I wish we could have gotten feedback sooner on a lot of our assignments, but I understand that was difficult with such a large class. It didn't make sense to me to have both a final project and a final exam due so close to each other, but ultimately it was fine.",
                "Everything about this class was great however I felt that the large size prevented interaction and feedback with the instructor and TFs. I could definitely see it being better at a smaller size.",
                "Strengths-The professor and teaching team were all excellent and extremely knowledgeable. Community also. \r\nWeaknesses-This was the first year this had been a large lecture course, cross listed in both the school of environment and EVST. As a EVST undergrad, I am extremely grateful we had the chance to take this course. But I also think the course may have been flooded with more people who were just looking for a science credit. I don't think the resulting class environment was always the best for professor Duguid's (excellent, I might add) teaching.",
                "I was confused a lot throughout the class, but that could be on me. I felt like my lack of knowledge in ecology made the course a lot harder. I liked the community learning groups but I think they'd only be enjoyable if you had a good group. I felt like there was often too much of a disconnect between what we learned in lecture, what we read, and what we discussed in our groups so it was just kind of hard to know what I was supposed to be learning/what knowledge was the most crucial. For example, I felt like some questions that were on the midterm were just testing if I remembered a small fact that was briefly mentioned in lecture once. This was mostly an issue just because of the great breadth of the course. It would have been great if we had like a list of specific key concepts that we could use to center our learning. I don't mean this in a \"I'm a baby and need the course concepts spoon-fed to me\" type of way, but rather a \"this class covers so much content and concepts that I don't know where to begin\" type of way. Marlyse is great though!",
                "This course was all strengths! Due to this being a large course, grading between TAs was not very consistent (some harsher, some not) so sometimes I was unsure of whether I got a concept right or wrong. There should be discussion of a standard, or one TA should stick with the same group of students for all assignments (including midterms) to improve consistency.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, no complaints.",
                "The course covered a lot of material. It was accessible for someone with no forestry experience, but a lot of the papers we read were pretty involved.",
                "I think the strength was the PITW journaling, which was a great experience and helped cement a lot of what we were learning in class. Also the lecturing style was very engaging. I think a weakness was the discussion groupsvery hard to have student organized/run and still be effective in my experience.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were very interesting and thorough. I also enjoyed the many guest lectures. It was great to do the place in the woods assignment every week, as I enjoyed developing a relationship with a patch of forest in New Haven. I enjoyed my discussion group, but I suspect that my experience would have been negative if our group members had not been as responsible as they were. I appreciated that the final exam was take home and open notes. Both the midterm and final should be take home in the future.\r\nWeaknesses: My friends and I felt that Dr. Duguid often spoke too fast during lecture. I understand that professors must go through presentations quickly, but I just felt that I did not have enough time to process what was being said (and I did not have time to look at the recordings later). I wish that the weekly reading response and field journal assignments had been worth more points because I put a lot of time and effort into them but only got one point for each. Even though I had already prepared two drafts of the annotated bibliography prior to finals week, it was very stressful to do the final project and the final exam. Despite the extensive work I had done for the final project prior to finals period, the annotated bibliography took me a ridiculous amount of time to finish (and I therefore had less time to prepare for the final). It would have been helpful to have had access to the answer key when we got our midterm grades back. I did not know why I got questions wrong and had to go to office hours to get answers during a very busy time of the semester. Finally, I did not like that we were asked to evaluate our discussion group members at the end of the semester.",
                "The lectures were engaging and fascinating and the professor funny and lively. Guest lectures were great and provided a nice opportunity to talk to people doing research. No weaknesses that I can think of, except I didn't receive my online midterm back to review and I would have liked to see what I got right and wrong.",
                "Strengths: reading group (if it was a good one), bibliography due over time rather than with one deadline, various opportunities to demonstrate learning through variety of assignments, and guest speakers from the field.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: my poll everywhere didn't work a few times so my attendance wasn't taken properly, too big of a lecture in that a lot of the information wasn't necessarily relevant to an undergrad even though it may have been to a forestry grad who was also in the class, more chances to apply what we were learning to real forests would have been great.",
                "Strengths: lectures were engaging and Prof. Duguid brought in a lot of dynamic guest lecturers throughout the semester.  Prof. Duguid is amazing!  The weekly place in the woods assignments were super fun.  I also loved my reading discussion group and really improved my ability to read scientific literature by practicing it weekly throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures move a bit quickly at times, and it was sometimes difficult to access office hours.  But overall, I loved this course and would take it again in a heartbeat.",
                "Strengths - accessible\r\nWeaknesses - a lot of work at end of the course: both an annotated bib and final",
                "I thought this was such a strong course against all odds, since I know you weren't expecting as many undergrads to sign up, but I really enjoyed lectures and the weekly assignments, especially the place in the woods assignment, and I thought the peer discussion groups were a great more casual but still interactive alternative to section for discussing the course material. My one recommendation for changing the structure might be to make the due date for the final annotated bibliography come a little earlier in the year. I really liked the assignment and I thought the workload was well-planned and manageable, but it was a little overwhelming to have 2 final assignments/exams due during finals period.",
                "lectures sometimes moved too fast and there was quite a lot of busy work; a final and a final assignment felt like a bit much, and it often seemed like we were being asked to do work just for the sake of it",
                "I love the field journal assignment and the set up for weekly peer-learning (way better than a proper discussion section).",
                "Very well organized. Class felt a little big though.",
                "The course material was interesting, and I feel like we moved through it at a good pace. However, this course implemented an attendance policy halfway through, which was good in concept, but ended up being really stressful and technically difficult. This is unusual for lectures and Im not sure actually changed participation since people could game the system.",
                "The strengths of this course was just how engaged it encouraged us to be in our learning. The consistent assignments kept me consistently interacting with the material, which was especially helpful as a new science student. I feel like I got so much out of the class for that reason. The weaknesses of the course were that it was rather disorganized at times, and the teaching team sometimes could be unresponsive because they weren't leading our discussion sections. While I liked the student-lead discussion format, I think I would have gotten even more out of the class if I TA had been leading our section (especially since many of the students in my section were non-science majors like myself, and we often were unsure how to proceed with the material).",
                "Strengths: incredibly helpful professor and TFs who put an enormous amount of work into engaging each student and providing crazy detailed feedback on student work and learning. Weakness: lectures being held on Science Hill",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Encourages experiential, tactile learning in the forest and applying theories to real life examples \r\n- A lot of room to explore specific topics you're interested through the Annotated Bibliography \r\n- Student discussion groups were really helpful in clarifying readings and expressing concerns in a small, safe and encouraging learning environment \r\n- Field journals were really helpful to catalogue personal learnings across time\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- A lot of ground to cover in very little time\r\n- Success of student group discussion is dependent on group mates",
                "Its huge lecture format was not intended, and for good reason -- the huge lecture made it easy to lose engagement. However, the lectures were interesting and engaging, albeit sometimes far too quick. I think some more practice with real-world application could have made the course stronger. Also, figuring out discussion groups before registration could have been useful.",
                "Material was generally well-organized, and regular assignments were helpful in keeping us on track. However, exams were difficult to prepare for because so little information was given out about them in advance. The administration of the midterm was stress-inducingly disorganized.",
                "Strengths: Manageable workload and interesting range of topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Bibliography and Final Exam were too close together.",
                "The syllabus balances breadth and depth really well. I also felt like the material was accessible but complex enough to make me feel like I was doing real science and have a solid base if I want to learn more about forests in the future.\r\n\r\nGoing into the woods every week and discussing scientific papers with peers in my residential college was really fun. That being said, when the midterm and final came, I didn't really feel prepared. In a lot of classes, you do psets/worksheets regularly and, when it's time for the exam, you're already used to answering questions and being evaluated on your accuracy. But, because the assignments were all supplementary, we had never been assessed on our knowledge before the midterm and that made it more stressful. \r\n\r\nIt would be ideal if we got the experience of going out into nature and reading papers alongside practicing the course material so taking the exams is a smoother transition.",
                "Lecture notes or recorded lectures would be really helpful. Slides are posted but there is never much information on them. There is an overload of information during lectures so it's nearly impossible to capture everything cohesively. The early morning time and the location also sucked, but that's not something that was in Professor's control.",
                "Strengths  Interesting and accessible to everyone, great teaching staff, reasonable workload, place in the woods exercise was great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses  The midterm was very confusing. The practice midterm posted looked absolutely nothing like the actual exam and was very misleading. It wouldve been great to receive more guidance and appropriate practice questions.",
                "Strengths: it was pretty accessible to someone without a biology/ecology background; the teaching team were excellent; the guest lectures were in general quite interesting; Professor Duguid's lecturing; the goal of the course; my personal discussion group was dedicated and a pleasure to work with;\r\nWeaknesses: Organization. It felt like topics were taught in a pretty arbitrary order. I know everything connects, but the fact that we we learned about succession and then went to talk about tree architecture and then back to larger-scale forest evolution was quite confusing.",
                "Strengths: Well organized, interesting material, engaging lecturer\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not a ton of guidance, TF engagement seemed minimal",
                "Strengths: many guest lecturers, field trip and place in the woods is helpful and fun\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were not posted before class and were not very self explanatory",
                "The structure of this class was very consistent. The lectures followed the syllabus closely and slides were always uploaded before class. Weekly assignments were enjoyable as we were split into independent groups. \r\nDue to the large class size, there were logistical issues in the beginning, but Professor Duguide and the TAs worked hard to amend them as soon as possible.",
                "I thought it was a very good lecture course but I think the discussion sections were poorly organized.",
                "I think the weekly readings were not often tied into the course. The final exam was also pretty subjective which I thought didnt make for as clear of a learning benchmark as the midterm.",
                "Strength: Marlyse and the TFs were remarkable; I loved the PITW structure. Super accommodating. I loved the reading groups.\r\nWeakness: the content was repetitive and basic, but I really didnt mind it.",
                "more engagement with TAs. opportunities to have an in-person relationship with them and ask questions not via email"

                "I highly recommend this class as an overview of forest dynamics. The professor is kind and warm, and that makes all the difference.",
                "Definitely! Forests are cool.",
                "I would recommend it to folks that already have an interest in forestry or environmental sciences. As someone with an environmental science background, my previous EVST coursework helped me a lot, and I could not imagine now having that foundation.",
                "It was pretty easy and I think i really learned a good bit about forests and trees. I was hoping for more content on forest management and actual practical examples of how these concepts and models we were learning about were impacting forests globally. I guess that is also on my for not being aware that that was outside of the scope of the class.",
                "Yes! It is so much fun going to the woods for homework. She also is a good lecturer.",
                "Sure! If you're truly interested in this subject. I really took this class for a fifth credit, it didn't count towards my distributional requirements nor was it important for my major. I was interested in learning about the forest, but because I didn't do super well on the midterm and got overloaded with work towards the end of the semester, I decided to credit/d the class and it was a lot more relaxing.\r\n\r\nDo I regret taking the class? Not really  the low workload and chill environment allowed me to focus on other classes, but I still studied a decent amount for the midterm exam and didn't do as well as I expected to.",
                "Yes!!",
                "110%. this may be my favorite course I have taken at Yale. This course changed the way I viewed the natural world and the structure of the course keeps the workload manageable and the content interesting!",
                "Yes, absolutely! This was a great course.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in forest ecology. If you have no interest in trees or biology, and are just looking for something to fill your science requirement, I would not recommend it. But if you are interested in the subject there is so much to learn and it is nice to have some more interactive components.",
                "Absolutely. Marlyse is a phenomenal professor, and you will learn such an incredible amount in just one semester.",
                "Absolutely recommend to EVST students.",
                "No. I'd guess if you're really interested in forest ecology there are better, more in-depth courses. If you're not, take something else for a science credit.",
                "Definitely. Especially if you don't have a background in forestry, this class will change the way you see and think about forests. Also, it's a really great place to learn how to read science papers, if that's a skill you want to develop.",
                "I don't think I would recommend this to another student. It was super tough and if I weren't here to get my science credit, I don't think I'd be taking this course. I'm sure people who are passionate about forestry and want to pursue it for a living would love this course, but I just don't know if I'm that type of person or if I know anyone like that either.",
                "yes, I enjoyed the content and thought going to the forest every week was a good activity",
                "yes",
                "Take this class if you are willing to put in the work, go to the woods, and sit there for a long time and critically think about how to apply the concepts you're learning in class to what you're seeing in real life. \r\n\r\nBut the class is actually quite a lot of work, and requires a huge amount of individual motivation to get out into the woods/do the readings/show up to discussion in order to get something out of it. If you aren't willing to sit in the woods in the middle of November/early December when it's cold (and maybe wet) then you shouldn't take the course.",
                "I would recommend this class to non-EVST majors who are interested in the outdoors and want a science credit. I think this class was a little too basic for EVST majors to get a lot out of.",
                "YES! Absolutely the best class I've taken at Yale. However, this isn't a science gut. We definitely learn a lot and the workload is not light. The class will be significantly easier if you are passionate about the subject material or if you have previous exposure to ecology/evst topics.",
                "Highly highly recommend if you're interests at all intersect with forestry. I think if you have no interest in forests though, you might find the concepts feel...arbitrary, and unimportant to you. This is a course best for students who are invested in it.",
                "If you have no interest in forests or you're looking for a gut science course, I probably wouldn't recommend this course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. You will learn a lot about forests and stand dynamics. However, it is NOT a science gut. The material is actually quite challenging.",
                "Yes! This was one of my favorite courses at Yale. Disclaimer: you should come into this class with an open mind and willing to learn. As someone who loves forests and plants, this class challenged my perceptions of forests and taught me a lot about the detailed dynamics of forests and trees. However, if you are looking for a gut, this class is not for you. You will need to put a lot of thought and effort into your responses. The intellectual challenge is on par with some engineering courses I've taken because you will be challenged to think in different ways.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in forests or forest ecology. It's not a mega-gut though, as a lot of the work (annotated bibliography and final) are concentrated in the last 2 weeks of the semester.",
                "Yes! Really got me excited about environmental science and changed the way I see and interact with the natural world.",
                "Yes! Just be mindful that there is a heavy weekly workload.",
                "Absolutely, it was a great overview of many topics in forest ecology and goes into management as well, which makes it a good starting point to assess what you like to study and what topics you want to learn about in more depth.",
                "I took it for a science credit and also thought forests would be interesting and useful to learn about. It was definitely more technical than I was hoping for that purpose. As far as science credits go, there are definitely others out there that are guttier. This course requires engagement and interest in forests to be successful in it, so if you're not willing to put either of those on the table, I would look elsewhere if you're looking for a science.",
                "Absolutely.  This course changed the way I look at the natural world and was structured to be accessible to students completely new to forest ecology (like me).  I looked forward to the weekly reading discussions with my group of 4 other students every week.  Forestry is a relatively new field, very exciting to learn about, and super interesting.",
                "Less of a gut than you might think",
                "I don't know if they're going to crosslist it again, but if they do definitely take it! this course has been a great way to think broadly about forests and all of the different ways they exist and we interact with them. I'm environmental studies and I thought this was a great way to cap what I've been learning about, but even my non-stemmy friends in the class have gotten so much from it and it's transformed how I see trees and forests!",
                "not a bad science credit, though I doubt Prof. Duguid will teach this course in the same format next year",
                "If you are looking for a science credit, this is a great option that does not require labs, psets, heavy memorization, or irrelevant knowledge :)",
                "This is not a gut! But that being said, I am so happy that I took it for a science credit as a non-stem major. If you're willing to put in the effort and have the slightest bit of interest about trees, forestry, and how they exist within the world, I would absolutely recommend this class. I think the weekly field journals also helped because they allowed for you to connect the concepts taught in class with the real world, which is something I really appreciated coming out of this class. Prof Duguid truly has your best interests at heart and isn't trying to have any \"gotcha\" moments and really just wants to share her love of trees with the rest of the class did you know that Palm Trees aren't trees?",
                "Yes, but you get as much as you put in",
                "Yes, I think the content is interesting, and something everyone should learn about",
                "I would recommend this course to another student! I thought the topic was fascinating and the course design and teaching team, overall, was very encouraging and supportive. I would only advise them that the course is a lot of work, since visiting the woods each week often became difficult to organize around my school and extracurricular schedule.",
                "Absolutely- you learn a lot, you're pushed to spend time in nature and better appreciate and understand the ecosystem around you, you gain skills like tree id- it's a great, well-run class.",
                "I would recommend this class to environmental studies majors who would like to explore a broad range of topics related to ecology or natural sciences. If a student is looking for specific features of ecology then this may be too broad for that person, this is a good introductory course to ecology.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in forestry, conservation, or if you just like trees!",
                "Not unless the administration of exams became better organized. I would also caution them against taking any class that assigns both a final project and a final paper. However, I would tell a friend that I found the material interesting and valuable.",
                "Yes, it is very interesting and will indeed change the way you view nature! The only thing I would say is you have to be okay with 9am",
                "Yes, definitely. It felt like a real science class that challenged me to learn more about ecosystem but, at the same time, it was basic enough that I always felt comfortable.\r\n\r\nThis is not a gut. Although it's very possible to get through this course without doing much work week-to-week, in order to do well, you need to go to every lecture, do (some of) the readings, go into the woods every week, and study for exams. If you're looking for an easy fifth class, this might not be right.\r\n\r\nBut, if you're interested in the environment and are willing to invest 3-4 hours every week, this course is fairly chill and rewarding.",
                "Yes, if you care about trees and the environment. I am a humanities person, so I did find the content interesting when we talked about the social and cultural aspects of forest dynamics (such as prescribed burning), it was very interesting, but generally, I found it mind-numbing. This isn't the professor's fault, it's just a \"different strokes for different folks\"-type scenario. It is a gut, in the sense that it's easy to pass the class, but you do have to work hard and pay attention in lectures if you want the A (which is hard if you find lectures mind-numbing).",
                "I would absolutely recommend the class, but it is not a gut. If you are dedicated, you can get a lot out of it, but the three papers+discussion+place in the woods assignment ended up being quite a lot each week. The papers do get easier though, and you come out not only feeling like you understand a lot of forest dynamics but also feeling capable of reading scientific literature related to forestry. The final project is also a pretty hefty assignment that was added on top of a normal final. You will leave the class so excited about trees, and it really did change how I see the world when I walk down the street (what Professor Duguid said was the goal of the course at the beginning of the semester). The teaching and organization of topics was somewhat scattered, and frankly I would be surprised if the class was open to undergraduates again. I think with a smaller class size and better organization this would have the potential to be the best class I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes! Marlyse is a wonderful lecturer, and if you're interested in botany or forest management, this is a great introduction to those subjects.",
                "No unless you are very interested in trees",
                "yes! I enjoyed this class so much. The Place In The Woods assignment was one of my favorites. We had to visit our a place in the woods and monitor changes in the same plot of land. It truly changed the way I see the environment. Although the workload was greater, it is well worth the investment of becoming engulfed in the subject. There is so much to learn and enjoy.",
                "I think you really have to care about the subject to enjoy the class so I would recommend it to anyone who is passionate about forestry",
                "Absolutely!! If you want a science credit where you actually learn relevant information about the world around you, look no further. I only wish I had taken this earlier. Id probably have taken many more EVST courses after this. But Im a senior",
                "Yes! It was fun. Lectures could be boring but the reading groups and PITW were exciting. Best science for non-STEM majors ever. Super easy too.",
                "i would!! having the place in the woods exercise was so great for me, a really wonderful ritual. i learned new things-- i am not a science major and i found this class accessible for someone who wasn't studying science"
