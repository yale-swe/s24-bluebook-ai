            "comments": [
                "The video lectures were interesting. However, I wish that studies and experiments were more clearly alluded to in lectures. The seminar during meeting times were disorganized.",
                "Too much essays for exams. A combination of Short Answer and Multiple Choice questions would be less stressful. Also more Assignments.",
                "Class was great, Professor Wynn was a wonderful professor, the discussion sessions throughout the semester were split between being led by Professor Wynn and her teaching assistant Dr. Jordan, I wish that the both taught together so we could interact with our professor more throughout the semester. Furthermore, I wish that we received clear feedback on our exams so that we had concrete ways that we could improve.",
                "Strengths: Professor Wynn is a superstar and has a lot to offer, and she incorporates many fascinating studies into the course content. Weaknesses: The course structure was not at all conducive to learning for me, especially the discussion sections, which were totally unstructured. I wish discussion sections had involved Professor Wynn leading us through the problem sets, having us participate as we solved them as a class, methodically, ideally with an answer key or visual aids provided by the professor for us to follow along with. Instead, they were a random collection of questions asked by people in the class that may or may not be relevant to exam content. In addition, it would've been helpful for the TA to actually answer the questions we asked in the Canvas discussion threads each week.",
                "This course had its strengths in the clear, concise lectures that were given. However, these lectures were recorded, so we could not interact with them, and the discussion sections were just Q&A sections. They hardly helped us digest the information because questions were often outside the scope of the course and only asked to gain participation points. Additionally, we had to write two discussion questions every week and post them, but the professor/TA did not attempt to answer the questions or have students answer the posts, so I'm not sure that anything was gained by doing that. Also, there were three question sets, but we were not given answers, and when we asked about them in section, only thinly veiled \"what do you guys think?\" answers were given. Finally, we were not given any feedback on our exams, so we had no idea what we did wrong when we lost points. It could be improved by focusing efforts on organizing discussion section and and the discussion posts to facilitate learning and giving more/better feedback.",
                "Recorded lessons are long.",
                "While I did enjoy the discussion sections and the lecture videos were interesting, I think the course is just very outdated. The lecture recordings were from 2012, and there have been so much more development in the field of developmental psychology that wasn't addressed in this course. There were also no assigned readings from before 2011, which contributed more to the course material feeling outdated.",
                "Strengths: The material is very interesting and if you are interested in developmental psychology, you will definitely find the course material interesting. Weakness: Although the material is interesting, do note that during this online format the material was not taught in seminar but was instead presented on pre-recorded lectures from 2012. This was not necessarily a bad thing, although I think it would have been more beneficial for seminar time to be used to teach instead of just an office-hour like discussion. Also, I think that the discussion format we used during our twice weekly meeting was a bit disorganized, and discussions often felt abstract rather than directly related to the course material.",
                "This course was incredibly disappointing in terms of teaching. The amount of material was itself beyond what was normal even for an accelerated pace typical of summer courses (some weeks 12 readings, 4-5 hours of lecture videos) with two zoom meetings of entirely unstructured discussions in which not a single question was ever clearly or concisely answered. The question sets provided were never given answer keys nor clearly discussed when asked about specifically in class. The material and course content could have been interesting if it were properly taught, but truthfully, we were expected to make sense of the material as a whole completely on our own. The entire class resorted to teaching each other separately out of desperate confusion. Overall this class was extremely disappointing in its lack of guidance and feedback. Exams were graded in points onlynever explaining errors, leaving us to merely surmise as to what the correct information we had missed was. I am someone who has treasured most of the psychology courses I've taken over the years, so I take this review very seriously.",
                "This course was great especially for a summer course. Sometimes the discussion sections/class time seemed long but the professor and TF handled that well and made it really engaging."

This course served as a great introduction to those topics without really feeling overwhelming.",
                "Overall, yes I would recommend this course if you are at all interested in developmental psychology. Obviously this would differ during this course when it is offered during the school year, but in YSS the material is taught via recorded lectured from around 2012 and the section times are used to discuss the material.",
