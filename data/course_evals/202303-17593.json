                "The class provides insight into the development of Christianity and Catholicism. The content is extremely interesting because most of the works have deeply impacted the development of the faith. This class is important to me because religious teaching is something that has become somewhat trivial to the academic world despite being so deeply rooted in early thinking and education.",
                "I learned about the development of Catholic philosophies from the Bible into the 21st century. I learned about broad themes within Catholic intellectual development, as well as various individual people/texts.",
                "Knowledge of the Catholic Intellectual Tradition",
                "This course was among the first I've taken at Yale that is directly oriented towards historical analysis. While I found the vast quantity of important dates and identifications to be overwhelming at first, I developed a strong understanding of the course material and greater confidence in my memorization.",
                "Form this course, I had my first interaction with theology and the history of a religion. Despite being Catholic myself, this class provided information on the history of the Catholic religious development and the changes/ challenges of theological thinking in response to historical events like modernity, the enlightenment, the reformation, etc. I was able to face lengthy and complex readings, understand them, and apply them towards analysis through papers.",
                "How to navigate seamlessly between philosophy, theology, and history; mediated through one of the longest and most sophisticated intellectual traditions in human history.",
                "I was able to elevate my way of thinking by applying Catholic thought into secular conversations. I'd say it made me become more informed about my own religion.",
                "I developed a much greater understanding of the foundations of the Catholic Church and its intellectual history.",
                "I learned of the many different eras of the catholic intellectual tradition and many of the different strands of thought within the tradition.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: this course gives a good overview of Catholic History, the structure of the course is clear and well thought out, the guest lecturers were great. Weaknesses: At times the lectures didn't seem to fit with the readings, I wish that Carlos Eire lectured more as there would sometimes be 2-3 week periods of only guest lecturers, there were weeks in which 250+ pages of reading were assigned.",
                "The course has an assortment of guest lecturers that provide great expertise on various fields of the Catholic Intellectual Tradition. I would have liked Prof. Eire to provide more lectures however. The syllabus itself also focuses on material that I felt was not critical to the course topic as other material which we did not cover.",
                "The amount of reading assigned weekly was very intensive and at times was not conducive to the lecture material. I believe for a student to fully appreciate the class they need to have an adequate foundation in Catholic theology, in which case exposition of some beliefs would have been beneficial to understanding readings and material.",
                "I think at the very beginning of the course Augustine would've been more beneficial to read as opposed to the two Gospels we read. Most people have read the Gospels, so I think it would serve as a better optional reading, while Augustine would give a good foundational context for the course.",
                "Great course! I loved the content and the syllabus was great. Some of the guest lecturers were excellent and some were just okay. I wish Professor Eire had spoken more, especially when the guest lecturer was mediocre. One think to improve this course would be to get professor Eire a microphone. He is very soft spoken so I felt I had to sit up front to catch everything.",
                "The course has a very steep learning curve for the first half of the class, this was a point when the class was one of my least favorites. However, after some time you begin to grasp the central concepts of the Catholic faith that are consistently analyzed. I wish the class could be clearer in the beginning on the idea of theology and the tenets of Catholicism for a foundation, but the rest of the course was very intellectually stimulating.",
                "I really dont think the readings from the last two weeks (particularly the Merton/Day readings) were very engaging. They were more confessional than intellectual. Of course, I know that these are not mutually exclusive concepts, but they did not hit me in the same way that Confessions or Penses did. They were also immensely long  a more concise & stimulating set of readings could do a lot.",
                "Strengths were the TFs of the class! They did an amazing job explaining complicated theology and doctrine into simple wprds.",
                "Strengths: Professor Carlos Eire was amazing; he told history like a story and chose very engaging texts. He brought in guest lecturers that enriched the class as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes lectures did not correlate as well to the readings as I had hoped, but for the most part, they contributed to a greater understanding of the text.",
                "Strengths: the reading assignments were very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings were impossibly long, like 80 pages long. Granted, I think we were assigned to read it during break, so it was not too bad.",
                "Strengths: Fantastic lecturers, many of whom were specialists in the text/area we were focusing on during a given week. \r\nWeaknesses: It presumed a certain level of base knowledge / experience with Catholicism. This course is an interesting overview of Catholic thought, theology, and philosophy, but it does not function as an introductory class. I am not religious, so while I was interested in the field of study and able to engage with individual texts on a weekly basis, I found it difficult to engage during some discussions, especially when the conversation went beyond the readings and lectures.",
                "Strengths: prof Eire is wonderful. He is so sweet and brilliant. You read and learn over a huge time frame. \r\nWeaknesses: Though said otherwise, this class is built for people who know about catholicism already. Obviously, this course attracts many people who are of the catholic faith, which can make discussions difficult when there are also newcomers. As someone who knew next to nothing about the reformations, etc. I still feel really confused about the history. Many times it felt like we were focusing on the nuances and not the important events. The readings are also VERY over assigned so choosing what to focus on in a given week is difficult. I understand there is a lot of stuff to get through, but I think the course could be improved by making some optional or ranking by importance.",
                "I loved it. Perhaps the slides from guest lecturers being posted for review after the class would help, but (for the most part) I got everything I needed to write down from the lectures. The slides would help with filling in one or two of the things I had missed",
                "Strengths\r\nThe diverse perspectives brought into this course astounded me: whether it be knowledge from biblical scholars from the divinity school, medieval historians, or philosophers. I feel like I gained a deep multifaceted appreciation of the Catholic Intellectual Tradition through this course.\r\nThe readings were really illuminating and super fun to interact with. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nI feel like the course does not dedicate enough class time to exploring scholastic philosophy itself, focusing too much on the historical context in which it emerged and less so on the actual substance/ideas of the movement.",
                "Strengths: I found the lectures to be very engaging. Carlos Eire knows his stuff and is a very engaging, entertaining lecturer. I wasn't completely familiar with the idea of the Catholic Intellectual Tradition until I took this class, I know I feel I have a solid grasp of what it is and how it has evolved.\r\nWeaknesses: There are a lot of readings for this class, some of which are more relevant than others. The exams hinge on the readings and identifying passages from the readings, so make sure you do your readings! This class delved into philosophy, a subject matter I had almost no familiarity in. This is not a bad thing per se, but if you have very limited knowledge in philosophy, you may find yourself feeling behind in the class as many people enrolled have some background knowledge.",
                "One of the many strengths was the guest lecturers that knew so much about their particular fields in the history of the Catholic Church. However, professor Eire was also fantastic and made many of the lectures incredibly interesting even if the topic didnt seem that way.",
                "This course had very interesting readings, great lectures/guest lecturers, amazing teaching fellows, and was overall very comprehensive. However, the readings could feel excessive and difficult."

                "I would highly recommend it to another student although I would warn of an initial difficulty in following some concepts if the student had not ever been exposed to general Christian beliefs. However, the class is very extensive and students will walk away with a thorough understanding of the Catholic Intellectual Tradition which, at times, relates incredibly intimately to general intellectual tradition.",
                "Yes I would! It is a good introduction to Catholic thought, and you engage with many interesting themes, writers, and texts.",
                "Absolutely! I think this course has a lot to teach about one of the key intellectual currents in the western world. A student need not be Catholic to get a lot form the course.",
                "Yes, I would. It was a welcome challenge and unique opportunity to study religious concepts.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I came into the class from the perspective of a Catholic student, so I do not know if someone from another faith would have the same inherent interest. Above faith, the class is genuinely intellectually challenging and rewarding with much of the learning coming from individually digesting the readings and participation in section.",
                "Absolutely! Too often, faith and reason are juxtaposed. Coming from a non-Catholic (a non-Christian, for that matter), this course shows that that is demonstrably not the case!\r\n\r\nI love philosophy, but I often find it unfortunate that many of the elaborate systems produced by scholars (I.e. Hegelianism, Platonism) are not really followed real people. The beauty of this class is that it shows us the intellectual grounding of a thought tradition that has hundreds of millions of followers!",
                "I would recommend this class for anyone that would like to learn more about Catholicism and how this conversation of catholic thinkers has transformed over the last thousand years. The majority of people in the class are catholics so I would say some interest is definitely needed.",
                "Yes. The readings were transformative for me in my spiritual life, and it is one of those courses that contributes to both intellectual and personal growth/reflection. My favorite course at Yale.",
                "Yes. For students who want to learn about the Catholic intellectual tradition, rather than simply the practices of the faith but the tradition's attempts to answer more complex questions, this class is excellent for that.",
                "Yes! This will challenge any assumptions you may have had about Catholicism from culture and will introduce you to constructive thinking about religion. Also, you get to hear from a variety of speakers in lecture who are clearly BOTH deeply passionate and knowledgeable about the material.",
                "Yes, I would. Although I believe the syllabus has a higher barrier of entry if you are not Catholic, as a non-religious student, I enjoyed the class. I also think that having more students who are not already embedded in Catholicism would make the class more engaging and accessible for everyone involved.",
                "Yes, because there is not another class taught like it at Yale.",
                "I totally would. I loved this class and genuinely looked forward to attending each lecture and discussion section. The sections were small enough that I was able to feel comfortable and heard. I enjoyed contemplating the ideas and challenges presented through lectures and discussions and thought often about the material during my own free time.",
                "Absolutely. The Catholic Intellectual Tradition is in many ways the backdrop of modern western thought. Professor Eire was incredible, and the TAs were as well. This course allowed me to read so many fascinating texts and really piqued my interest in medieval history.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the history of the Catholic Intellectual Tradition. I will probably not take a religious studies class again, but I'm glad the religious studies class I did take was this one.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they are interested in the topic."
