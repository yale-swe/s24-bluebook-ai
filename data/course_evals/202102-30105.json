This skill will help me in all my other courses moving forward.\r\nSpecifically relating to the content of this course, I learned the basics of a whole language, which I am very proud of. I also learned a lot about roman life and how it different from our lives now, even though so many emotional experiences stayed the same.",

I really enjoyed the content of the letters and poems and felt the layout of the class trying to decipher the sentences together was really enjoyable. It was very gratifying to be able to finally make sense of something I struggled with as homework. \r\nHowever, I think allocating some time every class to do a more thorough and structured review of grammatical concepts as they came up could have helped solidify things for me.",
