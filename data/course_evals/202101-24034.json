In terms of teaching style, this was by far the best course I have taken at Yale were I was encouraged to learn the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The only weakness of the course was the constant use of breakout rooms, where we would go over questions from class but neither of the students would be able to say whether our responses were right or wrong, so they felt kind of useless."
