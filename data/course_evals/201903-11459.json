   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Developed basic knowledge of persian\/arabic script, rudimentary grammar and vocabulary, the skills to converse in basic contects, and insights about persian\/iranian culture and history",
    "I was able to enrich my knowledge of Persian culture, including literature and art, form a foundation of Persian grammatical structures, and I was able to master a plethora of vocabulary. The vast jump in improvement motivates me to continue my education in Persian studies.",
    "I came out of Elementary Persian I not only being able to write a 2-page essay in Persian and being able to speak conversations with ease, but also with a deep understanding of Persian literature, art, and culture. Our professor (Ostad, as all her) helped me gain a well-rounded understanding of Iran whether taking us to the Beinecke to look at old Persian texts to showing modern music videos in class. Ostad cared about each student deeply and made sure we all had a positive experience in the class.",
    "I really enhanced my Persian writing skills and developed a deeper understanding of the structural rules of the language. I was also surprised by how much I learned about the culture.",
    "We learned the Persian script, grammar rules, and a large amount of vocab. Further, we also became very familiar with the differences between spoken and written Persian. We also did several cultural assignments, so I feel comfortable talking about the history and culture of Iran. You learn so much in just L1 that it's kind of amazing. By the mid point of the semester we could already write a multiple page paper in Persian.",
    "From just one semester of Persian L1 I feel comfortable speaking and writing Persian. I learned both the formal written and casual spoken forms of the Persian language, as well as a comprehensive understanding of the diverse culture of Iran.",
    "This is a well-paced language course and made deeply interesting with a broad cultural lens. I was familiar with the alphabet but by the end of just L1, I feel very confident with the little Persian I can speak and I feel comfortable with the most fundamental tenets of Persian grammar.",
    "Alongside the Persian language, we have learned about the literature and culture of Iran. It is a good start to Persian culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "a huge strength of the course comes from the dailiness of the effort, as language learning requires. Prof. Shayesteh does a great job of keeping students with potentially varying backgrounds in persian on track, and advancing the same pace.",
    "The course was tailored to each student's ability in the language. It moves at a pace that is clear and facilitated with the workbook and textbook. A weakness of the course was that your grade is never clear throughout the semester.",
    "The class was demanding at times, but in the end it was well worth it. I certainly saw results for the work and effort I put in, and a lot of that is thanks to Ostad helping me improve every lesson.",
    "I think the course was really effective at teaching students the structure of Persian and the basics of the language. There was also an emphasis on useful vocabulary and we did a lot of practice with the words we were learning.\r\n\r\nThe class was a bit fast and at times stressful in its pace. Even for a student with a working knowledge in Persian, I felt overwhelmed by the amount of material we were covering, especially as it related to writing. Picking up a foreign alphabet is difficult, but even harder when you are trying to juggle new vocabulary words.",
    "Strengths: Ostad's methods of teaching and the assignments that she assigns allows for students to easily learn the language while never feeling overworked. This was the first language class that I've take where I've actually looked forward to class everyday (and that's saying a lot considering it's at 9:25am). You learn so much in just L1 as compared to other language courses at Yale. The facilitation and everything about this class is well done. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the course could be improved by allowing one day to cover all the cultural topics, rather than splitting it up into ten minute discussions everyday.",
    "Although the Persian department at Yale is small, it still does its best to make every student feel noticed and appreciated. The class was a comprehensive,  manageably paced teaching of the structural basics of Persian language. It was wholly engaging, very much in part due to a wonderful instructor and supportive students. \r\n\r\nMore funding towards the department could allow for more resources to students, and an increased visibility of the program.",
    "The 9 a.m. was tough for me but it gave a good start to the day. Ostad is very charming and purposeful so the 50 minutes never felt like a drag.",
    "Strengths: The knowledge is well contextualized. The influences of culture on the language are well-explained by the professor and are made accessible to everyone. \r\nWeaknesses: Finding resources online can be hard."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes!! if you want to learn persian, the programme is absolutely amazing and you will not leave dissapointed",
    "Yes. If someone truly wants to become proficient in a language, this course will help any student achieve that goal. I have taken courses in other languages, but the improvement I have seen in myself and other classmates is nothing in comparison. The language is not easy, and there is another alphabet, but by the end of one semester, my class and I were able to form complicated sentences and hold conversations.",
    "Yes! Especially if they are interested in the Persian language, or if they are eager to immerse themselves in a widely different and unique culture in just one semester.",
    "I would - I learned a lot in this class, even though I went in thinking I knew a lot for the level. I really improved my reading and writing skills and gained a better understanding of some things I already knew. I would caution a student, though, that this class might be much tougher than they expect. The grading is steep and intense and can be off putting if you are not committed to the subject.",
    "Yes! This is by far the best language courses I've ever taken at Yale (and it's probably one of the best overall). You learn so much but never feel overworked. The students all start out at an even playing field and because of the small course size we all become pretty well acquainted. Ostad is an amazing professor, you can really tell that she cares about her student's and their learning.",
    "100%, yes. From the start, the course ensures that students have a strong foundation in the language before it continues. This worked to ensure that students understood the basics and were able to apply what they knew to new, more difficult topics. In an extremely manageable way, students learn to both read and write Persian--a skill that will set students apart and can be valuable in future career paths. More than just the language, the class is also a crash course and celebration of Iranian geography and culture. In this way it almost feels as you are also lucky enough to be enrolled in a history class. This extra information is not overwhelming, and oftentimes engages students in connecting to the language lessons.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in Iran and Persian culture, this course is a great way to start your journey! There are conferences and class trips to support learning as well. Having this class every morning made waking up a lot easier. If you're interested, you will love it!"
