                "Professor Grimstad did an excellent job laying out the arguments of our thinkers, as well as encouraging us to explain the arguments and give our critiques and objections. The seminar-style format kept us all actively engaged.",
                "Strengths: Really open and free discussion during class of all the philosophers, especially important arguments and points of confusion. Grimstad is a great facilitator of conversation, and there definitely was a lot of it. Weaknesses: People did not get to speak enough. Some voices dominated the conversation. It wasn't very structured either, and the question addressed would often be unclear. It got boring sometimes, with people rehashing the same point over and over. Some questions were left unanswered, which was slightly frustrating.",
                "STRENGTHS: welcoming Professor willing to offer his own time to ensure student success and actualization; strong and comprehensive reading list\r\nWEAKNESSES: size of class was too large for seminar format.",
                "This course manages to cover a lot of challenging material very fast, but I still felt like I got enough support to keep up. The flexibility of class sessions was also really nice in that regard.",
                "Particularly toward the end of the semester, I'd have preferred more curated reading assignments. I appreciate that Directed Studies values reading texts in their original context, but I think for each work, it'd be nice to assign a) required reading for seminar, and b) suggested reading for the essays and final. (And to do (roughly) the same required reading & suggested reading for all sections.) Counterintuitively, in focusing the reading for the seminar, I think it would broaden actual seminar discussions beyond just the first few pages of a text. \r\n\r\n(I think something like Prof. Werner's handouts or Prof. Lindskog's questions for discussion could also help facilitate discussion.)",
                "The discussions were very lively and the lectures were helpful in understanding the texts, but at times it moved too fast for me to keep up, especially during the difficult readings of Kant. The reading load of Kant especially was overwhelming since he is so hard to understand, so it could possibly be improved by either decreasing the amount of readings or increasing the class time around him, although it might just be my personal struggle with understanding him."

I would not necessarily recommend this class to someone who wants to study philosophy very deeply. However, it does provide a solid background for anyone who is interested in philosophy.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! I really loved engaging with all of the philosophers in section and with my friends. Grimstad was a little... esoteric, I suppose, and he had some difficulty relating to the students, but the readings alone make the class worth it. Not to mention the discussions that would go on outside of the main oneespecially in the chat box. We had so many in-class jokes and interesting debates.",
                "If you are interested in modern philosophy it is a great course but the authors we read second semester are very difficult and detailed.",

                "I would recommend this course to students who enjoy reading philosophy and enjoy arguing.",
                "Yes. The works broaden your mind, the seminars and lecture refine your understanding of what you've read, and the essays force you to apply what you've learned. I think it lies at the heart of the liberal arts experience. \r\n\r\n(There's definitely more reasons, but the course evaluation tool was a pretty easy sell.)",
                "I would definitely recommend Paul Grimstads class  he is an excellent professor and I learned so much from him.",
                "I would hesitantly recommend it. I enjoyed DS as a whole, and I also enjoyed most of philosophy and loved reading Descartes and Hume, but the later readings of the semester are extremely difficult and time consuming, so I would not recommend it to most students unless I knew they would be up for it or if they had an interest in philosophy.",
