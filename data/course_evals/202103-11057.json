            "comments": [
                "I strongly disliked the class format. We had to watch 1-3 hours of lecture per week, and we had 2.5 hours of in class \"group work\" time. I felt that the lectures were often confusing, and it was hard not being able to ask questions (and it was also less engaging). The in-class time felt pretty useless -- we would have 30 second discussions about questions about topics that had been barely touched on in the lecture videos, and the TFs would end up having to explain most of it to us. We would do problems at whiteboards, but then we wouldn't have those problems in our notes, and when problems like those appeared on Problem Sets or exams and people were confused about them, Professor Faison would just say \"we did one like that on the whiteboard.\" Overall, class felt like a waste of time, and I think the class would be much improved if in-class time was reserved for lectures, especially if the lecture included maybe a couple opportunities for group discussion or questions. The main strength of this class, in my opinion, is the TFs. All of our TFs were super helpful and very patient in explaining the concepts -- in class, in section, and over email. I wouldn't have made it through the class without them!",
                "I do like the online lectures. it gives us a chance to pick when we will learn the material which can help us pick the best times we are most engaged. The parts of class involving going to a board to work on problems is clunky and usually not very helpful. It would be better if we all went through the problems together with people we want to be with and then had the classwork posted to canvas after for us to study for tests and homework.",
                "The lectures honestly weren't as helpful as the textbook chapters, which seems backwards...",
                "I think that professor Faison is very clear and good at articulating his ideas. However, I am strongly against the flipped classroom. I feel like learning online is much harder and I would prefer if we had in class lectures and a discussion section if you wanted to continue with the flipped classroom.",
                "This course was good at using algebra to understand the vastness of space.",
                "I think the format of the course is its weakness. You have one to three lectures to watch at home before class, and during class time, you have a giant class discussion. I truly don't think this helps with student learning or engagement. Most students won't watch the lecture before class and will have no idea what's happening during class. I don't think I learned much from the discussions, BUT I learned SO MUCH from watching the lectures. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, getting to use telescopes after class and looking at the sun was really cool",
                "It could be improved by not having all lectures online the night before. Feel like I would learn more with in person lessons.",
                "Less hybrid style",
                "The lectures did not overlap with the problem sets nor did they overlap with the problems we did in class.",
                "strengths is professor very passionate, learned broad scope. weakness is class discussion felt kinda forced at times, not much incentive for people to participate, discussion groups people just giving bs answers",
                "It was very useful going over course material twice a week. We had two classes and about two videos to watch a week - it made it very easy studying for midterms if we kept up with everything",
                "It was slow",
                "Classes and assignments was repetitive, which made it difficult to stay engaged as the semester progressed. I didn't feel like I learned much from the actual classes that I hadn't already been told in the online lecture beforehand. It was nice that those lectures were available to watch at any time though.",
                "I liked the discussions during class it was nice to talk to classmates. Psets didnt always match class material",
                "The course is great and the lectures are engaging. The problem sets could be a little shorter.",
                "I liked the interactive class but the online lectures were not as beneficial to me as in person lectures are",
                "Strength: Professor and TAs are incredibly caring and helpful in helping students digest the material. Weakness: The flipped class structure made the class somewhat time consuming at times, as students were expected to watch recorded lectures beforehand."

                "I would say it depends. I took it to fulfill Science and QR requirements, and it's really nice that this course fulfills both of those requirements. The workload is manageable, and the PSETs aren't terrible (if you go to section), but the class itself is not well organized to maximize efficiency or learning. This class fulfilled a requirement and nothing more, but it probably is easier than other STEM classes.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student if you truly have an interest in astronomy. I know some people who went into this class thinking it was just going to be easy, but it was harder than expected, so only take it if you have a genuine interest in the subject.",
                "Yes.",
                "I definitely would recommend the course to anyone who is genuinely interested in astronomy. Without some interest in astronomy, the weekly problem sets, prerecorded lectures, and in-class discussions can become tedious, but for those who enjoy learning about planets and stars, the workload will be well worth it! The course content is very interesting and covers a good range of various topics in astronomy.",
                "Be ready to do lots of work for this class. It is low intellectual challenge, but the workload is really high. You have lectures to watch at home, you have to go to class for a discussion, AND there is a problem set every week.\r\n\r\nIf you can commit to that, this class is really awesome. At Christmas dinner, someone asked about Pluto not being a planet, and I went into a 30 minute discussion of the solar system. It was AWESOME. You will learn a lot of fun facts about the solar system :)",
