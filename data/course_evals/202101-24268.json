                "This course does a great job at looking at modern sociopolitical issues in China. That being said, I would just barely call it a history course. The name is incredibly misleading because in no way do we take a survey of Chinese history starting at the present and then working back into the past. Really what it should be called is \"China in the Present with Brief, Miscellaneous Looks at the Past.\" If you are looking for a real Chinese history class, then this is not it for you. The course also does well enough in discussing bias in sources and help students analyze this bias, but another pitfall is the professor. She can be pleasant at times, especially in a one-on-one, but her tone can often be condescending during section, and that is incredibly inappropriate, especially when we are discussing topics that are subjective and students or the TF are giving their own opinions. However, the TF is wonderful and very knowledgable on Chinese history and modern events. Lastly, I just found the course to be poorly organized. There was no logical progression of the history discussed in class and the organization was more centered around a non-meaningful arrangement of events in modern China such as \"protests\" or \"family life,\" while the course title suggests the progression to start in modern China and work backwards until the Song Dynasty.",

                "The prerecorded lectures ended up as a disaster. While the beginning of the semester, the recordings were fine, towards the middle of the semester, the quality became nearly quite bad with horrible audio quality that was difficult to hear and poor video that made it difficult to see the slide shows. Also, the canvas page with the lecture links was difficult to navigate because the links were all just numbered with no indication of the date or topic of the lecture, which could have greatly improved the navigability of the page. The recorded lectures were also not very engaging. Section was on zoom as any other class, so this was as any other zoom class would be. The professor was also understanding of technical difficulties that could have caused any issues in submitting work or attending section, which was relieving.",
