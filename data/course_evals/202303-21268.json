                "Strengths Professor Kiarie. He is so sweet and I love the way he teaches. He teaches us songs and for the food unit he even brought in plastic toy foods for us to use, it is hard to not be engaged with his teaching style. Also, the words are so fun to say! It's a small class too so you get to know your peers well and connect with them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses It is so early in the morning, if you are unable to get up early, do not take this class. I got up at 5 every morning in high school and thought I could take a 9:25 easily, but I began to dread it toward the end. Seeing your roommate sound asleep in their warm cozy bed while you have to face the New England cold is an unfortunate experience. I definitely missed a few classes. On the other hand, getting up early also meant I had to maintain somewhat of a decent sleep schedule and I got more done throughout the day, so it really depends on your preference."

                "I would recommend this class to anyone who has a tough schedule and wants to learn Swahili. Very  manageable workload and good environment",
                "I definitely would! The language is very interesting and incredibly well taught, while also not being overwhelming whatsoever. They assigned very little work in the beginning of the semester while you were getting a handle on things, and only started assigning worksheets once you had enough knowledge for them to be effective teaching tools. The small class size made it very easy to get to know both the teachers and fellow classmates. All around, I loved this class so much, it was the highlight of my first semester!",
                "I would undoubtedly recommend this course to another student, especially over the more common languages such as Chinese and Spanish. I was actually intending on taking Spanish here, but then I met with one of the instructors and found out that they use a lot of online software to teach the course, which makes it so hard to learn a language. It's better to learn a language with face-to-face interaction and when taught by a person, I did not come to Yale to learn Spanish the same way I did in high school. Then I met professor Kiarie at the course fair and he was so friendly and excited, so I switched to Kiswahili last minute and I am so thankful, especially after talking with some of my friends in the Chinese and Spanish classes. Furthermore, more people in the west need to learn how to speak languages like Kiswahili, especially at an institution like Yale."
