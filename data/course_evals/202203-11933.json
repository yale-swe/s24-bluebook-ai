                "A full and nuanced picture of the lives and marriage of Nelson and Winnie Mandela. The course also briefly covers more philosophical topics, like forgiveness and nonviolence more broadly at the end.",
                "I was able to experiences the various dimensions of the political personalities,as well as the personal relationships, commonalities and differences of Nelson and Winnie Mandela, as well as the turmoil South Africa was experiencing during that time period.",
                "This was my favorite class of the semester. Nelson and Winnie Mandela are two fascinating icons with so much depth to each of their stories - every week, there was always something new to discover. We also discussed the topics of autobiography and the power of the celebrity figure amidst controversy in politics. Discussions were always stimulating and Prof. Steinberg is incredibly knowledgeable and insightful. It was truly an honour to be able to engage with the guest speakers, who included Mac Maharaj (he transcribed Nelson's biography whilst imprisoned on Robben Island, and served on his cabinet!).",
                "Through this seminar, I gained a deeper appreciation for the layers of Nelson and Winnie Mandela's marriage. I think that Prof. Steinberg prompts us to critically evaluate the concept of a political marriage but also think about it from the perspectives of empathy, anger, and survival.",
                "I learned about the political and personal lives of Nelson and Winnie Mandela. Also had the opportunity to put them in conversation with other major political figures and theorists like Fanon and Gandhi.",
                "Not only did I learn so much about the Mandelas' personal lives and the political theory that influenced them throughout this semester, but this course challenged me to adopt a new political science perspective to my research as a history major. I learned so much from Professor Steinberg and the other students in this class  about how to study political figures and, interestingly, the role of memory and image within history. I also gained new writing and research skills through our response papers and two research essays.",
                "The disciplinary differences between history, sociology, and journalism. Fascinating to read Steinbergs book and listen to him in class. I learned about South Africa and the project of biography. Also, necessarily, about Nelson and Winnie Mandela."

            "comments": [
                "The reading material and class discussions are interesting, but at the end of the day it is run as your average History seminar, with student discussions taking up most of the class, framed by remarks from the professor. Compared to other classes I have taken at Yale and in the History, AFST, and Poli-Sci departments in particular, this format is just less engaging and less exciting. The classes are also hugely shaped by the students taking the class, so I assume it is vastly different from year to year.",
                "The content was extremely interesting and was a very unique approach to understanding the conflict of the African states during this time period, as well as the political involvement of many prominent figures of the anti-apartheid movement.  The guest speakers added a very interesting dimension to the class discussions and Professor Steinberg's intimate knowledge on the subject was extremely enlightening.",
                "I think that while this course was extremely informative and covered an extensive amount of South African history, the transitions and connections between the Mandelas, Fanon, and Gandhi were a bit abrupt. I am not well-versed in political theory or philosophy so it would have helped to assign some easier background readings to supplement or have a brief discussion in class. I think I connected my thoughts the best when Prof. Steinberg got up and drew diagrams or shared his own personal thoughts to help us visualize what we were learning--examples include the spheres of Winnie Mandela's existence, Nelson Mandela's political ideology, and understanding the racial segregation of South Africa.",
                "Strengths: content is so engaging, its great to spend such a prolonged amount of time with two political figures. This is not an opportunity you often get in PLSC classes and it makes for some in-depth learning.\r\n\r\nI only wish I had gone into the class with a stronger grasp of South African history and the events of the anti-apartheid movement. You certainly have the opportunity to learn this as the class goes on, but I feel that coming in with that background would have made the learning even easier.",
                "The strengths of this course were its discussion format and the texts that we studied. I loved reading the material for this class every week, and our discussions greatly enhanced my understanding not only of the texts that we read, but also of bigger questions of the historical time period, political theory, and the politics of representation. It was incredible to read and hear from Professor Steinberg's deep knowledge about this history, and it was equally fascinating to talk with the guest speakers he brought to class. While focusing on two figures alone was new for me as a history student, I do not think that this class had any weaknesses!",
                "I liked the readings and structure of the course. I wish our conversations could have had more structure - I would have liked a set of questions to discuss. As it was, our conversations could be free form and devolve into a lot of nothings. But Steinberg was kind and interesting at every turn."

                "If you are very interested in the topics covered in the syllabus, yes! Otherwise I doubt this class will make you more interested in them. I would recommend this course to younger students with time and energy to engage in the reading material and to get a sense of a traditional seminar at Yale. I hesitate to recommend this class to anyone not already very interested in the material.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone that has an interest in political figures and the way they deal with conflict domestically and internationally.",
                "Yes! Every student is incredibly engaged with this seminar. Not only will you learn about two fascinating characters, but you will also gain insights on the art of autobiographies and the power of political figures.",
                "I would recommend! I really really loved this class. Its quite interdisciplinary, in that it requires you to think like a political scientist, like a historian, and even like a biographer (which takes on a bit of psychology). I think if youre interested in Nelson and Winnie Mandela and their story, youll enjoy this class. The readings are well-selected. They feel pretty comprehensive without being too long - makes it very doable to complete the reading each week.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material was fascinating, and Professor Steinberg is one of the most conscientious and engaging professors that I have had at Yale. I loved completing the readings for the course each week, and our class had fascinating discussions each and every week. This course challenged me to see the past through a new perspective, making me a better writer and history student. You should definitely take this course before you graduate Yale!",
