                "Strengths: knowledgeable, passionate teacher\r\nWeaknesses: incredibly boring (sorry)",
                "strengths: an amazing, engaging professor who is hilarious and makes the class so fun; the class is helpful despite being dry \r\nweaknesses: psets graded harshly",
                "Professor Thomas is a committed and passionate teacher and does a good job making a less than thrilling topic engaging. The course covers a lot of helpful statistical analysis that could be helpful in future courses or work depending on your academic and professional direction. While the class was made to be as engaging as possible there were a few resources that I felt were lacking. It was extremely frustrating not to be given pset solutions, midterm solutions, or midterm and final practice exams. The teaching staff was extremely specific with their grading and expected word for word answers. It would have been a lot easier to study and learn from my mistakes if solutions could have been posted to psets, exams, etc.",
                "Strengths: Slides and sections are very digestible to understand. JT is a good professor (but takes a long time to respond to your email). The learning curve is really steep, and I feel like I learned a lot. \r\nWeakness: Office hours are not helpful. Grading on Psets tends to be harsh, and the psets are LONG. Disorganized at times.",
                "The course is excellent. It is well-structured, well-explained, and very practical and applicable to future work.",
                "Strengths - JT is very engaging and supportive, the material is super useful, the course is well-organized. Weaknesses - psets are graded quite slowly, and the grading is sometimes quite opaque. I also felt that the lecture style was also not particularly suited to large groups - JT asks a lot of questions, but sometimes students provide several answers / don't provide one very clear answer, and it is often difficult to pinpoint the correct answer and make sure you understood it completely - it would be very useful if the correct answer was repeated to the entire class for clarity.",
                "Strengths: JT is an amazing instructor and does as much as he can to keep lectures interesting and interactive. Weakness: we did not get midterm corrections, problem set corrections, or practice problems for the final. Pset grading was very harsh and inconsistent.",
                "Phenomenal teaching: sometimes a bit quick, but always slowed down when requested or clearly needed.",
                "I think this class is sometimes more geared towards people who want to go into research themselves than simply towards creating research literacy. However, my main critique is that the tests and problem sets are very particular to specific interpretation language, but often the interpretations arent provided anywhere. So, wed end up in office hours at the last minute asking the TAs to guess as to interpretations, since there was no info in the slides. I think if youre going to be picky about language, you have to make that language easy to find. The strength of this class is that JT is a very engaging and fun lecturer!",
                "One of the best lectures I have ever been to. There's a reason around 80-100 people come to class every day even though it's recorded. JT is so fun, makes the material real and interesting, and always keeps it at our pace. I have no clue how he always knows what we might be confused about and addresses it but he always does. The course is fun in that it's intellectually challenging and you have to spend some time on your own wrestling with the concepts, but there is support for you and once it clicks it's so satisfying. Can't think of any ways to improve. Really enjoyed.",
                "The weakness of this course is Professor Thomas or \"JT\". Unresponsive, pretentious, can't clearly explain the material, and all the time tells his stupid stories about playing ball with friends instead of teaching. I love stats, but he made me hate it. I have no idea what qualifies him as a professor.",
                "Professor Thomas is the strength of this course as this is a requirement of the Global Affairs major. The p-sets prepare you well for the midterm and final.",
                "JT is a gem. He teaches statistics in a way that is engaging and easy to digest, even to students who do not have STEM backgrounds. It is an incredible and empowering experience to be able to learn statistics and practical knowledge used in policy problem-solving within the classroom. The one area of improvement would be PSET grading and answers. I have felt that the PSET graders were at times inconsistent, as people in my study group and I would at times get a score difference as large as 5 points while working through the PSETS together. I would also really find it helpful to have PSET answer keys, because often what students write on PSETS are more complicated than needed.",
                "Strengths: instructor and TAs are helpful\r\nWeaknesses: grading can be tough, lots of specificity",
                "Instruction by both the professor and TAs was amazing. My only complaint (And its a small one) is that the problem sets sometimes weren't posted until late on Thursday or early Friday. The best time of the week for me to work on them would have been Thursdays or Wednesday nights, and it often felt like they were posted a bit too late so I would scramble to fit them in elsewhere. In a perfect world for student work load, I think the problem sets could be posted Wednesday shortly after class. But everything else was great, and I learned so much from this course! Would absolutely recommend to others.",
                "The strength is that JT is a very experienced teacher who is clearly very familiar with the course material and delivers the course professionally. The powerpoint slides however may not be self-explanatory at times.",
                "The grading of this course is extremely nitpicky and specific. More transparency about what the exact thing that graders are looking for on Psets and exams would be helpful in the future.",
                "This entire sequence should be substituted out for S&DS courses.",
                "The strengths of the course is clearly the professor and his teaching. The weakness is the overly strict grading on psets and exams.",
                "Weaknesses- the way office hours were set up. The times were all during the day and never in the afternoon which works best with a lot of students' schedules. In addition, the office hours were only by appointment, so for some weeks I found myself out of luck when it came to getting help. \r\n\r\nStrengths- lectures were pretty engaging and the content discussed in class was actually and fairly reflected on the exams and psets we were given. Psets were good study materials and feedback was usually received swiftly.",
                "It's an amazing course.",
                "I loved this class!",
                "JT is a great lecturer and while the psets are long, they really helped me consolidate what I learned in lecture. Section was also always helpful, because we did structured review of that weeks material (and that usually helped with psets).",
                "Strengths: I really like stats and data science, but I need to feel like its motivated by real world goals. This class taught me how to orient my analytical/ quantitative thinking towards human centered results. \r\nWeaknesses: some of the work felt like busy work.",
                "I think the course was great, however lecture slides could be a bit better at explaining concepts. While I attended every lecture, I still felt like if I missed a word/phrase that was said I couldnt find it elsewhere in the slides.",
                "Strengths: it's a straightforward class, with not a ton of tricks up its sleeve. Exams are pretty aligned with the psets, the lectures are super engaging, and the discussion sections really help to outline what takeaways you should have from each week. Weaknesses: takes a long time for psets to come back, and they varied wildly in length, making it hard to predict how long an assignment would take each week. Also, we tended to spend multiple lectures on the same subject, which decreased some engagement with the class.",
                "Strengths: JT is an amazing professor.  You learn a lot of the underlying statistical principles as opposed to just rote applications.\r\nWeaknesses: It's a mandatory stats class.  It's not expected to be perfectly engaging or fascinating at all times.  You'll learn a ton, but if statistics frustrates you, you're going to have at least a little difficulty.",
                "The main strengths of the course lie with JT, who is a really wonderful professor. I especially appreciate how he always goes out of his way to give engaging and interactive lectures, and he provides great support to students. Additionally, I think this class has one of the highest practical real-world utilities of any Yale class Ive take. One weakness is that I found JTs lecture slides to be super unhelpful when it came to studying for exams and doing problem sets; the information is poorly displayed and has a bunch of questions but never any answers.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is that all of the data analysis is with real data sets, meaning that it feels like you are solving real mysteries and looking for real-life trends on every problem set and exam. The biggest weakness of this course is that the content can be dense and little supporting materials are provided to you  no past exams or practice problems ahead of exams.",
                "The strength of the class is that each subject builds on to the previous one. The data analysis is very well taught.",
                "Strength: Long p-sets, but being allowed to do these together with friends made it such a great time. I learned so much through these problem sets! JT was also really cool. \r\nWeaknesses: JT had a bit of a stretch where he explained things that didn't make much sense. He came back around in the end, but it was difficult at points. Also, his lecture notes did not help as much as they did in AQA 1, as there were many conceptual questions that were not answered throughout class or in any other setting. Jane's section notes helped much more in understanding what exactly we needed to know.",
                "One strength of the class this semester were the TFs - loved Jane and Sidney, they were both super helpful and always willing to answer all of my questions (dumb questions and all). Another strength is that the exams are pretty similar to the psets, which makes studying a little bit easier. And I will say, even though the psets were long, I put a lot of time into them (both on my own and then asking questions at office hours / with my study group) and as a result I really learned the material and felt well prepared for the exams. Section was also super helpful - we would do worksheets or go through power points with examples of the problems, making the theoretical explanations from lecture a bit more tangible and digestible, and also helped with the problem sets, A weakness is the timeliness -- psets were often posted late, which was annoying to deal with at times in terms of my weekly schedule of work. Also, JT usually doesn't answer his emails, so do not count on him answering your questions via email.  Another weakness is the lack of office hours. JT offers like 1 hour of office hours a week or maybe an hour and a half, in 15 minute slots (so 4-6 slots per week basically) and you have to sign up via canvas, but if you don't click on the sign up the minute he posts them then you can't get an office hours slot with him which is annoying. The TFs also only offer an hour each, which is a little tough to work with in terms of not being enough time for questions and also class schedules too.",
                "I liked that the problem sets were graded and feedback was given, but points were often taken off for what felt like such minute, irrelevant details. The exams reflected what was covered on the problem sets and there were no surprises.",
                "Strengths: teaching materials are interesting. Recording lectures made completing problem sets and reviewing for exams easier (facilitated the absorption of material... and I attended all classes in-person). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps the pace was too fast. Problem sets were frequently overlong. Class administration organization could be improved. Grading on problem sets and exams was inconsistent and frequently did not help me understand/ comprehend the material or what I got wrong. There were insufficient office hours to follow up.",
                "It would be good to have more teaching assistants who can support in learning the key concepts outside of lectures.  The TFs did a good job and JT is super dedicated to his students, but just too many students to be able to get individualized attention as / when required."

                "Highly. JT is one of the few professors who could really keep you engaged even though it's a lecture class about statistics, and he's the only professor who cold calls that I don't hate for it, which is a difficult feat. If JT is behind on lecture material and we haven't gotten through it, no harm no foul, that won't be covered, and you won't be penalized, he won't rush through it, it just won't come to anything. He's fair and generous, and JT is the reason this course is so fantastic.",

                "I would recommend for Global Students as they have to take it. Try to find a study group for the class in order to work on psets because they are pretty difficult and they are harshly graded.",
                "Yes, it's a class that will push you, but it is not an impossible course.",
                "Absolutely. Excellent theoretical and practical overview.",
                "I loved this class!",
                "If youre a global major, you have to take the class obviously, but its a good class!!",
                "If you are a global student, you have to take this course so not sure how much choice you have in the matter. But its definitely an interesting course.",
                "No",
                "Yes! JT is a wonderful instructor and its evident he really cares about the students. I really felt like a walked away with a tangible skill set Ill use in the future.",
                "Absolutely if youre a global major, of course. But I honestly think that this course is so valuable for everyone studying any field. As a pre-med student, I could instantly begin applying what I learned in class to numerous papers on clinical trials and the like.",
                "Yes. Besides the fact it's a requirement for the Global Affairs major, it's a great basis for statistical analysis, and makes you very comfortable with STATA and different analytic techniques. JT's also a fantastic professor who really cares about his students, and it shows in the enthusiasm he brings to lecture and the course content.",
                "If you are a Global Affairs major, you have to take this course.  If you are not, you cannot.  For GLBL 122, this question is irrelevant.\r\nHowever, that said, it is an extremely valuable class with many career applications.  It is recommended, even if it is required.",
                "Well, you have to take this course if youre a global major and you can only take this course if youre a global major. But, I would recommend taking it directly after 121 (or your substitute) rather than waiting.",
                "I would not recommend this course to students outside of the Global Affairs major. Grading is tough, the work is tough, and the attention to detail for the work is incredibly high.",
                "Yes, since we are all global majors we have to take it. But I really felt like I learned something, and walking out of the AQA final I felt very accomplished.",
                "You have to take it if you are a global major, however I would recommend to another student regardless as long as you are willing to put in the work. This was my \"hardest\" class this semester in that I put the most energy into it and as a result feel like I learned a ton and got a lot out -- setting me up well for the rest of the major classes, and for whenever I need to read a social science research paper.",
                "I would only recommend this course if the student needed it to fulfill a requirement. It was extremely challenging and not always that interesting.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes!  For students who want to gain skills relevant to regression analysis, I'd definitely recommend it.",
                "Absolutely. The course is a nice gateway into research design and statistical analysis, and it's especially great for someone who isn't a hardcore stats person and is looking to get a pretty good foundation for applied stats.\r\nAlso, JT is a fantastic professor, probably one of the best lecturers at Yale I've met so far in terms of teaching ability."
