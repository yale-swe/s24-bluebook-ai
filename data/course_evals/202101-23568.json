                "I learned how to conduct some geographical research methods and how to think about space from the perspective of a critical geographer. This class gave me the tools to think about how physical places and space shape our lives and how they are related to countless social issues today. We talked about space and place not only from the perspective of geographers but also from critical theorists on race and class and gender. Overall this class helped me understand how I relate to place and how others relate to it as well.",

Counter-mapping was my favorite assignment, building off the lesson that maps, like other pieces of text, speak. Creating my own map allowed me to tell a very personal story. As people and maps attempt to define and represent particular places, the discussion of power is necessary to understand this process of meaning-making. I was also so struck by Don Mitchell's landscape axioms that I continue carrying them into my current work at the Peabody as an exhibit assistant writing labels for the North American Dioramas."

                "The field work was the greatest strength of this course, and I enjoyed the opportunity to learn from non-textual sources. For me, the class discussions and essay feedback were two weaknesses of the course. In general, the discussions closely followed the texts, to the extent that class participation was largely just the regurgitation of facts from readings. This was particularly disappointing given the interesting field work/materials that my peers and I could have presented and discussed, so I think that a shift of discussion focus from readings to field work could greatly improve this class. The essay feedback also fell short for methe grading was so focused on fairly rudimentary structural elements (i.e. thesis statement, paragraphs, etc.) that it was difficult to make any nuanced claims. I also felt that, in order to receive a good grade on a paper, I needed to fully agree with the professor/TA, which resulted in me cutting back on the ideas that I wanted to explore.",
                "strengths: field projects and flexibility\r\n\r\nweaknesses: seminar encouraged us to recall readings more than allowing us to discuss ideas. would probably be better in person though",
                "what a great class!!! I really really enjoyed the aspects of place we explored and also the projects we did! one thing to consider might be opening up the discussions a bit more --  I know it's tough over zoom and you folks did an awesome job adapting to virtual, but I think it would be so interesting for class discussions to be a little less structured so conversations can meander a little more! Honestly this might be more doable for an in-person class because I know our time was shorter to prevent zoom screen time (which I really appreciate) but just something to think about for the future. even still, classes were SO engaging and interesting and I honestly did look forward to this class every week!",
                "I think this class had a great organizational structure. The weekly readings were sometimes long but usually very manageable and always engaging and interesting. We had a fair amount of work but it was spread out throughout the semester so we never had too much work due at the same time. Our discussions were usually very well organized, and the projects had clear directions and expectations. One weakness of the course was the turnaround time between class and the time the projects were due. Since we normally went over our projects a bit during class, sometimes it was tough to finish class at 5 and then turn in the project by midnight. Overall though I really enjoyed every single class session and I learned so much from my peers and professors.",
                "This course packed a lot of work into a short amount of time (weekly papers, field projects, and readings), which was difficult around midterm season. By the end of the semester though, I didn't mind it! The material is engaging enough that it honestly wasn't that bad. I also think the field projects were really fun and exciting - Prof Barraclough is deeply committed to transformative education and allowing students to do practical field work, which made the class all the more engaging! I also received clear feedback on every paper, which was nice.",
                "Strengths: Really good readings and discussion set-up in class. Having smaller discussion groups within the seminar group was very helpful! Check-in weeks are very helpful too.",
                "I love how the course was split into the theoretical and practical framework. As a person who struggles to learn from reading thick texts of theory, the weekly field project assignments allowed me to play with different geographical ideas and see first-hand their productivity and their problems. The short essays also constantly pushed me as a writer to make my ideas more succinct without sacrificing style."

It is a fair amount of work but if you are at all interested in space/evst/urban studies this class is so interesting and I think ties in so many important ideas that we should all think about when we think of space and geography. The professor organizes class in a way that makes sense and helps you build on previous knowledge. I always feel like I got so much from the class discussions, and could relate many of the topics from the readings to my own life.",
                "DO NOT take a class from professor Barraclough if you are sick, disabled, or have any life circumstances that might make your participation a challenge. She claims to be willing to be flexible and supportive but will be neither. I should have trusted the negative reviews of her indigenous geographies class (2019 Fall, ER&M 320), as the instructor they describe was exactly the instructor I received. Read them before you take any class from her.",
