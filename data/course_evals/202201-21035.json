Case studies in history wars and memory studies related to: slavery, settler colonialism, anti-Mexican violence, the Confederacy, the civil rights movement, individual figures like W.E.B. Du Bois, the Holocaust, Japanese \"internment,\" terrorism, and police brutality.",
                "I learned about ongoing historical debates going on in the U.S. at the intersection of race, class, and gender.",
                "I learned so much in this class! We covered a ton of diverse topics and I gained a different perspective on so many issues, some of which I'd never even thought about before. I also learned how to write an op-ed, which was cool. I talk about the topics we covered in this class with everyone in my life now, it was so informative and changed my outlook on a huge array of issues. Definitely learned about the role of telling and recording history in shaping the present day.",
                "This course was a pretty incredible series of case studies about instances where folks in different American settings and times encountered silencing or reducing historical forces. As such, we learned not only about American history but about the way historical memory is dynamic and conflicted in the present day. We broadly developed analytical skills by developing and answering discussion questions each week and working to tie each weeks events to course ideas.",
                "I learned more about how to understand historical memory, and its meanings in the 21st century.",
                "I learned about historical memory, particularly through the lens of certain subjects, such as Civil Rights, concentration camps, and colonization. We had engaging discussions about who writes history, why, and how and about the ways we memorialize. I learned how to engage with certain texts to formulate my ideas that challenged easier perspectives on historiography."

            "comments": [
                "The concepts covered in class are interesting and worth much consideration, but simultaneously, I felt that the course was somewhat repetitive to a fault in its themes. It seemed like we would talk about the same arguments made in previous classes without trying to complicate our discussions or challenge those opinions in good-faith. To be sure, HIST 145J was a wonderful course, and I very much think that Professor Duensing's presence added to the overall experience. I still wish, though, that Professor Duensing acted more assertively during seminars. Class discussions, especially in the second half of our two-hour sessions, would start to noticeably slow down. \r\n\r\nMore classes that primarily deal with historiography and the philosophy of history--like HIST 145J--should exist at Yale. Professor Duensing's class certainly helps fulfill a need.",
                "Strengths: the readings (almost every week's selections were excellent and memorable), the assignments (midterm op-ed and creative final project), the professor (Anna is amazing!). There were no glaring weaknesses, but I would offer two suggestions. First, because it was such a large seminar, I think more in-class activities and small-group work would have broken up discussion and kept more people more engaged. We did fewer of those kind of activities in the latter half of the semester, but I thought they had been working well. Second, I really appreciated how this course examined the production of history as a site of both domination and resistance, but sometimes I felt the balance was a bit off: like there was too much focus on how powerful actors silence/repress certain histories of violence, and not enough about how people resist the dominant story and effectively promote alternative narratives. For this reason some sessions ended on too pessimistic a note. I noticed this more with the latter half of the syllabus. Overall though, an enriching course led by a great instructor.",
                "Strengths: The readings were very well-selected and manageable while also still being intellectually challenging. Anna was a highly approachable and warm instructor. I thought our seminar had a great dynamic.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "No weaknesses. This was a great class and I learned a ton. It was very well-structured with lots of student engagement and freedom to explore any topic in the midterm and final projects.",
                "I loved the variety of readings we did in the course, and, although our class was quite big, it was an intimate group who I really felt safe discussing and challenging ideas with. One weakness is that we definitely needed a bigger classroom.",
                "Occasionally the readings could be a bit lengthy, but Professor Duensing did a great job highlighting the most important texts. I also really enjoyed the flexibility of our two assignments. This flexibility allowed me to create projects and focus on topics that were much more relevant and exciting to me. Professor Duensing also did a great job create a class environment that fostered productive discussions on sensitive subjects."

                "Yes!!! I learned so much about historical thinking and discussion not only from the professor but from classmates. It was also one of my first Yale history courses  it was challenging but in a really impactful way. Easily one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale.",
                "Absolutely - it was an intellectually engaging course where we explored many different historical moments as case studies to understand historical memory. Anyone who is a fan of history, or wants to think more about what history means to us today, should take this course.",
                "Absolutely. The discussions we had are important for all citizens to engage with, particularly during a time when there is increased reckoning on this country's identity.",
                "Absolutely! I have had few classes as truly engaging and valuable (at Yale and in life) than this class. Listening to all my classmates final presentations during the last class really put into perspective how impactful and impressive the work facilitated by this class is! Anna did an amazing job teaching us about so much and facilitating class conversations. I really really enjoyed this class!"
