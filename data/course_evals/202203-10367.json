                "I learned about important theorists of liberalism, along with some amusing historical anecdotes",
                "I learned a lot about a lot: what went wrong in the post-Cold War era, grand strategy, basic international relations, current events, etc. This course covers everything in a palatable way. Professor Gaddis calls it \"grand strategy lite,\" which I think is a very accurate appraisal.",
                "This course made me 3x wiser",
                "I really enjoyed Professor Gaddis's seminar.  Despite the name not giving much of a description, the class is ultimately a class about the patterns of history with a specific focus on the Cold War and post-Cold War Eras.  Gaddis is obviously an expert in the Cold War, and our seminar took place during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, so we spent the bulk of our time discussing the Cold War as well as contemporary events.  The readings for this class asked a lot of me and I will admit that I did not always do all of them, but I learned about an incredibly broad range of history topics.  Gaddis gives paper feedback both on content and writing, and he is incredibly thorough and fast.  I would suggest this class to anyone (like me) who feels that they understand the general themes of the Cold War and post-Cold War Eras but feels like they would like to know more details as well as how to draw parallels between different historical events.",
                "I learned a lot about the theory of strategy, leadership, and the broad history of US foreign policy in the Post-Cold War Era.",

                "I learned a lot more about foreign policy and definitely think I now have a good grasp on grand strategy. The Berlin readings were particularly enlightening, and their wisdom will certainly stay with me as I move forward as a learner and a leader. Professor Gaddis is also strict about clarity of writing which urged me to produce concise essays and refine my style."

            "comments": [
                "The discussions were quite poor. It never felt like Professor Gaddis actually wanted to discuss something, it seemed like, whenever he posed a question, he had a very specific answer he wanted to hear. He would cut off students and shut down nuance in a way that kind of seemed anti-intellectual.\r\n\r\nThe readings in the first half of the course were very, very strong. It gradually declined in quality, especially when we read the modern theories for Western decline, all of which could have been explained in a few pages, each.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gaddis is brilliant -- but the feedback and expectations were often unclear.",
                "This was a super solid course. I thought the class discussions were generally productive and thought-provoking, and the essay prompts were pretty fun. I had a blast in this class and I highly recommend it, whether or not you'd traditionally find yourself in a History seminar.",
                "Weaknesses- too many students. This at time made discussions difficult and it hard to get a word in, and topics at times got unfocused. Minimal critique, however.\r\n\r\nStrengths - Very interesting and relevant discussion which would often focus on changes to the world order that happened just the day prior. Grounded in history and classical grand strategy and highly relevant. All the writing assignments were creative, educational, and fun to write. Fantastic assignments, great feedback, and discussions were always interesting and usually lively.",
                "I came to yale to take courses like this. This is what it is all about.",
                "Strengths: this course covers basically all of history in a comparative way and attempts to dry parallels between different time periods, which made it more interesting than time period specific courses.  Gaddis gives incredibly thorough, prompt, and detailed feedback and is always happy to meet outside of class to discuss anything.  The readings are heavy but they are usually interesting and the syllabus is updated much more frequently than most other Yale courses.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, Professor Gaddis has a tendency to lecture rather than facilitate seminar.  The broad content we tried to cover at times felt vague and abstract.  The discussion would often go off the rails without someone to steer it back toward the initial question asked.  And lastly, I felt that there were about 10 students too many in the class, which made discussion less engaging just by the nature of the giant class.",
                "Strengths: Reading Gaddis' book, On Grand Strategy, with him as an instructor is a fantastic experience. I had read it before the class on my own, and did not get a third of the value from it as I did reading along with him and the seminar. A genuinely perspective-changing, thought-provoking, wonderful experience. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Unfortunately, after Gaddis' book is done (first third of the course), the quality really drops off. Not only are some of the other books far worse, but also class discussion becomes much less focused and less interesting. If you have taken classes on US foreign policy before, or have even had a decently passing level of engagement with this topic before, the class becomes a exercise in listening to your classmates extemporize on how they think the Cold War / Post Cold War US FP went... which is not typically very interesting. Without Gaddis' book (or the Isaiah Berlin essays) as a guide, the class is not a uniquely excellent experience, by and large.\r\n\r\nImprovement: Gaddis should talk/lecture more, especially when it is not his book. Otherwise discussions are too disorganized and often lack the punch of the earlier parts of the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gaddis' expertise, fascinating core text (On Grand Strategy was my favorite book of 2022), classroom was buffed with Colonels/Eli Whitney students who brought interesting experience to the table, learning grand strategy is exceptionally useful in everyday life\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class discussion was sometimes too abstract, not anchored enough to feel like we were getting anywhere. Class size was also huge for a seminar (26 students).",
                "While the readings and content were very interesting, I think the seminar discussions suffered a bit. The class often felt like a mini lecture, and when it didn't, many of the students were preaching to the professor rather than debating with each other. Students never really stopped competing for attention and posturing their intelligence. To an extent this makes sense in the course of a highly accomplished professor (who it was a joy to learn from), but the few truly engaged discussions made me wish we had more."

                "I expect that some other comments will be critical of this class. They might say that the readings were rarely directly discussed in class, that Gaddis' grading was a bit arcane and subjective at times, and that every person gave off section asshole vibes. Some of that is embellishment but there's a ring of truth to most of it. HOWEVER. This class is worth it. Gaddis holds a lot of wisdom and is an excellent foreign policy mind. He will try to make you see history in completely new ways. He's a gem, and the class won't be around forever. If you expect this class to be something it isn't, you won't enjoy it. But if you realize you're taking it mainly for the privilege of sitting around with Gaddis and catching a few moments of deep insight each class, it's worth it.",
                "Maybe. The readings are good, the discussion isn't, the assignments were odd!",
                "I would strongly recommend. This class is a condensed version of what the Gaddis Grand Strategy Program used to be like. Totally take it",
                "Yes",
                "Professor Gaddis is like the greatest human I have ever met. Taking his seminar is like learning history from Yoda. If you are lucky enough to learn from him, thank your lucky stars",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are willing to do the reading necessary to get through the class and understand that the professor will push back against points brought up in class.  I had never had a professor before tell me that they thought that I was completely wrong about something before this class, but I believe that it made me grow immensely as a student.  It's an unrealistic expectation that all the reading is done, but having a good understanding is essential before class.  Do not be intimidated by the syllabus or the professor or the typical student you think would be interested in this class.  If the syllabus sounds interesting to you, try your best to take it!",
                "I would still recommend this class to anyone, on the basis of reading Gaddis' book with him in the first third of the class being so fantastic as to make up for the somewhat mediocre later two-thirds of the course. If you are well experienced with US foreign policy history, the material itself will not be that interesting but the discussions can be, if Gaddis gets involved in guiding them. \r\n\r\nThe course was very uneven: from fantastic initially to mediocre in the later half. Overall, I would still take it,but temper your expectations.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class because learning grand strategy and learning from Professor Gaddis are amazing opportunities. Two caveats: be prepared for Professor Gaddis to grade based on a niche writing checklist, make sure you have 2 other junior seminars (it's a great course but in no way prepares you for a history thesis)",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in foreign policy and grand strategy. The seminar sections sometimes drag, but if you're interested in the subject matter, you'll definitely learn a lot and truly find wisdom that will stick with you for a long time. That said, if you're not interested in the specific material of the course, it's not so much a history class in the second half as current events/foreign relations, and you may not find it very enjoyable without those interests."
