I got lots of good, general information on concepts like the media, interest groups, and direct democracy. There was a couple really interesting lectures on theories about the government. Most of the information wasn't super new to me, and was similar to high school government\/US history course information.",

                "No weaknesses, amazing class! Fairdosi is a great lecturer and the team of TAs was incredible. Lectures are easy to follow and interesting. I can't say enough great things.",
                "This course covers a lot of important material, and the professor is very engaging. It would benefit from a longer block of it; we were often cut short as class ended, and we were limited in the information we could cover. I also found the writing assignment to be jarring after having very little written work for the rest of the semester.",
                "I think the strengths of this course was that it did not assume anyone's level of knowledge of American politics and was truly and Introduction.  I think this course can be improved by having the notes of the lecture posted in case certain points were missed or if the lecture runs over time.",
                "Weaknesses: lectures are quite slow. Wish we could have gone a bit deeper into the topics. Felt like it was taught below the level of a Yale intro political science class.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Low-stress. And TA Jack Greenberg really gave it his all!",
                "Section was great. Lecture content was very straightforward but could have been more engaging at times. I liked the format of the assessments (midterm, paper, final).",
                "This is a very basic course that delivers exactly what its title says: an introduction to American politics. With that said, a lot of it was reviewing American history rather than discussing the connections of different parts of government today.",
                "I have no strengths of this course to offer except for the actual workload it's very manageable. \r\nI found the lecture style to be terrible. Prof Fairdosi just puts up a list of text on to the screen and then reads from his notes in the same spot for an hour twice a week. Incredibly disengaging and hard to pay attention. He also kept plugging his Congress course from next semester.",
                "Class was at times a bit disorganized, concepts were never fully explored in depth.",
                "Strengths: generally engaging content that covered a lot of important ground, in a topic as broad as American politics\r\nWeaknesses: lectures generally ran over time and were rather disorganized at times, leading to some content being covered disproportionately compared to others",
                "Strengths: the lecture plan was well organized to facilitate learning, and Prof. Fairdosi is an authority on the topic. Section is actually interesting, which is a welcome break. \r\nWeaknesses: the course demanded nearly no engagement apart from occasional writing assignments. \r\nImprovement: more readings would be nice, especially since the textbook is mind-numbingly boring.",
                "I wish the teacher made lecture slides to take notes off of",
                "As an intro class it was very good but could be improved by diving a little more into certain parts of government.",
                "A strength is that you get a good general survey of the history and current landscape of American politics. The course is also not a ton of work, and is very manageable. A weakness is that I didn't learn quite as much new information as I would've hoped. I wasn't super engaged in lectures or section. There wasn't a lot fo feedback on work.",
                "I thought the lectures were easy to follow and interesting. One weakness was we didnt always follow the syllabus towards the end because of lack of time. My TA gave great feedback on the writing assignments",
                "i thought the lectures were interesting and the sections were well structured to cover all the material",
                "Strengths: well-organized course, professor makes content very accessible",
                "This course could have been a bit faster so that we could cover more material. However, the material that was covered was interesting and useful to a thorough understanding of American government.",
                "This class made me feel like I was back in high school and not in a good way.  Our textbook was probably written for a 9th grade audience, and Prof. Fairdosi taught the class similarly.  Prof. Faridosi essentially read off of his lecture notes verbatim for the entirety of every lecture in an incredibly monotonous tone of voice.  I get that this was an intro course, but Prof. Fairdosi treated us like we had never heard of something called politics before.  One gem was \"Political scientists want to know what people think, but it turns out we can't actually ask everyone what they think, so we do something called a poll based on something called a sample.\"  Similarly, we spent about 5 minutes of one class defining what gerrymandering is, and several more minutes of another defining a legal brief.  There's a way to teach an engaging and informative intro course that doesn't assume a deep background in the material, but this was not even close to being it.\r\n\r\nProfessor Fairdosi also seemed to lack a basic understanding of the courses material.  For example, he informed the class that there are four freedoms protected under the First Amendment, when there are famously five.  Moreover, we fell super far behind the syllabus, meaning that there was a decent chunk of information that we simply did not cover.  At best, it felt like Prof. Fairdosi just treated this class as a way to advertise his class on the U.S. Congress, given that he mentioned it at least once a week while lecturing.  \r\n\r\nThis class could be improved by completely rewriting the syllabus and not letting Prof. Fairdosi within a mile radius of the classroom.",
                "more videos and other engaging things in lecture",
                "I feel there were many strengths with this course. Firstly, I enjoyed the structure and outline of the class. I feel the layout and use of papers to reflect knowledge was very engaging. All of the assigned papers\/essays allowed creativity and knowledge to combine. Secondly, I loved the teaching style and use of a lecture outline. Each lecture was very organized and easy to follow. The lectures inspired creativity. Lastly, I loved the flexibility and understanding that the professor and Teaching Fellow had for classmates throughout the semester. Personally, a weakness of the course was the class location. Overall, the strengths of the course outweighed the one weakness regarding the location.",
                "Strength: good general overview of American politics for those who aren't too familiar with how it works. Weakness: The lectures sometimes felt dry and it was hard to be engaged in the subject material not that the subject material isn't interesting, but the way in which it was taught.",
                "strengths: great flexibility in assignments and lectures. no weaknesses",
                "Excellent",
                "Lectures were interesting yet at a slow pace, and very repetitive of the textbook. Readings outside of the textbook would diversify the information.",
                "Both the Professor and the TF were amazing at presenting the course concepts in clear ways and the suggested reading enhanced the concepts we learned about.",
                "could be cool to bringer a speaker in if possible, Prof. Fairdosi is a great lecturer though.",
                "Was hard to stay engaged as lecture was not interactive at all",
                "I think the strengths were a very robust lecture system with thorough outlines, the only weakness was that we would not get to everything in an outlined lecture all the time.",
                "Strengths: great lectures, clear rubrics for assignments, interesting readings and assignments, \r\nWeaknesses: the discussion sections lacked structure and did not add to my learning experience",
                "Professor Fairdosi is extremely engaging and very passionate about the topics at hand. Since it is a lecture, there isn't room to ask questions during class time. The experience also heavily relies on which TA you get, which can be good or bad depending on which one you get."

After declaring as a Political Science major, I decided to take this course as I had never taken a class on American government before. However, if you have already taken a class like AP US Government in high school, I don't think it is necessary to take this course, especially since its main textbook is one used in AP US Gov classrooms.",

Not only did I feel comfortable in that class, but I felt encouraged to think critically and argue both sides regarding political topics. The lectures, for me at least, always went by fast which is really nice. Additionally, this semester the midterm and final were open-note, and we had several days to complete them. The TAs are very helpful in answering questions. The one thing I will say is that some of the readings are quite extensive, and the font on the book is small."
