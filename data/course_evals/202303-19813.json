                "It felt like the amount of material we needed to know for the final was a bit ridiculous.",
                "The structure of the course as a whole is incredible. The projects allow us to explore what were interested in and the readings, lectures, and sections broaden our knowledge and push us to learn more. That being said, they are grossly different than what the final ended up being. A key part of section was being able to read a building (look at it and give an educated guess as to where\/when\/what the building is\/is used for). The final then required us to memorize the buildings we encountered with about two weeks notice (with the building list not finalized until a little over a week before the final). It felt disjointed from what the rest of the course was pushing us to learn.",
                "Strengths: you learn a lot of information about architecture which you can apply when walking around anywhere in the USA (its all around you!) Lectures were engaging and I had a good time discussing readings during section as well. No weaknesses",
                "This class was really interesting and I loved it! Would warn that the readings are not very useful or interesting, and the lectures are essential. Take notes!",
                "The final study guide had too many slide IDs to try to memorize. There was also a substantial amount of readings that were hard to do with the other classes yale students take.",
                "I enjoyed learning a lot about the history of buildings, but think the course could be more engaging.",
                "It's honestly too big and too comprehensive. It's a survey course, but I think Rubin is much more interested in 20th century matters. It feels like it has been forced to grow into the size that it has.",
                "This course is quite good at indexing the history of American architecture and urbanism in a way that remains engaging, insightful, and most importantly fun. I think that the course overall benefits from the ability to immerse its students in the process of architectural development in such a way that confers onto them the skills of architectural analysis in ways that feel natural and perhaps even intuitive. The emphasis on description, change, and comparison really allowed students to develop their own critical thinking processes. The only place I could foresee some need for improvement would be in the ways in which TA's handle their various sections as I noted some discrepancies in TA teaching styles, but this I think speaks to the course's flexibility and fluidity, which I would still consider a strength.",
                "strengths: i know not everyone did the readings every week, but i really thought the choice of readings was excellent. great opportunity to discuss them in depth in sections each week. loved the structure of two lectures and section.",
                "The readings didn't always feel like they connected to lecture. I often felt like discussion sections and lectures also felt separated, like I was taking two different classes. However, lectures were pretty consistently enjoyable and fruitful.",
                "strengths is prof Rubin- super interesting class. workload is lowkey a bit intense- not a super gut. final exam is TOUGH- 150 slide ids and content from class. its a great class that is interesting but be ready to study for the exam.",
                "Strengths: Readings were super interesting, though often quite long (one must master the art of skimming), and lectures were also captivating.  Discussion Section was a great way to dig deeper into that weeks readings and have a productive conversation with my peers. Weaknesses: there was disconnect between the two assignments and the exam  I had to scramble to memorize buildings for slide identifications, when neither of the two previous assignments required any sort of memorization.",
                "This course is fabulous. The lectures are very engaging and informative, with a really strong narrative flow. The assignments are well designed and provide an interesting and in-depth learning experience with a relatively low workload. The readings are a great complement to lecture, without too much overlap. The final exam sounds pretty hard at first, but it's actually not bad and one can succeed on it by having a good grasp of the course themes. My TA discussion sessions were also really good, with a good balance between TA explanations and student discussion.",
                "S: great overview of American architectural history, engaging lectures, great assignments and final.\r\nW: the readings were way too long and not accessible in language or length. many students I spoke to, myself included, said they didn't do the readings because they were too long and didn't feel like they were worth doing. I make this complaint because I love this course so much, but to make it better, the readings should be reviewed so that they are more accessible to everyone and directly pertain to the lecture material.",
                "strengths: professor Rubin and the TFs are caring and tried to be helpful; gut class if you want an easy A \r\nweaknesses: lectures were disorganized, most of the time I don't know where professor Rubin is going with his examples; sections were not helpful and felt like a waste of time; I just didn't feel like I learned anything",
                "Prof. Rubin is a fantastic lecturer, and the assignments are really designed to facilitate learning and are very customizable to student interests, which I really appreciated. Overall a fantastic class  only weaknesses I can think of are: a) the readings are just a bit much (I often found the readings really interesting but was unable to give them the time and attention they deserved) and b) the memorization for the final exam was a bit taxing and time consuming. Pretty minor complaints though one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "The lecture is amazing, and the number of assignments allows students to learn instead of always cramming.",
                "Final exam formate relied too heavily on rote memorization which took away from critical thinking.",
                "Many of the lectures were really disorganized  - it felt like there wasn't a clear point, but rather is was just a collection of facts.  Also the final exam was a lot of memorization",
                "A strength of this course is how accessible it was to everyone, majors and non-majors. You don't need any background whatsoever to do well in the course. There were a decent amount of weaknesses to the course, unfortunately. I think the biggest one is how the lectures often were very hard to follow and it seemed like the professor was just spewing out various facts regarding specific historical buildings and periods. I think it would have been helpful to more clearly establish the overarching themes and key points that students should be understanding, and then going into specific examples and buildings to exemplify this. It felt like I was constantly missing context and it was hard to know what I should be getting out of each lecture.",
                "Strengths: Elihu is an engaging lecturer, and the written assignments (especially the first one to research a building in New Haven) encourage students to engage with the city and contribute to its history. Weaknesses: the final exam is a traditional, memorization + essay-based test, which feels out of step with the assignments leading up to it; I wish the lectures were ordered more systematically to help with learning, even just including slides that explain when we're transitioning from one topic to another in the lecture",
                "strength: none\r\nweakness: only memorization for the assessments, no prep for assignments",
                "Very interesting assignments, great TA sessions, and informative lectures. Greatly balanced and interesting for all who want a great intro to architecture.",
                "I think the content was very interesting, but it could have been organized much better. Lectures felt all over the place and it was difficult to know what to write down. This made the final exam feel more difficult because many buildings that we discussed in lecture did not stick. The professor was a strength as you could tell he was very passionate about the content and was also very supportive of students in the class.",
                "STRENGTHS: I loved the ways that this class made students engage with the world around them; the assignments were interesting, and I appreciated that they gave you a lot of freedom to research your interests. Elihu was clearly interested in the material.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: This class is known as a gut, and it felt like the majority of people were in the class because it was a \"gut\" rather than being interested. My section specifically lacked participation. Also, Elihu's lectures were sometimes hard to follow. It was sometimes difficult to know whether he was geeking out about something or whether it was actually significant. Additionally, I felt that the class focused more on the East Coast for Architecture and Urbanism than the American West, specifically after the turn of the twentieth century; I would have loved to do more analyzing sprawling cities of the American West such as Denver, Phoenix, or Los Angelos, but I felt that Detroit, Philadelphia, DC, New York, and Boston got much more attention than their western counterparts because the East Coast is older.",
                "The projects, with their open-ended nature allows you to focus on whatever excites and intrigues you most. The readings however, were hit and (more often) miss, at least for me personally. I believe too much readings (or at least too many pages for the readings) were assigned on the usual week, often leading me to not reading any at all. To be clear, there are many fantastic readings, but by the second half of the course I often found it not worthwhile to take the risk.",
                "This course is mostly about urban planning, so take it if you are interested in that. However, there was very little content about architecture. For example, something like \"Greek revival style\" would be mentioned, but there was almost no explanation of what this means in terms of the building's actual design. I don't think I learned much about why buildings look the way they do. The final is a lot of memorization of things we only spent a minute or two learning about in class, so even though it's easy to do well if you spend time memorizing, I'll instantly forget all of it after taking the test. I wish we had learned about fewer things and learned more about each one. Memorizing the architects of 150 buildings is not a great use of time, especially when some of these architects were never mentioned in lectures or readings.",
                "The strengths are that the material is very interesting, and there's room to study what you as a student are interested within the field. I also enjoyed that the assignments pushed us to explore sources (like the New Haven Library) that we wouldn't normally think to use. The greatest weakness in my opinion was that the course was too broad. I understand that this is intended to be a survey course, but we didn't explicitly learn any architecture or urban studies specific vocabulary besides what we picked up through interacting with the readings. I wish we had deep dove into a smaller number of buildings and cities and really learned about their features and development instead of going over hundreds of buildings and cities to be able to provide surface level analyses. I also think that there only being one exam was difficult. Though the final exam wasn't particularly challenging in content, it was agonizingly long and I would have much preferred taking two 50 minute exams that required more precise understandings of a handful of buildings instead of taking a broad test that could cover 150 IDs. Also there was simply too much reading, speaking to the overly ambitious breadth of the course.",
                "Strength: lectures were very animated, engaging, and relevent.",
                "Strengths: I liked the discussion section of the class as my TF made the readings worth reading and engaging with. This class only had one exam at the end of the semester, as our midterms consisted of two pretty intense (but very fun and interesting) projects. \r\n\r\nWeakness: There are a lot of long readings that we were expected to do, I remember having to read 40 pages of three different chapters for one lecture, however, there wasnt any way of ensuring that we did the readings which was good in some way. The class was also not always following the syllabus which made it difficult to know where we were in the material.",
                "Lectures could be slightly more organized along the readings.",
                "Strength: I found the lectures pretty interesting. Professor Rubin clearly knows his stuff and is engaging, fun to listen to. Another strength of this class is that you'll get as much out of this course as you put in, meaning if you sometimes need to shift your attention from this class to deal with other stuff, its structured in a way that you won't fully fall behind as a result. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish we would've had more heads up on the final, I felt a bit caught off guard by it, but in the end, it was fine. Also, sometimes it was hard to keep up with the readings.",
                "The strength of the class was the time and grace they gave on assignments. There were no weaknesses.",
                "This course was a great crash course into Architecture, Urbanism, and US history. It would be helpful to have lectures recorded, or recorded and released ahead of the final.",
                "Strength: enlightening conversations of architecture and urban culture is sections accompanied by eye-opening lectures on the evolving style of American urban landscape. The density of architectural analysis really gives you a variety of scope to see buildings in different realms. Everything over the American urban history would start to gain momentum in the second-half on the course, as more and more recurring motifs would reappear in new styles.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the lecture sometimes brushes past significant styles a bit quickly, but the structure of the course and the immensity of the bulk it takes upon make it necessary for a quickfire and fast-paced presentation.",
                "The strengths of the course were Professor Rubin's interesting and insightful lectures. The course could be improved by formatting the final exam differently so it did not rely so much on brute memorization.",
                "I would've liked some more explicit instruction on the architectural terms and what defines the different styles. Basically, a little more on the architecture and less on the urbanism, although I did enjoy learning about urban policy a lot as well.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed doing primary source research and looking at Sanborn Maps for the building assignment",
                "I found the first assignment very enjoyable because it asked students to directly engage with the built environment of New Haven. By visiting the site of the building I chose over the course of a few weeks I got a chance to explore an unfamiliar part of the city. A major weakness of the course is the lack of depth. It was quite challenging to engage with the course material because the class would only overview surface level information about certain architectural styles. At times I felt that I could have gained a similar understanding reading in my own time. I also found the assigned reading very dull. A majority of the readings only restated what was said in lecture instead of expanding on the week's topic."

                "absolutely. fantastic introduction to urban studies and architecture. can completely transform your perception of the city, its history, and how it influences our behavior and interactions. I think anybody who cares about cities in the slightest should take this class.",
                "yes, especially if you have the slightest interest in urbanism",
                "I would if they are interested in architecture\/urbanism of any form!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student who wants to learn about this material.",
                "Yes - great intro to architecture",
                "Yes, this is a great course to gain more appreciation for the built environment.",
                "If you have any interest in architecture or history in general, this course is simply amazing. The lectures evoke a narrative of America that gets you excited and intrigued about learning the intricacies of urban landscapes.",
                "Yes- it provides a new lens to look at American history through. The projects were also incredibly fun and pushed us to really delve into what aspects of that history most interested us",
                "Yes! Elihu is a great lecturer and the course material is super interesting.",
                "Take it! It's really interesting and will change how you view the world.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if they have an interest in architecture.",
                "I would, but I would frankly call it somewhat of a gut.",
                "I would highly highly recommend this course to my fellow yale students. Not only does this course cover a fascinating array of history, it also immerses students in the world of architecture in such a way that feels engaging, thoughtful, and rewarding. I particularly  benefitted from the course's geographical diversity as I enjoyed learning about the United States' various regions and how they create a quilt of different architectural realities and relationships to the built environment. I also think the course's use of archival materials and the New Haven city itself really underlined how crucial the study of the urban space continues to be, only making the lessons learned in the course even more empowering and fruitful.",
                "yes if you are into architecture and american history! or if you are international and want to understand america better, especially why suburbs exist and why americans are obsessed with cars.",
                "If you're interested in architecture and American history, certainly. If not, it's probably a waste of your time.",
                "Yes, its one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale",
                "Definitely!! For urban\/architecture majors, this class is a great introduction to both those topics in an American context.  For other interested people, this class will make you think about cities and buildings in a way you never have before! So worth it.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. It has changed the way I experience urban and institutional buildings and spaces in a really empowering way. Even if that doesn't happen for you, Professor Rubin's lectures are really fun and interesting. A great credit-D option for STEM people as well.",
                "100 times yes! If you are interested at all in urban studies, architecture, history, or the built environment, it's a very good class. If you want a class where you can get an A by just putting in effort and work, take it. It's a fantastic class that everyone should take.",
                "No, lectures were disorganized and boring, discussion sections felt like a waste of time, I didn't learn anything",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, absolutely! Especially if you are interested in architecture or urban studies. I'm a STEM major and I took this just for fun, and I was not disappointed. The material was very accessible to me despite not having a background in the subject matter, and it was a thoroughly engaging class.",
                "Definitely! Prof Rubin is an engaging speaker and the breadth of topics really allows you to learn American history through another lens.",
                "No - it's uninteresting and poorly organized, and also the exam is a lot of memorization.  Choose another gut",
                "I would still recommend this course to any student interested in a broad survey of architecture, urban design, and any other related topics of this sort. I think the course was still a valuable opportunity for me to do some research on a specific building in New Haven, analyze urban patterns across the United States, and even draw threads of understanding to my own experiences and life. I think I can now appreciate the built environment more than before and understand the complexities associated with architecture and urban design.",
                "Yeah! It's nice actually knowing something about architecture now, and I appreciate cities more.",
                "no - unless you're fine with spending days just memorizing buildings for a final that you will forget within a few days\r\nwaste of time",
                "The first lecture was one of the best I have ever had in any class. Unfortunately, the remaining lectures failed to live up to that first one. I still think I'm interested in the material but somehow was never engaged by the lectures, even though Elihu is, as everybody says, a national treasure. I heard people talk about this class and they weren't super enthusiastic about it, and that's kinda how I feel about the class at this point. Also, the final does have about 150 buildings you need to memorize their name, date, location, and architects (you could also skip about half the IDs on the final though).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially those looking for an intro to art (as themes are repetitive with other courses), regardless if they are majors or not.",
                "I don't think I would recommend this class to another student due to the lack of organization in lectures. This made lecture attendance very low and therefore more difficult to engage with. I would recommend the course to someone if it was organized in a way in which I could feel like I was learning and remembering content. The class contained important topics, but the delivery was not quite there.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who has intrinsic motivation to learn about American Architecture and Urbanism. If they don't have a personal desire to learn, it would be easy to fall behind or complete assignments for completion rather than to learn.",
                "I think I would if they were interested in, well, American Architecture and urbanism. Particularly good as a fifth gutty course",
                "This course is easy, but studying for the final was a bit more stressful than the average gut. The content was not as interesting as I had hoped. A lot of students love this course, but it wasn't for me.",
                "It was interesting enough, but there was too much reading and I believe there are more interesting architecture classes at Yale. If you split the course into two courses, American Architecture AND American Urbanism, I would recommend both of them because the prof was excellent and very passionate!",
                "I would absolutely, its incredibly interesting.",
                "Yes, great context for American architectural forms and urban trends.",
                "I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in the history and different names of architecture buildings in America. I dont take this class if you want to learn about the architecture types or how to draw them. Nevertheless, Im glad I took it nonetheless.",
                "Absolutely! Great comprehensive overview of American urban history.",
                "Yes! 100%! Take it.",
                "I would, interesting content, cool professor, not too intense if you don't want it to be.",
                "Yes, this class was very interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course, I found it very informative and relevant to other areas of study as well",
                "This course would satisfy anybody who have a hunger in learning about the evolution of America. It's historical narrative really builds a momentum and keeps you intrigued even if you have no prior experience in art history or architecture.",
                "Yes, I would! Overall, the course was very interesting.",
                "Yes! If you're interested at all in architecture or urbanism, then this is a fun, easy survey of the topics. The project requiring you to research a building is cool and teaches you what primary sources are available for this kind of research.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you want a very general overview of American Architecture."
