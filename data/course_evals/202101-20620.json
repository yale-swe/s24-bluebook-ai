                "Strengths were the organization, dedication of the professor and TA, and collaborative work with other students. No weaknesses.",
                "There were a lot of strengths to this course. The virtual lectures were productive and very engaging. Throughout the semester there was a good mix of quizzes, virtual labs, and in-class assignments, and the teaching staff was always available to assist with assignments. The in-person labs were genuinely interesting and fun. We received a lot of help and feedback with the final lab report. Because the course was half-term, it was a lot of concentrated work and occasionally felt a bit rushed. However, the teaching staff did their best to fill in any gaps in understanding and the schedule. I would have liked the opportunity to spend more time in the lab in-person, but the time we did get was productive and considering COVID restrictions it was nice to get any in-person instruction at all.",
                "The TA and the professor were both very kind, open, and accommodating. They definitely did their best to put a lab (!) online and although classes were often very long, it was a lot of time spent on Zoom for both students and professors so I appreciate all the effort they put in. \r\nThe weakness was that as I write this evaluation, a week after the class has ended, I am only just now receiving grades for quizzes which were taken over a month ago. It's difficult to get an idea of how you are doing in a class/if you need to improve some aspect if you don't receive the vast majority of your grades until the very end of the course, or even after it is over."

                "I think the lectures were well adapted to the virtual setting. I think the least successful virtual component was the Labster online labs, which I felt weren't particularly helpful to complete and ended up just being busywork. Because of the hybrid format we had a lot less time actually in the lab, and some experiments felt a bit rushed, but the time we spent in lab was helpful, useful, and fun.",
                "I honestly liked the Labster virtual labs; they were sort of silly but I definitely got a good sense of the technique. Sometimes lectures got behind and went over time; also, in the beginning of the course we watched a lot of documentaries on Zoom, and while they were interesting, I don't feel like they were related enough to the course for me to want to spend an extra hour on Zoom. Because of the duration of this class, the Zoom fatigue definitely got pretty severe, although I really appreciate the yoga and meditation breaks which were built in."

I personally enjoyed the boot-camp mentality of the half-term course, and I learned so much in such a short amount of time. Also, the teaching staff genuinely cares about helping you learn the content, develop your laboratory skills, and become a better scientist.",
                "Overall, this is a great survey of some foundation molecular biology techniques. If you work in a lab, you have probably used them before, and may want to use the waiver to get out of this course. However, I still enjoyed it and felt like I got a lot out of some of the psets and final paper, so it was definitely not a waste of time. Also, the teaching staff are great to get to know, and I imagine if it was in person it would be a fun class to be in."
