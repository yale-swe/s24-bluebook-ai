                "I was able to develop great reading skills, especially skills involved in reading and analyzing legal papers. In addition, my writing has improved tremendously through Professor Garfinkel's attentive edits and overall structural comments.",
                "i loved everything about this course, professor garfinkel made this so interesting and so engaging and truly made it seem like he wanted us to learn instead of worry about the grades",
                "This course provided a general understanding of contemporary issues relating to the role government plays in the lives of children and the family. The design of the course was such that many topics were covered, so I now feel equipped to further research certain topics in the future.",
                "You get what you want to get out of this course.  If you do the readings, participate in discussions, and listen to Judge Garfinkel, you will learn quite a bit.  I found the course material fascinating (from ever-changing abortion precedent to the protection of free speech in schools), so I feel like I got quite a bit out of it.  You will learn how to read casesand how to use Oyez when you don't have time to read casesand learn how to formulate both paper and oral arguments.  It's 100% worth taking if you're pre-law or even just interested in how the American legal system works!",
                "Learned so much about how US law treats children. The material covered a crazy range of interesting topics from education, to abortion, to emerging technologies, to the criminal justice system without feeling watered down. Got a great intro to legal analysis, constitutional law, legal writing, and oral argument. Also heard from a lot of amazing guest speakers that spoke on relevant contemporary issues that affect children and families.",
                "I developed a good understanding of the law. It tapped into many facets of modern day life like abortion rights, surrogacy, marriage rights, and childrens rights at school. The class was so interesting, and the professor really cares about the well being of students. I also learned oral argument and research skills.",
                "I learned so much more than I could have ever asked for. I learned about everything relating to children and their place within the frameworks of our nation's and states' Constitutional and statutory law. I was particularly interested in First Amendment and Fourth Amendment rights of children, which is a particular hot topic of debate, and our class was able to analyze and discuss a variety of cases relating to these rights. I also got to learn so much about the character that a person in law needs to have. Professor Garfinkel was an amazing role model and someone that I will look up to for the rest of my life.",
                "Speaking skills, analyzing skills, intellectual curiosity, open mindedness.",
                "read a casebook, discuss/argue both sides to a case, understand judicial system and appellate court system\r\nlearned more about various cases relating to children and the 1st amendment, the 14th amendment, the 4th amendment, and more",
                "I learned a lot about the US legal system, particularly with a focus on legal issues surrounding children, and any problems that arise. I learned how to read and discuss court cases, and how to reiterate court cases through an oral argument, set up like a moot court. I gained a lot of knowledge from the material and found it extremely engaging.",
                "As the name of the course implies, I learned about the law affects children and families. We read a variety of cases, covering topics such as eugenics and first amendment rights in schools.",
                "I learned how to read court documents and I better understood how we make big decisions. I realized just how difficult these things can be. I also gained perspective on the problems that face people in America, and was able to confront ideas that we too often ignore."

            "comments": [
                "I think a strength was being able to engage with many different units of the course, and reading legal papers that require a specific type of diction. \r\n\r\nA weakness, however, would be that I wished discusions were more student-led. Instead, many classes were more lecture-based, which I think made the course seem a bit dull at time.",
                "it could not be improved at all!!! it was perfect and i would take this course 10000 times if i could",
                "There was a lot of flexibility when writing the papers, and it allowed for students to explore further what they found interesting. The guest speakers were amazingit was really special to have people of all walks of life come in and talk to us. There were several times, though, when I had prepped for certain topics having followed the syllabus, and the class was focused on something entirely different. So I think thats one area for improvement.",
                "Strengths: Fascinating material, light workload (only three papers and Judge Garfinkel is very understanding with deadlines), great teacher (Judge Garfinkel is a homie), and the oral argument only really counts for participation points. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not totally a seminar, but it's not really your honor's fault.  I don't think our class did most of the readings.",
                "Strengths: Judge Garfinkel is awesome and so knowledgeable about all the topics, the readings are very well selected and extremely interesting, the class isnt stressful, and the essays are really fun and worthwhile to write. Oral argument at the end was also cool. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really; sometimes the reading load was a lot, but it wasnt crazy by any means and didnt feel dull.",
                "Strengths are the content and readings. Super interesting and topical. I think it could be improved by offering more podcast and video options for content, especially for current issues. Another strength was the speakers who were all fantastic!!!!",
                "The course only had strengths. Since it was a seminar, we were able to learn material through discussions and hearing other people's insights, which was really helpful. Professor Garfinkel was extremely understanding and flexible and wanted to make an already chaotic first semester as easy for us as he could. The course did have a lot of readings and there wasn't any accountability in terms of finishing them or doing them. However, I believe most students taking that class had a genuine interest in the law and were putting in every effort possible.",
                "My favorite part of the class was the speakers that came in and the final oral arguments -- the only tangible thing that could make the class experience better is having a second round of oral arguments.",
                "strengths: super kind instructor, veryy interesting material, lovely discussions with classmates\r\nweaknesses: hard to know what instructor expects for papers as no prompt or rubric is given (that can also be a strength for some people)",
                "I absolutely love Professor Garfinkel. He is the best teacher, super caring, kind, and has an amazing scope of knowledge. I really liked how the class was discussion based, rather than a lecture, which kept the material engaging while also facilitating conversation. The only weakness would be that the class was taught at 4 pm, and it is often hard to focus so late in the day, but due to Professor Garfinkel's schedule, I believe this was the only feasible time. We also did not talk about everything we were assigned to read, but the material was generally interesting so I would not consider that a real weakness as well.",
                "Some of the strengths of this class is that Judge Garfinkel invites many guest speakers, prioritizes the readings for you so that you can know what to focus on, and provides a variety of readings (cases, blog posts, etc.). The essays are also assigned in a way that can work best with your schedule, which can be relieving.",
                "The structure of the course is strong and was run well. It was sometimes difficult to participate, because of how heavy the topics were and how big the ideas were, and also how much thought had already been put into the decisions that we reviewed."

                "Absolutely!  Judge Garfinkel is the kindest professor I had in my first semester.  He was so understanding and very knowledgable about the material.  The guest speakers were also great and had many interesting perspectives.",
                "Amazing first-year seminar and would absolutely recommend! Especially if youre interested in anything related to the law. But even if not: the issues discussed are really challenging and interesting (and also broad, so theres something for everyone in the syllabus). Was really fun, and I looked forward to class every week.",
                "Yes! You should definitely take this is you are at all interested in medical ethics, law, womens rights, or the rights of children. It is so engaging, and I think the workload is pretty manageable, especially since the readings are interesting and somewhat optional.",
                "Yes! I recommend this class to every student who is interested in the intricacies of the law. I feel like a much more informed person as a result of taking this class, and I would recommend this class especially with Professor Garfinkel to everyone.",
                "Yes, I think that this course was extremely well structured and it opened a gateway for me to develop a love for law and was a fantastic introduction to it.",
                "yes! this was a lovely first-year seminar choice as the class did not move too fast/become overwhelming and the material was incredibly interesting",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It was my favorite class of the semester and Professor Garfinkel is amazing! I really love seminar based classes and I was always engaged and interested in the material. The topics we cover in class are also endlessly interesting and I've continued some of the conversations I had in class with friends outside of the classroom, which points to how engaging the material and subject is.",
                "I would recommend any class taught by Judge Garfinkel because I think that everyone should have the privilege of meeting him. If you are interested in the law, this class will be great for you. If you arent interested in the law, you might find the class boring.",
                "Yes. It was a great course and covered such important topics that should not be ignored."
