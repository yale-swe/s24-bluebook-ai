                "This class is very fun and engaging. I genuinely think that almost anyone would find the readings interesting and class discussions were always fun with Professor Sexton. The only complaint I had about this course was that on some random Thursday there was a whole book assigned and we weren't warned before Tuesdays class that we were going to be reading the whole book. And like of course, no one actually finished this book. I mean the part of it I read was super interesting and I definitely will finish this summer on my own time but I really would have liked if we had spent longer talking about it or only had to read part of it.",

                "Strengths:\r\n- My favorite part of this course was the evocation exercises (we would listen to a song at the start of the class every Tuesday and have to immediately respond to it in a paragraph or two to evoke it -- very interesting way of learning how to write quickly and concisely\r\n- If you love music, none of the homework will feel like homework\r\n- The course is really flexible in writing about things that interest you\r\n- Prof Sexton leaves so much feedback on your essays - super nice!!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Almost wanted to do more essay to have a bit more practice\r\n- There is rather randomly a whole book assigned in the middle of the course that is very interesting but no one had time to fully read\r\n- Sometimes the workshops would be a bit too flattery focused than constructive",
