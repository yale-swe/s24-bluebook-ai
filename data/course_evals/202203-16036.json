                "Learned more about Queer Latinx Trans communities and the different figureheads/readings in the field. Extraordinarily interesting readings, including novels, first-hand accounts, diaries, visiting the Yale archives, and more. A highlight was getting to talk to another academic via zoom during class. Another highlight was the creative component for the final essay--what a wonderful idea!",
                "This class was amazing! We learned so much about the methodology and major theories of Latinx trans and queer studies. As an ERM major, Prof Vargas really gave me the direction to think about theory differently, more sustainably and deeply than other courses, which will help me for the rest of my years and life. This was the best class I've taken at Yale.",
                "I developed a lot of cultural studies forms of analysis to study Latinx Queer and Trans communities. This class also bridged WGSS and ER&M very nicely!",
                "I learned about existing concepts and discourses on the intersection of queerness and latinidad through scholarly articles, books, documentaries, and other forms of resources. I learned about the importance of identity construction and expression, and gained more visibility for different queer spheres in latin america."

                "Strengths: Interesting readings, solid seminar format, cool speakers\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "WONDERFUL COURSE TAUGHT BY A WONDERFUL INDIVIDUAL. Please take this course, no matter what major you come from. Professor Vargas does an EXCELLENT job at making a very welcoming environment, especially as someone that doesn't come from a WGSS background. Each class is expertly planned with a presentation, discussion, and break, and the professor really does care about the overall group and individual students. The material is absolutely fascinating and nothing like I've ever studied before in an academic setting.",
                "Strengths: readings were manageable, insightful, useful; professor was amazing and really cared for each student; project was challenging but gave you much autonomy to choose what kind of project you wanted to do",
                "The class was very collaborative! Professor Vargas was extremely supportive and loved hearing our ideas and analysis. The class was also organized very well and the readings were very interesting.",
                "One strength of this course is the blended format of the first part of class being a lecture and the second part being our discussion. I think this allowed for us to understand the important concepts and gain vocabulary that we could then use in our discussion. I also felt that this helped me actually learn things in the course where in a lot of discussion based seminars we just talk and don't actually come to conclusions or establish a consensus. I also liked how this class was small with only 8 people, so we got to really bring our different perspectives to class and contribute to discussions. Going to this class didn't feel like going to class, it almost felt like seeing familiar faces and talking about something that was personal and interesting to all of us."

            "comments": [
                "Absolutely, especially if you have any connection to the course material. Queer Latine studies is definitely one of those fields where you have a vested interest in one or both of these identities, and this meant the demographic of the class leaned very heavily towards queer Latines. Not to say that you can't take the class if this doesn't describe you, but I found the environment was just fantastic for learning, and I got so so much out of the class.",
                "Yes I would! Deb is fantastic and fills a gap in queer Latine scholars in the WGSS department, which I feel is most of the time not catered to Latine or non white students. The WGSS department tends to attract wealthier, white students in the courses so it was really cool to feel like this class was different. Deb is super accessible as a prof but I still felt that the material was intellectually challenging without being stressful.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Take this course! Learn more about yourself and your communities!",
                "Yes, I highly recommend this course or any future course with Professor Vargas! Prof Vargas is kind, knowledgable, and a powerful educator. I learned so much about the intersectional experiences of Latinx trans folx and am grateful for this opportunity, which is hard to find at other classes at Yale.",
                "Absolutely! If youre at all interested in cultural studies, Latinx queer and trans communities, take this course. Professor Vargas is very helpful and is great to talk to during their office hours.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course is not for my major and was something I took just for fun, and I don't regret it at all. As long as someone is interested in the subject matter I think this course would be very rewarding to take. I'm glad I took a chance on a new course this year and hope that this course gains traction and continues in subsequent semesters."
