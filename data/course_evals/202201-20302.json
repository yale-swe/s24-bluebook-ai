The readings were incredibly interesting, and the weekly discussion posts & seminars were helpful spaces to formulate thoughts on them & process them together. I also had space to think more about the role of the public intellectual, the purpose of my education at Yale at large, and the ways I engage with the issues we encounter in class.",
                "how to write engaging public pieces about timely and important topics! we got to hear from different guest speakers and read very interesting op-eds and public-facing pieces about different topics, from climate change to immigration to metaphorically walking in the shoes of different marginalized groups. the readings were always fascinating and not difficult to understand. i feel like i gained so much knowledge not just from the readings but also from weekly discussions in class."

                "Strengths: It was super engaging! Course readings were a blast (and short too!), and from a wide array of different sources, so it was really easy and engaging to just have a conversation about those pieces. We had weekly discussion posts that Professor would also read and pull into our conversations, so it felt that all of the material that we were covering was getting used.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't have anything to say here!",
                "I honestly loved this course and don't think it has any weaknesses that stand out -- I think that a big strength was that it met once a week",
                "Strengths: the readings were all very interesting, without being too intense! Prof. Jelly-Schapiro brought in engaging, insightful speakers, and the class was a friendly, welcoming space. Weaknesses: the course is deeply, deeply US-centric  while this isn't a bad thing in itself, I wish I had known about this before I chose the course",
                "strengths: interesting pieces, relatively low workload, very high reward\r\nweaknesses: it was at 9:25 in the morning which made getting up hard, but i would say overall it was worth it."

                "Yes! I think this iteration of the course was very valuable in teaching me to write in a specific way and the prof clearly had expertise in what audiences to target/how to write in a way that would have impact in the world",
                "Yes! But this is also highly contingent on if Professor Jelly-Schapiro is still teaching it, as he's a visiting professor from NYU that filled in for a different professor this semester. While I can't say anything about the previous courses with the different professor, they did receive not-so-good ratings from previous students, which is a little bit telling.",
                "Yes",
                "If the readings excite you, sure! I don't think I gained anything too special from the course, skills-wise, but it was a fun space to think about some interesting pieces once-a-week.",
                "YES absolutely!! it really makes you think and engage with the world. i felt like i gained so many new perspectives. and the workload was not bad at all."
