I learned a variety of mathematical theorems, the concepts of derivatives/ integrals/ fundamental theorem of calculus/ etc, and used those skills in a few real-world applications such as optimization and related rates questions. This integration of concepts and application greatly expanded my mathematical thinking in a manner that I had never had in previous courses.",

I think there could be slightly more effort in order to motivate students to be in class as this was not required, and although this is very helpful during busy days I definitely saw better results in times when I was going to class more frequently than when I wasn't.",
                "Strength: it introduces you to calculus concepts \r\nWeakness: for a person that has never take calculus before it can be difficult to keep up with the class, it's doable but requires a lot of commitment to learning",
                "The course covers a breadth of calculus-related topics, ensuring that I left this course with knowledge of an entirely new field of mathematics. The course also made efforts to level the mathematics playing field with review lessons for students who had only taken math up to pre-calculus (such as myself) while also offering abundant peer tutoring and office hour opportunities in times of midterms and exams. They were very considerate of our needs in practicing what we learned. The only issue is that the reliance of the course on problem sets makes absorbing certain ideas difficult, often I would confuse some topics of ideas because they were learned in a somewhat superficial way in class to cover more things.",
                "Professor Geiger was amazing! They were very kind and attentive with in-class teaching. Overall, no other standout strengths/any weaknesses.",
                "I think the course was a great way to get introduced to calculus and give students a steady pace on what calculus has to offer. The professor was great, and it helped me understand this math on a deeper level. If there is anything that could be improved, I would love to have more review sessions during midterms and finals, as I was not able to come for the full time with the times given.",
                "I liked the smaller classes. It felt more engaged with the instrutcor.",
                "Strengths: derivative computer was helpful in ensuring that students knew how to properly compute derivatives - a crucial component for the latter curriculum.\r\nWeaknesses: homework problems didn't align with the difficulty of the practice problems we did in class.",
                "The course did a great job teaching us concepts using examples and went beyond simple definitions to explore the mathematical basis of different theories. Each lecture was engaging and did not rush any learning point. The problem sets were very helpful and organized questions based on concept, and I really appreciated how frequent peer-tutoring sessions were."

Even if a student simply wants to take a math course to keep their mathematical thinking sharp, this course provides a challenge through the problem-set questions and exams which, in my mind, makes the class worth taking.",
                "Yes I do. It is challenging if one does not have experience with calculus is is definitely manageable and there are lots of resources for assistance.",
