                "Its perfect!",
                "Overall, the course felt like it was presented in a much more confusing and complex way than what we would actually do each week. After each lab we are expected to write up a lab report. However, most of the labs are just making observations or taking pictures of organisms, so it makes it difficult to \"make\" anything out of these lab reports. It seems like we are just typing words to fill space. On the other hand, I think incorporating more labs similar to labs 11/12 where we collected data and had to form our own inferences would be helpful.",
                "Great labs! the nature walk was amazing! going into the stream was also very fun!",
                "amazing course",
                "This is one of the best courses Ive ever taken at Yale. I had so much fun with labs every week, and Marta and my TFs were excellent. The course provides a large variety of lab tasks, with high levels of preparation for the labs and for the weekly quizzes. I appreciated the provided study guides for the quizzes, and the intros provided in lab handouts. Sometimes lab lectures felt a bit rushed, but still provided a lot of interesting and important information.",
                "The strengths were that the course was reliably well organized, but there were times where it just felt a bit inefficient, but that is normal for a lab setting. Also Dr. Wells is absolutely amazing and the TAs are incredibly supportive and responsive.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Wells is super passionate and friendly, labs are really engaging and focuses on big concepts instead of minute details, very collaborative, lab reports are reasonable length, quizzes are generally pretty reasonable \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "Strengths: Prof Wells is amazing; one of my favorite classes at Yale",
                "Having a lab report AND quiz felt high for a half credit course, but I felt that the combination of quizzes and lab reports held us accountable and made sure we were truly learning.",
                "There are many strengths, which include the structure of the modules themselves. Each module touches on a very specific part of the tree of life and covers a variety of engaging, hands-on activities from stream ecology to observing invertebrates under the microscope. The weakness is that sometimes the rubric for lab reports is not very clear and students are docked points unfairly (I.e. whether or not citations are important to include).",
                "Weaknesses: I dont think the quizzes are necessary and they are just stressful and have really specific details. Maybe just a reading response style question would be more effective",
                "The course is very engaging (mainly because of Professor Wells' humorous comments and enthusiasm) and covers big idea topics like biodiversity. It is a relatively low workload; however, if you work fast, there are days when you will have to wait around for other groups to finish before leaving lab, which was aggravating at times. Overall, good bio lab course, especially for pre-meds!"

The work was also very reasonable, and I felt like most students also became passionate about the work because of the wonderful teaching staff.",
