It helped me understand de re vs de dicto distinctions, which has been extremely useful for the rest of my philosophical investigations.",
                "Modal logic systems and proofs in these systems, diagrammatic method to test for validity, countermodels, plus a deep understanding of some of the issues and debates surrounding modal logic in the literature through my paper / readings",
                "I learned first-order logic, propositional modal logic, quantified modal logic, and how to read logic-related papers.",
                "I learnt that I need to go to office hours a lot more.",
                "This course provides some really great information about a part of logic. It is really a great course to take after taking any of Professor Shin's. This course is especially amazing to take after math logic and philosophy of math because it has both technical and philosophical aspects which build upon those other courses."

                "Strengths are the lectures themselves and the readings. There could have been more readings instead of problem sets.",
                "The course itself was incredibly interesting (Professor Shin is a great lecturer and is really very funny), and the work-load is perfect. The problem sets are just enough to engage you, but not too hard so that you have to devote your whole life to it. The essay is a bit of work, but Professor Shin is good at making sure you are on top of things.\r\nOne weakness is probably the backload of the work -- there was an essay and a pset that ran into each other at the end of the semester. It would probably be a minor improvement if the problem sets were spaced out a tad more evenly so that the class could expect when they would have one, in general.",
                "Professor Shin is an amazing professor who really cares about her students. Take any course you can with her because you will learn a lot without ever being super stressed. This course in particular I enjoyed because it had a nice mix of psets, readings, and a paper, so the work never got monotonous and I feel like there was a lot of opportunity to take the logic we learned and apply it to actual philosophical situations, which I found to help with overall understanding a lot.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Shin is wonderful, accommodating and helpful. Workload is for the most part light but interesting, a great combo. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes got a little lost during lecture / felt a bit of jump between what I understood and what I needed to for homeworks, but office hours resolved this",
                "Professor Shin and the organization of the course was definitely a strength. Professor Shin is one of the kindest instructors I have ever had and it is always a joy to attend her office hours. She is incredibly knowledgeable and cares so much about her students. I felt that she prioritized teaching much more than most professors at Yale and it truly makes a difference to the students. The handouts were also all very written and incredibly helpful for the problem sets. By having the notes in front of us during lecture, we can focus on understanding the content rather than scramble to take notes. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "More office hours option. Please consider adding a TA-- it is not always easy to speak to a Professor especially about problem sets."

                "Yes! For the STEM kids, especially ones with a Math/CS background - this is the perfect Humanities and Arts credit! Most of the class is technical and so are all the homeworks, though the humanities is beautifully intertwined within all the lectures. In the last couple of days of class and 10 page final paper is only when the philosophy/humanities kicks in. For non-STEM kids, I assume this is a good, fun QR credit.",
                "Yes if you have a background in first order logic and are interested",
                "Definitely, if you are interested in logic. Prof. Shin is a great lecturer, the work-load is perfect, and the course is engaging. It does go pretty quickly at the beginning, so I'd recommend that this isn't your first logic class (should have FOL under your belt).",
                "Yes! This is a great course and could be taken by someone interested in logic and computer science etc or someone who is more into philosophy. The issues are approached from different angles which is really nice. I would say it's a must take for anyone who wants to do philosophy because the understanding of modality and the formal systems taught in this course are extremely important. I didn't realize how much modal discussions are actually present in the larger philosophical discourse, but having taken this class, I saw it more and more and having the skill set from this course definitely improved my engagement with those other issues.",
                "Yes! take any class with Prof Shin if you can.",
                "If you like logic at all, yes, its an interesting and not very stressful class to learn some more logic. I was afraid at first because Im a philosophy major and dont consider myself super quantitative, but its really logic and not math related. Basically, do it if you like logic.",
                "I would most certainly recommend this course to a friend, in fact I have recommended it to many. Dr. Shin is an engaging lecturer and is incredibly knowledgeable. The class was incredibly interesting, and was made better even beyond the content by Dr. Shin's style.",
                "I absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in logic. I can see how some people may not be interested in the topics we cover since they are quite specific and a little difficult to comprehend, but I personally loved every single second of the course. I learned so much about something I never thought about before and it really clicked with me. The course was intellectually challenging, but very rewarding overall.",
                "Only if they have already taken mathematical logic and computability and logic.",
                "Absolutely! Take any of Professor Shin's courses! She's really great and provides excellent explanations of both the technical details and the philosophical/historical motivations surrounding them."
