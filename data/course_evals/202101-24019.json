                "The only thing I didn't love about this class is that the readings every week were very long, usually 150-200 pages. Professor Ford ran a very, very good seminar discussion and I learned a lot from class, from him, and from the readings I did. One other thing I didn't love was the assignments for the course. I don't really understand why we did lengthy foreign policy analysis... I think it would have made more sense to write policy analysis memos styled off of how they write memos at the State Department.",
                "Ambassador Ford is very knowledgeable and uses his past experience to make the course more interesting.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the course felt as though we were just talking about the book or talking about history, rather than some of the more critical analyses of why something was a good or bad policy.",
                "Strengths were definitely Ambassador Ford and his teaching style. He's really insightful and encouraging too.",
                "This is an amazing class, and I have few recommendations for how it could be improved. Ambassador Ford is a great instructor who always moves the discussion in interesting directions.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Ford is wonderful. Genuinely cares about the students and has a lot of experience and insights of his own.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion was more focused on major events / turning points in isolation. Sometimes lost track of the overall arc of US foreign policy history.",
                "The readings were incredible and seminar discussions were also really good.",
                "Ambassador Ford and the reading list are strengths.  He is incredibly knowledgable, sharp, and engaged in teaching the course.  Most of the books we read were great.  No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths were the level of discussion and the expertise the professor brought as well as the readings assigned.",
                "Professor Ford is a major strength of this class. He is excited about the topic, constantly engaged with students, and whip smart. Moreover, his selected readings are all fascinating and provide major insights into the turning points we focus on. Students were also super engaged with the material, so I looked forward to every class because of the energy that I knew would inevitably be there."

                "Absolutely. This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. If you get the chance to take it, definitely do. Be ready to put in the work, but it's well worth it. You'll learn a lot from Ambassador Ford and the other students in the seminar. Also, he's really invested in his students. During the pandemic, he even arranged to meet students in-person (safely and following the rules of course) and speak with us in-person and hear about our interests, background, career paths, etc. Definitely take it if you can get in.",

                "Definitely, especially if you have any interest in U.S. foreign policy or want to learn about the continuity and trends in it.",

I looked forward to the class every week because students clearly wanted to be there and the books we read were so interesting. Be prepared though, the reading pace is about a book a week and you NEED to do it in order to be successful in the class."
