                "I think the course is very good. Anurag is an amazing professor and is very clear in instruction. He is able to break down concepts nicely and his slides are very clear. There are a lot of strengths.\r\nAfter the exams, I feel that one weakness is that sometimes, lectures do not capture more tricky details of the concepts introduced, at least I didn't grasp them fully by watching the lecture at one go. I think maybe Anurag can provide more examples showing some edge cases regarding understanding the concepts.\r\nThis is a minor weakness and the class is excellent.",
                "Strengths: Anurag is a fantastic lecturer who cares a lot about his students and the class. You will learn a lot by paying attention in lecture and asking questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the homework assignments were a little tedious and underspecified, and some rough edges on the projects which will hopefully be ironed out in future iterations of the course.",
                "Interesting course material. Professor is good at lecturing about general concepts. Sometimes topics were confusing, but could be clarified through piazza\/office hours.",
                "I thought this was a fantastic course, I would say that maybe if there were more homeworks but of shorter length that would be great, because sometimes it felt like it would be a while before we would have a place to review\/apply our learning.",
                "Strengths: nice slides, the course has great coverage and applicability in the real world\r\nWeaknesses: very hard class with super long exams",
                "The lecture is great and the course is taught in a very logical way that makes it easy to understand the very complex multi-layered internet that we rely on today.",
                "The workload was incredibly manageable and all the assignments were designed to allow for an in-depth understanding of the material. The purpose is not to overwhelm but ensure that you are following what's going on in class.",
                "I think Anurag's lectures are fantastic and the class participation element makes them more engaging than the average CS class. The Psets are well designed and help you come to grips with the material better.\r\n\r\nIf I had to nitpick about weaknesses, I would have preferred that the 2nd exam be held during finals week instead of being rushed right after the last Pset was due. The 2 projects were fun, but it would be nice if we dealt with the actual sockets and ports, etc. ourselves instead of only implementing the higher level features.",
                "The strength: Anurag is a great lecturer, Projects (programming assignments) were pretty interesting and not excessive in number (We only had 3), and homework assignments were pretty tricky but critical to understanding the class.\r\n\r\nCon: sometimes Anurag goes too fast and the lecture can seem very dense, so ask questions to stop him and ask him to explain things!",

It is absolutely essential for any computer science student to be familiar with these concepts and they are quite enjoyable to learn.

                "I would definitely recommend this course. The internet is the backbone of our modern world and it would be criminal to not get a thorough understanding of how it works as a Computer Science major (especially when the course is so well taught).",
                "Great CS elective that is both engaging and useful. Absolutely recommended if you are interested in how networks are built and function.",
                "Yes! I came into this class wanting to learn about networks, and I actually learned a ton! This class really does give you a really good introduction and foundation on networks, and at the end we walked through examples on how your computer connects to a website (e.g. google.com).",
                "The course was very well taught and you learn a ton about system design by studying networks. My main complaints were that each TA\/ULA only had 1 hour of OH per week, which often felt like it wasn't enough given the length of the problem sets. Also, be careful when Cr\/D\/F this class because some individuals have received D's if their grades are too low."
