                "I learned SO MUCH! About looking; analyzing shape, color, composition; about handling paint and brush; about choosing things to paint and how to paint them. Essentially I learned how to paint and be intentional about it. Loved this class",
                "This course taught me how to oil paint effectively. I learned how to oil paint from observation, and how to really see what I was painting. I also learned a lot about the materials necessary for oil painting, such as when I should use linseed oil versus galkyd.",
                "I learned so much about painting, including paint handling, color theory, and compositional techniques. More generally, I think I became a better at \"seeing\"--looking carefully and appreciating things.",
                "I learned so much about painting techniques and patience for the process",
                "I learned how to paint with oil paint (brushes, solvents, clean-up). I also learned about color theory and composition.",
                "I learned how to oil paint from observation, working methodically and building up skills. We had a series of assignments that were all engaging and culminated in a rewarding final project."

                "The pacing of the assignments is well thought out. Though some deadlines were a bit more nerve-racking than others, I never felt that I was drowning in work. The deadlines actually helped me move past my work and look forward to the next piece. I do wish we could have done some outside painting throughout the semester though. The feedback from both Bev and Taura was always conducive to our learning. I feel that I became much more open to allowing paint to do its own thing. I became much more loose and willing to change my art midway yet still feel like I was in control of the entire process.",
                "No weaknesses I can think of, maybe provide more materials so that students dont need to purchase as much",
                "The course was very interesting and engaging. I felt like it was taught very well by the professor. I think the in class critique were very helpful but I think we shouldve had more.",
                "The course is a lot of work, which Im not sure many people expected it to be. But it was a wonderful course that taught hard things in an accepting, safe environment, and encouraged both experimentation and individuality and dedication to learning technique.",
                "This course fostered student growth. The assignments pushed us in beneficial ways to try new styles and techniques when painting. The assignments were specific enough that it was clear what we had to do, but they also required lots of planning and experimentation, which helped us become better painters.",
                "This course was very strong. It was enjoyable, and I learned a lot, without feeling overwhelmed. Expectations were always clear. The Canvas website was kept very organized and detailed, which I appreciate.",
                "I wish I could have done more 1 v 1 work on certain skills since it is an introductory painting class",
                "I was very grateful that the art department covered the course fee because the cost of the materials we had to buy in addition were quite high. I hope that policy continues in the future. As for the course itself, the gradual nature of our assignments and having to paint from life always was so mind-expanding. I would say I learned more in this class than in all of my other classes this semester combined. The assignments were really well-paced, and the different techniques we learned in each culminating in discovering our own style for the final were really cool. Sometimes I would have liked to hear more of the advice given to other students on their paintings, because I think it would have helped mine (some advice I heard really did help me). Perhaps more class announcements when something useful comes up would have helped with that, though I know we were asked to work without headphones so we could hear each others feedback, which was good.",
                "Bev is amazing! She is a great teacher, whose in-class feedback is constructive and encouraging. She treated us like serious artists and considered our visions with care. The syllabus is well structured and makes it easy to build up painting skills, even as a beginner."

                "YES! YES! YES! I think painting is a medium that was so therapeutic for me. Paintings would take a lot longer than my drawings but strangely enough, I enjoyed painting so much more. I found it so peaceful to just work on my paintings at whatever time of the day.  ALSO, your classmates are some of the most talented people you will meet! I swear some of the stuff I would see was just so great.",

                "Yes I would highly recommend if you have any interest in art or want to explore painting. I had a lot of fun in the class.",
                "Absolutely. I think the skills I learned in this class would be great for everyone to learn. Professor Acha treated everyone with great respect and dignity, regardless of their skill level, and I cant think of a better atmosphere to learn to paint with oils.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The class was very fun and engaging every day. The class culture was also very positive and encouraging as people worked on their assignments.",

                "Only if you are willing to dedicate the time",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You will begin to see the world in a completely new way, and you will finally understand art museums. Plus, you will have a hunch of paintings at the end that you are (hopefully) proud of. Learning the medium of oil paint is a really challenging and rewarding skill.",
                "This was a really rewarding class to take. It was great to watch my paintings improve over the semester, and to learn some basic art theory. Bev created a collaborative learning environment."
