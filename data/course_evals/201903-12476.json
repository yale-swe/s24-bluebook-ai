    "This course was very interesting and the professors brought in are obviously very passionate about their work. I wish this course was more of a seminar style since it is a first year seminar. Every week felt like another lecture to me and the lectures were very long as well. I wish they would either be shorter or split into more days because after a long period of lecturing, things that were interesting start to get boring.",
    "Some topics I wish could be explored in greater depth or over a longer span of time.",
    "So far only one of the guest lectures has been exciting and interesting (the chemistry professor) the other professors seemed to be giving the same presentation they had been giving for at least 8 years and seemed less invested. The quizzes always felt completely unrelated to what we learned."

    "This course is fun!",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in science, but not interested in pursuing it. It would add a nice variety, for instance, to a very humanities driven course load.",
    "Yes, it is an entertaining course that could serve practical usage as many of the topics taught are relevant in modern society.",
    "This is not a seminar! Its a lecture with a quiz and sometimes a debate thrown in. I would recommend for non science majors."
