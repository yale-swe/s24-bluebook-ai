   "comments": [
    "The pacing of this course in developing knowledge about Haiti is very effective and helps students grasp a sufficient understanding of the history of the country without actually being there. I also think that the session with the librarian is a great way to expose first-years to the resources that Yale has to offer.",
    "Strengths:\r\nWeaknesses: Would have liked to see more of an emphasis",
    "The strength of this course are the material, student required presentations throughout the class, and discussion base of the course. I felt as if more in depth discussion would have been beneficial to the exploration of Haiti's history and current situation. I also feel as if more discussion on the environmental aspect of sustainable development in Haiti would have been very much welcomed.",
    "I enjoyed the student led lectures that occurred every class, though I think their structure and the readings  could be tailored to foster more discussion and student engagement.",
    "It is a strong course in terms of material covered but I think some of the readings could have been chosen a bit better. This just means that rather than just reading Wikipedia articles sometimes maybe we could have done more peer reviewed papers. But that being said I liked how the professor made it clear that students in the class could always add their own readings to the assignments.",
    "was good, I cannot think of many weaknesses\r\nreally interesting"

    "I would recommend this course for students that want to take a class that gives them the freedom to explore ideas they are passionate about.",

    "Yes, I felt as if I learned a lot in this class and it was catered to what I wanted to learn about rather then a pre set curriculum",
    "I definitely would because it was a course about the history of an unappreciated country!",
    "I absolutely would! This class was fun and informative.",
    "Yes this course is really eye opening for students who dont know much or anything about Haiti.",
    "YES \r\nteaches you how to write without the stress because we are allowed to rework our drafts and improve"
