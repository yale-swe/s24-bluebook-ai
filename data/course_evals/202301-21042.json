                "I learned a lot about many, many theories in philosophy and how these theories are actually lived out in people's lives through empirical psychological evidence. It was fascinating to learn about how many assumptions philosophers and psychologists have made about how people think have turned out to be sometimes true and sometimes completely false. We discussed topics ranging from causation to the self to free will to many other topics and sub-topics.",
                "Learned a lot about methods in empirical philosophy, its' intersection with philosophy, and how to write experimental proposals. Truly an excellent class that does what it aims to do in the syllabus.",
                "This course covers a lot of interesting philosophical concepts, inviting you to think deeply about issues of morality, the self, causation, free will etc. At the same time, you also explore empirical data from psychology that provides evidence for an against some of the leading theories you discuss in class. This course will familiarize you with reading and writing both philosophy and psychology papers and enable you to engage in philosophical conversations,",
                "I learned about philosophical theories and ways that psychology studies were paired with them.",
                "We focused on exploring the recent experimental literature around a few key philosophical questions: utilitarianism vs deontology, free will vs determinism, intuitive dualism, continuity of the self, and the theories of causation. I learned how to design an experiment that borders philosophy and psychology. Experimental philosophy as a field was completely foreign to me, and Professor Knobe's class gave me a running start in knowing how to read and research the exciting topics that this newer field has to offer.",
                "Through this course, I learned more about philosophical questions and challenges that have been attempted to be answered through psychological measures. I gained insight into how philosophy plays a role in the development of psychology research and study, particularly in the realm of beliefs of self and free will. The class was primarily a seminar that allowed us to develop interesting ideas after reading the papers provided by Professor Knobe and it was a great experience to learn from others and develop my own philosophical ideas.",
                "Deeper insight into the intersections of academic philosophy & psychology, as well as a broader understanding of \"folk\" notions of each.",
                "Overview of some big ideas in philosophy, including the self, free Will, and mind-body dualism. This seminar places an interdisciplinary focus on philosophical and psychological understandings of human behavior.",
                "An introduction to some of the biggest problems in philosophy (morality, free will, personal identity, etc) and how current psychological research can help us think about these problems. This course also offers a robust introduction to the methods of experimental philosophy  using empirical data to help approach philosophical problems."

                "I found the once-weekly, one hour and fifty-minute seminars to be helpful and conducive to rich, focused discussions in the topic and reading(s) for the week. The workload for the course was manageable and interesting. It can be hard at times to engage in discussions if you don't have a strong background in philosophy, but Josh creates an extremely approachable atmosphere for class discussions that helps encourage everyone to participate.",
                "Strengths: great content, great professor. Only wish he were a little more accessible with regard to office hours but being the cogsci DUS it makes sense. he doesn't have a lot of time.",
                "One strength of this course is how it combines some lecture with mostly discussion, which is lovely for a philosophy class. One weakness is that it is easy to become disengaged in a two hour seminar format, despite the fact that professor Knobe is very engaging.",
                "Strengths - interesting to see 2 disciplines combined!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - some more structure of recapping what the reading put forth at the beginning of class couldve been helpful. Also guidance on preparation for the final exam was very limited.",
                "I wish we hadnt spent so much time on discussing assignments. We lost a lot of class time.",
                "The seminar format was very effectively led by Professor KnobeI came into some classes completely baffled by the highly technical readings, and somehow walked out with a quasi-full understanding of the essence of the topic at hand. Professor Knobe's enthusiasm about his research and his expertise in the field brings energy to our discussions, and he is very patient and understanding that we come to his class from different backgrounds in philosophy and psychology. He is a kind and understanding grader of written work and will take the time to give detailed feedback about your arguments. An area that could be improved is that the readings (especially in the free will, causation, and continuity of the self sections) felt at times unnecessarily difficult and jargon-y as an introduction to the topic.",
                "The class was extremely engaging and intellectually simulating. I really enjoyed every class because we were able to discuss and debate various different philosophical ideas that are often difficult to grapple with. I really learned a lot through the format of the class as Professor Knobe was able to both lecture and invite students to share their thoughts on specific thought experiements. The papers were also very engaging in their ability to challenge our abiltiy to develop strong philosophical ideas and critiques.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, easy to participate, supportive instructor\r\nWeaknesses: We didn't engage much with the readings until it came to write our two papers or study for the exam. Would also have enjoyed more class discussion...sometimes it felt like productive lines of discussion were cut short to stick to basic ideas.",
                "Strengths include the discussions, which incorporate a good balance of assigned readings and real life examples. However, many times, the discussion strays from psychology and ends up being a philosophy-only discussion, which is not what this course intended to be."

                "Yesif they have a strong interest in philosophy and philosophical thinking. Though the course is Philosophy for Psychologists, the primary focus is on philosophical theory and how such theories have been tested via psychology. The readings can sometimes be dense but they are overall very interesting, and class discussions are engaging.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course. The topics are very interesting, and the class environment was a refreshingly positive thing to experience every week.",
                "Yes absolutely. A fascinating class on the intersection of two very related fields by one of the most perfect people to do it. Knobe's passion and incredible knowledge shines through in his teaching. Excellent course.",
                "I would recommend this course! I also took PHIL 182, Perspectives on Human Nature, which was a very similar course with respect to content and organization but I think I liked my ability to engage with the texts and my classmates more in a seminar rather than lecture format -- but I am glad I was able to take both and re-engage with new papers and Professor Knobe.",
                "If theyre interested in how psychology and philosophy can overlap, yes.",
                "Yes! It was very interesting!",
                "Yes! Professor Knobe is very knowledgeable and invested in each of us in the seminar. Whatever your background in philosophy, cogsci, or psychology, I believe if you put in the work, you can get a lot out of this course! The material is unique and Professor Knobe himself works in pioneering research in the field, so there is nowhere else you want to be if you are interested in research in this area. Be ready for dense readingsyou will get out of this course what you put in.",
                "Definitely! I really enjoyed the course because I learned so much from Professor Knobe and my peers!",
                "Yes. Take this class if you can!",
                "Yes, if you need a psych\/philo intersection or are a CogSci\/psych major.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in exploring intro philosophy with the occasional relation to psychology. However if you are only looking for intro philosophy, its best to take another course.",
                "Yes, most certainly if you're interested in the intersection between philosophy and psychology. I consistently found the course material  reading and short lectures some of the most interesting material I was reading this semester, even if the class discussions sometimes drag (due to the two hour class length and difficult nature of the problems). Finally, this might go without saying, but don't expect closure on any of the topics we discuss. We never seem to solve any of the big problems, only reframe them. But this is pretty typical of philosophy."
