In doing so, we learned about the history of different Latin American countries, the main issues contributing to inequality , the political trajectory of the region, and different analytical methods.",
                "This course was a great experience in interacting with the major research in Latin American political inequality. Engaging with the scholarship and the presentation/discussion format was very practical.",
                "Studied Latin America as a region, looking at the ways in which inequality is observed, how it is measured, and theories about how it came to be. Topics included perceptions of inequality, corruption, violence, clientelism, and the trajectory of democracy in the region. Learned how to read academic papers and studies both on the quantitative and qualitative side.",
                "I learned how to analyze research papers efficiently and effectively, and I gained insight into the politics and inequality in many latin american countries.",
                "This course provides great insight and skills for thinking about Latin American politics and the issues that the region faces. It's really useful for understanding what's unique about inequality in Latin America and what makes it so different from an American context. Furthermore, there is a presentation assignment that really lets you delve deep into one country's politics plus learn about other countries through others' presentations."

                "The course could've been helped by more current events in the syllabus/readings to apply the research to current circumstances, instead of the bulk being in student led presentations.",

                "The course could become somewhat dry in structure as it was mainly reading research papers, but I enjoyed our discussions and the level of engagement in the class.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings; great discussion and the seminar approach is very engaging; not too many assignments so you can focus on truly engaging with the readings; and professor De La O is very knowledgeable on the subjects and the countries."

As someone who had little personal background in the region before taking the course I didn't think this was a barrier to understanding/participation and it was great to hear a lot of perspectives I wouldn't otherwise be exposed to.",

                "Any student interested in understanding the complexities of Latin American politics and socioeconomic dynamics should make this course a priority.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in not just Latin America, but politics in general.",
                "Yes, if at all interested in latin america or inequality.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course as it was engaging and I feel as though I learned a lot but it also wasn't too stressful. I would definitely recommend taking perhaps a more introductory level course on Latin America beforehand as I feel like some general knowledge about the region will make the discussions and readings that much more engaging, but you can also definitely learn along the way."
