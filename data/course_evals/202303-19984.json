            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Riley is great. The class discussions of the essays we read, which were all excellent, were engaging and yielded good insights. Essay assignments were fun, appropriately challenging, and we received clear and useful feedback on all of our drafts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many that I can think of! Sometimes it could be challenging to finish readings in time for class, but not more so than any other seminar.",
                "I think organizing essays and their respective themes by unit made it easy to expect upcoming pieces, and made for easy comparisons\/contrasts. Perhaps the time in between editing essays was too little (generally you had a week to submit a polished draft, and about 3-4 days to submit a final draft after receiving revisions, and for me personally, I am a perfectionist, so a polished draft was almost never good enough for me), but Prof. Riley was very kind about allowing students more time if necessary.",
                "I think the essay format works. The workshopping process is fairly productive and fun. I like how there's no final or midterm, and I think they would detract from the class as a whole. The regular schedule of writing essays and receiving feedback both kept me engaged and kept my writing skills up. I think this course could improve by using class time differently. I felt discussing the readings only netted so much discussion, and that class time could be used better."

                "I would definitely recommend this course. It was fun and fairly easy, but it still demanded a baseline of engagement. The readings are fun, and the work for the class is even better: you literally just write four personal essays. You can be creative in rewarding ways."
