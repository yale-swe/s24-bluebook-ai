                "Strengths: the problem sets and lectures improved my understanding of the material. The exams were very fairly structured and forced me to really understand the theorems and concepts. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the homework problems felt very unmotivated and a chore until the end when you realized how they were important.",
                "Strengths - content was interesting, midterm format was reasonable, generous grading policy\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - lectures could be hard to follow at times",
                "Strengths: a rigorous introduction to abstract algebra, covered many topics at a very fast pace, learned a lot about abstract algebra\r\nWeaknesses: course intended to best fit pure mathematics majors with a good grasp of the topics before taking the class (not quite an introduction level course speed), professor is very smart but assumes the same of the students and skips over parts of the proofs on frequent occasions leaving the proofs difficult to follow. Definitely take this course with a lighter workload on other courses. 10 proof problem PSETS per week, even on Thanksgiving week",
                "The course moves at a very quick pace, and especially in the beginning, it can get overwhelming--particularly for those who haven't seen abstract algebra before. However, the course is otherwise well-designed for learning.",
                "Great course! In the beginning it was a lot of work, but dropping the number of pset questions from 10 to 8 helped a lot. The exams were also very chill.",
                "The strength of this course was the material and the community. The course material was very interesting, and I think most of the students really enjoyed engaging with it. We also did a lot of work together in office hours and otherwise, which gave us a nice sense of community in the class.\r\n\r\nHowever, that is about where the good things end. People bond through struggle, and the reason we had such a strong sense of community was that we were very badly struggling. Our ULAs told us that our class was going at about twice the speed of the course when they took it. We were tearing through the material, being given absolutely no time to process any of it, and we were expected to be able to do these problem sets, some of which had absurdly hard and long questions. For example, in past math classes, we would learn a new theorem, and then spend a day or two using that theorem to prove some other things to see how it is used. In this class, our professor would introduce an idea and then just move on, with little to no explanation. Because of that, we had no time to internalize any of the information, and we just felt absolutely lost on the problem sets.",
                "Professor Frenkel is brilliant but a poor lecturer. It was incredibly difficult to follow the presentation of content in class. Provided proofs were incomplete, entire areas of content were omitted and then would later appear on PSETs (e.g. semidirect products), and lectures were generally unclear prompting many students to choose not to attend. Dummit and Foote is a great reference text but not ideal for a first exposure to the subject given the pace through which we moved through content (all of rings in addition to an introduction to algebraic number theory). As a result, the workload of the class was overwhelming with a continual feeling of not understanding and being told to read more. Unnecessary stress was caused by scheduling midterms for the Wednesday immediately after both the fall and Thanksgiving breaks, releasing 15 possible theory problems that may appear on the exams, and assigning PSETs due on the same days. Both of my breaks were occupied with studying. A great strength of the course were the TA office hours. Hamilton, Sarah, and Dash are exceptional and were able to both teach us general content and guide us on how to approach PSET problems. Although PSET feedback lagged throughout the semester, the grading of exams was timely and generous. A large proportion of Dummit and Foote is covered.",
                "This course covers some really fascinating and beautiful material, but it is also quite difficult. Professor Frenkel sometimes did not explain things very clearly which made it difficult, but the ULA's were fantastic and answered any and all questions I had.",
                "One particular strength of this course was the consistency of the course format. This included the parallel between the material and the class textbook, the problem sets, and the format of the exams. Firstly, the material closely followed the course textbook, and since the material was often too complicated to understand after a single lecture, being able to follow up on class notes with the textbook was very helpful. Secondly, the problem sets were assigned weekly, with 8 required problems and two optional problems for extra credit. The questions always closely tested the definitions and concepts from that week of lectures. Furthermore, the problem sets were published in halves, which encouraged students to get an early start and not attempt to finish the questions all at once. Lastly, the exam format included several questions selected randomly from the homework, and an additional question selected randomly from 15 theoretical proofs from class. This encouraged students to pay careful attention to the pset problems and to attend office hours regularly, and to take detailed notes on the proofs presented in class. It also provided an amazing incentive to revisit and learn foundational proofs that would have been too daunting to revisit otherwise. The main weakness of this course was the pace of the material. I feel that I would have taken more away from the course if the material had been at a pace that allowed me to keep up with textbook readings and to complete the optional homework problems.",
                "Abstract algebra is applicable in many areas; connections to different fields of math were hinted at throughout. Learning abstract algebra definitely improved my depth of math knowledge. As a weakness: the course was not organized particularly well; the professor could have streamlined feedback and the structure of the course",
                "Id say that the structure of the problem sets and tests this semester was probably much easier than perhaps in the past which could be very nice at times.",
                "This course is hard and it goes very fast. In my opinion, its major flaw is that it spends too much time proving later results and not enough time explaining intuition for key concepts at the beginning of a chapter. It's very cool that you can prove this result, but it doesn't matter as much if I don't understand what the building blocks.",
                "Strengths: PSET questions clearly intentional, built off each other to give more understanding. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While he's a legendary mathematician for sure, Frenkels' lectures could've been a bit more structured\/easy to follow - I found myself getting lost in some of his proofs and was unsure why he was bringing up some topics at certain times - I think a slightly more linear approach would've made for clearer lectures.",
                "The course this semester had a very high workload with 10 exercise proof problems from the textbook each week, which could easily go upwards of 15-20 hours some weeks to complete. While this does teach you the material comprehensively and at the end you have learned a lot which is a strength, it can be overwhelming and feel like more work than it needs to be at times.",
                "It is very hard to follow the high-level idea, since this is our first exposure to this topic.",
                "The lectures went at a fast pace and were often difficult to follow. I also did not like the format of the examsthe midterms consisted of one theoretical problem chosen from a pre-distributed list of 15 problems, along with three problems selected from past problem sets; I would've preferred the exam to contain some problems we hadn't already solved.",
                "Well-organized class. The different concepts can be a bit overwhelming but can be handled.",
                "This class was really difficult. The problem sets took a long time, and the exams covered a lot of content.",
                "The lectures were very difficult to follow -- but the sheer beauty of algebra saved it!",
                "With Frenkel, you needed to put a lot of independent work into understanding the material. Certain concepts that came up in the problem sets were not covered in class during lecture. As someone who hadn't up to this point devoted my life to math, I would have preferred more assistance and for more details to be covered during lecture.",
                "I thought the structure of the class worked well. I appreciated how pset questions were released after the relevant lecture, I felt like the psets generally solidified my knowledge of concepts, and the format of the exams made me have an even better understanding of the material through my studying. Lectures were interesting and taking notes was helpful for the exams. One improvement would be providing the chapters\/sections of the textbook covering the class content.",
                "The strengths are definitely the textbook and the ULAs. I probably read that textbook several times over throughout the course. It has really clear explanations and motivations of theorems. You can basically not go to class and just read the textbook and be totally fine. In fact, that's what I did for a significant portion of this course because lecture was not good. Often, lectures were vague and had errors even though a lot of what was covered was just exact portions of the textbook. Professor Frenkel often left gaps in his proofs because I think they were trivial and very rarely turned around to answer student questions. So it was really difficult to learn from lecture. Problem sets were often really long and required theorems or propositions not covered in class but mentioned in the textbook so it made the learning process very difficult but on the bright side you will feel extremely comfortable reading a textbook after this course. Each of my psets was about 20 pages handwritten and took several hours to complete. Fortunately, Professor Frenkel was kind about deadlines and in fact reduced our problem sets from 10 problems to 8 with 2 extra credit ones. Exams in this course were crazy. The syllabus only mentioned a single midterm and final but we ended up having a second midterm anyway. Midterms were also intense. They consisted of 4 problems: 3 from the approximately 60 homework problems and 1 long proof that could be any of 15 theoretical questions (think existence of Sylow subgroups, gauss lemma, etc). So midterm prep was extremely tedious since we had to be able to prove any of these 75 questions in a tight time frame and probably wrote several pages of proof. However, despite this tediousness I feel like learning to prove myself all of the big theorems of the course in preparation for an exam gave me a deep understanding of the material despite the painfulness. Another problem is that each midterm was right after our two breaks so we basically never got a break and we had the psets (that were included on the midterm) due the same day as the midterm so this semester I never got to rest because of this class. ULAs overall were super kind and knowledgeable so that was a significant plus and other people in the class were really nice too so we had a good community. At the end, the Frenkel had mercy on us and made the final optional so that was nice. I think this course could be improved by being mindful of breaks and workload and having way clearer lectures that are actually helpful and answering student questions. We also never got out psets back until basically the end of the semester so if you misproved something on the homework and it was on the exam you wouldnt know until you get your poor exam grade back I got lucky and this didnt happen to me but this definitely happened to some people.",
                "I had to rely a lot on independently reading the textbook. The TAs are nice though",
                "The course is pretty fast-paced compared to MATH 230 and 231, and requires a lot of self-learning to fill in material not covered in class. The office hours are super helpful for catching up with material and finishing Psets, but I wish we had more structure for the course (Something like a course calendar or textbook chapters to preview would have been very helpful).",
                "The psets were good. I found the lectures a bit rough sometimes - for some of the longer and more important proofs it felt like the prof was just rushing through without taking the time to clearly establish pieces of notation or check that people were actually following along, so I often ended up just scribbling everything down and then taking time to work out how it actually went on my own afterward. My main complaint\/feedback is that it would be really nice to have a textbook that better matches the way the course is taught. Some important theorems were proved very differently in the textbook than in class (for instance, the classification of finite abelian groups wasn't even proved in the textbook, just given as a corollary of a significantly more powerful theorem that was outside the scope of the course). There were also a few places where the lectures used slightly different definitions than the textbook, although that wasn't really much of an issue, just slightly inconvenient at worst. In general, I would have had a better time if we had written resources for all the material covered in lecture, since I'm much better at reading math than listening to it.\r\n\r\nAlso, it took ages for us to get our psets back. They're a relatively small fraction of the grade compared to the exams, which were returned quite promptly, so it's not a huge issue grade-wise, but it was still frustrating to not have feedback.",

The only drawback was the lectures were at times hard to follow, so a lot of times I had to read the book to figure out what was going on. But its doable and totally worth it in the end.",
                "Generally no, a very difficult course that made my semester very academically focused. However, some people who know they will study pure mathematics will find this course to their liking.",
                "Yes, it's definitely worth it. Even though the class probably consists primarily of math majors, I think the class may be interesting to a slightly broader audience. Although it may not be as applicable in industry as some of the other classes in the math, cs, or s&ds departments, it might be one of the best classes for non-majors to get a taste of pure math, and it's definitely challenging but rewarding!",
                "I definitely would, I loved the content very much and am now considering pursuing algebra in the future.",
                "As it is currently, I would not. I intentionally created a relatively light courseload because I thought this course would be difficult, but I couldn't anticipate the pure frustration that it brought. I went to office hours 4 times a week, spent many hours on each problem set, and basically... this class ruled my life. It was the primary thing I thought about for the entire semester. The issue is that this class is a HUGE prerequisite in the math major, so while I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, people will definitely have to take it.",
                "Prof. Frenkel is a geniusnot just because of his accomplishments in math. By releasing a lengthy-but-finite set of possible exam questions before the test, he had the entire class reviewing so extensively for exams that we all learned the course content several times over. The course is heavily reliant on Dummit and Foote's text (Chapters 0-9) and on the ULAs. Frenkel is also very courteous and understanding when it comes to grading; he provided multiple ways of calculating your final grade and will give you whichever comes out the highest. He is very responsive to student feedback.\r\n\r\nBe warned, however, this course is an immense workload. You will struggle a ton and there will be students who seem to understand everything 10x faster than you. 60% of the class didn't come to lecture because the lectures were very hard to follow. I could see the course being a better experience if you read the textbook and practice from it ahead of taking the class. Otherwise, be prepared for this class to take up all your spare time and you will need to make office hours every single day mandatory in order to get by. I anticipate some negative reviews above and below mine, but there is absolutely a pathway for success in this class and Professor Frenkel is very generous and wise.",
                "No, this is an absolute nightmare of a class. \r\nIt was incredibly difficult to follow the presentation of content. Provided proofs were incomplete, entire areas of content were omitted and then would later appear on PSETs (e.g. semidirect products), and lectures were generally unclear prompting many students to choose not to attend. Midterms were scheduled for the Wednesday immediately after both breaks overlapping with the due date of PSETs. The workload of the class was overwhelming with a continual feeling of not understanding and being told to read more. This led to rampant imposter syndrome and withdrawals (including math majors). The only advantage may be the wide scope of algebra covered- although not ideally- and the amazing TAs who went beyond to teach us in office hours.\r\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, but maybe not with Professor Frenkel. The material was some of the most interesting I have studied in any math class at Yale, but Professor Frenkel was not very clear in his lectures. I found I had to teach myself a considerable portion of the material, which was ok since it was interesting but I still wish it had been taught better the first time around. Nonetheless, abstract algebra is kind of vital to know for any math student, so I definitely would recommend taking this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in pure math, but I would caution them that it is very easy to experience burnout on this course. The material is interesting but highly abstract (as the course title suggests) and very technical, so without a clear passion for pure math, it is easy to become lost and frustrated with the subject matter.",
                "Take it if you're a math major. It may be interesting if you're not a math major, but depending on who's teaching it it may be a hard time. Workload is also a solid amount.",
                "Yes I would go for it if you are interested in taking an interesting higher level math course. Can feel intimidating for some at first but it is pretty accessible for people with background in the math introductory sequence.",
                "If you're a math major, you should absolutely take this class. Group and ring theory are both fundamental and necessary to so many other fields that you'll be missing out on a lot of math without it. For non-math majors, if you're really interested in the material, go ahead, but it will take a lot of time and mental energy, so make sure you're really interested before committing.",
                "It's a hard course. If you're up for it, go ahead. But I would only recommend this course to a student extremely comfortable with math proofs and with some existing curiosity about the subject.",
                "Iff you want to do higher-level math\/math-adjacent topics. The work is a lot, but the material is quite beautiful.",
                "Taking this course with professor Frenkel really depends on what type of class you are looking for. If you are a math major who really wants a stong grasp of the material and is okay with the workload, then this class will offer that experience very well. Otherwise, for others interested in abstract algebra but don't want to commit a minimum (possibly more) than 10-15 hours each week for the class or generally have a busy schedule with their other classes, then I would likely recommend waiting to take the course another year.",
                "As a math student, this is something you must take.",
                "I would recommend abstract algebra to all math majors, as well as anyone else with an interest in pure mathematics! However, if Prof. Frenkel is teaching the class, be prepared to spend a lot of time reading the textbook thoroughly.",
                "Yes to any math major. This class involves basic concepts important for algebra.",
                "Sort of? It's a pretty important math class to take, but it was a lot of stress and work.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course for any math student.",
                "This class is a prerequisite for anyone who seeks to learn more about abstract algebra (i.e. if you want to take Math 370 and beyond). Anyone who is interested in math should probably have some sort of an introduction to abstract algebra, but this class requires quite a bit of work, so it's good to keep that in mind.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed the class, and felt like I came away with a solid understanding of the material and well prepared for future courses.",
                "Yeah - good intro to groups and rings and stuff",
                "Be careful yo. Only take this course if you either know what you are doing and have experience with algebra (lots of people somehow did) or are willing to put in an insane amount of work. After this course however I feel unafraid of higher level math and have been through the ringer. The strengths are definitely the textbook and the ULAs. I probably read that textbook several times over throughout the course. It has really clear explanations and motivations of theorems. You can basically not go to class and just read the textbook and be totally fine. In fact, that's what I did for a significant portion of this course because lecture was not good. Often, lectures were vague and had errors even though a lot of what was covered was just exact portions of the textbook. Professor Frenkel often left gaps in his proofs because I think they were trivial and very rarely turned around to answer student questions. So it was really difficult to learn from lecture. Problem sets were often really long and required theorems or propositions not covered in class but mentioned in the textbook so it made the learning process very difficult but on the bright side you will feel extremely comfortable reading a textbook after this course. Each of my psets was about 20 pages handwritten and took several hours to complete. Fortunately, Professor Frenkel was kind about deadlines and in fact reduced our problem sets from 10 problems to 8 with 2 extra credit ones. Exams in this course were crazy. The syllabus only mentioned a single midterm and final but we ended up having a second midterm anyway. Midterms were also intense. They consisted of 4 problems: 3 from the approximately 60 homework problems and 1 long proof that could be any of 15 theoretical questions (think existence of Sylow subgroups, gauss lemma, etc). So midterm prep was extremely tedious since we had to be able to prove any of these 75 questions in a tight time frame and probably wrote several pages of proof. However, despite this tediousness I feel like learning to prove myself all of the big theorems of the course in preparation for an exam gave me a deep understanding of the material despite the painfulness. Another problem is that each midterm was right after our two breaks so we basically never got a break and we had the psets (that were included on the midterm) due the same day as the midterm so this semester I never got to rest because of this class. ULAs overall were super kind and knowledgeable so that was a significant plus and other people in the class were really nice too so we had a good community. At the end, the Frenkel had mercy on us and made the final optional so that was nice. I think this course could be improved by being mindful of breaks and workload and having way clearer lectures that are actually helpful and answering student questions. We also never got out psets back until basically the end of the semester so if you misproved something on the homework and it was on the exam you wouldnt know until you get your poor exam grade back I got lucky and this didnt happen to me but this definitely happened to some people.",
                "Required for math majors, would not really recommend for non majors.",
                "It is an excellent course for people planning to dig deeper into pure mathematics, but it is very time consuming and can be frustrating at times.",
                "If you are interested in abstract math, yes. If not, no.",
                "I would if you really really like mathematics.",
                "If you're genuinely interested in pure math, this is definitely a valuable class. However, if you're not willing to put in the work to do the weekly psets and study all the proofs (around 50 proofs each) for the exams, then the workload could prove high for you."
