Don't be afraid to go to office hours. She is very helpful, is absolutely willing to practice more Japanese with you, and can explain to you the ideas behind her ways of teaching which are all very logically sound. She doesn't answer emails very consistently so just walk up to her after class, and she's very nice and willing to help then. Honestly, I am highly glad to be continuing level 4 Japanese with her next semester. While being cold-called in class can seem scary, and we didn't get very many grades until after term ended, I daresay my Japanese (especially speaking) has improved the most under her teaching, just from the sheer amount of participation expected and the high level of interaction she encourages among her students. Her expectations are also clearly laid out, and she even gives us kanji practice that directly help with the real tests. Just follow the rubrics and you won't go wrong. Give her a chance and see. I can see why she may not be for everyone, but I just want people to gain a perspective from a student who appreciates her teaching style the most out of all the Japanese teachers I've had"
