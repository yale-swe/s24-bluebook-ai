I also learned about basic optics, light, electromagnetic rays, quantum mechanics, and cosmology. I learned how to translate formulas to real world problems and practiced figuring out what level of complexity a particular problem has.",

And a fascinating introduction to Quantum Mechanics: experimental basis behind it, solving Schrodinger's Equation, expectation values and eigenfunctions.",
                "I was exposed to so many concepts that I can tell are whole fields in themselves. I love that we were able to see all these topics and their applications in future courses but not be pressured to understand every nuance now. I knew how to use the equations and where they came from, as well as how to comprehend the background of the individuals who came up with these theories.",

I learned a lot about problem solving for electromagnetics questions, and I really liked having a better understanding of quantum mechanics.",
                "I learned the fundamentals of electrodynamics, quantum, and cosmology. We learned surprisingly in-depth for the amount of time dedicated to each subject.",

In addition, I have gained a rudimentary understanding of quantum effects and how to work with equations within quantum mechanics.",

            "comments": [
                "It's fine",
                "The exams were pretty easy and had generous grading. This made the class, which is pretty darned difficult intellectually, a lot more manageable to stomach and less of a burden on my GPA. The psets also had extensive support from TAs, which was important because they were really difficult. Sometimes I found it difficult to focus in lectures, but this generally was not a major impediment to doing well in the class.",
                "There is so much out-of-class support built into the 200/201 sequence and it really needs it. Lectures aren't always especially organized or understandable, but office hours are always incredibly helpful on problem sets and overall understanding of the material.",
                "The only weakness of this course in my opinion is that due to a large amount of material to cover, some lectures felt rushed and important topics were glossed over and relegated to self-study. \r\nThis is compensated by the greatest strength of the course  the office hours. This course has amazing office hours, with supportive TFs and PSets which go over the material thoroughly and sufficiently. I am pretty sure someone who never comes to lectures would still be able to learn the entire course by just going to the office hours and doing the problem sets (although I havent tested this hypothesis). The amount of support offered by Professor Tipton and the TFs/TAs is truly what every course at Yale should strive towards, and even when I didnt understand something (because no-one ever truly understands quantum mechanics) I felt confident that I had somewhere to go with my questions.",
                "The lectures are engaging and the office hours are very useful for doing psets and learning material outside of class. \r\n\r\nSometimes it felt like the exams were not representative of the material on psets and review material, and would often have a problem that related to one slide on a single lecture.",
                "I think the course is impeccably structured. The lectures can be followed if you're paying attention. The psets can be difficult but there are peer tutoring sessions 5 days a week to help you with them, and unlike a lot of other courses, the peer tutors for this course are actually competent. After a while, we became so friendly with them that the sessions were actually fun. The exams were fair, usually easier than psets, and the grading for them are generous as well. There are enough practice problems posted before exams that you are well prepared enough.",
                "moved pretty quick",
                "The lectures are a tad boring and long but they are sometimes interesting.",
                "I think that the lectures could be made more clear if Prof. Tipton were to write on the board instead of going really quickly through his powerpoints. I think that this would help pace the class better, too.",
                "One strength of this course is that it provides an introduction to many important subfields of physics. I particularly appreciated the treatment of quantum mechanics and founded it to be a good complement to my quantum computing course. I also appreciated the numerous office hour sessions offered to help students complete the assignments.\r\n\r\nOne challenge with this course is that material is introduced very rapidly, making it sometimes difficult to internalize. Additionally, there were times when the homework problems felt unclear or provided insufficient clarification to communicate the task being solved.",
                "The course was very well taught and the content was engaging. I thought the textbook for the course wasnt particularly great - maybe Griffiths is beyond the level of this course (arguable), but I found it a better resource, especially for practice questions. Prof Tiptons lecture notes were very extensive, however, which definitely helped",
                "Strengths - same as with 200. Highly organized and with a clear focus for each lecture. Example problems and PollEVs contribute to overall engagement.\r\nWeaknesses - as with 200, the length of the slides themselves sometimes makes it so that we have no idea what is \"important\" and what is not. Sometimes there will be long tangents about a derivation when what we need is a boxed formula at the end -- too many things are labeled in bold to show if they are meaningful. The optics lecture specifically could also be improved.",
                "I loved the balance between psets, lectures, and office hours in aiding my understanding of course concepts. I have no complaints about the ability of the course and the instructor to convey all of the information and skills I needed to know to succeed.",
                "I really liked the example problems and how open Professor Tipton was to questions! It was also incredibly engaging! One point of feedback would be the lecture slidesa few times there were some errors in equations.",
                "This is an excellent course! Lectures are clear and organized, for the most part, and office hours are helpful enough to make up for any missed or difficult material.",
                "A strength and weakness is the breadth of the class content. As an intro course it makes sense to learn about numerous topics, but some days felt so rushed and we barely learned enough about a topic to understand it.",
                "I liked the content this course covered (electromag, GR, quantum, cosmolgy)! The problem sets (compared to 200) were a bit more reasonable in length and in my opinion, more fun/understandable. I think this course could be improved by having a bit more organization on the slides, but the information on the slides was all very helpful!",
                "The strength of this course is its dedication to ensuring that all students understand complex topics. Professor Tipton manages to break down very complex topics into digestible chunks that allow you to build a solid and nuanced understanding of the material. This course could be improved by moving a little more quickly through electrodynamics, as it often dwells too much on some topics that the class already understands.",
                "Strengths: much of the material is interesting\r\nWeaknesses: the amount of time spent on each concept is sometimes minimal, while the resources for study outside of class are small",
                "The homeworks do not reflect what we learned in class. It could be helpful for Prof. Tipton to make it clear at the beginning of the semester that we are expected to use the internet/reference textbooks for problems that require knowledge on things we did not learn in class. Also it may be helpful to host a session on how to find the right information/equations to use using the internet.",
                "I thought this course covered a lot, and possibly a little too quickly. For instance, in the quantum physics unit, it was difficult to fully understand the intuition of everything even if it checked out mathematically. Also, in the circuits unit, I was quite confused with actually solving problems by using the loop rule. Many times, it seemed that the direction of current through resistors were \"guesses\" and the intuition was unclear.\r\nOverall, however, I felt the class was very solid.",
                "Well taught and organized",
                "I liked the lecture, and I think problem sets were always reasonable. The format of tests I thought was great and well made. Sometimes, in long convoluted derivations it would be easy to get lost, but Prof Tipton always did a good job of summarizing the main points to takeaway.",
                "The main strength of this course was the teaching staff and the experiences during office hours. Although it would take time out of class to meet with either Professor Tipton or attend one of the study sessions held by the TFs / peer tutors, I enjoyed having a designated place and time to ask questions and work on physics among peers who were equally interested in solving those same problems. Professor Tipton is also a very charismatic lecturer, which lends well to days when the physics was not particularly interesting. \r\n\r\nI think that the pacing of some lectures was a bit difficult to follow at times. For some concepts, I would need additional explanation to fully understand them. However, the safety net of office hours / study sessions helped with this issue. (It would be difficult to keep track of lecture material by oneself if one did not have any spare time to go to office hours, however.)",
                "The class is very well structured for improvement in physics. Outside of professor Tipton's engaging lectures, there are office hours that are available in the evening and even the morning of the day the pset is due making it easy to find a time that works and go get help. In addition, the slideshows Professor Tipton makes for each lesson are easy to go back to and reread to gain a stronger understanding of the material. I also like the fact that I never feel pressed for time on exams and feel that the only limiting factor when taking them is my understanding of the material. I do wish for the optics unit we spent a bit more time going over things like raying diagrams and lenses as I just hadn't seen them in a while.",
                "Strengths: psets and tests actually test you on the course material, never really any surprises",
                "The biggest strength of the course is the number of Peer Tutor/TF hours on the schedule as well as Professor Tipton's teaching.",
                "This course had lots of very useful resources including the many office hours from professor Tipton and the TAs.",
                "solid intro course -- needed for physics major",
                "This is a great course. The only improvement is having a greater coordination about problem sets, as there should not have been that many instances of problems which just got removed because they were that suboptimal.",
                "Prof Tipton is the gem of this class. Incredibly kind, clear lectures, good at answering questions. Homeworks can sometimes be challenging but office hours help.",
                "Strengths: Lots of office hours and help. Moreover, there are usually other students during office hours, so it is easy to collaborate on the psets. Probably the biggest strength is https://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-201 . The entire material in Physics 201 is covered in the online lectures in basically the same way. In other words, you can essentially take Phys 201 asynchronously. Weakness: The Psets were terrible. Some of the questions REQUIRED office hours."

                "I think it's more interesting than 180/181 and not as oppressively difficult as 200/201. For sure.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone with even a remote interest in physics. It doesnt require vast prior knowledge from high school physics courses  it only requires that you pay attention and care about your own learning. \r\nI do note however, that this course should be taken after physics 200 (or equivalent), because although material from the prior course does not show up explicitly in this course, you will still be required to have at least a passing understanding on how forces act on bodies, Newtons laws and other physics staples. A student without this knowledge may find themselves without the tools other students have, and playing catch-up. Similarly, this course assumes an understanding of multi-variable calculus. Although Professor Tipton does give a video primer on the topic, a student without math 120 (or equivalent) under their belt may lose points unfairly not because their physics is letting them down, but because they integrated incorrectly despite getting the physics of the problem right.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think this intro physics class offers a great introduction to both classical and modern physics with a wide variety of topics and a good amount of depth in each.",
                "Yes, if you want to/need to take a physics sequence, I would really recommend. I think it is structured in the best way possible. I wish more STEM courses would follow this sequence.",
                "yes if you want to learn physics",
                "I would recommend the Physics 200/201 sequence given my experience in these classes. 180/181 usually teach the same subjects as 200/201, but have a significantly higher workload for no apparent reason. Of course, 260/261 is always an option if you're looking to challenge yourself, but 200/201 is a great middle ground. I particularly enjoyed 201; our unit on quantum mechanics was by far the most interesting part of the course. The psets for this class were not too challenging but kept you on your toes and kept us engaged and fascinated by the material. The two midterms were easy, but the final was a little rough, especially since we were tested on optics (I hate optics) and quantum mechanics.",
                "Yes, it is much better than 260, which I took last semester. It is a great introductory physics course that is a bit challenging but not impossible to get an A in.",
                "This class never stressed me out too much, because homework is 40% of the grade and the TFs can check answers in office hours. I think I had the physics background to take 261, but even though I've seen the material before, I was rarely bored. Tipton isn't always the best lecturer -- he can get confused by his own slides sometimes, and I don't know how much more stressed I would be if I couldn't fill in some of his blanks with my own prior knowledge -- but given my background I thought the class was chill and always enjoyed the 15-minute walk to SPL to attend lecture.",
                "If you want to learn the important topics in E&M without having to do super difficult p-sets, I would recommend this class. It covers more topics than PHYS 180 but is less challenging than PHYS 260.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who has some physics and math background and is interested in learning about a wide variety of topics in physics.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, who is interested in physics. It is a good choice for physics majors as it is well taught and comprehensive, covering lots of content.",

                "I would! Its one of the best classes Ive taken!",
                "I would! Especially over PHYS 261. It's way more chill, and if it's with Prof. Tipton, it won't be grueling, but it will be interesting.",
                "If you want a good introduction to university E&M, this is a great class. If your not super passionate, there are easier classes that still touch on interesting topics.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in majoring in physics, or who wants a challenging course to explore physics further. If you are seeing college-level physics for the first time, it will probably be pretty tricky; I struggled as someone having already taken calculus-based colle-level electromag. It definitely helps to have seen the concepts before/understand the main concepts already, as Tipton goes more in depth and challenges you with difficult problems. This course requires some dedication and work, but it is worth it as Tipton is a very nice professor! Definitely go to office hours, it's a great way to meet friends, do problem sets, ask questions, and get to know the TFs/Peer tutors and Prof. Tipton!",
                "Yes I would! Tipton is a great professor and will give you a rigorous introduction to a variety of topics that are currently at the forefront of physics research.",
                "Most likely - it offers a great foundation for approaching more complex ideas in physics, even if the teaching is sometimes lacking.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class. I took this class for fun as a cs major interested in physics topics (not looking for a career in physics). This class goes over the fundamentals without being too difficult and it does so in a way that facilitates an understanding of the big pictures in physics. Taking this class was a great decision. I learned to see the world in a different way that when I began the course. I especially love how the course emphasizes understanding the theory rather than computation.",
                "Hell yeah",
                "Yeah definitely, especially out of the other options of intro physics sequences. I really think it was a reasonable, rigorous, and enjoyable class throughout.",
                "If a person is interested in taking the introductory physics sequence, I would recommend this course, if only for the people that you will have the pleasure of being around. Even as a non-physics major, I enjoyed being in the class and interacting with physics on a deeper level (something that you might not get with some of the other introductory physics classes).",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone starting out in physics at Yale who has had some experience with physics EM in high school.  The class's speed assumes some level of experience with EM-type physics however if you've seen it before it is quite an interesting dive into the world of particles, electricity, magnetism, light, quantum mechanics, cosmology, and more.",
                "Yes. I was originally going to skip this class and go directly to 410 because I already took AP C in highschool. Totally worth it to stay because Tipton slowly eases you into quantum that will prepare you for future physics classes, if you're considering this for the major. Also, the tests are really predictable and always align with material in the review guides and psets.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I took 260 in the fall, and 201 with Professor Tipton made my life so much better. There are so many office hours, and the class is at just the right level of difficulty.",
                "Yes, I would. It gives you a good foundation in physics.",
                "yes! great overview to electricity and magnetism (and their connections!) and dabbling in quantum at the end of the semester was super cool!",
                "Absolutely, as it seems the objective best of the 3 intro physics courses.",
                "Yes, unless you really think that being in 200 would bore you to the point of lunacy, it's definitely worth taking with Tipton.",
                "Because of https://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-201 , I would always take phys 201 over phys 181. I would take phys 261 over phys 201 if I took Multivariable Calculus and AP Physics C."
