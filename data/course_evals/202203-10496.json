In addition to this I've learnt a lot about Italian culture through either informative videos, both assigned and in class and also through reading that we have done in class through group discussion."

With the vast amount of material to learn, it did at times seem like the pace was slightly challenging, and that there wasn't an ideal amount of time for reflection and conversation. Nevertheless, this is to be expected; the instructor was amazing and there were alternative means to practice orally such as online exchanges and tutors.",

                "I really like the Asynchronous elements of this course, as I think it really gives the students the chance to catch up and explore the language in their own time and to explore their interests that may have been sparked within the classroom further. In addition to this the amount of group-work that was used in the course means that I gained a good grasp of both speaking and listening / understanding the language - a better understanding of what Italian interactions would actually be like. As far as weaknesses are concerned I think that with any L1 language course it is quite vocabulary and grammar heavy, so maybe filling some of it with a bit more Italian culture would diversify the knowledge with which the students went onto L2 with"

                "Absolutely. As someone who has learnt 3 languages before from scratch, this class does an unbelievable job to push you closer to fluency even at such a low level. The balance of a casual learning environment with rigour made me excited to go to class every day. Moreover, you make many friends in such a small seminar setting. If you want a fun, insightful language learning experience with just the right amount of challenge, I cannot recommend the course more.",
                "Yes. The workload is not too high and I feel like I was able to learn a lot.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student at Yale as it was one which was very enjoyable and with a manageable workload, but also a course that is very engaging and whilst still intellectually stimulating it is a course that encourages interaction in the classroom which I found to be really enjoyable."
