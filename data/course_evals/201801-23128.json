    "FOR ME MYSELFIE AND AI: As Craig Eklund said: \"You read a lot but you don't end up learning anything\" -- anything concrete that is. You get a whirlwind view of the self which ends up confusing you even as you learn a lot about your own \"self.\" \r\n\r\nHelps to improve writing skills as well. Would recommend taking this early in your \"college career\"",
    "I learned how to analyze academic writing, improved my writing, and learned how to formulate strong arguments.",
    "This course was one of my all-time favorites at Yale. An English class with a focus on philosophy, I would recommend it to anyone interested in both writing and learning about one of the most complex topics in our world -- the self. This course helped me to become both a better writer and a better thinker.",
    "-develop writing style and technique\r\n-literary analysis\/critical thinking skills \r\n-insight about philosophy of the mind\/artificial intelligence",
    "I developed knowledge of some works about selfhood and improved my written argumentation skills.",
    "Writing clarity, content, tips and styles, knowledge about various views and arguments regarding the \"self\" throughout history, how the self plays into literature and film.",
    "I learned basic formal writing skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of the greatest strengths of this course was the low-pressure classroom environment. Every class seemed more like a discussion that everyone could participate in, rather than a traditional lecture. This helped to foster a comfortable class where students were encouraged to think critically and feel no shame about just throwing ideas out there. I have very few critiques about this course. It was one of my favorites.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-Interesting topic area\r\n-Structured into 4 essays of different styles that improves writing ability\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Class size was slightly smaller; great for individualized attention but not as diverse in-seminar discussions\r\n-Could have more of an emphasis on more advanced writing techniques and critical lit theory",
    "The biggest strength of this course is that it has an interesting topic with lots to draw from. However, I didn't find this course to be very helpful in actually improving my writing. It could be improved by doing more short writing exercises.",
    "Should have more papers that are shorter to focus on progressive writing development, since with so few papers, we only get minimal feedback."

    "I would recommend taking this in your first year at Yale. Even if you don't get in off preregistration it's worth showing up, since most classes don't fill up completely.\r\n\r\nMe Myselfie and AI was a really interesting course and if it's offered again I would recommend it. The readings are really good.",
    "Yes, as a STEM major, I really didn't want to take ENGL114 because I knew it would be a lot of work, and I am not very confident in my writing. However, this was one of my favorite classes of the semester because the topic of the class was so interesting. Writing drafts was not something I had done much before and learning to revise definitely improved my writing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. If you want to learn about the self through a variety of diverse lenses, have a kick-ass teacher, meet new friends in a small classroom, write fantastic papers (two of which are on a topic of your choosing\/you are given absolute liberty to write about what you want), and do so with minimum stress yet maximum benefit, you should take this course.  Its hard to find great english courses that are low stress, and this is one is definitely a gem.",
    "Would recommend to first-year students who would like a well-supported transition into college-level writing.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who was looking for a class to fulfill the writing credit requirement. I would not recommend it to someone who is interested in studying writing or selfhood in depth.",
    "Yes. Interesting content"
