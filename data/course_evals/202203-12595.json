                "I learned more about the histories of Latin American countries, outside of just Mexican history.",
                "I learned a lot about Latin America in both depth and breadth. It covered topics in a very comprehensive, critical way. I also like the way this class spotlighted indigenous voices and issues. It gives great context for anyone learning or reading anything about Latin America.",
                "I was able to discover the history of Latin America and how the relationship it has with the modern-day challenges in Latin American societies. I thoroughly enjoyed how specific and in-depth the lectures were as well as the readings. I know much more about Latin America than I did before. I also feel inspired to continue learning about the different cultures, political violence, and history of the region.",
                "I learned more about the Latin American culture, both in the past and the present.",
                "I learned a lot about the basics of Latin American history and culture. From the initial invasion of the Americas to current issues like feminicides, violence, and migration. I also appreciated the depth of study when we looked at revolutions, U.S. interventions into the region, and political violence. This is a must take course if you have any interest in learning about how Latin America formed itself and was influenced by the West.",
                "I learned so much about past and current Latin American politics, historical events, and culture. I now have a solid understanding of the incredibly diverse region and its current struggles and successes. I developed critical analysis skills because we have a variety of readings each week, all from different sources. We also did deep analysis of artwork, so it left me with better cultural interpretation skills. Overall, this was the class that I learned the most concrete knowledge from that I talk about and apply all the time.",
                "Colonial to present-day history of a variety of Latin American countries, including (but not limited to): Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras, Argentina, Peru, Nicaragua.",
                "In this class I learned the extensive history of Latin America which allowed me to gain interest not only in the region's past, but also in the current present that Latin America is in. This course made me realize how skewed some of my past perceptions had been about the region, since I had not learned the complete history of Latin America. I learned how to appreciate the current efforts of people trying to bring upon progressive change in Latin America, but also to notice and call out the need for reform in parts of Latin America that have undergone injustices."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths:\r\n- Great overview of Latin American history, interesting readings\r\n- Did not feel like a typical history class > not memorizing, but rather grasping larger concepts and ideas\r\n- Required films were great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lectures had interesting content but sometimes made me sleepy. \r\n- There were a lot of assignments to keep track of",
                "The strengths of this course is the passionate professor, invigorating lectures and discussions, and the in-depth readings and resources. The only way this class could further be strengthened if there was talk and inclusion of more Latin American countries in the lessons.",
                "I would encourage more engagement in lecture as this content tends to relate to our contributions as citizens of the US",
                "The greatest strength of the course is Professor Aguilar. She is extremely knowledgable about the history of Latin America and deeply interested in student engagement in the course. Although a lecture course, she wanted to hear our opinions, comments, and interpretations of the content that she was explaining.",
                "The lecture and section breakdown was helpful. The lectures were interactive and informative while the sections helped us deep-dive into the readings and connect the lecture themes together. It was the most engaging lecture class I have been in, it felt honestly like a leminar. We also were held accountable in our readings because of a discussion post before every class about the readings. I really liked the structure of the class -- the only thing I would add is it would be great if there was perhaps more communication between the section and lecture. Because students were in charge of leading section, oftentimes discussion would stall depending on the person and we wouldn't get as far as the material needed.",
                "Strengths: this course covered so many interesting and eye-opening topics that it truly was an introductory course that encourages students to continue taking LAST and HIST-labeled classes during their time at Yale, understandable readings, and flexibility on the creative project that allowed students to follow-up on their interests.\r\nWeaknesses: no outstanding weaknesses come to mind, but given the amount of material that had to be covered in each lecture it sometimes felt that we were making rapid transitions when discussing multiple countries in the same class period.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the material being taught was intriguing and interesting to learn about. It is rare that when being taught history you get a realistic and honest answer of what happened, but in this course I think that is exactly what went about."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in Latin American history. The course was organized very well, and Professor Aguilar did a very good job making the topics and pace engaging throughout the semester.",
                "Yes if you're interested in Latin America, indigenous groups, or US-Latam relations.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The material was very interesting and the workload is fair--there is some hefty writing on occasion, but nothing too complicated. i feel this class serves as a really good introduction to Latin America (In accordance to its name) for those who don't know much and are interested in beginning the journey of learning more.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to study more about Latin American history on a broader spectrum. This is a good introduction course that provides a substantial background on historical events in each country and its influence in modern society both in Latin American and the United States.",
                "Absolutely! I was always looking forward to lectures and discussion sections to talk about the content and the readings. Professor Aguilar really cares for her students, and the readings, videos, documentaries, and other material is purposefully selected. I have learnt so much about the region that I come from and it gave me a good intellectual base to analyze issues in Latin America. I am really grateful to have taken this course.",
                "Yes! Everything about this class was interesting and engaging, from the subject matter to the teaching style to section. I learned about history from a completely different lens that changed not only my perspective of Latin American history but my world view. To learn about history from someone who really experienced the events we were discussing and has a stake in the issues is priceless. It was also very well rounded -- we talked about culture, art, music, history, sports, and politics.",
                "Yes! While there is a lot of material to cover during the lecture period, Professor Aguilar does an excellent job of explaining the underlying complexities behind the struggles that Latin American countries now face in the modern day. There are so many avenues for students to pursue after taking this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because of not only how interesting the class materials, but also because of how Professor Aguilar chooses to structure her lessons. Everytime I attended class I learned something new that captivated me throughout my time taking this class. At the end of the course I was happy with the amount of material I had learned during class, but also outside of class with the assignments and readings we had to complete."
