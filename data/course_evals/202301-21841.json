            "comments": [
                "One strength of this course is the presentation and layout of new theory concepts. There was a clear development from pivoting to the bebop scale to diminished harmony and to harmonic applications of these ideas (i.e. relevant chords, etc.). Additionally, I enjoyed the inclusion of a masterclass from professional jazz violinist Scott Tixier, who provided a new perspective in an interactive manner.\r\n\r\nThis course might be improved if it provided more opportunities for students to improvise. There were many opportunities to build important skills through exercises and transcription, but students only improvised on a few occasions.",
                "It was not as rigorous as I was expecting/hoping it to be. There was a wide range of improvising abilities at the start of the class, so it was difficult having lessons where everybody could perform and improve at the same rate. \r\n\r\nHaving Professor Escoffery teach the course is pretty cool. He brings a lot of chill vibes to the class and has a good sense of humor. The course also covers a good amount of tools we can learn to implement on our own time.",
                "a lot of the assignments became very focused on transcription and memorization of other peoples solos, which i think was helpful in small doses but i think i spent way more time in this class transcribing and memorizing music than i did actually practicing improvising, especially after the first few weeks",
                "Strengths: Professor Escoffery is a really talented saxophonist and jazz instructor, and he also comes from a lineage of some really impressive figures in jazz. He also comes from the bebop tradition so you know he has some serious chops. When it comes to lectures, he has a truly terrifying amount of knowledge, but he's also skilled at passing on that knowledge in a way that isn't too overwhelming.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Despite the name of the class, we didn't actually do that much improvisation in class. The class was moreso focused on giving us the foundation (eg. scales and techniques) that we could then practice on our own and work into our solos. But you won't necessarily improve at improvising from taking this class alone unless you go and practice a ton on your own time.",
                "I appreciated the opportunity to actually play our instruments every day of class and the material introduced has the potential to be extremely useful in my playing years down the line. I think I may have gotten more out of it if the class met more than once a week/every other week (a few class meetings were asynchronous) and was made to more consistently practice the scales and exercises covered in class."

            "comments": [
                "I would highly recommend this course to someone with an intermediate level of music experience and knowledge of basic western classical music theory. I think it is a good introduction to jazz for musicians of various backgrounds, as there were people with classical, gospel, pop, R&B, rock, and jazz backgrounds who succeeded in the class. It may be difficult for beginning musicians, as a relatively high level of technical capability and harmonic knowledge are required to play class exercise and complete or perform transcriptions.",
                "Yes. If you want to learn how to improvise in a classic bebop jazz style, definitely take this course. No matter what ability you start out at, if you are interested in the music and the skill of improv this class will give you a solid understanding of where improvisation comes from (hint: improv is not random).",
                "i think there was a lot of good material in this course and i learned some good concepts and skills, but i didnt actually have time to practice them much in the assignments. i think the actual assignments were really time consuming and not always actually super helpful, especially for someone whos not super skilled at reading and memorizing large amounts of music.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class! It can be really intimidating if you're trying to get into jazz improvisation but don't have a lot of experience or formal training in jazz. Most people who take the class already have a lot of experience with jazz, and are great at improvising already, so it's definitely scary if you don't have as much experience (you will need to solo for the class at some points). However, Professor Escoffery does a pretty good job of balancing the different skill levels present within the students and making the class manageable even if you don't have much experience improvising. You definitely need to be proficient with your instrument already though, and things will be more difficult if you can't sightread. This class was simultaneously really intense and also really chill. To someone with more jazz experience, it was probably a super easy class. We didn't have much homework, and he would also often let us out of class early. We also spend a good amount of time watching videos of performances from jazz legends. However, since I didn't have much experience, I had to put in extra work to keep up, and it was challenging at times.",
                "I would absolutely recommend the course to any student with a moderate level experience playing/studying jazz who is looking to add some more tricks to their improvisational toolkit."
