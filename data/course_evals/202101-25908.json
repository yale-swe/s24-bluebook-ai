About a month in, I started thinking about how pieces of art of architectural structures were \"in conversation with\" their surroundings; another big one that's stuck with me since studying Indigenous and African art is materiality or lack thereof.

                "Prof Jung is amazing and engaging and so thoughtful in her lectures. really wish we got class with her in person",
                "Even though the class was asynchronous, Professor Jung was very good at maintaining my attention and expressing the importance and grandeur of each sacred space or object we looked at. I appreciated the way she connected sacred spaces across the world through different architectural or art elements. She taught me the ways in which humans have deemed things sacred and gave me a newfound appreciation of these spaces.",
                "Overall I thought it was a well designed course and I learned a lot of interesting things. I would've liked one or two more lectures on African art since some of that week was focused on ethical issues (which are important, I just also wanted to look at more of the art). If there was any way to keep people on track with watching lectures that might've been good because sometimes I'd slip behind, but I did appreciate the asynchronous style because it made it very easy to watch things on my schedule. I also appreciated the lower workload especially with this Covid semester.",
                "the accessibility of the recorded lectures was nice but i missed not being able to interact with a professor and ask live questions: there were ways to do this online through the course site, but it just isn't the same. it was good to have the discussion sections to be able to discuss what we were learning. i think we could have spent more time discussing some of the more controversial pieces or places we learned about because it felt like we didn;t always do the issues justice.",
                "A major strength was the use of multiple modes of teaching. The recorded lectures were actually a really great way to get an introduction to the context and history of the region of the art. We were then able to take this knowledge and expand on it in discussion section.",
                "I loved the professor's lectures and I also think the weekly TF sections were amazing in allowing students to practice using their art history brains. However, a major weakness is that the course requires 2 papers, but before the first one, we never even read examples of art history writing in section. I think it's important to incorporate writing as well as oral practice into class because the in-class sessions didn't exactly transfer to the skills we needed for the papers. Another gripe I had was that both our midterm and final exams were scheduled within a week of our midterm and final papers, which feels inappropriate at best. Something else I've grappled with is how Professor Jung handled teaching the Indigenous Americas and African art. Instead of doing two weekly lectures for these topics, she assigned outside media that discussed sometimes sacred art but also just cultural significance of these peoples. In some ways, I appreciate the professor's explicit acknowledgment that she was maybe not the best to teach these topics, but at the same time, I felt the outside media implicitly \"othered\" these cultures, where it could have been a stronger decision to teach them like the earlier content had been taught. In other words, if the professor's expertise is in Gothic French art/architecture, then that means she should know as much about Greek art as Indigenous art, which means to be consistent these should be taught the same. I guess maybe I'm drawing a false distinction, and the distinction Jung meant to draw was art that has been traditionally taught within HSAR and art that is non-canonical in that sense, and for that reason, she relied on outside media for these sections. I still think, though, that if that was the case, the professor might have just educated herself more Indigenous and African art before teaching usbecause her lectures were typically stronger than the outside media (which tended to be more thematic than concrete) anyways. All this being said, the lessons from the Indigenous and African art topics have made a huge impact on me. One quote from Jung was talking about how history of sacred art relies on materiality in a way that many non-Western cultures do not adhere to. So, I've been thinking a lot about the west as a concept and how we implicitly devalue cultures that aren't as easily intelligible to us and how the decision to relegate these cultures to the mythical past is a construct of colonialism. Clearly, I do not have a decisive take on how these units should be taught but I do think that it should be interrogated why they are taught differently, and if the decision after interrogating is to teach them differently, then the reasoning behind the decision ought to be more explicitly explained by the professor.",
                "The video lectures were amazing!",
                "taught me so much that my mom has been getting me to learn on every family vacation to foreign countries",

                "I loved this course. It was just a little difficult staying engaged with zoom lectures. However, Prof Jung did a great job with adding effects.",
                "I liked everything about it. Wish it could have been in person but oh well. Lectures were engaging, section was interesting. No complaints.",
                "I loved the course overall, but one definite weakness would be the framing and discussion of African art. I dont necessarily think this is inherent to this course, but a widespread issue in many art history departments. I think the notion that there simply arent as many artifacts or materials to study as compared to say Gothic France has truth to it, but I think theres always room to make more of an effort to cover cultures with the same intensity. Maybe including more discussions of sacred space and art in contemporary Africa would help with the geographic imbalance.",
                "The recorded lectures were definitely a good way to get the course content across",
                "Pretty interesting materials but it was hard to know exactly what we were supposed to be taking away. It's really a general overview and moves pretty quickly so if you want to go more in depth it might not be the best class for you. Professor was a good lecturer but uploaded videos that were over the amount of time of our class, which was annoying.",

My only suggestion would be to also provide still lecture slides to accompany the lecture videos, as that could greatly facilitate referring back to the material. \r\nAnother great strength of the course were the TA discussion sections, which allowed us to apply and discuss the concepts learned in lecture, with enriching exchanges and interactions.",

If you're not an art history major, I would still say the same thing. This course does an amazing job at looking at art yet making it feel very much introductory. Professor Jung is an AMAZING lecturer and truly engages the students in the different religions and cultures we study every week. She has an amazing level of commitment to the material that shows how interested she is in it--which makes a huge difference. I thoroughly enjoyed looking at different religions through an objective and non-critical lens, and I felt that Professor Jung handled sensitive topics very well. She has the utmost respect for art and religion that comes across as both appropriate and inviting. Christine (along with the rest of the TA team) are all so amazing, attentive, and engaged with the material that it makes the learning fun. It is super easy to sign up for office hours and to receive more feedback/just chit-chat with the teachers in this course.

I'm not sure if having to attend in-person lectures would change my enjoyment of the course or not.

                "Yes! Very interesting class",
                "Yes-- it is a great overview class, you go so many different places to see things that sometimes aren't normally covered in an art history class which I liked. I would never have learned about it otherwise, in such depth.",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. Professor Jung does an excellent job of breaking down sacred sites and contextualizing them. My TF, Michaela Haffner, was also very accommodating and was a great section leader.",
                "Yes! It was a great introductory course to the significant artistic pieces of the world",
                "Yes i would",
                "Yes, if what they are looking for is a general overview, and not a very specific focus on any topic in art history. Material is interesting and profs are nice. I think this class could also change a lot depending on which TA you get.",
                "Absolutely. One of my favorite classes at yale",
                "Yes! I loved it and found the material fascinating. It is a great introductory course to global art and architecture.",
                "yes! not too much work, but very interesting. great if youve never taken an art history course",
                "Yes! You should definitely take this course. It was my point of sanity this semester and I would recommend to all the happiness found in looking at pretty things.",
                "Yes, I never really thought about architecture and its history in creating a sacred environment. Honestly, some places became part of my bucket list to visit. Although the course doesn't cover all buildings in the world, it introduces students to the basic foundation of all buildings such as churches, temples, etc. Really cool and interesting course to explore the world.",
                "yes, i enjoyed the material a lot. very interesting and clear expectations",
                "Definitely! This course is a wonderful and wide encompassing introduction to the history of art. The global approach and variety encountered within the course make it extremely valuable to expand student's views and understanding of the world of art. It is the type of course that all students should take during their time at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale, easily. For upperclassmen looking to get an architecture/art history course under their belt for the bucketlist, this is the one. Amazing lectures, incredible professor, super fun material."
