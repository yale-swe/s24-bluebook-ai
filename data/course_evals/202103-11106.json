                "This course was very good at making students consider the runtime\/ efficiency of different convex algorithms. Sure, on most problems one thinks oh this is convex, I can run gradient descent and be done with it. However, issues of bit complexity, 1\/epsilon vs log epsilon dependence, and polytopes of exponentially many constraints require one to think more deeply about how to efficiently solve such problems. Looking at the ideas behind how different algorithms actually work provides insight into our own research in machine learning and how ideas like cutting planes or optimization in a local metric vs Euclidean can be generalized to other problems. Also, I did not have much experience working with functions of matrices such as log determinants, and the gradient\/ hessian of such functions, but these came up frequently and deriving them from the directional derivative is a useful skill.",

            "comments": [
                "This course is very strong in introducing different algorithms, justifying how the work, and providing examples of applicable problems. it is very much concerned with the how of convex optimization, the specifics of how to apply the algorithm to a problem beyond the technical details of the theory. Issues of initialization, efficiency, and polynomial vs exponential issues are core to this course. \r\n\r\nOne weakness in my mind is this course should not be advertised as a student's first course in convex optimization, there is simply too much too cover. I think students should enter with a knowledge of convexity, Lagrangian, duality, KKT conditions, conjugate functions, the more ``theoretical'' side of convex optimization as opposed to the application side via algorithms which this course covers. In my mind, there should be two separate courses. A ``theory of convex optimization'' which students take first which covers the mathematics of convex optimization, after this course a student would be able to take a problem and explicitly solve on paper using KKT conditions, etc, a problem which has a computable solution. Then, this course focuses on iterative algorithms to approximate solutions when one cannot be found explicitly via calculation. Having a background in such ideas I was able to keep up with this course, but if I was in my first year of grad school and took this course without those concepts already understood I would have been very lost. I think students with the appropriate foundation can better appreciate the algorithmic aspects of the problems, computational complexity, and methodology of ''how'' the algorithms work. I think if students have to learn this side while also learning the mathematics of convex optimization, they cannot focus on both and one area will need to suffer. Perhaps the course could be coordinated with others offered at Yale so this course can assume a foundation in the theory, so it can focus on the application. I think to advertise a student can take this course and learn both the theory and the application is too much to ask.\r\n\r\nAnother point, the homework was quite challenging. I think including a few more ''easier'' or warm up problems where students can practice more foundational skills like computing duals, proving a function convex, taking hessians, etc. would compliment the more difficult problems. These could even be offered each week as an ungraded practice set with solutions if not to water down the difficulty of the original problem sets. Some problems I would spend many hours and would get the answer eventually, but I would not always feel like a learned something useful but just learned how to solve that particular problem.",
                "The lectures cover a wide range of topics and are based on the book written by the instructor. The exercises are also very helpful, but are a bit too difficult sometimes compared to the extent of discussion in class. I hope the assignments, especially the harder problems, can be more related to the lectures and more hints can be given along with the exercises.",
                "The strength of this course is that it finds a good balance with theory and practice. The problems are very hard and require a lot of time, but sometimes the solution requires tools that are not covered in the course, so I think that more hints should be provided.",
                "This is a great course.",
                "The course covers essential topics in continuous optimization in a formal and in-depth manner. Students will learn an incredible amount, given they put in the effort (much of which is required to learn the material well)."

                "Seeing my previous comment, I would recommend the course only to a student with a strong background in convex optimization. If they did not already know the basic ideas like duality, conjugates, etc. I would recommend they take a course in this material before taking this course. However, if the student has this background and wants to learn different algorithms useful to their research, I would very much recommend. I think more thought\/planning of how the course complements\/ is supported by other courses on convex optimization offered at Yale would result in a group of courses on convex optimization that better serve students at all levels, and provide a comprehensive covering of the area.",
