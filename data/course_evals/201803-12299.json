   "comments": [
    "I developed greater analytical skills and an appreciation for people who intend to major in mathematics.",
    "Nothing. I took BC and don't feel like I learned anything new until the last day of the course.",
    "Calc II",
    "I developed an ability to think in a different way than I am used to because I am not the best in math and this course allowed me to push myself to be better.",
    "I went back to the fundamentals of calculus and where the concept stems from. Instead of doing the calculation mechanically I understood what was actually going on when I was writing the integral sign. I also learned concepts about sequences and series. Parametrisation, polar coordinates and solids of revolution all helped me to develop my ability to visualise objects in 3D which will be useful for Math 120.",
    "Differentiating equations and finding the area under a curve or around a specified point.",
    "I learned how to take a stem midterm and final, as well as some techniques for studying.",
    "Mid-level calculus, and especially difficult integrations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I am generally not a fan of flipped classrooms.",
    "I think the courses vary in quality, depending on the TF you have. In general, if you haven't learned this material before, make sure to do a lot of practice and truly understand how the concepts work and what they'd look like as test questions. If you have learned this material before, and you still remember a good chunk, it's smooth sailing.",
    "This course is very strong in the material that it covers, but it would be helpful to have more examples done in class by the students with the professor giving time for them to answer examples.",
    "A flipped classroom approach might help",
    "The course goes a little more in depth with the concepts of integration, series and polar coordinates. The topics are all linked and are explained in logical progression, which means that since we have covered a given topic beforehand, we are better able to understand the next one. It is a good refresher for integration techniques. The professor also gives support and offers help to his students.",
    "Course moved very class and contained a incredibly difficult curriculum. Was a requirement for my intended major so I had to take it.",
    "The course is basically a BC calculus course.  Its strengths lie in the amount of information covered, but its weakness is that many students are very prepared to take the course having background in BC calculus, making the course less interesting.",
    "This course was challenging based on your level of calculus in high school. As a first year in this course, I knew a lot of other first years taking this course who decided to drop to Math 112 because this class was too much of a challenge for them because they did not learn as much in high school as they thought they had. I wish the placement test had more of an indication of how prepared for each class you are rather than just which one you technically place into (ie; if you just barely place into 115).",
    "I took a section that was too early and that weakened the course in my view but that is entirely my fault. There are no significant weaknesses of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Even though this was my toughest class this semester, I would still recommend it to another student.",
    "Not if you took BC and understood it then.",
    "Only if it's required.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it gives a very good and in depth overview of calculus, preparing students for higher math if they wish to take it.",
    "Yes definitely. For the math sequence, Math 115 is a good refresher and prepares you for future classes in Math. Even for non-majors the class can be intellectually satisfying.",
    "Probably not. This course was incredibly hard and irrelevant to many majors.",
    "If you just need a QR credit, this is not the class for you. However, if you are going into the stem fields and took calculus in high school, this course may be helpful for you.",
    "Yes, it's important to know math and I think the teachers are pretty fair and helpful."
