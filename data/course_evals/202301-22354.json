I also found some of the theoretical material difficult to follow but as a non-PhD student I'm not the target audience necessarily!",

                "Such a great tandem of instructors, each giving their insight and becoming extremely complimentary. Such a great class full of very interesting content. I would maybe recommend the instructors to post their lecture notes on a timely manner on canvas so that we can access them before and after the class.",
                "The strengths are the content and the lecturers. They were both amazing, and the content was always fascinating.\r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, I think the course structure is a bit too \"lecture-style\" than I would have liked. I think I would have learned more if we spent more class time workshopping research ideas or having critical discussions of papers, rather than just listening lecture. Which pains me to say because I loved the lectures, but I do wonder how much of it I retained. \r\n\r\nOn a similar note, I wish the class met twice a week for 1.25 hours rather than once a week for 2.25 hours. I think I would have had more time to process the material."
