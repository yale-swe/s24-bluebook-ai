                "A keystone to the mechanical engineering curriculum, Strength & Deformation to Mechanical Elements builds off of one's understanding of classical physics to real engineering problems. The beginning of the course feels like any physics course, but once you begin analyzing trusses, you build off these concepts to discover stresses on an object, deformation due to axial and torsion loads, and beam selection/deformation. The course covers 16-17 chapters of R.C. Hibbeler's textbook over the course of a semester, which are key to future Mechanical Engineering courses such as Manufacturing, which expects one to know these concepts on the first day. The foundation is set well by the problem sets and exams.",

                "I learned a great deal about statics, a core part of the mechanical engineering curriculum. I also learned about material deformations, offering a much more in-depth analysis of these phenomena than other classes like mechanical design had.",

                "I learned all the basics of statics that I will continue to use constantly in mechanical engineering classes and jobs. I'd say overall the class does a pretty solid job of hammering in these foundational topics and I feel relatively confident in them.",
                "Beams!!! I enjoyed beam class. I learned a lot about statics.",

This class utilized content learned in introductory physics courses and began to apply it to an engineering context.

                "The course was accessible to students who did not attend lecture in-person as all lectures were recorded. The discussion section times were accessible and many made use of them to receive help on problem sets. The exams were not too difficult with the exception of the time crunch on the first and second midterm exams (75) minutes compared to the final exam (3 hours). Content assessed on examinations is consistent with the problem sets and lecture items in class, but maybe a bit less complicated than assigned for problem sets. If you are able to understand a concept well, then you would be fine for the purpose of exams. Minor ways that the course could be improved is posting lecture notes following the lecture with a recap of concepts taught, or the addition of a recap at the beginning of a lecture of the previous class. The use of practice problems in lecture was extremely helpful and useful, especially with Diana's commentary.",
                "The course is fine overall, there isnt really a lot of room for changing it.",
                "It focused too much on the math and not how it was applied. The final was 50% theoretical math that wasnt used to solve any real world problems.",
                "Strengths: Course is well organized, exams are fair and representative of the course content. Lectures are very clear, if a little slow, and Professor Qiu is very understanding and accommodating of individual circumstances.",
                "This class was outstanding. Dr. Qiu is a fantastic professor, and she makes the lectures quite engaging. You go through derivations of formulas to ground your understanding of the material, as well as practice problems to prepare you for the problem sets and exams. The workload is never burdensome, and the questions on the exam are always quite fair. There were zero obscure exam questions across all three of them. The grading scheme is also fair and allows you to make mistakes without killing your course grade. I do think there are any weaknesses or ways for the course to improve.",
                "Prof. Qiu is a huge strength. Her lectures convey all the information you need in the most digestible form possible, and she is so sweet and helpful. No weaknesses.",
                "The course is pretty fun, but it can be hard to follow along the lectures sometimes and lecture attendance was weirdly low.",
                "This course is taught very well. Everything that needs to be known for the exams comes straight from lectures. Even though it was at 9am, the lectures were recorded, making it nice and forgiving. I think it would be cool if this class had a hands-on aspect.",
                "The course is well-organized and centered around the textbook it uses, making it fairly easy to go back and review material that may have been confusing in lecture. It is an effective introduction to statics. Lectures can be dry, but that is mostly down to the material and not any issue with organization or Professor Qiu.",
                "The course followed a very linear format and each pset was based on each chapter that we analyzed in the textbook. This was helpful in keeping up with the content\r\n\r\nI thought that the lectures were tedious sometimes because the notes came from the textbook but I enjoyed doing some of the problems from the psets during lecture. I thought they made it more engaging",
                "Class is good as is.",
                "Strengths: This course taught me fundamental concepts, in a clear way, and I have been able to relate what I've learned here to other engineering ideas and classes. Content is taught in a very logical order so connections between concepts are made easily. \r\n\r\nWeakness: This course does cover a lot of content and sometimes the steps to solve problems are not clear at all.",
                "Strengths: This course was taught pretty well. Professor Qiu is lovely and helpful. You can bring notes into the exams which was nice and the curve was pretty good. \r\nWeaknesses: In my opinion the only weakness was that there were very few office hours all of which were at pretty inconvenient times.",
                "This class was well organized for the first 3/4 of the semester. The end of the semester felt a bit rushed and I wasn't able to digest the information as well because we were covering topics at 1.5x speed.",
                "Taught very poorly, no engagement",
                "This class has been taught by Professor Qiu for many semesters, so it is organized very well. The classes move at the correct pace, and there are quite a few worked through examples which are very helpful for me. The classes are recorded and the notes are great. The textbook was very helpful as a second source of teaching and worked through problems. My only complaint is that sometimes the notes were hard to read, which is important in this class because of all of the greek letters and variables.",
                "This course was well organized and the content flowed very well, with most topics building on top of the other. There were some instances where the content seemed a little out of place and seemed to be covered for the sake of being covered. Despite this the overall skills we were developing seemed clear in how we needed to apply them and when."

                "This course would be recommended for mechanical engineering majors and those with interest in physics and structures; otherwise, the concepts in this course are too highly specialized for day-to-day use. The course is not difficult for mechanical engineering classes, but does have a higher workload because it is a STEM-oriented course. Diana is an amazing professor to have and I would recommend going to discussion sections / office hours for help on problem sets and occasionally going to Diana's office hours to work through problems or prepare for exams. This course can also be self-taught, if necessary, and the resources to do so are available. You can expect to dedicate around 6 hours/week to work outside of class. I am impartial to the topic of lecture attendance - you may attend in-person if you do wish, however; I often find myself thinking or doing work not related to this course during lecture because I personally feel the pacing is too slow.",
                "Sure, unlike some of the other engineering classes, this one teaches you things which are pretty fundamental for engineering and seem likely to be actually useful. Its not exciting but its not supposed to be (and it is actually a little cool to think how you could actually apply these equations to designing systems)",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed the process of learning these concepts and how they fit together",
                "It's obviously required for mechanical engineers, but I would recommend this course anyhow because it's super foundational and the topics from this course are highly applicable to more advanced courses such as MENG 325. It's also great to learn from Professor Qiu.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Dr. Qiu is a great professor, so I would also suggest taking her other course, MENG 492, as well. The material here though is rather interesting and gives you a basic understand of statics which informs your understanding in other electives later on. The grading is fair, and the exams are manageable as long as you study well. I really enjoyed lecture in this class as well as the practice problems made it feel engaging.",
                "Yes, this course teaches core concepts to mechanical engineering, and provides an opportunity to apply physics in new, interesting ways.",
                "Yes! It's a great class, and definitely a good place to start if you are interested in mechanical engineering.",
                "It's a great course but you have to put in a lot of effort to learn all the material and it helps a ton to read the book. It's not exactly a course you can just passively take and be fine.",
                "Yes! This is one of the best taught and digestible courses in the MENG major. You will be taking this if you are a MENG major, but this is one of the only classes I would recommend to a non-major.",
                "Yes. If you're taking this course it is probably a requirement, but it teaches crucial elements of mechanical engineering regardless of any requirements and should be taken.",
                "Yes if they are an engineering major",
                "Very straightforward material and well taught class.",
                "The course was good. Sometimes it felt like it was overloaded with material, and a little rushed, but at least this wasn't a problem for the exams, where only the more important material was covered",
                "If you are interested in mechanical engineering, I highly recommend this course because of how necessary it is to all other aspects of engineering. It teaches you how to analyze complex engineering problems, how to design systems, and generally builds an educated engineer.",
                "This course was more work than I expected it to be but I still had a positive experience. It's definitely helpful to have friends in the class to work on psets with and study for exams. The exams were hard but fair and the curve turned out fine. I found this course pretty difficult but interesting and possible to succeed.",
                "If you are thinking about majoring in mechanical engineering, this is a great class to take. I would recommend this class to people who have some experience in physics, since most of the principles build off of a fundamental understanding of forces and torque. The textbook is helpful but not necessary; Diana does a wonderful job of explaining all the topics covered.",
                "Yes, most people who take this class take it because it is required, but if you care about the topic of this class then you will learn a lot about it."
