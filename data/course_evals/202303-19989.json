                "Professor Aldrich does an excellent job teaching students about the existing political science literature on how gender permeates every aspect of our social and political systems. I thought it was a great class for younger students as it also taught us how to read political science journals and understand how to do research ourselves.",
                "I learned more about where women stand in society, the progress they have made over the years in terms of equality, and the fact that there is still a long way to go. I also got practice with analyzing the credibility of research studies.",
                "I honestly didn't learn much. Most conclusions from the lectures seemed obvious to me and were not very interesting or insightful.",
                "I learned how to look at politics and policy through a gendered lens. I also learned how to read political science papers and analyze research. I enjoyed the end of term paper and I definitely gained more insight on how to write a policy memo.",
                "how to analyze political science research, some basic data analysis, and write a policy memo",
                "I learned about the women's movement, the barriers to women's access to power, women as political candidates and how to see policy through a gendered lens.",
                "I had never taken a political science course before so I thought this was a great first one. I learned a lot about how to read political science articles and understand the research and data. I also learned so much about women and their place in politics and reasons behind why they are in the position they are",
                "I learned about gender roles and the political sphere and the way in which these topics intersect. This was my first PLSC class, and it was a great intro into this major.",
                "I learned about the extent to which women are disadvantaged in society and their pathway to politics. I learned about the historical context and modern-day barriers women face. We discussed many political science theories about women and the political sphere. The most important finding that stuck was that women are necessarily better legislators because only the cream of the crop of women were able to run and get elected in the first place.\r\n\r\nI also learned to read political science papers better and improved my data collection and analysis skills.",
                "I learned a lot about not only women in politics (such as women in Congress, women candidates, etc.) but also about women in society in general.",
                "understanding political science data (the gist of it) & reading a lot of social sciences papers and distilling their main points/arguments.",
                "This course was an eye-opening exploration into why there aren't more women in positions of political leadership and how to remedy this problem. It also provided a solid background in how to engage with political research.",
                "I gained an understanding of the subtle and explicit ways that gendered language, discrimination, and sexism operate in politics. I learned about how electoral competition is marred by gender imbalances and inequities that are difficult to detect by simply looking at the success rates of women and men candidates.",
                "This class taught me a bit about barriers facing women in politics. I also got more practice with reading and critiquing political science research.",
                "I learned a lot about different kinds of representation and what it takes to become a female in politics.",
                "By taking this course, I learned about women, politics, policy, and the ways in which they interface with one another within both American and non-American contexts."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the content and I actually thought the assignments were really well designed to help students gain exposure to political science\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: geared mainly towards younger students, in my view. I also thought the lecture was not always essential for the assignments.",
                "I think we should have either done more work on the project at the beginning of the semester or should have done just the project or just the final paper.",
                "The course would benefit from more specific instructions, but Professor Aldrich and the TFs were all very responsive and provided great guidance when asked.",
                "Section was really helpful and the lectures were good.",
                "I think the section/lecture structure works well for the course, but there aren't many strengths to the course itself. I honestly can't remember much that I learned from it because there wasn't much nuance to the conclusions presented. I think the course could be improved by prompting more discussion about the complexities surrounding gender policies and politics.",
                "Strength was definitely the variety of assignments and how the professor engaged the class during lecture. \r\n\r\nWeakness was probably the data project. I felt very underprepared for it and there was general confusion about what the assignment was, including the TF also being confused. I think there could definitely be more preparation for it in section and even in lecture.",
                "the course is well-organized on canvas. the readings offer a gendered lens rarely seen in other courses.",
                "Lectures were very engaging and informative. There was no lecture that I thought wasn't interesting and Professor Aldrich did an amazing job in the structure of the course through its four modules. The varied types of assignments we had throughout the semester also helped keep me engaged and interested in the course material.",
                "I think this course was great. The lectures were engaging and the sections always had interesting discussions or skills for us to learn. I really didn't think there were many weaknesses of the course except for maybe more discussion time would be great but that is so difficult for a lecture course so I am not sure that's possible.",
                "The lectures were great and I feel like I learned a lot from this course. The professor was also a large strength as she made lecture very exciting and fun. I think the form of assessments were interesting and varied which also made this course unique. We had a midterm, a data project, and an essay/policy memo. The only weakness is that lecture felt less substantive as the semester went on; I felt like I was learning a lot at the beginning and as it went on, we looked more at papers/studies rather than learning about new concepts.",
                "Strengths- The course CONTENT was very interesting and opened my eyes to many access barriers women face. It was also refreshing to be in a political science lecture in which women made up the majority of students! I also appreciate how interactive the lecture was, how accessible it felt, the really helpful recordings, and the in-class activities. I also love the prof and she is a powerhouse !!! (and the department head!)\r\nWeaknesses- The midterm wasn't that fun but I did like that it was online. I guess I wish we had reviewed the skills of reading a research paper more. I think that overall section felt very boring and unhelpful. I'm not sure if it's the fault of the TF or the ideas for section. It felt like section existed just becasue it needed to and it didn't help me anyway except for the interesting case studies. I wish section was more interactive, exciting and engaging with what we discussed. Perhaps we could have done some field work during section? Lastly, the data project could have been more organized! There were too many mishaps with the data sheet and I wish there was a way to hold students more accountable for completing each field and doing it accurately! I also feel like the memo project needed more guidance. Perhaps we could have read policy memos in section and gone over them meaningfully?",
                "One strength is that the workload / readings are very managable and that there are a mix of assignments (such as a data collection project, policy memo, midterm, etc.) that allow you to be engaged. Also this was the first time that this course was offered as a lecture, so some of the assignment directions may have been vague or confusing at first, but our TAs and Professor were willing to answer all of our questions and edit the assignment descriptions to give clarification.",
                "Strengths: helps you identify whether the quantitative side of political science is for you aka being a political scientist because it makes you read a lot of papers and try your hardest to understand the gist of the data. I sometimes skipped the data aspects of the readings entirely because they were too much to go through and the authors typically explained the important parts for their arguments. Also you write a policy memo at the end, which you don't get a lot of instruction from the instructor except like a template and a rubric, so you do learn how to write one because you need to write one but you're not sure throughout the process. Good amount of readings and work. Big workloads are just the 48-hr midterm (make sure to do all the lectures before then and can dedicate basically at least 20 hours to it to give urself enough time) and the policy memo/background paper. The group project was fairly easy as long as you have people who want a good grade in your team.\r\nWeaknesses: wish we had more instruction and examples of successful policy memo/background papers. Also wish we had more of an idea what the midterm consisted of and how to read a political science reading properly.",
                "The lectures were well-organized, engaging, and digestible. The curriculum was paced well, backed up by useful readings, and very interesting. The one weakness I would identify was the seminars, which I think I could have been used more productively to further engagement with the readings and coursework.",
                "the time of the lecture and the structure",
                "Strengths: Each lecture was genuinely interesting, engaging, and taught me something new. Lectures never felt repetitive and frequent case studies made the course that much more engaging. The assignments in this class were very diverse (a take-home midterm, a group project, a classwide data collection project, and a policy memo) and catered toward different learning styles and preferences. There was a lot of choice regarding the topics each of us wanted to focus on, particularly toward the end of the semester when we could choose to write a policy memo on any topic of our choosing that had to do with gender. Everything we learned felt relevant, valuable, and worthwhile.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Toward the end of the course, there was some confusion surrounding the expectations of our final assignments. A little bit more emphasis on/time spent talking about intersectionality (eg. in the obstacles to running for office) would make the course even more fruitful.",
                "Strengths: The course is well organized. I liked the lecture style, and the workload of the course was light. The assignment instructions were also clear and straightforward. Weaknesses: I am not sure I learned much in this course. There was not a lot of content, and I feel like we missed out on some opportunities to have more interesting conversations about women in politics since we had so little content to work with. I took this course because I was excited to talk about gender in policy specifically, and I felt like that part of the course at the end was kind of brushed over.",
                "The course is well organized and the expectations are very clear.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is how engaging it is. Instead of your conventional lecture where you sit and listen to a professor talk for an hour, Professor Aldrich is dynamic, incorporates modern, real-life examples, and utilizes a range of delivery methods including slides, lecturing, small group discussions, group mini projects during lectures, polls, large group discussions and questions, etc. The discussion sections were just as engaging. I left the course feeling as though I had learned a lot of new information related to women and politics, as well as new perspectives."

                "Yes if you are interested in how women get power in the workplace or in politics and also if you are interested in how policies affect women.",
                "Not really, mostly because of the teaching. It was hard to care about any of the concepts when they were taught in such an unsure and flat manner.",
                "I would! I think it was very informative and interesting and I loved Professor Aldrich!",
                "Yes! Prof Aldrich is great! you will learn useful skills applicable to the rest of the major and learn such important topics. it is well-organized and offers a diverse set of assignments.",
                "Yes - this class is accessible to students with an interest in gender, politics, electoral systems, or none of the above! It is taught as an introductory course, but also gives students the scope to dive into particular topics they are interested in. Even for students who may think they have a strong grasp on gender in politics, some of the research Professor Aldrich presented to us really challenged my preconceptions.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to every student no matter their major. The topics within this course make it a wonderful introduction to political science and gender studies.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other Yale students. It helps answer questions about why women face the challenges they do in politics and in life in general and gives you real data to prove this. There are also interesting assignments where you can work with groups and learn more outside of class.",
                "I would recommend this course because the professor was great and she made the lecture content very interesting. I would specifically recommend this course to someone who wants to see what political science is like; it was a good intro.",
                "Yes! If you care about women representation in politics, this is the course for you! It's a really solid course and not difficult at all if you pay attention and put in effort. I also had so much fun with the case study and the data project! I truly love how this class was so varied in its type of assignments in a way that I rarely felt bored! The mix between group projects, solo presentations, online exam, and a final paper felt refreshing. The workload was really chill and I feel like I've learned a lot!\r\nI do think this class could work better as a seminar (it used to be one). The problem with this being a lecture now is the discussion section feeling irrelevant and unhelpful. But hopefully it can be improved in future iterations of the class!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking for another PLSC class (whether or not they are PLSC majors or not) and wants to learn more about how politics treats women and how women affect politics around the world.",
                "Yes yes yes. The content is very interesting and important, and Professor Aldrich is amazing. She knows how to explain concepts in a way that students can understand, and she is very kind.",
                "I would if you want a fairly easy (easy-moderate) political science credit. Classes were a breeze once the midterm was over, you just needed to focus on the policy memo/background paper, data collection (input/output data from the internet), and group project. I attended lecture to learn but you don't need to do the readings if you don't have the time after the midterm.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is a low-stress way to learn about an important subject in an eye-opening manner. The course is paced and taught well.",
                "yes if it aligns with their interests",
                "I definitely would recommend this course to another student, even if you're not a political science major. The subliminal ways that policies are gendered were not immediately obvious to me and now that I've taken this course, I look at gender inequities in politics through a more critical lens. The course is simultaneously very manageable while still feeling worthwhile and relevant.",
                "This is an easy course that allows you to look into some interesting topics about women in politics. However, there is not a lot of content, and the general level of engagement with the course was very low.",
                "I highly recommend this course, you learn a lot about the subject at hand in a fun and exciting way.",
                "If you're interested in women's issues, definitely take this course! If you're not, definitely take this course, and you'll see why so many are so passionate (and for good, urgent reason)."
