I gained a lot of knowledge about different design architectures, the history of robotics, and making decisions related to creating robots. Each lecture was incredible engaging and filled with worthwhile information.",
                "I learned a lot about different aspects of robotics",
                "This course forces students to think about problem-solving in a way that few other CS courses do. As a result of exploring how to deal with the noisy imperfection of the real world in intelligent ways, the course challenges and defies the fundamental ways that students would go about solving problems in a more conventional CS class",

We covered different architectures, the development of intelligent robotics over time, the social implications and ethics of robots, and how to evaluate different robot architectures. I gained an appreciation for robotics as a distinct and important field.",

            "comments": [
                "Gained a really broad understanding of robotics and intelligence. I wish the last few lectures had included a little more present-day examples. We talked about autonomous vehicles and trucks, but not the new Tesla electric semi-trucks that were being presented the very same week. We learned about integrated systems, but not about the intelligent ChatGPT that could someday be thrown into ATLAS.",
                "Each lecture was really engaging and concise, so it was easy to pay attention to the whole thing. I think the problem sets and exams were incredibly fair if you kept up with lecture material and readings. The project seemed to come at a bad time of the year -- split up with Thanksgiving break, and it was difficult to gauge whether we were approaching it in an appropriate manner.",
                "I think that there could be a bit more coding work in the beginning of the class that could help with the final project",
                "Overall, this is an incredible course. The content covered in it is fascinating, and Scaz may be one of the greatest lecturers I have ever heard. That being said, this course stumbled when it came to pacing. The course is extremely front-loaded, meaning almost all the meaningful content is delivered in the first half of the course. This results in a midterm that is much, much more challenging than the final. Also, the lectures were notably more organized in the first half, having a very clear structure and progression that was easy to take notes on. In contrast, lectures after the midterm essentially took the form of a series of stories loosely tied together by a central idea, which made note-taking more difficult. Finally, it is worth noting that while the content is frontloaded, the actual work is backloaded to an almost unmanageable degree. This semester, there were 3 problem sets spread out over the first few months, and I never needed to spend more than five hours each week when we had a problem set due. However, there is also a final project that is assigned in the last month of the course. This project is both extremely ambitious in scope and a group project, which meant that the large work was rarely distributed in a fair manner. Also, because of a lack of clear information and the specific timing of the assignment, it was very hard to put in much work until the week before it was due. These facts combined meant that the penultimate week of the course was a 60+ hour slog, while most other weeks had little to no work.",
                "Very fun class",
                "Strength: Scaz's lectures. He has clearly taught the subject many times over, and the way he speaks is very engaging. \r\nWeakness: final project. I enjoyed programming a robot on our own, but it didn't feel like the best reflection of what we'd learned in the course because we spent most of our time debugging and figuring out how to make the sensors work rather than implementing the architectures and design considerations we'd learned. In fact, they encouraged us not to implement any one architecture we'd learned. I think the final project could be re-worked and made to both better test students' learning while making the project less difficult/stressful for students.",
                "Strengths: Scaz is a great orator. Lectures were fun and interesting. The homework was very infrequent and not a huge burden. The final project was interesting and fun. Weaknesses: The final project wasn't as organized as I would have liked. The specs were reasonable, but some of the tasks we were required to do had not been talked about much in class, but we were expected to know how to execute it anyway (a decent amount of self-study was necessary). Additionally, the webots documentation is not very descriptive and the software is a bit buggy, so a lot of effort went into trying to understand the platform and avoid resulting issues. But these issues felt minor relative to the overall nature of the course.",
                "the lectures were fun/ engaging\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to know a bit more about what would be on the final. Also a bit more guidance about the success/ failure criteria for the final project would've been appreciated. Additionally, the final project was a bit chaotic with issues being encountered with the simulator/ final project which was somewhat annoying",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures\r\nWeaknesses: class material is not very relevant to the psets, the project at the end of the semester has very little guidance and can be really difficult for someone who has not previous robot coding experience, everything is pretty theoretical",
                "Strengths: scaz is a fantastic lecturer\r\nWeakness: no clear feedback, arbitrary grading, difficult exams and final project",
                "If you treat this class as 20-ish independent lectures that are entertaining and give a view into the history of the discipline, this course is great. Unfortunately, I don't think I came away from the course having learned anything useful. The problem sets were fairly simplistic, the exams tended to focus on historical facts instead of concepts, and the project had significant problems that prevented thorough testing. This class felt like it should be a round-table discussion class with interesting readings to investigate the precise nature of intelligence, rather than a lecture and problem-set based class.",
                "The lectures are really great and very informative. I think the way of assessment was also good, the problem sets, exams and the final project helped me better understand the topics. The only weakness might be the lack of communication about what was expected from you, and the feedback on your work."

                "Yes, if you want to take a survey course in robotics. I found it fascinating and filled in many gaps, but otherwise, take MENG 443 to learn the math and coding required to control and simulate robots.",
                "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale, and it was a great CS elective. I would definitely recommend it, even if you are not particularly interested in robotics. There was a lot of useful information and offered insights into modern technology and recent research.",

                "I would definitely recommend this class! The material is very interesting, and Scaz is a great professor.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed Scaz's lectures and the final project was fun. Cool to devise and test various strategies inspired by concepts in class (e.g. reactive robot control, vision systems, prioritisation of goals)\r\n\r\nNote the workload is not evenly spread out - the first two p-sets are pen and paper questions, whereas there is a huge coding final project, and then the final exam is back to pen and paper questions. So don't expect a consistent \"algorithm-heavy\" approach to robotics, but it is also not a gut qualitative \"writing\" CS class. I like the balance between high level architecture design and getting to implement (and debug) Python code in Webots.",
                "Yes, since the course material is quite interesting, and Scaz is a great instructor.",
                "Totally! Super fun and learned a lot. With only three problem sets, two exams, and a final project, the workload wasn't exacting either.",
                "Yes! It is a really fun course that introduces a lot of great concepts in robotics and AI, and how the industry impacts society. It is very low workload and manageable for beginners, so I would definitely recommend for anyone interested in robotics.",

                "YES!!! If you are thinking about this course, even if you're not really familiar with computer science, you should take it if you have the opportunity. This is one of those classes where you just cannot get the same knowledge by reading a book about the subject."
