                "I think this course is more about the experience of taking it than the knowledge you gain. That being said, I learned how to approach modernist works and how to write more confidently.",
                "My writing and literary analytical skills developed tremendously, as well as my knowledge of the Western canon.  Professor Spitz offers wonderful commentary on our papers and encourages students to share their real opinions and discuss their thoughts and emotional responses.  We also had a small introduction to art history and its interaction with literature, which I greatly enjoyed.",
                "Became more fluent in modern Western literature",
                "This was my favorite Literature class I have taken so far at Yale, and it's in part because Professor Spitz encourages students not to over-analyze literature. When you approach a text purely from an analytical lens, and lose sight of how a text makes you feel, you lose sight of what makes reading literature so enjoyable. Thus Professor Spitz encourages students to really allow themselves to feel emotions as they read and think about how the relationships and human experiences depicted in the texts relate to their own lived experiences. I really learned how to grapple with character's psychology this semester, how to connect what we read to art and music of the time, and to really immerse myself in the lives of these characters in order to try and empathize with them. I also learned how to discern why characters were motivated to act in the way that they did -- what emotions drove their actions? I also learned how to write personal essays that are based around my experience reading a particular text. That was something I had never done before! Another cool thing that I learned was how to prepare and lead a literature seminar discussion. Professor Spitz has every student in the class lead one discussion, and it was a really cool thing to learn how to pick passages and themes that would help foster discussion among my peers.",
                "I learned how to critically engage with a work of literature and to write a paper which synthesized analytical and personal writing.",
                "My appreciation for the beauty of literature and the joy of literary analysis certainly grew. I also improved my writing skills and came to appreciate the value of writing essays in a less constricted and more natural way. The course allowed me to see literature less as an academic subject and more as an art.",
                "Deep insight into the texts, but more importantly, how to love and be a good person. This course made me think about who I am and how I engage within the world. I developed profound insights into relationships, caring for one another, love, mistakes, regret, and loved how it ventured into artwork as well.",
                "I gained a much deeper understanding of Modernism in literature and the prevailing themes and issues which define writing in that era. I also became a more confident writer, especially with respect to expressing my own impressions and beliefs about the text in a manner that is more personal than writing a traditional essay.",
                "I significantly improved my writing skills, but I also learned how to write in a more personal, authentic way that enhances my engagement with the texts I read. I encountered diverse literature, from Tolstoy to Wordsworth."

            "comments": [
                "This course has an incredible reading list. We could easily spend 3-4 weeks if not more on each book, so the pace can be challenging. But the point is to give you a foundation in reading great literature from Cervantes' age to the 20th century while still enjoying the reading along the way. The course absolutely accomplishes this goal.",
                "I think cutting part 2 of Don Quixote from the reading list would be a great success.",
                "The course contains some of my favorite books I've ever read, and the essay opportunities and their prompts are super engaging.  Having been exposed to the art history aspect, I wish some of the DS curriculum could be made a tad bit more interdisciplinary, interacting with some other related fields.",
                "Honestly I cannot think of any weaknesses of this course. Perhaps to spend longer on To the Lighthouse but of course that is not possible!\r\n\r\nIn terms of strengths, I think Professor Spitz does a really great job of teaching literature because she knows these texts so intimately and also loves them so much! Her love for the texts and her enthusiasm really shone through in her teaching, and made me love these texts all the more. I write about the course's strengths in all of my other responses and don't want to repeat myself, but definitely look to my other responses for more details!",
                "Strengths -- covers a lot of ground; interesting books\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- sometimes we do not have enough time on particular works",
                "The greatest strength was the overall enthusiasm, encouragement, and kindness of the professors in the literature department. Every lecture and discussion section was engaging and gave me the sense that the professors truly wanted to share the joy of literature with us. The only weakness that I could think of is that the amount of assigned reading often felt very overwhelming.",
                "Simply wonderful, Ellen Handler-Spitz is such a kind, wise person I feel like I learn simply by hearing her speak and letting the words rush over me. Sometimes, however, it would have been nice to have more direction in the discussion as the students would get off track.",
                "The course is well-structured overall. Certain reading assignments were slightly overwhelming at times, but the generally speaking the workload was balanced and very educational.",
                "Strengths: I feel that Directed Studies Literature in the spring is much more diverse than the fall in terms of the texts and authors that we read. We got exposed to authors writing in various key moments throughout world history, spanning different times and geographies. This diversity fosters an intellectual rigor, and the process of grappling with the texts is a challenging but rewarding process. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of. I would have liked to have spent more time on certain texts, but overall, I have no complaints about DS Literature. It is simply magical."

                "Yes! Really enjoyed DS",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course (and DS in general) to another student! DS is the best -- you really get to know your professors and students well, and that's something I found to be particularly true about Professor Spitz's class this semester. The class really felt bonded together like a family, and I think that's in part because Professor Spitz made students feel comfortable to share personal experiences with the class. Often times, students would discuss how a text led them to recall a particular memory from their own lives, or perhaps how a relationship explored in one of the texts reminded them of a dynamic between people in their own lives. These moments helped bring the class closer together, and they would not have occurred if Professor Spitz had not been so warm towards her students and so receptive to what students wanted to discuss in seminar. \r\n\r\nI loved Professor Spitz's class so much that I am taking another class with her in the fall!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I believe that the books we read really made me think more deeply about the role of literature in the world and how I interact with it.",
                "Yes. It gave me a solid knowledge of several seminal texts, it broadened my understanding of literature and literary analysis, and it was simply enjoyable to read literature with and learn from such an enthusiastic and kind professor.",
                "Yea!! You read amazing texts and there's a great balance between lecture and seminar.",
                "I certainly would. The course provides valuable background for understanding our contemporary culture and appreciating various literary styles. It also is a good opportunity to improve your writing.",
                "PLEASE. TAKE. DS. There is only one word to describe it: MAGICAL. After taking DS, I look back with tears at all the amazing memories I've made with friends I cherish. DS is not only a course of study, but also a family. Your professors and fellow students will push you to become not only a better student, but a better critical thinker and person."
