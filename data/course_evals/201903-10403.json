   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "improved skills in Adobe, expanded knowledge of design principles, basics of urban representation",
    "I learned a lot about how cities interact with their landscape and are influenced by nature. I also improved my photoshop and indesign skills",
    "Too many - as the format of the class was an iterative one building towards a final project in the form of a graphic novel, there were many skills to develop along the way, but plenty of support and time to develop them.",
    "I learned a lot about how cities work spatially.  I also learned how to use Photoshop and Illustrator, and was reminded of how to draw.  In general, my visual-spatial analytical skills were sharpened through this course.",
    "i learned a lot of fundamental parts and definitions of architectural work like plans, sections, sectional collages, and transects. i also learned a lot about what it means to examine things and institutions spatially and how its spatial elements impact other things like social, political, economic, and environmental aspects. i also learned a bit about how to use adobe applications like photoshop and illustrator.",
    "Technical-skill wise, I've learned how to use mostly photoshop better, but also illustrator. Architecturally, this class really focuses on the collage as the mode of representation, which can be really powerful. I've of course learned more about New Orleans and about New Haven, not necessarily from a historical perspective, but Anthony's own knowledge and background lent more to an infrastructural and social understanding. With portions of this class involving field-work, you get experience honing skills of observation, although they weren't guided very much. In making a comic book, you get to try your hand in story-telling through space and the difficulties of writing a narrative about the city.",
    "I learned how to use photoshop and illustrator to greater effect. I learned how to imagine and represent a space creatively and in many mediums of representation, as well as how to infuse a representation with a para-fictional narrative.",
    "I learned about how to articulate idea spatially, and visually, using models, and iterative experimental exercises. I also learned how to use InDesign with greater confidence, PhotoShop and Illustrator.",
    "Urban Lab is a junior studio class for Urban Studies majors. Not a requirement to be in the major, our class had people from a range of different fields: Environmental Studies, Computing and the Arts, etc. Each week you do different assignments (some drawings, transects, collages, section cuts, etc.) with the final project being a graphic novel. We look at two cities and their relationship with water: New Haven and New Orleans and got to go on a field trip to New Orleans during October break. Over the course of the semester, you learn how to conduct fieldwork, look at cities critically, and represent stories visually and spatially. We do pin-ups and critiques with both our professors, peers, and outside critics so you have a lot of opportunities to stand by your work and present it. Because we have assignments due every week, it can get a bit hectic and overwhelming if you don't start early. However, it gives you lots of work to add to your portfolio!",
    "How to visualise and conceptualise cities and the environment surrounding them.",
    "I became more comfortable using Photoshop, Illustrator, and Indesign during the course (also learn a little about how to make a book!). This course really pushed me to think about methods of visualization for urban issues outside of just writing.",
    "writing reviews for architecture studios is just impossible. this class is like being strapped to a rocket with nothing but a fist full of pens and crumpled tracing paper which you stole form the urban lab space on the third day and then blasted into the sun where a disembodied voice calls you to hallucinate through an experience simply as bonkers. You then you open your eyes and you find that on the other side of the sun the arch studio kids have already transcended into hyperdense blocks of instant coffee and charcoal and now communication only in rhino boolean unions, but Anthony's kind guiding hand comforts you that this is normal and your hallucinations will come to something, something that perhaps can only be understood by falling into a unusually deep puddle at 5:46am on the walkway by the afam house and Loria, but something that can be understood."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "trip to NOLA was awesome, instructors\/TAs were quite helpful\/enthusiastic, and theme of cities on the \"margin\" was interesting\r\n\r\ncourse could be improved with more assignments around specific skill-building (like first one for figure-ground drawings and one for transects)",
    "One weakness was that I felt like we did not receive feedback often enough. Some reviews for the first few projects, my work wasn't even seen by the professors. For many of the reviews for the final comic book we were given 5 minutes with the professors and I would often leave very confused and have to go to the TAs to decipher their advice.",
    "The iterative process of production and learning is both a blessing and curse. You learn a lot week to week but progress has to be constant and your skills have to have developed from one studio meeting to the next.",
    "This course was really intense.  Each week seemed like an insurmountable challenge, but we all somehow rose to the occasion, only to be pushed even further the following week.  That in and of itself was a good experience, albeit a frustrating and challenging one at times.  The real strength of the course was the other students -- they were all incredibly invested and knowledgeable and came from very diverse academic backgrounds.  We became close as a class and it was really rewarding to see all of their work and learn from them.  I wish the professors had leveraged the incredible array of knowledge and talents that were present in the classroom -- they didn't really do this, in my opinion.  Also, the course got very arts-and-craftsy at a certain point, in a way that was incredibly time consuming and not always, in my opinion, the most worthwhile.  I felt like I didn't learn very much about \"urbanism\" itself, and instead spent a lot of time somewhat arbitrarily drawing, collaging, and fumbling through photoshop.  The trip to New Orleans was jam-packed with pretty exhausting walking tours -- we met up with some interesting people, but the specific things that they guided us through felt a little too narrow.  The trip felt like it only had incredibly structured and narrow group activities, or entirely unstructured time.  It might've been nice to have something in the middle.  The trip was really great, though, overall -- it was interesting to meet up with local activists, architects, city planners, etc., and it was a great opportunity to learn from and get to know the fellow students.",
    "strengths: you learn a lot and get a lot of opportunity to develop your skills, the trip to new orleans is a really fun opportunity but also pretty vital to your success in the final project, the reimbursements and largely paid-for fall break trip are what made the course financially ccessible for me, you get close to your classmates, the TAs were great\r\n\r\nweaknesses: didn't feel like we always got that much clear and directional feedback which was hard to reconcile with us being graded at the end for everything we do but not as we turned it in, didn't get to see each other's work as much in the latter half of the course",
    "Readings in the beginning of the course did not lead to great discussions in class or in sectiton and then we sort of just stopped reading in the second-half of the course so maybe structuring that differently and more continuously could be better. I also think there needed to be more time for full-class pin ups rather than just individual feedback as I wasn't able to connect with my classmates and their work as much as I like to in studio classes. I also think there needs to be readings and discussion on the ethics of field work either in the first weeks of class or sprinkled throughout. As for strengths, Anthony and Brian were both really smart professors and gave good feedback on work. The content is great and I think the comic book assignment is so worthwhile.",
    "Integrating reading into curriculum during the latter weeks. Having more incentive to start the final projects early. Less iteration, given all students are enrolled in many other courses. Some teacher feedback was hard to integrate.",
    "Strengths: engaged professors, awesome guest professors, supportive and diverse classroom environment, it feels good to be able to create something every week, supportive TAs that help with any questions you have, so much fun to be able to see the amazing work your peers get to complete, opportunities to speak and learn how to present your work, you can really shape your projects to be about whatever you care about! this class equips with the tools and community to seek that out, cool lectures & diverse learning material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Wish there was more time to get specific feedback (I know that our class size was pretty big, but classtime in the later half of the semester was a lot of waiting around, and a rush to make sure that everyone's work got to get reviewed). In retrospect, I see how the class does a good job of building up to our final assignment and preparing us through different activities. However, in the midst of the journey it was a bit confusing and also hard to predict what would happen next (eg. finding out we have one more week to work on an assignment). Maybe that's part of the fun of taking this class though. Required readings and sections were sometimes a lot to pair with the weekly assignments",
    "Very interesting material, cool and demanding projects, a lot of time spent one on one with the professor. Cons: for the final project, 2 weeks were spent with very little feedback on our work, so when we started producing drafts a lot of fundamental changes had to be made quickly, which was stressful.",
    "Strengths: the New Orleans trip was really fun! The assignments sometimes felt like a lot of work each week, but each one was really designed to set you up for the next one and to build your skills slowly throughout the course. The reviews are non-traditional and structured really well to maximize feedback while not being as intimidating (you meet in small groups with critics and other students and its a conversation more than a critique). \r\nWeaknesses: Even with the assignments building on each other, some weeks were really a crash-course in a program if you had no prior experience (and required a lot of outside time to figure them out). At the start of the comic book project, there also wasn't a lot of time allotted for simply reading about and discussing the city's history (I would have liked to have more time to research the city and learn more before just picking a topic and diving in).",
    "Would love more work on drawing conventions and developing our own style. More creative projects with more specific details would help guide us on our rocket launch I swear just give me helmet please"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course because the work required you to really think outside of the box. I also think it was such and incredible opportunity to be able to go to New Orleans and actually see what we were studying first hand.",
    "A great class for Urban Studies major and being able to study both New Haven and New Orleans in depth makes it a unique experience. Be warned it is 1.5 credits for a good reason, but is very manageable if you are organised.",
    "I would recommend this course if you really want to be there and are really interested in urban studies.  It's a big commitment and will kind of consume your life, but the people you meet are 100% worth it.  The skills you gain are kind of worth it.",
    "i would to anyone who's an architecture or urban studies major, but i'm not sure if i'd recommend it to people outside of those majors. i'm outside of the major and i did love the course, but it ended up being a much bigger commitment than i expected and it felt odd that it was something mandatory for the major for almost everyone else besides myself and a couple others. the level of knowledge you came in with felt a little uneven. but overall it was a very rewarding class and despite the heavy workload, i'm glad i took it and generally recommend others to take it too.",
    "Yes, but be careful. I spent many many all nighters with this course. Take it if you have friends in the course to stay up late with. In all seriousness.",
    "Yes!! Very unique course.",
    "Yes! Take this class! But be prepared to spend lots and lots of time. My Thanksgiving break was spent working (or at least thinking) about the graphic novel, it is really really important to manage your time. You learn a lot about how you work, how you handle unexpected situations (everyone had at least 1 printer fiasco), and how to prioritize. Anthony, Brian, Manasi, and Brenna are amazing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it if you enjoy thinking about cities, working in design applications (photoshop, illustrator etc) and drawing.",
    "Overall, I would recommend this course! (although if you aren't an urban studies major and are just looking for an fun course, I don't know if this is the one to pick). It's a lot of work each week - the additional 0.5 credit translates into a lot of extra work - but it introduces you to programs that are really valuable skills to have for urban studies\/architecture majors (photoshop, illustrator, indesign). And I think Prof. Acciavatti is very intentional about how each week is structured to prepare you for the next and how the reviews are structured to give you lots of different feedback. And you get a paid trip to New Orleans!",
    "you will learn by failing. don't know how much more I can say. if you come ready to work and ready to be compassionate with yourself you could probably find a very good balance in this place. but be ready. cuz we are going for ride."
