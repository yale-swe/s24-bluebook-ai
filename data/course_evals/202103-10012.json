                "understanding of basic feminist and queer theory, knowledge of prominent women's studies scholars, higher-level understanding of the many factors (race, gender, age, ability) that factor into the concept of consent, writing about gender and consent",
                "I learned a lot about the ways in which consent operates legally and culturally. I was also exposed to a feminist theory and texts that I hadn't read beforehand.",
                "I gained a more thorough understanding of what consent means and the breadth of factors that can complicate it. I learned various theories and perspectives on consent and learned to consider many angles before labeling a situation.",
                "I learned about sexual consent through the eyes of the law, through policy, and through cultural analysis.",
                "frameworks of thinking with and about consent, the advantages and pitfalls of different metrics with which to adjudicate sexual wellness and erotic flourishing like sexual autonomy, force, exploitation... We considered too: how do you tackle questions of taboo, like incest, or necrophilia, or extreme BDSM, legally, and morally?",
                "I greatly improved my skill in close reading dense texts. I learned to think about consent as only one important component of sexual ethics. I also developed a better understanding of the difference between legality and morality in adjudicating sexual misconduct.",
                "This is definitely in my top two or three classes Ive ever taken at Yale. Grounded in history and law, and cut with joy & creativity. I learned about erotic flourishing and sharpened as well as challenged my conception of the world.",
                "I learned a lot about different challenges around legal consent but also how to think critically about why we have different consent assumptions for different people. I learned a lot about what the actual harms of different blurred lines around consent, and feel like I have the tools and language to talk about issues that I felt or knew about but didn't know how to engage with previously.",

                "There are no weaknesses. Strengths include the every other week discussion posts + cold calling to keep students accountable, reading materials, mixed media readings for the class",
                "The concepts that this course touched on were all pretty interesting, and by the end of the semester, I felt like I had learned quite a lot about consent. Professor Fischel is also very passionate about the class and about the subject matter, so that's a big plus. \r\n\r\nMy biggest critique would be that the reading load is fairly heavy, especially for a class that teaches theory (which tends to be a bit dense). We sometimes didn't get through all of the readings during our class discussions. A slightly lighter reading load would probably allow for deeper engagement with the texts. \r\n\r\nAll in all, however, this is a good class.",
                "The course is perfectly organized. Its best strength is the refreshing variety of sources not only in terms of representation\/the diversity represented in the authors, but in the type of media. Ive never had a class that combined theory, articles, legal cases, podcasts, TV episodes, and more. It made it so the class accommodated something for every learning style and also showcased how the concepts we were learning about manifest in actuality rather than restricting our discussions to the theoretical. Additionally, the alternating weeks with groups made it so that it was okay to get by successfully if you had an off-week and put the ball more in the students court in terms of time management, which felt amazing.",
                "Strength: Very engaging material, Prof. Fischel is very knowledgable and well connected to the authors we read which adds a great layer to class discussion, Prof. Fischel was also very open to class feedback which was great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A couple readings were a bit dense, midterm and final essay project have questions that are a bit complex and long (leave less room for student creativity) but with support from Prof Fischel and our TF they were answerable",
                "This course is incredibly strong. The readings are all fascinating, and often, not super long too... Some of the legal theory gets a little heavy, but it is well worth the effort.",
                "The workload was backloaded in a way that made the second half far more intense than the second, and the final assignments were overwhelming. On the whole, though, the course was very very interesting and engaging, and I learned a lot in terms of content and skills.",
                "STRENGTHS: I looked forward to each week's readings because the syllabus was super well-crafted. It pulled from feminist theory, creative nonfiction, podcasts, news articles, and case law. Professor Fischel and Isabel's feedback on assignments was thorough, which helped me develop careful arguments about dense texts. The biweekly discussion posts were never burdensome. They were a helpful opportunity to clarifying my thoughts on the week's material and consider questions that my peers were raising. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: We could have received more guidance about expectations for the response papers. Some guiding questions or even some examples would have been helpful. Professor Fischel tried to give each student a chance to speak, but I noticed that some students were called on far more than others. Sometimes students were clearly not listening to their peers, either. Perhaps future iterations of the course could establish classroom \"norms\" about genuinely listening to classmates, which would make for a more supportive learning environment.",
                "Certain weeks (in TPSC I am thinking of sex in public & inappositeness) could have benefited from a piece that tied the readings together more thoroughly \/ a paragraph from Joe tying it together. However, each class period brought the readings together quite well. The arc of the class is also great and I remember being blown away at the degree of complexity we were engaging in by the end having conversations we were TOTALLY unprepared for, collectively, at the beginning. Insane. I also read the discussion posts every week and was always touched by the thoughtfulness and creativity of my fellow students.",
                "Strengths - interesting conversation that is very applicable to the world around us! Fascinating topic and you definitely learn about useful tools and read about helpful concepts. Fischel super excited about the course\r\nWeakness - doesn't really help your writing at all because assignments are sporadic papers and not a ton of feedback on them. Sometimes class felt too popcorn and scattered because we only met once a week, so we had so much to fit in into one class (cause we'd read lots of papers each week that all had to be discussed)",

                "Yes. It was INCREDIBLE. Anyone and everyone should take this class to understand a basic concept of everyone's life better. A great experience in normalizing talking about sex and gender and understanding consent.",
                "Yes! My only warning is that the content, by nature, can sometimes be a bit intense, but the Professor does a great job of warning and not spending too much time in the material that can be particularly triggering. If youre at all interested in the topic, take it!",
                "Yes, , the content feels very important for people of all ages and creates a framework for ppl to think about sexual relationships in their own lives. Of course, as the name of the course implies the content is sensitive. But if you are interested in the topic, I would definitely recommend.",
                "I would highly recommend this to every Yale student. In fact, I'd say it's a must take class for everyone.",
                "Absolutely! The premise of the class is really interesting and each weeks topic forces you to consider something else about sex and morality.",
                "Absolutely! It is challenging, but Professor Fischel is supportive and discussions were NEVER boring.",
                "Hell yes. For the sake of everyone else be prepared to do the readings!!! But the style of splitting the class into two groups meant that every other week was a bit easier you only have to do a discussion post \/ are on call for your week. But for anyone who is worried about this, the class is nuanced and bold and creative. Were not supposed to invoke specific personal experiences in class which goes a long way towards making this a safe & warm but very academic class; limits opportunity for projection \/ ad hominem even during difficult convos. Extremely intellectually rigorous.",
                "YES. This class was wonderful. It was my earliest class, and every Thursday I rolled out of bed wondering where I would find the energy to participate, but then I got to class and was absorbed and entranced by the conversation. I felt myself wanting to snap and clap at the brilliant comments and observations my classmates made and proud of the comments they had led me to form. Every Thursday, I walked out of class feeling energized and excited for the day, even after a 2-hour seminar. The readings are somewhat dense but you'll want to read them and take notes on them. You'll find yourself highlighting them and crying during a few of them and often feeling angry about the kind of unwanted sex so many of us have and what sex has come to mean. You won't necessarily walk away with answers, but that's ok. There is beauty in describing a world where sex isn't so scary, where people's wishes and boundaries are both respected, where we question why and how sex is special, and we recognize the power and pressure we both have and face when it comes to our bodies.",
                "Yes. You're definitely learning about relevant, important topics that everyone should consider. To be honest it was less of a framework creating class, like many of my other WGSS classes, which I had a hard time with, because I like when WGSS classes teach me to look at the world in a new way, through different perspective, but this class was more just reading a lot of stuff and discussing it with less obvious of a through-line or connecting bit.",
                "i would not recommend this class as a 5th class. i would recommend this course if you have the additional time to engage with lofty theoretical material and you are someone who is interested in the theory and politics of sexual consent."
