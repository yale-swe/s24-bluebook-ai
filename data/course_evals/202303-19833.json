I wish I could have her as my Spanish teacher for the rest of my time at Yale. I have never been more excited about attending a morning class. She is the epitome of what Yale should and strives to be.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was our in-class \"lectures\" and discussions. The class format made it easier to break down Spanish concepts, and it facilitated good discussion and practice. The biggest weakness of the class was the speed at which we needed to learn new terms and vocabulary. While I understand that the course is designed to teach a lot in a short period, it is very easy to fall behind if you don't study every day.",
                "The only weakness I can think of is the virtual day where I would often not do any of the work until much later in the evening. However, I felt that the seminar like environment of the class along with the professor made this class fantastic."
