            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course was the ways in which the material was made more approachable through the tests but the weakness lies in the fact that the homework was consistently so difficult that recitation with the TAs followed by OH with Dr. Loewenberg were necessary in order to fully understand the material. I would also say that although class time was quite helpful, there were moments where I was unable to understand the connection between the material we were doing vs the homework. The introduction of Mathematica although helpful in giving examples of applications of the material, it was hard to use it myself in the homeworks.",
                "Strengths: The material is honestly not that difficult, the teaching was the issue.\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook discusses a lot of unnecessary stuff, as textbooks are wont to do.",
                "Problem sets were very difficult, and the TAs helped but sometimes they were also lost and confused, which is understandable as it is really easy to make one small mistake and mess up the entire rest of the problem. I feel like there were also many times that everyone in the class had no idea what was going on, but the professor Dr. Loewenberg did a great job of trying his best to explain things slowly and clearly.",
                "Professor Loewenberg is one of the kindest professors you'll have the pleasure of meeting so he's definitely the strength of this course. He genuinely cares about students and is a really wonderful person to interact with. Our TAs were also awesome and willing to go over PSETS on a weekly basis.",
                "Strengths: Loewenberg and the TAs were nice about answering questions, but their responses could be opaque. Another strength is that Loewenberg knows hes not the best lecturer so he compensates by giving easy test problems? But honestly this should be a negative. Its kind of comical for a course to have a reputation of lacking enough clarity that the exams are intentionally designed to cover less complex material. I guess thats fine if youre just chasing the grade, but not so much if you want to walk away from this course with a real sense of achievement and actually feel like you learned a lot about transport phenomena.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the use cases and assumptions behind problem solving techniques should be made more clear, the lectures do not feel set up for learning, and the pset solutions and practice problems often skip so many steps as to be practically indecipherable.",
                "The course is very well organized and taught. Going through examples and practice problems in class is particularly helpful. PSETs are well-designed and facilitate applying concepts from lectures. In the future, it could be helpful to have a few practice problems similar to those given before the exam assigned each week, along with the PSET, as it may be easier to first apply concepts to simpler problems and then to more complicated ones.",
                "We worked problems in class in small groups and that really helped solidify the material"

                "I would not really recommend this course. If taught by Prof Loewenberg its at least more pleasant but the material is difficult. The psets in this class are a lot and the material is super confusing so the tests are really hard to prepare for. You're probably ChemE and have to take this class anyways so good luck and just try your best.",
                "Only if required.",
                "Definitely don't take this course unless you have to, but if you have to, Dr. Loewenberg has taught it better than others in the past based on what I've heard.",
                "Heat transport is hard and confusing but if you can take it with Loewenberg do it!",
                "Not if it isn't necessary for your major - sorry chemical engineers. I find it difficult to recommend this course as taught by Loewenberg. Lectures are rarely engaging, and its pretty discouraging to have attended practically every one and still feel like 70% of the time I just had no idea what Loewenberg was doing. The psets are so far removed from lecture that there is no way to figure out the solutions without going to office hours. Which, weirdly, is the way Loewenberg seems to have set up the class because every week in OHs the TAs would just walk through all of the problems in the pset from start to finish (at that point, why are they even psets? Just publish them as worked examples, and give us problems of similar difficulty to do on our own and go to office hours for help). The office hour recordings would take 4-6 hours to watch, and the recordings almost never gave justification for the solutions provided and were often filled with ambiguities and errors.\r\nThe prof and the TAs kept emphasizing throughout the semester that they knew how difficult this class was, but the irony is that the difficulty stemmed more from the ambiguity of their teaching than the inherent difficulty of the concepts. Loewenberg is knowledgeable and tries his best, but the disorganization of this course seriously made me rethink the rigor of my chemical engineering education at this school during several points in the semester. Im writing this review because I still believe transport has the potential to be an interesting\/inspiring class, and I sincerely hope the department can reflect on the structure and organization of this course to ensure future engineering students learn about this field in a way that helps them acquire valuable skills and sets them up for success.",
                "I would recommend this course, as it provides fundamental information on transport phenomena and discusses interesting problems."
