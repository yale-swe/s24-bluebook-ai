                "We addressed various foreign policy events and concepts since Truman's use of the bomb in WWII. We spent considerable time understanding the human dynamics at play and how important interpersonal relationships are. Additionally, many of our writing assignments emphasized an economy of prose.",
                "Through taking this course, I learned about American foreign policy from the presidency of Truman to current day. I leave with a richer understanding of US foreign policy making, a deeper knowledge of the people behind those decisions, and a renewed interest in American foreign policy. A fabulous course!",
                "I learned to discuss foreign policy decisions from Truman to Biden, write two-page memos, read large volumes of material per week, and work effectively in a group to write our final paper. I also made really close friends who always amazed me with their perspectives in class. Learning how they and Howard see the world was the best part of the class!",
                "We learned about the history of big decisions in American Foreign Policy, from LBJ to the present. The course is pretty grounded in recent history. We also learn ways to approach foreign policy decisions. Howard reminds us about the \"retrospectoscope\" -- in other words, the idea that we get to view world history with the benefit of hindsight, while the actual actors in those days did not.",
                "US and world history; US foreign policy strategies over the past century; writing; group work; presenting/oral communication",
                "I learned more about the history of American foreign policy, particularly in the early and mid twentieth century.",
                "A deeper critical understanding of American foreign policy gained through a great reading list and class discussions. We also learned how to write succinct policy memos."

            "comments": [
                "Very few weaknesses in this course. Biggest complaint is that the class isn't long enough; many of our discussions could easily go an hour longer. Very well structured. Readings were reasonable in length and the in-class discussion was generally fantastic. Professor Dean is top tier.",
                "This course was absolutely incredible. The syllabus was well conceptualized, class discussions were riveting, and all of the work/assignments felt purposeful. Not a weakness to think of!",
                "Getting to know Howard and the other students in the class was by far the highlight of the class. I looked forward to class every week, and we always talked about interesting things. Howard is really accessible, so if you have any big ideas about the course material or anything else, he is ready to listen and provide his thoughts on the issue. I also really enjoyed the books and readings that were assigned throughout the semester, and I feel like I have a far better grasp of the era now. Another strength of the classwhich students should be prepared for when they applyis the diversity of thought among students in the class. Discussions sometimes became quite contentious, but in the way that provokes good thought and dialogue.",
                "Strengths: Howard is really fun, engaging, and genuinely cares about his students. The readings are interesting, the guests are eloquent and accomplished, and the workload isn't too bad. The students also bring unique perspectives, and I learned a lot just from sitting back and listening to them. Howard really challenges his students and isn't afraid to share his own views, but he always listens to and believes in each one of us. Every student left this class more knowledgable about the world and more aware of nuanced perspectives.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The final group project can be a bit of a pain, and isn't relevant to the work we do throughout the semester. The reading load can sometimes be too heavy.",
                "Governor Dean is fantastic. It's a very different course than most at Yale. There's a strong emphasis on teamwork and getting to know the other people in the class. Governor Dean is also really generous with his time. He's really available to meet and chat with students about what they're doing.",
                "This class provides a great overview of US foreign policy as understood by key figures in US history. Unfortunately as US history has been dominated by white men, so is the syllabus. It would be great to include a greater diversity of perspectives in the syllabus. Class readings were too much to take on individually but reading groups were unstructured and made it difficult to tackle the reading with others, so by the end of the semester I did not engage as much with the readings as in the beginning of the semester.",
                "Strengths- interesting classmates, good readings, great conversations, low stress\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- I wish professor dean would speak more and share his insights; I also wish class discussions were more guided- they tend to stray from the reading topic pretty quickly.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was the opportunity to learn alongside some of the most interesting Yale individuals that I've had the fortune to meet. Howard emphasized teamwork through reading groups, the NSC simulation, and final paper, which I really appreciated, and he pushed us to refine our thinking and convey our ideas clearly through oral presentations and writing assignments. \r\nFor next year, I do think it would be helpful if the class discussions stuck closer to the readings, because we tended to get off topic which made it more difficult to contribute. Sometimes the grading also felt somewhat arbitrary but I appreciate Howard's willingness to work with us, including meeting with each group for the final paper."

                "100%! Howard's course was easily one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. If you are interested in American history, foreign policy, or politics, this course is for you. Not only is Howard an incredible professor, but as an undergraduate, having graduate students in the class was an invaluable learning experience.",
                "Yes! By far the most fun class I've taken at Yale! What could be better than getting to know a great group of people over an interesting set of booksespecially when office hours inevitably feature crepes or coffee? Howard also gives really great, prompt feedback on all of your assignments, which I really appreciated in adapting to writing the two-page memos. Bottom line: apply, and if you don't get in the first time, apply again!",
                "Yes!! This course is perfect because you get out what you put into it. If you don't do the readings, it won't necessarily hurt your grade, but it will hurt your appreciation of the class and decrease how much you learn and grow from it. Howard is a really chill professor and will work his butt off to support you and your personal growth. Take the class for Howard -- he has so many unique insights into the world of foreign policy and is all-around a great mentor. The creperie where he holds office hours is lovely too.",
                "Absolutely. It's one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "This is an amazing course, but not for the standard reasons. It is a great course, not because of the challenging material or that it \"changes your life\", but because of the community of the class. What made this course amazing was the people selected to participate  and Howard himself. It is not the most academically challenging class (although the combination of the reading list and graduate students makes for some incredible conversations, some of the best, intellectually challenging conversations I've witnessed at Yale), but it is the best community-focused class I've taken at Yale. Howard interviews every candidate for the class personally, and hand-selects a really diverse, well-rounded class. If you get into it, you should take it, for tons of reasons  not least compelling of which is Howard, himself. He is who he is, and still remains the most engaged professor I've ever had at Yale. He held weekly office hours buying students food, hosted dinners for the class, and made himself incredibly available to his students. In my book, he is one of the best, most community-oriented, most helpful, most generous, and most knowledgeable professors at Yale.",
                "Yes, the readings were interesting as were the class discussions",
