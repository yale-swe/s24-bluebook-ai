                "This course provided the foundational knowledge and skills needed to dissect, evaluate, and understand grammatical concepts used to read Middle Egyptian Hieroglyphs through a study of language, culture, and history. This course not only provided the class with a survey and in-depth study of the basic sentence structures of Ancient Egyptians but also offered perspective on how grammatical structures are applied in modern languages such as English, Hebrew, Arabic, French, and German. One of the most exciting opportunities was to study actual Ancient Egyptian materials at the Yale Art Gallery and decipher their meanings.",

                "We learned the basics of reading Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs",
                "I knew virtually nothing about hieroglyphics apart from the relationship to Egypt. This course not only taught me the fundamentals of hieroglyphics but also its importance and cultural significance in the past and today.",
                "This course taught me the foundations of the transliteration and translation of hieroglyphic Egyptian, as well as provided insights into the culture of ancient Egypt during the Middle Kingdom.",
                "Learned the basics of reading hieroglyphics, a very solid amount of grammar, and some cool Ancient Egyptian history. Was very cool and satisfying to be able to read real tablets!"

                "The strengths of this course include excellent instruction, lesson planning, and course content; accessible materials with ample opportunities for office hours to assist with difficult concepts; and enriching class events, guest lecturers, and field trips. I do not have a critique for weaknesses.",
                "One of the strengths of the course were that the text book was very in depth on the content we covered, making it easy to study independently (which is necessary given the difficulty that learning hieroglyphs can pose). Another is that Professor Morel was truly excellent and cared deeply for his students.",
                "There is a lot of material to cover and at times it felt as though we were rushing through the curriculum rather than going at an understanding pace. I would say that the pacing should be improved. Other than that, the class was very enjoyable and informative!",
                "This course had excellent instruction and provided many opportunities to work on actual pieces written in hieroglyphic egyptian.",

Although Middle Egyptian is not a common language today, its study has broadened my understanding of English and other modern languages.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wishes to learn ancient Egyptian. I would caution against taking it just as an \"interesting\" language course- it's fair to want to take it out of interest but just be aware that you will be engaging with a whole ancient language and all the grammar/vocab/ memorization that comes with that process, and if it's your first time learning an ancient language it might be more work than what you think.",
                "If you are interested in learning about hieroglyphs then yes! I found it to be very cool to have insight into the minds of people who lived thousands of years ago through the study of their language.",
                "I would recommend this course; hieroglyphic Egyptian is such an interesting language, and the way it was taught in this course was done so well.",
                "100% -- it was very enjoyable and interesting. I'm probably majoring in STEM and mostly took this class to just try something new and different and it was totally worth it."
