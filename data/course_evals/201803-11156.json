    "I learned so much about how our Earth works. What's really cool is that the class covers different topics every week, like oxygenation and meteors, so you never get bored and are always learning something new, although we did only scratch the surface of many topics. But we wrote two papers, and I got to explore two topics I was really interested in more and become an expert!",
    "I learned about current science topics ranging from extinctions to meteorites. Each week there is a different topic by a different lecturer and you gain insight to a small specific topic and then move to the next. Its a great way to gain basic knowledge of a range of environmental topics.",
    "I learned how to comprehend and analyze complex research papers in a variety of topics related to environmental studies. I also gained a number of perspectives on the plethora of issues facing the modern world and the factors that led to the creation of the global systems humans live within.",
    "Learned about writing research papers in college great practice!\r\nLearned about reading and understanding complicated peer reviewed science articles\r\nReceived a broad overview about many fascinating environmental studies\/G&G topics",
    "I learned how to read and understand scientific papers. I also developed the skills to write my own research paper based on other's findings.",
    "I gained foundational knowledge in environmental science and Earth's history. Although the scope of the course was broad, the depth of each subject depended on how much I wanted to engage with it. For me, that's an ideal class. Also, I learned how to read (read: skim) scientific papers and write scientific papers.",
    "I learned how to read jargon-filled scientific papers, ask informed questions of experts, and write about and discuss relevant earth science topics.",
    "This course teaches students, especially those not with a science background, how to engage with scientific literature focused on the environment.",
    "This class teaches you to work through and more easily understand academic papers. I developed a greater awareness of environmental issues and solutions through discussion as a supplement to the papers.",
    "I learned how to understand the big takeaways from dense scientific literature. I learned something new about each of the topics we focused on each week, retaining the most information about the topics that engaged me the most which were urban planning, fracking, and my term papers.",
    "A brief overview of a lot of scientific research fields; familiarity with reading scientific papers.",
    "I learned about a wide variety of natural processes and phenomena.",
    "Learnt about a range of topics and issues around the world I was not previously aware of."

   "comments": [
    "The guest lecturers each week were great, and our assignments were engaging but not too demanding. I think during class discussion, it got monotonous sometimes when students would repeat the same things over and over or only talk about social impacts rather than investigating the science. I wish the class could somehow encourage students to look at these factors more and to ramble less.",
    "The lecturers are not necessarily always engaging - its more of a hit or miss. The weekly papers rarely have anything to do with the lecture and the weekly summaries we have to do on them are done with a partner, which is not ideal. However, the topics covered in this class are very interesting and no other course will allow you to gain insight into such a range.",
    "The workload was not bad. It is very manageable, yet it is remarkably easy to procrastinate on the midterm and final research papers. Overall, many of the lectures were incredibly interesting and some of them were not able to engage the class. For example, Professor Bhullar's lecture was one of the most interesting lessons I have had in my educational career, despite me having no notable interest in avian evolution before the lecture.  The class could be improved by changing some of the lectures which did not interest the class as much.",
    "Strengths: very open, allows students to be involved as much as possible, gives exposure on an array of scientific topics that may induce students to want to learn more or major in one of those areas.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussion sometimes flowed really far off the topic at hand",
    "The strength is that the class is small, so there discussions really help in understanding of the material. The weakness is that sometimes guest speaker's lectures are difficult to understand, and are not related to the homework (papers) we have to do.",
    "Professor Timmermans is reason enough to take this class. She is simply the bomb  thoughtful, understanding, and with a killer sense of humor that often strikes out of nowhere  and can masterfully moderate even the most winding discussions. The structure of the course as well  guest lectures speaking about their research which we had read beforehand  was also fantastic and exposed us to many different facets of environmental science and geology and geophysics. I can see how many students could find a subject they liked amongst the bunch and become hooked. But the shining star(s) of this class were my classmates. I don't know what it is, but this class seemed to attract some of the most open-minded, genuine, and kind people that I've ever had the pleasure of interacting with. Even though environmental science isn't really my thing, I've learned that environmental science lovers are my kind of people! If there is anything that could even be considered a weakness, it was that topics were often discussed skin-deep and I left the class with deep, lasting knowledge only of the topics of the two term papers that I wrote. But this was a product of my own unwillingness to dive deep into every topic each week. Although this is not expected of students by any means, nor is it really the purpose of the class, I felt that it was the only downside of an otherwise brilliant course structure.",
    "I wish we had more time in class to discuss our paper writing processes. Other than that, the course was fantastic. I really appreciated hearing from Yale professors. I feel as though this course caters well to anyone with an interest in earth science topics, regardless of past experience.",
    "This course is extremely interesting. Every week is centered around a different topic with a different lecturer. The only weakness is that every week the assignment due is a summary of the piece were learning about, so maybe changing things up could be fun.",
    "Strength: consistent work load, interesting content\r\nWeakness: focuses a lot on background knowledge and doesnt teach concepts so much as reference them, if you havent taken an environmental science class in high school  before I feel like you will not get as much from the class.",
    "The discussion section aspect of it on Thursday's proved mostly unhelpful to me because it often relied on outside prior knowledge that we had on the material, which many people including myself often lacked. This made it difficult to make a meaningful contribution to the discussion and often led to very loose connections that derailed from the topic or to citing data that could very easily be incorrect. While it was nice to hear my peers hypotheses on questions that they had asked, I feel like this could be improved by supplementing the discussion with more teaching from Professor Timmermans, potentially be her creating a powerpoint and going more in depth about the most common questions.",
    "Strengths: structure of the class, engagement of the Professor, class environment\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of clarity with regards to the most important assignments (midterms and finals)",
    "I loved this course and loved that the instructor varied by the week. The information was interesting and engaging.",
    "Covers a wide range of topics. Some of the presentations by professors were irrelevant to their papers."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's a great introductory environmental studies class, and a great first-year seminar that gets you acclimated to Yale.",
    "I would. The class helped me gain insight into topics I would never have exposure to. The professor is nice and kinda and its fun to have a different lecturer every week.",
    "If you have an interest in environmental studies or want to gain an understanding of a broad group of topics related to the Earth, resources, humans, and the ways these things interact than yes.",
    "Yes, definitely. Great course if you are not a science-y person looking for a broader overview of a lot of fascinating topics. Not good if you want to be actively doing science (an easier science credit). Loved the professor and the TF, developed close friendships with numerous people in the class. Loved this course and will miss it a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend to another student. Homework is manageable, although the two papers are difficult, you come out of the class feeling like you learned (and not just some material, but rather how to understand scientific research in general).",
    "Absolutely yes. This is one of those rare classes that not only opened my eyes to a new field, but also made me realize how lucky I am to be here. In other, more intense classes such as the introductory economics seminar and chemistry, it is easy to become cynical and view classmates as your \"competition.\" But this class felt like a family  an extraordinarily intelligent, open-minded, and FUNNY family. I know that I will look back upon this class with fondness.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in the content.",
    "Absolutely. This has been the best course Ive taken so far at Yale.",
    "This class is interesting and works well as a introductory class to environmental science at Yale as each guest lecturer introduces a new topic from different scientific fields.",
    "Yes, undoubtedly. Professor Timmermans is amazing and the course is really interesting. Even though I did not have a background in science, I was able to do well with her help and I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they already had a solid background in environmental studies and felt up to date on the material. I would also recommend that they were interested in the majority of the lecture topics rather than just a select few because otherwise it will be difficult for them to remain engaged for much of the class. The topic papers were fun though because you get to choose something that genuinely interests you.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely. This course was interesting and accessible to anyone, even without a science background.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who possesses any form of curiosity when it comes to the natural processes and systems of Earth. The format of the class is amazing, as it gives you a taste of such a wide variety of topics. The weekly assignments allow you to work with many of the students in the class, promoting discussion and further exploration of the topics at hand. The freedom of the term papers allow you to pursue any topic you choose, which makes them more enjoyable to do. The repeated exposure to scientific research papers, and the subsequent ability to dissect them and pinpoint their main points, is the core reason to take this class, as this is a skill that many students coming into college might be lacking. I personally loved coming back to my dorm every day and trying to teach my roommates what I learned in lecture; this class gave me the ammunition to start some hilarious, unforgettable conversations with my friends, and I think this quality is invaluable.",
    "Yes. for students who are interested in learning about the world environmental issues"
