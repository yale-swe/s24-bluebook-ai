Definitely opt for Profesora Baffi if you can! She's is one of the sweetest people on the planet, and I feel like her kindness helped us all feel more comfortable challenging ourselves at the risk of making mistakes. Learning a whole new language can get frustrating at times, but when you're met with patience, understanding, and support, a lot of the frustration dissipates.",
