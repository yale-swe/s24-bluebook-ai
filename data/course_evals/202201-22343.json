The class has so many far-reaching implications for a lot of things I think about, for other classes, and generally in my life.",
                "Key theoretical frameworks that left me wondering how I'd ever managed to analyse, critique, or live without them before!!! This class is truly a gift that keeps on giving, and I can already tell has implicitly and explicitly shaped my approach to reading, thinking, and feeling. Readings spanned philosophy, critical theory, decolonial and Indigenous ways of knowing, literature and fiction, STS (science and technology studies), cultural anthropology, and more, on topics from Santera and technology; \"agential realism\" in feminist philosophies of quantum physics; relation, parasitism, and the idea of networks and rhizomes in various philosophical and religious studies texts; institutions, religion and belonging at Yale and Goldman Sachs; psychedelics, plant life, and white 70s counterculture; monstrosity; materiality; embodiment and knowledge at a molecular, material, and spiritual level; and more.",

            "comments": [
                "The strength of CTSR is for sure the professors, Prof Radin and Prof Khawaja are amazing as individuals and as a teaching pair. This course could only work with them, not just because of their expertise but because of the attitude that they create in the classroom. They've been such wonderful role models for me; they're not afraid to ask questions that they admit they don't know the answers to, and they point out where even they get stuck in the readings. As a result, nobody's trying to one-up anyone in class or prove themselves to the professors, so we can actually have honest discussions. They challenge us to think harder about what we're saying, but in an encouraging way rather than skeptical. All in all, I highly recommend taking this class as a chance to be mentored by two wonderful professors and people.\r\nThe only suggestion I have for the course is to maybe try and even out the syllabus a little. I appreciate that the readings are meant to be a challenge and are meant to be thought-provoking, not mastered, but it can get exhausting and discouraging to feel like you're not understanding anything week after week. I hesitate to name specific readings that should be left out because it's been wonderful to see how everyone responds differently to readings, but I think The Parasite could be taken out and we'd all be better for it. Basically, I think some more comprehendible readings should be added to the end of the course, and there could be a stronger effort to incorporate some of the foundational texts on objectivity we read at the beginning of the class into later classes. I think the idea to return to our first readings in the final class was a great, and could even see possibly slimming down the amount of readings to allow for more returns (I think we could've done with another reading of Situated Knowledges).",
                "Strengths: Joanna and Noreen! They are literally the best! They were so accomodating throughout the semester and always wanted to know how we were doing. They were both great discussion leaders and made the class feel fun. Also, the syllabus had some really cool and interesting works that I'm definitely glad I got to read. Weaknesses: none!",
                "strengths\r\n-interesting readings\r\n-interesting people in seminar\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n-the seminar developed a dynamic of criticizing the authors on the syllabus without talking about what they said, I found this unproductive\r\n-readings are very long and dense",
                "Strength: This course encouraged me to think in new ways. Every text was new to me and sometimes it was difficult to grapple with the content, but our course discussions always helped clear things up for me. I appreciate that this class also emphasized the application of the concepts within the texts on our own lives and experiences.",
                "Strengths: A wide range of philosophical, literary, theoretical, and thought-provoking readings left me feeling a lot of feelings and thinking a lot of thoughts. This class has some of the most intellectually challenging material I've encountered, but it also is designed to help you explore things that are personally relevant and rewarding. The professors are both kind and brilliant and work to create a supportive, inclusive environment--they truly practice what they preach. Weaknesses: None!! The readings could be extremely dense or challenging, but professors worked to create a flexible structure that supported us to engage with the readings as best we could.",
                "strengths: i feel like my mind was constantly blown.  a very not stressful class where i learned so much.\r\nweaknesses: sometimes i didn't know how to participate in class because everyone else's thoughts were so much more sophisticated"

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who is willing to challenge their worldview and deal with questions they didn't even know to ask. This class worked because every single student was dedicated to the questions posed and to thinking critically, so I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't ready to dive into the deep end of philosophy of science\/religion. But nobody should feel hesitant to take this class because of they feel their major\/discipline doesn't align with the course, I think almost every student had a different major and it was a stronger class for that. Even if you're a heavily STEM-oriented student, you should seriously consider taking this course to think about science in a different way and to, honestly, live a more interesting and colorful life.",
                "100%. Definitely take a class with Joanna and Noreen if you get the chance. They are two of the most loving and caring teachers ever. This class really changed how I think about science, religion, and the world in general. I've found myself using so much of what we learned and discussed in seminar in my everyday life and conversations. Also, the midterm and final assignments are low-stakes ways to talk about what interests you! If this class is offered again, take it!",
                "I would if they are interested in the questions this course asks. I also think you get a lot more out of this course if you have time to do the readings. So even though you don't have to do them all, I would only take this course if you think that you have time in your semester to do most of the readings.",
                "Yes! I thought it would be way above my head as someone who has never taken a HUMS or RLST course at Yale, but I found that the challenge was really rewarding.",
                "Yes if they are interested in HSHM.",
                "Yes, if you are up for a (good) challenge!",
                "Yes! This is such a beautifully taught course by Professor Radin and Professor Khawaja. I learned so much about theories surrounding how we shape and define the world we live in, and I will carry so much of the lessons from this course with me as I approach the future of knowledge production.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. Besides getting you to think, reflect, and feel a wide variety of different questions, curiosities and discoveries this class also gives you a wide range of theoretical tools and methods that you can use to live critically and flexibly at Yale and beyond. This is one of those classes where you can take what you learn into other classes and even your life outside of coursework. Each reading feels relevant to living in the world, in a community, and with each other. I highly, highly recommend this class to anyone, regardless of whether you are into history, STS, philosophy, religious studies, ethnic studies, STEM, etc.",
