   "comments": [
    "critical examination of objects of study (state, family)",
    "I learned many great thinkers in feminist and queer theory, a massive feat. I learned what the dominant languages are to discuss objects from a feminist\/queer perspective.",
    "This class provided a broad survey of major feminist and queer theory themes. I found the syllabus to be incredibly expansive and inclusive of many different theorists in the field. At times, such a broad expanse of readings that were each individually so dense proved to be challenging to digest each week, but overall I really enjoyed the readings.",
    "This was my first time taking a class based strictly in theory, and I gained immense reading, analysis, and writing skills. This class has changed the way I think and approach class materials, even in non-WGSS courses.",
    "I developed the ability to think critically about societal and political structures that regulate gender and sexuality. I also learnt to step out of my perspective and acknowledge the value of different methods of knowledge production.",
    "Mostly, I learned how to read dense theoretical texts more efficiently. I also gained a more robust understanding of transnational feminism and feminist critiques of neoliberalism."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strength: breadth, texts, seminar format\r\nweakness: size of the class?, sometimes discussion was hard to follow",
    "The course is strong in that Evren is a thoughtful, extremely accomplished professor. Not only did she put together a wonderful syllabus, but was open to feedback throughout the term about how the course was going. She also made herself available for office hours to talk about a broad array of topics. I would say its  main weakness is that we lost a bit of momentum towards the end of the term  it seemed like we got a little tired of the reading and the discussions died down a bit. Perhaps Evren should make sure that were staying engaged a bit more towards the end.",
    "Strengths: syllabus, a wonderful teacher, and plenty of supplemental reading for topics you were interested in. I also really enjoyed the fact that the class had both undergraduate and graduate students. I also found the reading responses to be a helpful way to stay on top of the heavy material, though I did not receive a ton of constructive feedback from what I wrote. \r\nWeaknesses: size! The class was way too big, and this caused the seminar to be unfocused, contain moments of awkward silences, and sometimes turn into leminars where Professor Savci would speak to fill the gaps.",
    "The syllabus for this class was truly exceptional and definitely a strength of the course overall. Many women-of-color authors were featured and diverse perspectives were a hallmark of this course. \r\n\r\nI would say that the only weakness lies in assignments and course organization. Expectations and deadlines for our weekly reflections were not very clear in the first half of the course.",
    "The strengths are brilliant readings, the professor is a great communicator and thinker, and the class was very engaged. Weaknesses were that we rarely managed to address all the readings in class, and the course sometimes felt a bit rushed.",
    "I felt that was far too much reading assigned per week in order to really tackle the readings during seminar. More so than other WGSS classes, I rarely felt like I had the time to get good grasp on any given reading. I also would have appreciated more scaffolding from at the beginning of the course to help contextualize what we were reading (mostly post-9\/11 book chapters and journal articles) within the history and development of the field. Weekly (600-900 word!!!!) reading responses (which were sometimes called papers??) werent graded until weeks after they were submitted, which meant that I didnt have the opportunity to respond to feedback progressively each week throughout the semester.",
    "This course provided many thoughtfully chosen readings, notably with more writers of color than in previous iterations of the course. The seminar was taught with a half-udnergrad half-grad student split which resulted in a large class size for much of the semester. As a result, some of the discussions lacked a solid flow and engagement."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "yes, because i think the grappling it encourages is important",
    "If youre ready for it, yes. The reading and weekly essays are no joke, but you will get so much out of this course if youre ready to engage fully with the material.",
    "Probably. I love Professor Savci a lot and also really liked the material we were learning. However, there was just something off about the two in combination and the class in general. I feel like if taught again with a smaller group and a different TF, it could be a really great space.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, especially for WGSS majors. It was intellectually challenging, eye-opening, and engaging. The syllabus was incredible and each reading was worthwhile.",
    "Yes! This course will open your eyes to normative and regulatory structures in society. Its literally like taking off a blindfold. I enjoyed it hugely and learnt a lot.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they were interested in reading a LOT of more contemporary theory. If youre interested in exploring feminist and queer thought more casually, I would recommend WGSS 205 instead.",
    "I would carefully consider taking this course if you are unfamiliar with Feminist \/ Queer theory, or theory more generally. If this were taught as an undergrad only seminar, I think the teaching style could be adapted in such a way to better facilitate learning."
