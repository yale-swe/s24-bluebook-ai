Although this class was a departmental seminar, Professor Jordan personally guided each and every one of us through the process of historical research, writing, and analysis. The weekly blog post assignments led us to critically synthesize and analyze large quantities of complex information, and our weekly discussions encouraged me to think more deeply about each essay and historical event we studied in order to question and attempt to fill the gaps in our knowledge. I have taken multiple history courses at Yale, but Professor Jordan actively worked to make me a better history student unlike any instructor I have encountered thus far at the university."

This class is not interested in easy fixes; it steadily built on our knowledge and skills each week toward the ultimate goal of our final essay assignment. We had nuanced and critical discussions each week, questioning the veracity of our sources, attempting to fill the gaps in complex narratives, and turning to a variety of sources, including creative works, in an attempt to gain a deep understanding of the time and place which we were studying. The weakness of this course was that, occasionally, our deadlines weren't always clear, leading to some confusion among our class regarding when to turn in assignments."

The thematic organization of the course is wonderful and gives you insights not only on 15th and 16th century Spain but also on contemporary conversations in Europe about race, indigenous rights, poor assistance, and veiling for Muslim women.",

Professor Jordan is one of the best instructors I've ever had at Yale, and her course provided telling insight into a complex yet critical period and place in history. Our discussions were one of the highlights of an otherwise difficult Zoom semester. Moreover, Professor Jordan goes out of her way to support and encourage her students. The frequent emails she sent to our class, as well as the multiple meetings I had with her about the subject material and my final paper, kept our class constantly engaged and helped me become a better history student. You must take at least one course with Professor Jordan during your time at Yale."
