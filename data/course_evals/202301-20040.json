            "comments": [
                "I don't think this class was taught in the greatest way. I think the slides could have been more clear and I found myself just scrambling to write down the codes in class without understanding what each line did. The content was confusing to me.",
                "Strengths: I quite enjoyed the content in this course. At first, I was not too excited to learn Matlab, but by the end of the semester, I was fascinated by what I could do with the program. Dr. Mak is a strength of this course--he is consistently accessible for office hours, and does a great job of answering student questions. Another strength of this course is the problem sets, as they helped me rigorously engage with the content in the course. One final strength is the practice exams, as they are exactly like the midterm and final, so there were no curveballs or unexpected \"gotcha\" questions.\r\nWeaknesses: The main weakness of this course is that it is very dry. I think this is in part unavoidable when teaching Matlab from scratch, but I think this could be fixed by moving more quickly through the first half of the course, and spending more time on the second half of the course. The first half of the course was extremely boring, especially since many people had at least some coding experience. The second half, however, was considerably more difficult--but more enjoyable and fascinating--and I think the course could improve a lot by expanding more on the second half (chemical reactions, Brownian motion, etc.).",
                "The difficulty of the course ramped up very quickly after the midterm.",
                "As part of the additional help provided, extra questions were created and posted on canvas. However, the answers to these extra questions were not posted. As such, the potential for the extra questions to help was extremely limited.",
                "The lecture material could feel slow, or dry at times. But, I feel that this was the best way to learn a new programing language. I'd never used matlab before, but now feel very comfortable with the language.",
                "Strengths: Computational skills are a must in this day and age, and this course was a very approachable introduction to these skills. Prof. Mak did a great job integrating practical tasks with teaching coding fundamentals. Additionally, ample support was provided, with plentiful office hours and TA sessions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Learning coding in lecture format can be a bit dull sometimes, but this is more the nature of the subject rather than a shortcoming in any teaching capacities.",
                "I thought that, towards the end of the course, the psets were incredibly difficult, and the allotted time to finish them was not enough to properly learn the information. Overall, I found that I learned a lot of coding, however, and that the course was very good for learning the logic behind coding in MATLAB.",
                "This course taught me the skills I need to model and analyze data using matlab. However, the lectures were often hard to pay attention to and could be made more interesting.",
                "A strength of this course is that its structure of the content (i.e., the units the course is split up into) makes sense, such that at the end of the course, completing the final project which models a biological system is simply a matter of combining the basic parts together into one model. The pacing is also very approachable. \r\n\r\nOne improvement I think could be made is in how some demo codes are presented. Though it could be difficult, it would be useful to show that oftentimes, several different logical structures could work for the purpose of the function being constructed.",
                "The material is very dry and its hard to remain focused during lectures. The TFs were not very responsive to emails and neither were they very helpful when it came to problem sets. The second half of the course is significantly harder than the first half and much of the material was rushed through toward the end. The slides were also not very helpful for exam prep. The final project is very time consuming (even though its worth only 5% of your grade!) and working on that took a lot of time away from studying for the final.",
                "I struggled a good amount given that I had no coding experience, but I'm not exactly sure how it could have been improved given the amount of content we had to cover in a limited amount of time. I think I was given a good amount of resources but I just needed more time. It could have been nicer providing written explanations of what certain commands in MATLAB meant so that reviewing codes after class would be more straightforward.",
                "Wish it was a full year course. All of the really exciting stuff came at the end",
                "I think that the office hours offered by Prof Mak was a highlight of the course as he always made time for students and was extremely kind and patient. I wish that the course itself was more engaging though as it was mainly just students copying code from a computer screen. I also wish we went over graphing models and interpretations a bit more.",

I would recommend it, but with the caveat that this course, if not changed in any way, will be very boring (almost unbearably so) for the first half of term, and then much more rigorous and enjoyable in the second half. If a student wants a more rigorous introduction to programming in general, I would not recommend this course, as it has a very niche focus (fascinating, but niche nonetheless).",

Development of coding skills alongside modeling and statistical interpretations is useful and applicable to areas outside the course, especially if you are conducting research or taking other learning labs (e.g. physics labs, BME labs)",
                "If a student is planning to use MATLAB for biological modeling in the future, and has no experience with MATLAB, I would very much recommend it, because the course starts with the fundamentals of how MATLAB stores data, etc. I would say that it's probably best if you go into this class with some previous programming knowledge, as some of the more universal aspects of programming (for example, being able to easily understand conditional statements or logic trees, matching indices, etc.) are not addressed in enormous detail.",
                "Not really, but you dont have a choice if youre a BME major. This class was not as hard as Physio but it is very poorly taught. I struggled to pay attention in class and it didnt seem like either the Professor or TFs cared if we were struggling with the material. While its not as hard as CS50, if you dont have a background in programming you start out at a significant disadvantage. The exams are not too hard but theyre very harshly graded so always pay attention to detail when studying code. Although I gained a solid introduction to the basics of MATLAB, I dont feel qualified to write code for a research project involving real life data.",
                "Yes",
                "I would, but only if its a major requirement. I think another computing course, like a CS class would be more fun and engaging for those genuinely interested in coding. The PSETs also take a long time each week and it is necessary to complete them with others as it is difficult to complete on ones own.",
