   "comments": [
    "I have learned that an individual can be in an academic\/professional field for almost a decade without taking steps to further your own knowledge of the field or updating your teachings based upon developments in the field so long as you maintain a good working relationship with a prominent figure in the field.",
    "I learned that we aren't so different from animals after all, and that human babies are a lot smarter than I expected.",
    "I was able to learn about misconceptions regarding the cognitive & mental abilities of animals and babies in comparison to humans. Learning about the rich complex emotional lives of animals & children, and what exactly makes humans distinct through well-structured lectures, articles, and videos was extremely effective  I felt like I was able to learn a lot, & be able to talk about what I learned to those around me!",
    "I had no prior experience in psychology, and this course taught me a great deal about our core cognition and what features of our psychology are uniquely human. We explored well-known psychology studies, many of which were conducted by Professor Wynn herself, and proposed further experimental inquiry. The course as a whole covered understanding of objects, number, and language as well as emotions, morality, and attachment, along with many other fascinating topics.",
    "This class taught me tons about infants and the innate understandings that they are born with including object permanence, universal grammar and some sort of expectation for fairness. I loved this class and also learned a lot about many different animals, though we focused a lot on monkeys specifically. I loved the parallels we drew comparing human and animal cognition - awesome class.",
    "how similar babies and animals are to human adults in numerical cognition, spatial navigation competency, language abilities, etc AND how they are different from us",
    "I learned how to think more critically about our cognition. Much of the world as I knew it was a given and this course taught me that so much of our worldview is shaped by the environment. Genuinely an insightful course.",
    "I learned a lot about where the human mind begins and how much we develop (and don't develop) between infancy and adulthood. I also gained insight into what it means to be human in terms of what is uniquely human through studying the many similarities and differences between animal minds and our minds. I also improved my ability to think deeply about material and come up with substantial questions, and I gained confidence to ask these questions and speak up about my thoughts in ways that I haven't in previous seminars. These skills and knowledge I gained from this class are making me interact with the material a lot more thoroughly in my Session B course than I think I would have otherwise.",
    "I enjoyed how the class challenged traditional (and often wrong) beliefs in psychology and focused on current research.",
    "I learned how to think more critically and beyond the information taught in class. I also learned how to apply the content to other areas which I think is very important and interesting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures were often more than 8 years old, which is a big deal in such a rapidly developing field as infant\/comparative psychology. Additionally I did not feel like I was taking a course with a Yale professor, instead it felt like an ludicrously expensive version of Kahn Academy where I was as likely to receive out of date or blatantly false information as I was good science.",
    "Strengths: Professor Wynn and TA Ashley! They were both very knowledgeable and kind, as well as receptive when it came to our discussions, and her lecturing style is very clear and concise. \r\nWeaknesses: I think having an entirely flipped class was a little too much. It kind of felt like I did all of the learning outside of class, and while the discussion sessions were helpful, I think having 2 hours of entirely Q+A was a little much.",
    "I enjoyed meeting twice a week after having watched the lecture material before classes in order to have meaningful discussions with my classmates, TA, & professor.",
    "The course isn't a super heavy workload which allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the material. Professor Wynn does a great job of presenting the material and made the lectures engaging.",
    "Strengths: the course material was engaging each week and allowed students to think critically about interesting topics (theory of mind, evolution, emotions, etc), the lectures were clear and engaging and the readings were always relevant \r\nWeaknesses: I feel like this course did not really foster collaboration like it would have if it was in person. In my other summer course we were assigned study groups in the beginning to foster smaller group collaboration and I feel like that could have been helpful for this course. I think that also would have made the live sessions better because students would feel more comfortable talking about the course material",
    "strengths: the lectures were super well organized and structured, weekly reading assignments exposed me to lots of psychology literature that I would have otherwise not read \r\nweakness: there was definitely a lot of information to process in five weeks' time, so I guess the only weakness was that the workload was a bit overwhelming (but nothing much of a surprise since I knew what I was signing up for)",
    "It was a lot of material and the live sessions could have been more dynamic\/engaging rather than just Q&A. On the other hand, there were no true homework assignments which made it easier to focus on the material",
    "Strengths: forced me to come up with questions and think critically about the material, really knowledgeable teachers, interesting course content, did not feel like a high-pressure seminar\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class size was a little big (so participation felt somewhat limited at times)",
    "The discussion sections were very long and not well organized. As someone who had never taken a psych course before (not a pre-req) I found it very difficult to participate.",
    "the course was super interesting and I really learned a lot through the readings and studies we went over. I think more time to talk about the material in a more organized way would have been nice, but it's challenging to run a discussion and on zoom on top of it."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely would not recommend this course to another student, during summer session or during the school year. We were not taught by the professor at all. Instead we were made to watch 8+ year old video lectures and attend 2 hour long Q&A sessions with the  TA. The professor attended only 3 of 10 sessions that we had, and the remainder were run by the TA. There was little if any new information presented in this course, and many of the studies discussed have been dramatically expanded or our understanding of them fundamentally changed since the times of these lectures, but such changes were not addressed at all. (this knowledge of changes coming from other courses in the field that I have recently taken that discussed the expanded studies.)",
    "Yes! The content is very interesting. In an in-person format on a less accelerated timeline it would probably be an AMAZING class. Online it was a little tricky to navigate sometimes, but the content and Prof Wynn are worth it.",
    "Yes! I feel like I learned about such fascinating things, and although the pace of the class in the summer is faster compared to if it were in person during the semester, the pace did not feel overwhelming for me to keep up with (even despite the fact that I was working a full-time internship 40+ hours a week).",
    "Absolutely. The course was really enjoyable and covered portions of psychology that I have not previously heard discussed. You will learn of so many interesting examples of human-like animal behavior and will gain a greater respect for the cognitive capacities of animals and infants.",
    "YES!! Take this class. Super fun, super interesting",
    "I would recommend this course because it's just really enjoyable. The material is very light but it is also really interesting and you do not need a background in Psychology to get a lot out of this class. It really just helps you think critically about the human mind, which I think most people would find engaging.",
    "YES definitely! I gained a much better understanding of what it means to be human and whether certain qualities that we believe are unique to human adults are present in babies and animals",
    "Yes! It really was very interesting although, as a psych major, some parts were repetitive.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I found it very interesting, and I think the skills I described earlier will be invaluable as I move forward. I feel like it helps you learn about your understanding of the world and the human experience. It will also help you learn some things about your pet or any small children you're around.",
    "Super interesting. I had fun learning and thought the workload was manageable. Yes!",
    "if youre interested in the differences between babies and animals mentally yeah, the title is pretty self explanatory, but the content doesn't disappoint at all."
