                "The lectures where interesting and also engaging to the point where students where able to ask questions. The greatest weakness in the class by far was in sections. Often times section felt like the only reason as to why you spoke was for your participation grade. We are college students, talking about life and our future is meant to be intriguing at the least. Section was very boring and with no structure did not even feel like a regular conversation. One of the TA in particular JOEL SATI was by single handedly the worst TA Ive had at Yale. If anyone plans to take this course in the future I recommend leaving his section. He provides little to no help in regards to structuring ideas for assignments, his tone of voice is belittling where he only makes corrections and never gives you a push in the right direction, and his communication skill are extremely subpar.",
                "I liked the discussion section the most. It was good to talk to others about the material.",
                "The content is very engaging and the readings are interesting, but sometimes matters did feel like they got bogged down in meticulous theoretical matters. Grading is based entirely on 3 papers, but writing is definitely not a focus of the course, and it didn't feel like there were clear ways to learn how to get better at writing philosophy papers.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Very engaging material as it is relevant to literally anyone\r\n- I felt like I was attending an interesting lecture at an event more so than a class\r\n- Given that we weren't tested on anything per say and that our papers consisted in thinking, note taking isn't required in my opinion. This enabled me to focus on what the professor was saying and truly think about the topics discussed as opposed to not listening and speed writing to make sure I have everything written down\r\n- Small discussion sections were fascinating. I felt like I was having late night philosophical discussions with friends about various aspects of our lives\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Grading is not consistent with other classes at Yale. Professor Kagan judges that a B is good. While I accept such an opinion, it is not consistent with how other professors grade. Anyone who doesn't want their GPA to drop has to take this class credit-d-fail.",

                "This course was very interesting and was very easy to keep up with. It was difficult to participate in virtual seminars due to wifi issues at times but that just comes from the nature of being online.",
                "Strengths: really interesting course material and engaging discussion sections. \r\nWeaknesses: paper prompts were really broad and often hard to approach",
                "The entire course felt like it did not look at the reality that most people can't make so-called ideal choices to improve their wellbeing. Taking about ideals is important, but when it starts to feel detached from reality, I am not convinced by it. Maybe change the central argument towards something more connected to young people's lives? We are worried about finding jobs so that we can pay for food and a house. We are worried about starting families and what that entails. Maybe a class focused on how best to navigate realistic events that most of us will face in the next 5-10 years will feel more realistic. \r\nAlso Professor Kagan is a notoriously strict grader, but this is an introductory philosophy class. Many people taking the class are not philosophy majors, but people who need a humanities credit that fits in their schedule. Maybe save the strict grading for higher level classes and let people get their humanities credit without tanking their GPA? Some of us need to apply to med school, law school, etc and we cannot afford to lose GPA to a class that is unrelated to our future profession.",
                "Shelly is a great professor to listen to. Hearing him recap and think through the arguments in the readings made the readings really digestible for non-philosophy majors. Definitely suitable for people who are non-PHIL majors.",
                "A big weakness is definitely that this course feels more geared towards teaching you how to write a Phil 179 paper than to actually philosophize. I feel like if this course was pass\/fail, that might actually lend it more credence. The slightly brutal grading took precedence over the reading material so I felt like instead of *learning*, I was just trying to get a good grade.",
                "This course overall was really good. I think that the virtual aspect hinders the discussion a bit, but that can't really be helped.",
                "Discussion sections and talking after lectures (Kagan will stay as long as you'd like) are definitely the best part. You have so many opportunities to talk and discuss philosophy.\r\n\r\nLectures can be a little less engaging, but luckily Kagan is an above-average lecturer.\r\n\r\nWorkload is a bit uneven: this course is a series of 3 sprints (3 5-paper essays). Otherwise the workload is incredibly low.",
                "The lectures were basically just a review of the readings, but less in-depth and with some of Shelly's opinions.",
                "I liked the level of breadth covered in the course, and how much we were still able to learn about every subject. I think the discussion sections were a huge strength, and where I learned the most.",
                "The main reason anybody takes this course is Shelly's lectures - and this semester they certainly earned their great reputation (although I would've much rather seen them in person.) But I was also pleasantly surprised at how much I liked section. There's a lot of handwringing over philosophy sections and the awful traits they bring out in us, but I found mine to be stimulating, enjoyable, and fair. \r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness, and I know every course evaluation will sound like they're brattily complaining about this, is the grading of the course. It's fine that Shelly believes grades at Yale are inflated, (they are) but making the majority of the class get a C is not going to fix any of those problems. With internships and clubs requiring a 3.5 and above, the class is not worth the GPA hit that accompanies it. And that's a real shame, because it really is a course worth taking.",
                "This course was amazing with Shelly \r\nHe was a great lecturer and Super friendly and willing to engage students in conversations after class \r\nThe TA was alright, they couldve more guidance on how to write philosophy papers and perhaps offered a writing credit for this class",
                "The live lecture was not very engaging and it was hard to have meaningful discussions during the discussion sections",

                "Discussion section led by the group was great, the lecture was boring at points",
                "I think this course would've been better if the prompts more closely tied to questions that we'd face every day. Some of the hypotheticals felt too removed from real \"Life\" itself.",
                "Professor Kagan is a great lecturer. He really knows how to present information in an interesting way, and provide examples that makes content understandable and relatable. The course is great as an introductory philosophy course and is great for non-philosophy people who are interested. Discussion sections are also great for solidifying your own thought processes, and are really structured around getting differing viewpoints from classmates and trying to understand varying ways to tackle the weekly topics. \r\nI think the course grading standards are a bit harsh and A grades are very difficult to achieve (if possible at all), but I see that as the only weakness of the course.

                "This was one of the better classes and worst classes to take during a pandemic. Lectures where nice to the fact that you would want to listen and participate. But my experience in section was terrible. My TA JOEL SATI had extremely high expectations for students and lacked no empathy for students mental well-being in already grueling year outside of academics.",
                "I liked the lectures being recorded. I would listen to them later like a podcast while walking outside, as it was nice to not be in my room.",
                "As far as online classes go, this one was run pretty successfully: simply Shelly lecturing to a large zoom audience. He did his best to do polls and take questions\/comments.",
                "Succeeded:\r\n- Professor Kagan always asked if students had questions during lecture, which forced some students to remain engaged.\r\n- Professor Kagan created polls in class \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The class was recorded and Professor Kagan didn't oblige students to attend or turn their camera on when they did. As a result, class sometimes felt like I was watching a recording of Professor Kagan rather than a live lecture.",
                "Great and smooth transition",
                "Lectures were great",
                "I struggle with class participation and doing a virtual seminar once a week was difficult and daunting for me. I asked my TA to help me maybe find a different way to participate but he was not helpful and instead put me on the spot at the end of every discussion to speak. Slightly traumatic! Please help students who feel uncomfortable in different learning environments find alternative methods.",
                "The class worked well in a virtual format since it was just lectures and a discussion section.",
                "I enjoyed the zoom polls",
                "The virtual polls during lecture were fun and engaging (easier to use than poll everywhere I think).",
                "I really liked the use of class polls to keep the class engaged! I think more things like that should be incorporated into the class.",
                "Recorded lectures helped for those living in different time zones.",
                "The recorded lectures was really helpful. Allowed flexibility in weekly schedule and also the ability to revisit things that were said in lecture.",
                "The virtual format worked well.",
                "Recorded lectures were very helpful.",
                "I watched the lectures after they were held because I live on the west coast, but I found this system to work just fine, especially because I got to engage a bit more during live section. This course is well adapted to Zoom times.",
                "Virtual lectures and recordings helped tremendously. Live virtual discussion sections were also helpful and did little to detract from the experience of the class.",
                "Zoom polls were fun. Shelly's (Professor Kagan's) lecturing chops were as engaging as always. However, there quickly emerged a culture of a very small and roughly fixed group of people asking around 95% of the questions, so it became very easy to just passively take in lecture. I think some encouragement to engage more actively, like via the chat, would have been helpful. Shelly would respond to nearly every comment or question, and it might have been more helpful to encourage a greater culture of sharing (e.g. of comments, confusions, links to related readings\/content, etc) without the expectation that every note deserves lecture treatment.",
                "The Discussion section was helpful in unpacking what we learned during the lectures",
                "I dont think anything could have been improved, as there arent many options with online learning. The teacher provided many avenues for academic engagement and I enjoyed the class very much.",
                "This course actually did a pretty good job on this front.",
                "The live lectures were great, as Professor Kagan did a good job of speaking about the content and connecting, even in that setting. The awkwardness of a large online class sometimes made asking questions too intimidating. \r\nThe adjustment halfway through the semester to make sure that all students left their mics on during discussion section and didn't wait to be called on to speak really helped turn the sections into more flowing and effective conversations.",
                "I liked the provision of a a recorded version supplement to watch the live lecture at a later time",
                "I am located in St.Louis, so my time zone difference was only 1 hour. For those who were attending from the other side of the world, the recorded lectures probably came in very handy.",
                "Lecture was pretty good and standard, but the efforts to actually involve or engage the students were pretty lackluster.",
                "There weren't really any huge changes other than virtual lectures and discussions. They worked well."

                "Yes but I would recommend taking it Cr\/D because you get to engage with the material, but not stress about the grade because Shelly is a harsh grader on the papers and it is hard to do super well.",
                "I took this class as a non-philosophy major, and I found it quite a nice balance to my other classes both in that it was a refreshing change of material and pace and that the workload (on non paper weeks) was a bit lighter. However, grading on the papers is a good deal tougher than I expected, so keep that in mind. Also, feedback on papers tended to be very case-by-case, and I don't feel like my philosophy writing necessarily improved very much as a result of the course. My favorite thing about the class was that I made me stop to think about what is worth pursuing in my own life.",
                "THIS IS THE MOST USEFUL AND INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATING CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. ANYONE SHOULD TAKE IT. Of course, given how harshly Professor Kagan grades, I would recommend taking this class credit-d-fail, unless you accept a B or C on your transcript.",
                "yes, this course teaches core values that all students need to contemplate.",
                "Yes",
                "As long as you aren't shy and your TA isn't Sati!!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in trying out a philosophy class; some of the major thinkers are covered, which lets you in on a little sample of who they are, and the class asks you to think critically and push yourself to take a stance on different aspects of life. I don't think that I am really changed my opinions about specific things (i.e. if I want kids or not) but it opened my eyes to many different arguments and allowed me to practice thinking argumentatively.",
                "Taking this credit d would be a nice 5th class. Shelly is always fun to listen to.",
                "Absolutely. This class was very intellectually stimulating and gave me a lot to think about. I think that every student at Yale should take a philosophy class as part of a well rounded education, and this class is a great starting point.",
                "This class was a really interesting survey of a lot of different philosophical concepts. I'd recommend it to those who are looking to take a philosophy class before graduating.",
                "Absolutely not. I had no idea what makes a good philosophy argument and what does not. Nothing I learned in other classes prepared me for philosophy, and as a STEM-oriented person, I struggled a lot. Work load is definitely less than most classes I took so far, but the grading is notorious. Unless you are really humanities-oriented, your GPA will definitely suffer.",
                "Yes. Especially for juniors and seniorsthe course covers content that seems particularly important to think about as you start to think about what you want to do post-grad\/in life.",
                "Only if you decide to take it Cr\/D\/Fail.",
                "Yes! Shelly is a great lecturer and there are only three papers throughout the term. In addition, it is really interesting to thing about what really matters in life.",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely! This is philosophy with a distinctly personal twist. If you have a lot of personal philosophies, or think in general, this course is for you.",
                "I would definitely recommend, solid 9\/10 class! Shelly is a great lecturer, even at 2x speed, and the content is all very interesting. It's easy to spend a lot of time in college stuck in a certain mindset without ever questioning if what you want is really what you want. This class definitely forces you to think about what really matters in life in a structured way that makes it less of an existential crisis and more of a hmm-let-me-think-about-this-stuff-in-the-shower kind of deal. I also had a really good section, and I got more comfortable articulating an argument that made sense logically. The papers are all pretty interesting, and also pretty easy as long as you start contemplating the prompts a day or two before you start writing. I definitely went into this class with the Credit\/D mindset just because the grading scale is tough, and Life was much better for it.",
                "This is a good 5th course to take as a Cr\/D\/F -- unless you are a philosophy major or have a formal background in philosophy, it is difficult to get an A due to Shelly's strict grading criteria.",
                "Yes - it is a good opportunity to think about the important questions, about who we want to be, what we want to do, what we want to strive towards. It does not assume any background knowledge in philosophy, and offers a structured environment to think freely about important issues.",
                "Yes, but only if you're prepared to not do well. The grading sucks, but it really is a fantastic course, and Shelly is one of those professors you've got to have a least once while you're here.",
                "I would generally recommend that other students consider this course. Look at the syllabus and do some skimming of random readings to make sure this class is *really* the approach to examining Life that you'd like to take this semester. My main caveat is, having also taken Death (Phil 176), I really enjoyed the rigorous treatment of a smaller selection of provocative topics; I found Life to be a bit more informal, survey-y, and thus harder to really grapple with some of the questions in a non-superficial way. It is definitely a course in which you will get out only as much as you put in. Further, if you do take the course, really try to engage with some other students in the course to just talk about the ideas. Getting some friends to take it at the same time as you is a great way to go; at least make sure you end up in a section that you vibe well with.",
                "Definitely, amazing course take it if you can",
                "No, I would not.",
                "I think it is a good intro philosophy course but it's hard, and also just not my cup of tea",
                "Yes, this is a great intro philosophy course that I would recommend to anyone looking to gain insight on what philosophy entails.",
                "If you're trying to take a philosophy class before you graduate, I think this course is probably one that touches upon the most real-life topics. Most philosophy courses are purely theoretical and this one feels pretty connected to questions we face every day. It will ease you into philosophy with questions you probably encounter anyway - what differentiates friendship \/ love?, what kinds of careers are most ethical?, etc. You will learn how to write a philosophy paper and really hone your critical thinking skills, which are two things that I think everyone would benefit from. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I made the mistake of expecting this class to be a good replacement for Life Worth Living, and I don't think it truly was. Philosophy still has a degree of separation from reality, so I would caution you from making that mistake. But if that's not what you're worried about, I would recommend this class!",
                "Yes, fun lowkey class talking about life. Not much so its an wasy credit d",
                "YES! This course was great. As a STEM student always interested in (but intimidated by) philosophy, this class was an interesting introduction that took an approach of philosophical thinking on topics that impact all of our lives (friendship, love, accomplishment, morals, education, etc), rather than focusing on specific theories, philosophers, or comparisons of literature. Professor Kagan is an incredibly engaging lecturer (even through Zoom), and the content in lecture, readings, and section was all interesting and accessible. I was amazed by how engaged I felt with this class and how fulfilling the content was. The papers were a challenge, but my TA was so helpful in talking me through how to think about my ideas and construct an argument. All in all, would recommend! Especially if you are a senior, or just generally thinking big life questions, making goals, or wondering what comes next.",
                "yes it was very interesting",
                "Sure. Grading is really harsh though, so theres a very low chance youre going to get an A.",
                "If you are serious about learning how to think philosophically and strengthen your understanding of how this field works, this course will push you to do that.",
                "Nah, it was a complete waste of a credit.",
                "Yes, of course! The reading material is not overwhelming, and neither are the lectures or discussion sections. However, I would recommend taking this class just for the sake of taking it; give yourself the room (time, mental capacity, etc.) to explore the material, and form a few positions.",
                "Dr. Kagan is an excellent lecturer and, even through Zoom, allowed for an appropriate amount of interaction in the classroom. I felt that the reading assignments were very helpful to both augment and supplement his lectures.",
                "workload small but grading is hard so an excellent credit\/d\/fail option , also interesting stuff",
                "Yes it was very interesting material, but definitely something to Credit\/D and not put too much effort into.",
                "Yes.",
                "very interesting course - however, I would recommend taking it Credit\/D as grading can be quite tough",
                "Yes! I wouldn't expect any life-changing or strong takeaways about how you should live your own life. If you approach the course more as a hypothetical thought exercise, I think you'll take away much more. But don't expect it to change the way you live your life."
