                "Due to the diversity of practices dealt with in this course, we were forced to compare the ways that different modes of storytelling can drastically change the types of stories that are possible to tell. You learn to look hard at yourself and draw out the ideas that drive you.",
                "I have learnt the important of revising pieces of work. I was also exposed to genres I dont write very much and was able to see how these play off one another and all intersect.",
                "This course exposed me to different genres of creative writing in a low stakes atmosphere, where making mistakes was encouraged and where workshopping fostered a collaborative and supportive writing environment."

            "comments": [
                "I think a strength of this class is that it offers a broad scan, and exposure to different mediums. Not necessarily a weakness, but a consideration, that the readings and the structure of the class will likely not surprise a student who has had previous creative writing experience.",
                "I thought the workshops were the best of the class. You get really insightful comments about your work, and get to look at other works from the perspective of a writer instead of a reader.",
                "The strengths of this course really are just having Prof. Deming. Hes kind, funny, engaging and incredibly dedicated to his students. Hes pretty clear and concrete with feedback, which makes revision a fruitful process. I think that the level of engagement that you get from workshopping with your peers is also really great, and I liked being able to discuss both famous works and works that were written by us!\r\n\r\nI found some members of the class a bit distracting\/obstructive to our class, and I feel like this could be improved upon by keeping a bit tighter rein on the seminar conversation.",
                "I like that we go through three different genres of writing. I think the pieces we read are great and really help us understand the genres. I think the workshopping format was also great. I enjoyed the visit from Marie Bertino and thought it was really helpful to get to hear from another writer. I particularly enjoyed the Hemingway imitation task - I think it really made me consider what is necessary to tell a story.\r\n\r\nI think the only weakness is that sometimes we had to rush through some peoples pieces when workshopping and so maybe more allotted time for workshopping or just stricter timekeeping",
                "Strengths: Professor Deming is an excellent professor and speaks to the class really well  he is able to sustain attention and his impromptu teaching style is very enjoyable. I really loved the little writing challenges he would set up for us\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While we read a variety of texts, I still feel like we were largely left on our own in terms of understanding a style of writing and mimicking it. Perhaps more thoroughly deconstructing a genre and style in class would be helpful and help students create better first drafts."

                "I strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in creative writing. Its a great intro both for those who just want to dabble for a semester and those who might want to pursue creative writing more",
                "Absolutely! Im not really involved in creative writing, but it was still so much fun and I enjoyed learning in this class.",
                "Yes. This class is excellent for those interested in writing who do not yet know where, exactly, those interests lie.",
                "Yes! I think that the course is extremely well structured to facilitate growth and anybody that takes it will definitely leave a better writer than they came in.",
                "A fun course and very useful for building a portfolio of creative writing pieces that may be able to help you get into other classes. Prof. Deming brings a great energy to the classroom",
                "HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE!!! You will grow so much as a writer and a reader in this course! I am not an English major but I gained so much from taking this class.",
                "Yes  if you want a low workload, low stakes introduction to creative writing. Still, I think Professor Deming has relatively high expectations for an introductory course."
