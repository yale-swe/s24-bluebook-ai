   "comments": [
    "I think I grew a lot as a writer. I could easily transpose what I learned in this class to my other writings, especially essays. As the course progressed my ability to form clear images, to get rid of unnecessary words, to be precise was deeply improved.",
    "I got a great sense of the mechanics of writing -- Professor Zarin had me focus on a granular level on how to work with sound, silence, motion, rhythm, and imagery in poetry.",
    "This class helped me think about poetry and writing more generally. Prof. Zarin cares a lot about making you a better writer and she always offers constructive criticism. The class is also set up so that you get to see her interact with poems she hasn't read before, which is really cool, because it gives insight into how she thinks about poetry and writing.",
    "I developed a deeper appreciation for reading poetry. Before this class, I wrote more poetry than I read. Now, I want to read poetry too, and reading poetry has bettered my writing. Ive also developed the understanding that poetry takes practice. This class has helped me get in the practicing of drafting and revising.",
    "This course helped me to think a lot about form and structure in my work, while also allowing me to explore the topics I wanted to write about.",
    "We got a lot of exposure to poetry!",
    "You will learn a ton about writing poetry. Prof. Zarin is very direct (not mean!) with her criticism and as a result your poetry improves very quickly.",
    "I wrote poems in many new forms and read work by many poets I had never heard of before. Probably the most important skill I learned from this class was how to revise poetry effectively. Writing poetry has also improved the quality of my prose.",
    "This course specifically looks at the technique and effect of writing poetry, not necessarily analyzing it for meaning. I really liked that - it gave me a lot more insight into how to cut to the chase in my writing, and how to get my message across in a much clearer way. Professor Zarin also pointed out how to structure my poems in a manner that would make it easier and more impactful for the reader. Additionally, I got to explore all different types of poetry that I wouldn't have been able to find on my own otherwise, and allowed me to workshop other students' work and have my own work be read by multiple perspectives as well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was a great course. I enjoyed forming our own anthology of poems as a class. We looked at many authors, there was no specific cannon of poetry that we followed so that was very refreshing. The exercises also varied a lot, so I felt like I had a chance to try a variety of different poetry modes.",
    "I would've enjoyed going over workshop rules before we began critiquing others' poems, since a couple people could sometimes be consistently mean\/critical in a weird way of others' work. I also would have found it helpful to workshop my poems more often, though I'm not sure how time would have allowed for that.",
    "The strengths of this course are that the workload is a great amount. Writing one poem a week isnt burdensome at all, but it is enough to feel like youre learning and getting something significant out of the course. I also liked how this course only met once a week too. I had enough time to really think about the material from the week before and engage with it.",
    "This course encourages its students to create and fine tune a body of work, as well as study published poets for their craft. The only thing I would have liked is if it would be possible to receive feedback on all the poems we submitted each week, either from the professor or from peers, because there are a few poems I wrote this term that Im still unsure what to do with. However, on the whole, just being in workshop and meeting with Professor Zarin taught me skills about editing my work in general, which was very helpful in creating the final portfolio.",
    "This courses strength is that it does what it sets out to do: makes the students better poets and more well-versed in the poetry world and its mechanics. The main weakness I can think of is that I feel that some of the more open ended prompts should come later, once students have found their voices.",
    "The class put a strong emphasis on independent learning. At times, this was very pleasant and liberating; at other times, it made the course feel extremely disorganized. I strongly think that there should be some amount of required reading -- as things were, we were simply instructed to \"read widely in poetry\" every week, and Professor Zarin only occasionally checked in with us to ask what we were reading.",
    "Sometimes I wish we had more office hours with the professor so we could really talk more one-on-one about poetry and writing in general."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely. The course is a broad introduction to poetry. It is fun, the assignments are challenging but enjoyable, and Professor Zarin is an amazing teacher, her insights and help in revision are super helpful.",
    "I would! I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "Yes!! It's a class that you can get a lot out of no matter what, but especially if you put in the time and effort to write poems you're proud of. Bare minimum, you learn about the craft of writing poetry. But you can also have a room of people reading things you care about and giving you good, thoughtful feedback.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. People whove never written poetry and people who have some experience writing poetry should take this course. This course helps one develop a deeper appreciation for reading and writing poetry. It also gives students a toolbox of skills. Professor Zarin is also a wonderful Professor, and no one should pass up the opportunity of taking a course with her.",
    "Definitely.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, if you have a strong interest in writing poems and really working at it.",
    "I enjoyed introduction to writing poetry very much and would recommend it. I did not receive nearly as much feedback on my poems as I would have liked, however. (Professor Zarin never provided me with either written or oral feedback on at least four of them.) Professor Zarin was very \"hands-off\" as an instructor.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's a great way to explore poetry and Zarin chooses poems in a way that allows her to bring together a general theme or lesson for each class related to poetry writing."
