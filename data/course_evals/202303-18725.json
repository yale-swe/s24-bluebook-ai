                "Strengths: Professor Robinson! It was an incredible to study under her guidance and years of expertise. She introduced great movement practice that was accessible to beginner's like myself. I also enjoyed that half of each class was spent moving. It was so refreshing to have a consistent movement practice two times a week. Weaknesses: sometimes the discussion half of class could be a bit unengaging.",
                "Strengths: Professor Robinson has 30+ years of experience with dance and with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. She's so knowledgeable and so helpful in guiding me through the dance journey. Every class meets in a dance studio and we start with about one hour of Floor Barre practice to align our bodies, and then we engage in class discussions on reading materials. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class could be organized better. We often get notified of homework less than a week in advance. Sometimes Prof changes the assignment so we couldn't know the assignment in advance by looking at the syllabus. There was little opportunity to know our grades on our assignments, except that Prof did offer opportunities to talk to her about our grades. Overall Professor Robinson was very understanding and flexible."

                "Yes! As someone without formal dance training, I found this course super accessible for beginners. It was so wonderful to spend two hours a week moving every morning. I thoroughly enjoyed the Floor barre exercises and could feel myself getting longer throughout the semester. It was so cool to learn about Alvin Ailey and the field trip to see the Ailey Company was definitely a highlight. The final self-choreographed performance was intimidating but I was surprised by how it all came together at the end and how well everything we learned throughout the semester helped me produce a story I felt proud of. The class also becomes a very supportive environment throughout the semester. If you want to learn some basics of dance and how to tell a story through movement or just want a totally different class experience, I would absolutely take this class.",
                "YES. A deeper understanding of yourself, your body, and other bodies awaits you.",
                "YES! I would recommend this class no matter what your experience with dance is. I think everyone can gain something from this class, especially since Professor Robinson tailors feedback to everyone depending on their backgrounds and experience with dance. You'll gain a new understanding of dance, have the opportunity to practice floor barre twice a week, and discuss dance with fellow classmates. Low workload too so a great fifth class, but I would say you get what you put in. I recommend fully engaging with the class. The field trip to NYC was a highlight, we got to see a matinee performance of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater."
