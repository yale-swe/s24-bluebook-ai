We also read a ton of really diverse, fun, and interesting example essays which were always a treat to read for class.  And I also got a chance to be creative in a way that few other of my classes allow, which I really appreciated.",

                "I really enjoyed this class; there's really nothing I can critique. I especially appreciate the workshops we did on each other's essays.",

                "strengths: development in your writing process and overall quality of writing, interesting readings\r\nweaknesses: harsh grading and very difficult to earn an A on the essays",
                "The pace of the class was fast enough that it felt like an intense English class but still slow enough to develop a sustainable rhythm. I appreciated how much feedback we got along the way as well.",
                "Strengths: This is an excellently structured course in which you read essays, discuss essays, write essays, and workshop your classmates' essays. It's a perfect set-up for learning about writing. Also, Prof. Shirkhani is an amazing teacher -- couldn't recommend her more highly. She created a fun, engaging classroom environment and we learned a ton. Also, the essays we read in her section were all top-notch (I think readings vary among sections). Workload-wise, it was great to only have to write four of the five essays and do one ungraded exercise (instead of writing five full-length essays, which is how the course used to be) because it gave me a bit more autonomy over my semester and time management.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "A strength of this course was the classroom size. It allowed for a good level of engagement and discussion. \r\nIt could maybe be improved by providing some sort of thought processes about what I should be looking for upon re-reading an essay. Sometimes during the semester I would read an essay and not understand what I was supposed to have gotten out of it.",
                "This class really felt like a community, which I think in general made students much more engaged in discussion and made it feel like a genuinely fun space to be in. Discussions followed a general pattern whereby Prof Shirkhani would give some opening prompts or questions that people would respond to. I thought there was a really good culture where students would build on and respond to each other instead of responding to the professor directly. One element which I felt was mostly positive but occasionally constraining is that in general Prof Shirkhani had a clear sense of one major takeaway she wanted us to get from the craft of each essay, and generally class would follow an arc which ultimately led to that conclusion. Along the way she was absolutely open to other insights brought by students, so the arc of the class did not come to the detriment of discussion or student contributions. But it was a little constraining in that the main focus of discussion was somewhat dictated. That being said, I think this was largely to the benefit of the class, because with so much material to go through, it was helpful to have a way to focus discussion and create a clear sense of the skills and techniques we were gaining from each sample essay. Also in general the sample essays were fantastic and so fun to read.",
                "More seminar-style so lots of opportunity to dissect writings and hear insights from your peers. Workshops were great for bouncing ideas off one another and getting feedback from many people."

                "Yes definitely great way to develop your writing voice and read some great stuff",
                "i would recommend this course to english majors or students deeply interested in personal writing. to other students, the grading is a bit harsh so english 114 or 115 might be better suited, especially if you're a first-year.",
                "Yes! I would completely recommend this class to another student interested in reading and writing better. I think it would be more challenging to go through this class without enjoying it, but Professor Shirkhani makes that part easier by consistently keeping the class engaging.",
                "Absolutely!! It's a classic Yale course for a reason. Take it with Shirkhani if you can -- she's an amazing, warm, fun professor.",
                "I believe that any student looking to pursue writing should take this course, given its capability of teaching the fundamentals of reading like a writer that can be used throughout our careers.",
                "I could not recommend this class more highly, especially with Prof Shirkhani. It had the greatest community of probably any class I've taken at Yale, and Prof Shirkhani really cultivated that. I got to be creative and expressive in ways that most of my other classes don't allow, and I think my writing really improved. I wanted to write and to be pushed in my writing and I absolutely got that. And I absolutely loved the readings. It was also so cool to workshop and read my peers' writing --- it allows you to gain personal insight into classmates that most other classes don't allow. And Prof Shirkhani also clearly cares so much about what she does. She gives incredibly thorough feedback on both drafts of every single essay, and is so open and easy to talk to, both in class and in office hours. Writing, especially essay writing, can be a somewhat vulnerable thing, but she created an environment where risk-taking was encouraged and felt safe to do. Taking this class was a highlight of my Yale experience."
