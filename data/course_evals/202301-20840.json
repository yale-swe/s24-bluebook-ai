                "The strength of this course will also be its weakness for a lot of students: students spend a lot of time learning Spanish for this class. For me, the fact that this class is worth 2 whole credits allowed me to only take 3 other classes this semester. This gave me affluence of time to sit down and focus on the work assigned for this class--or even pursue supplementary learning opportunities. You will be in lecture for 2 hours every morning, you'll have an additional hour or so of homework every weeknight, and you'll need to spend a good 2-4 hours studying before each exam (of which there are 5). This meant that improved my Spanish a ton, but it may be more of a time commitment than some students are willing to make. I'll add that the content that is assigned in and out of class is very engaging. Professor Maripaz has great taste in short films and short stories that are funny and interesting. The 10-15 hours or so of learning I did each week was never a slog.",
                "We had really good conversations about various more complicated topics like neocolonialism and unemployment, and it was fund to develop higher level thinking in spanish. I think it could be improved by being a little more conscious of the fact that we could still do everything in that class in slightly less time.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- expands Spanish vocabulary\r\n\r\n'Weakness:\r\n- my listening did not improve there weren't enough practice or listening strategies relayed\r\n- it was hard to engage as some students were given more priority\r\n- does not teach the cultural differences between spanish speaking countries thoroughly, only surface level"

                "I absolutely would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Spanish. Particularly if you speak another Romance language, or have some hispanophone background, this course will help you understand the language and consolidate it at a healthy pace. Also, since the majority of the learning happens in class, it isn't actually as demanding as you'd expect, except for class time. The 8 hours a week can be a lot, but it's only really that + vhl assignments and short grammar/vocab readings. If you're willing to pay attention, participate, and try your best, this course will be a great opportunity to develop your fluency, proficiency, and confidence in Spanish.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student, regardless of their comfort with the Spanish language. This year, I took both Intensive Elementary Spanish and then this course, despite not knowing any Spanish beforehand. The professors of the Intensive courses are extremely understanding and helpful. They both responded to any email questions within hours, they met with me  after class or during office hours to help me anywhere I was struggling, and they were pretty generous with grades--despite my relatively poor performance compared to my classmates. \r\n\r\nDon't let the high workload on course table discourage you. This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale. Incredibly well organized, with specific feedback, and engaging content. 10/10 would recommend. \r\n\r\n**I'll note that both times I've taken a language class here, I've requested a tutor for the course. This is a super easy process and was crucial for my learning. I got to spend an hour or two a week with another student and ask any specific grammar questions I had. I was able to practice grammatical structures that I was struggling with and get instant feedback. I was also able to practice speaking casually in a very low-stakes environment. It's free! Take advantage of this resource--especially if you don't have a really strong background in Spanish.",
                "Absolutely. I was nervous to take this class because it seemed really hard, but Maripaz is a wonderful woman, the course load isn't too intense, and you really learn a lot.",
                "Though it's only 2 credits, Span 145 is a great way to cover L3 & L4 in one semester, especially if Maripaz is teaching it.",
                "I think I recommend this course, but if you want to succeed you will have to put a lot of effort in to see results. A complacent taking this course could easily get you a B, but the content is challenging and so for anything higher you should prepare to work."
