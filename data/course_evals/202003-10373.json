I definitely think taking this course improved my writing, especially the journalistic\/creative nonfiction style of writing. \r\n\r\nI also learned about Grand Strategy in theory and in practice. The Brady-Johnson program gets a lot of hype, but definitely take this course if you didn't get into it\/want a one-semester introduction to Grand Strategy. \r\n\r\nI didn't know a lot about international relations going into the course, and writing a paper on US\/China relations certainly helped me develop more knowledge on that front. \r\n\r\nOverall the course is a mix of philosophy, politics, international relations, literature, humanities and intellectual history. Take it for Gaddis, who is incredibly knowledgeable and a really interesting thinker.",
                "In class, Professor Gaddis challenged us to go beyond surface-level answers and probe deeper. During office hours, he would openly question my beliefs, forcing me to analyze and draw connections rather than regurgitate talking points. His seminar lived up to the hype. I was extremely engaged with the material and my classmates were all invested in the course. This was my first class with Professor Gaddis and I'm glad I had the chance to learn from him.",

It is a great course if you want to develop your critical thinking skills and engage with a very knowledgeable professor.  I believe this course has significant real-world application.  Professor Gaddis compels his students to think of complex situations with new and different perspectives.",
                "Really learned about the different ways people think in general, as well as the tendency for leaders to make mistakes. The readings are really interesting and also fairly recent, giving new and updated perspectives on current issues. In general, this course also gives a critical view of Americas role in global affairs while acknowledging the cold-war mentality."

                "This is a great course. It is carried by a fantastic professor in John Gaddis, and a strong reading list that seems to cover almost all significant eras and figures from modern history. In my opinion, the best part of this class was the creative assignments, which forced the student to think outside the box and apply lessons learned from the course to other domains. Perhaps the only suggestion I have would be to work towards a more balanced discussion in class meetings, as it seemed that the discussions were sometimes anchored by the same small subset of students.",
                "Professor Gaddis sometimes spoke a little to much, but mostly facilitated good classroom discussion.",
                "Strengths: The professor. Brilliant, well-spoken, and actually very funny, Gaddis was one of my favorite professors this semester (and probably at Yale). The assignments range from creative to personal to political, all of which were interesting to write. The readings were good (I enjoyed the philosophical ones more than the political ones, but that's just me). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of reading, if that's something that deters you -- it can be up to a book a week, so if that's not your style, stay away. That said, often the class discussion wasn't totally related to the reading, but having done it is really helpful for grounding your comments in reality rather than just musing randomly. \r\n\r\nThe other thing I will say is this: if you're a philosophy type or a very nitpicky thinker, keep in mind that this class is VERY macro. One of the papers was to design a national security strategy for the US in five pages. You're going to be thinking at a very 30,000 feet of the ground kind of level. Do with that information what you please, but that said, I am the nitpicky type and I really enjoyed the course.",
                "I found no weaknesses in the course.",
                "Great course, can't see many ways to improve it.",
                "Strengths: The course is designed to gain not just the insight of the professor, but also that of the students.  We interacted with history in a very hands-on discussion-based way which allowed for a greater understanding of the material.\r\nWeaknesses: Most (~70%) of the reading for the course is condensed over four weeks in October\/November, but that's just due to the overall nature of the reading and can't really be avoided.",
                "Strengths: good instructor, interesting readings and writing topics,  helpful for improving writing and strategic thinking.\r\nWeaknesses: the seminar can be winding sometimes and may spend significant time on tangential subjects or leave students with a feeling unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved by a 5 minute recap session at the end to summarize the key insights from the discussion.",
                "The papers are very creative and ask you to sometimes try to solve problems with which the foreign policy community itself have been struggling. The readings are all fantastic and thought-provoking, but are often not really discussed in the seminar itself. I will say that sometimes the grading values ingenuity more than analysis."

                "The course was a seminar, and it worked well over Zoom.

Come to class on time to avoid this happening to you!",
                "The live seminar format mimicked, quite closely, an in-person discussion. This was unique to Professor Gaddis' course. My other courses from this fall didn't have nearly the same level of engagement. Students would be on their phones or scrolling through websites, making zero effort to hide their boredom. Because our seminar was small and the material captivating, all of us showed up prepared and stayed engaged for the full two-hours.",

                "Definitely take this course if you can get in. John Gaddis is one of Yale's greatest thinkers and taking a class with him is a high privilege. The workload is very low, simply consisting of 4 papers, all worth 25% of the grade. The papers are creative and will force you to take the lessons you learn from the class and apply them elsewhere. There is a lot of reading, but it is generally quite interesting and includes a lot of recent literature. If nothing else, take this class to get a peek into the mind of Professor Gaddis and learn from other driven students.",
                "Yes! Workload is not too bad and Gaddis is a phenomenal professor.",
                "This is an excellent course, and I would recommend it to other students. I was the only girl in this class -- which was not a big deal, but I only mention it to encourage more women to sign up next time it's taught. \r\n\r\nFoxes and Hedgehogs sort of evades categories or simple description. We started with Berlin's essay on Tolstoy and the Fox and the Hedgehog, and spent the first half of the course on the theory of grand strategy. In the second half we put the theory into practice, reading books on US foreign policy for the past 100 years or so, and discussing how to apply Grand Stategy to US\/China relations and National Security policy. So along the way we covered many disciplines, from literature to philosophy to political theory to politics. I note this because I think I came into the course not completely understanding what we'd be learning, and expecting more politics, and it was a pleasant surprise how much Gaddis emphasized philosophy, art and literature.\r\n\r\n The assignments are very hands-on, such as crafting our own national security policy and coming up with our own Fox\/Hedgehog metaphor. Be prepared to think creatively and spend time on your assignments. If you're worried about grades, you're going to have to work very hard, but it's definitely worth it. Gaddis rewards effort and new ways of thinking.\r\n\r\nI loved this course, and the other students in the class I talked to also enjoyed it. Email Professor Gaddis early on for a spot!",
                "I will be recommending this course for my remaining years at Yale. During my freshman year, my advisor and a handful of friends recommended I take a course with Professor Gaddis. The former knew of my future plans with the military and spoke of his serious involvement with student-veterans on campus. The courseload itself was demanding. Never had I been asked to read a book a week. I'm proud of myself for holding up my end of the bargain and took more out of the course because of the strict requirements. My peers were extremely impressive--a handful of them above and beyond--and I learned as much from them as from Professor Gaddis. For me, this was one of those \"defining\" courses that each student has during their undergraduate years. The combination of the reading list, Professor Gaddis' teaching style, and the crucial fact that everybody wanted to be there made this course a success. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that on the first day there were three female students \"shopping\" foxes, hedgehogs, and history. The next week, only one female student, Eliza, returned. I have no idea what that's like, but I imagine it's quite difficult to be the only woman in a room. Diversity of opinion, particularly being open to disagreement, was a leadership principle we covered in-depth this fall. However, given that most of the history we read was written by men, and there were fifteen men (including Professor Gaddis and the Lt. Colonel) in a sixteen-person seminar, we likely had a biased interpretation of the material. There must be underlying reasons why our course had far more males than females--in a similar way that courses in the History of Science and Medicine program are female-dominated. I encourage Professor Gaddis to investigate this because I think it would only add to class discussion.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "Absolutely! Perfect fusion of history, international affairs and grand strategy.",
                "Yes -- Gaddis will give you a new way to think about the world, not to mention that he will improve your writing",
                "Yes!  Regardless of your major, this class will make you look at US foreign policy and strategy in general from a unique and valuable angle.  As long as you do your reading (and please do it, the books are fascinating), and participate at least a little in discussion, a lot can be gained.",
                "Yes.  It is an excellent opportunity to improve strategic thinking and writing skills and provides a unique opportunity to engage with an amazing professor on a wide spectrum of subjects."
