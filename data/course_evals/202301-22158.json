                "Strengths: Genuinely interesting essay prompts. I found myself exploring such a wide variety of topics that I had not expected. Prof. Amrith is excellent too, and a good facilitator of discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that sometimes there was too much required reading (not to the point of insanity) but enough that it often took away from the class discussion when >50% of the class obviously did not do it. I think there would have been a lot more engagement had readings been more manageable.",
                "It was a great course. I think that it could only be improved by providing the readings earlier. Otherwise, it was a very wonderful, engaging, and accessible course.",
                "I loved this class! The content was very interesting, and the professor did a great job of making it very engaging",
                "Strengths\r\n-Prof. Amrith is just fantastic. Engaging, kind, and immensely knowledgeable. He does a great job blending seminar discussion with some lecture-style delivery of background information that sets the stage\r\n-I loved the assignments in the course, especially the two short papers. A novel and exciting way to engage with the course material\r\n-The course is well structured, surveying a range of topics in Indian history\r\n-A terrific cultivation of course readings. I fully intend to re-read many of them at leisure once the semester is over\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-None at all as far as the course is concerned. \r\n-If I had one suggestion, it would be that Prof. Amrith should also offer a lecture course on similar topics. Given how much more he knows about Indian history than students, it would be incredibly enriching",
                "While the readings were all well selected and enriching, I wish there was greater variation in the medium of these assignments (ex. videos).",
                "Strengths: Professor Amrith is a leading expert in his field, so its a privilege to get to learn from him; prof is very understanding and friendly; the opportunity to explore a topic/region of the world that is often understudied; experience planning and writing a lengthy research paper that makes a historical argument | Weaknesses: sometimes, class discussion felt a little too surface level, esp when it was obvious that not many of the students had done the readings; if more students in the class came in with a solid foundation in Indian history, then maybe students would have had a little more to bring to the table beyond the readings",
                "Well-directed seminar discussions and nicely selected readings!",
                "Strengths: charismatic professor, engaging material, great organization, caters to many types of learning\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: I really value how wonderfully Professor Amrith teaches this course. The incorporation of various different styles of sources was wonderful. The course was very organized and each week we had the opportunity to learn about a different aspect of India and analyze it through and economics lens.\r\nWeaknesses: None really!",
                "The strength of this course is that it allows for a lot of independence and leeway to explore personal interests in various topics. It is very student oriented.\r\n\r\nA weakness is that when discussions would fade out, the professor took charge of the class a lot, this could be amended with more class readings and activities being organized to make for a more structured class schedule.",
                "The level of assigned reading is excellent: enough to learn something from each text, but not so much that sections of the text become deprioritized/skimmed. Also, Professor Amrith is an excellent facilitator and inserts just the right amount of professorial comments in a largely student-led discussion each week.",
                "The strengths of the course definitely lie with Prof. Amrith, who is one of the best professors I've had in the history department! He cares passionately about the material he teaches, and he is incredibly supportive and encouraging to his students. I honestly sometimes wish I got to hear more from him during class he mentioned once that he may consider making this course a lecture, and while I certainly think it should remain a seminar format, I think the class would benefit from Prof. Amrith offering some \"mini-lectures\" at the beginning of each session to help contextualize the readings and the topic/theme for the week."

If you have any interest in understanding India in the 20th century through a lens of macro-economic drivers, then take this course. As always, with such a broad subject, I left the course feeling as though we had breezed through various topics that required more attention -- specifically India in the modern day and its acute problems of development. Nonetheless, Prof. Amrith did an excellent job dovetailing a history of various interconnected themes like migration, caste, colonialism, etc into a coherent and interesting course.",

We get feedback on a final outline before writing the paper, which is hugely helpful. Discussions in class were great too.",
