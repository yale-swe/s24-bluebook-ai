   "comments": [
    "I became more comfortable writing longer essays.  Prior to this course, I was most familiar with the 200-300 word format common for college applications.  I also was able to better articulate the tools of effective writing (which can help to employ them better) and I also was able to better understand and employ the primary structure of satire specifically.",
    "How to write personal essay; how to polish your own writing; reading authors pieces and adapting stylistic elements to your own essay",
    "I loved reading the different types of material in this class and I learned so much about writing different types of pieces for a multitude of genres.",
    "I definitely improved upon my writing skills because we wrote a variety of types of essays, none of which I had really done in high school. I felt that I had a decently strong grasp on formal essay writing, but this class expanded my writing to different styles as well. I also went in with the goal of learning how to make a point more effectively instead of using too many words to make it, which is a goal that I think I achieved through the help of my professor who I really enjoyed.",
    "I learned the writing process and how to improve my writing skill and craft.",
    "I took this course because I wanted to improve my reading analysis skills and develop my voice and style as a writer.",
    "This course provided plenty of inspiration and opportunity to experiment with my writing. I tried out various subjects and writing styles, and my professor provided me with excellent feedback.",
    "I expanded my writing potential and am much better at putting together an essay.",
    "I improved tremendously as a writer in this course. I developed a better knowledge of how to approach writing personal essays, the nuances of storytelling, and the strategies necessary to keep a reader involved. I also discovered writers in this course that I will follow in the future. The essays chosen were engaging and intellectual."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I do not have many weaknesses to point too in this course.  The readings are both entertaining and easily accessible.  The pacing is a good level.  The structure of submitting drafts for feedback and then revising them (sometimes with the aid of workshops) is great.  I felt somewhat restricted by prompt 3, writing about a person, as the condition that we couldn't write about a peer shut down an idea that I had been working on ahead of time, but that is pretty much my only critique.",
    "Strength: very engaging class, some essays are interesting to read, got to read some genres that I wouldn't really read on my own \r\nWeakness: as a stem person, I thought the readings for some days were boring or long, the class itself feels like high school class because it is discussion base",
    "I loved this course and can't think of a way to improve it!",
    "I really liked the way that we read essays in the style of essays that we were going to be writing. I was able to appreciate the way that other writers in the past have executed certain styles and then do it myself. The only improvement that I would mention is possibly having a little more variety in the class periods somehow because they were all structured very similarly.",
    "I thought the strengths of the class were that it was very contemporary allowing students to remain engage all of the time, however, extracting the skills we see in writing was great, but I wouldve liked to see more examples of how students can incorporate them in their writing.",
    "This course was very engaging because there was a lot of variety in the essays we read. With three or four essays to read each class, there was always at least one that I found very interesting. The small class size was really effective because it forced each student to be attentive and participate, and it also allowed us to get to know each other. It was a good course to take as a first year because it focused on developing some fundamental skills, while pushing beyond the basics of high school English classes. That being said, this class was pretty similar to some high school English classes, like AP Lang, so some students might find it repetitive.",
    "ENGL 120 offers a fantastic mix of reading and writing. The works we discuss are all brilliant and inspiring, and the course is setup in a way that allows for plenty of experimentation and reinvention with each essay.",
    "A strength of this course is having to submit a rough draft and getting great feedback for final draft.",
    "This course challenged me both as a thinker and writer. The discussions in class were captivating and sincere. The course packet was incredible - all of the essays chosen were connected to the theme we were discussing in class and helped give us guidance for writing our essay."

   "comments": [
    "I already have.  This course is a great example of one where I didn't feel dragged down by any of the work and also could clearly see how I could be improving.  My biggest disappointment related to this course is that I can't take it again.",
    "Yes, if you like to read and write. If you are a stem person and want an easy writing credit, the class is probably not for you. You also need to put in good amount of effort to get the most out of the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! The readings were fun and engaging and the freedom you have with the essays is really fun. You learn a lot about different types of writing and the essays are so fun to write.",
    "Yes, I definitely would. Not only did my writing improve, which is a very important skill to have, but I also enjoyed the readings and class discussions a lot. I think it was a very useful class to take as a foundation and also just to read such interesting essays.",
    "Yes! It was a fun and educational experience.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to first years who want to develop their reading and writing skills in a very supportive and productive environment. Also because the class was so small, I was easily able to make friends.",
    "Take this course over ENGL 114 or the likes, you will have a lot more fun. It made me truly fall in love with writing. The readings are diverse and captivating, and the essays let you explore topics that you feel passionate about.",
    "Absolutely, there are no exams, just writing and reading essays!",
    "Without a doubt. This course improves your reasoning and strategy as a writer. The professor is engaging and interesting. Highly recommend."
