In many ways, this course teaches you to read again, slowly, attentively, and collaboratively. I'm very grateful to have taken this course in a year like 2020, and redefining through the lens of different philosophers how we relate and connect to others.",
                "I learned how to think through the questions that existentialist philosophers and thinkers thought through. This is not a course that teaches you what existentialism is in a neat, post-facto definition. In this course, you do the work of existentialism. Asking questions about the self, our limits, our freedom, our choices, how we understand our place in the world is the work of this class. I read a lot of amazing and wonderfully confusing works along the way, and I was constantly given the platform to reflect on how the works and questions of existentialism relate to my everyday life.",

More importantly, it linked existentialism to more modern works that may not typically be thought of in that context and brought in a science, tech., society bend to the syllabus. Through these readings, I learned how to look for applications of philosophy and deepen my analytical reading of texts in general. Our final paper was also a rewarding challenge by making me engage in a type of writing I don't typically get a chance to do in more courses by analyzing only one or two pieces.",

You learn how to read and start to parse through dense philosophical texts and relate it back to your own personal life. In this iteration of the class specifically, we explored existentialism along with STS (Science, Technology, and Society) and learned about how these existentialist concepts can be expanded into scientific thought. We also expanded these concepts into race theory and feminism."

                "This course was excellent.",
                "This course was incredible. The readings always made me reflect deeply on my own life, and the professor and TA strongly encouraged us to bring these thoughts into our weekly responses and into class discussions. Sometimes the readings were a bit dense and quite difficult for someone like me who's never taken a philosophy course (or a feminist \/ race theory course, which would've been relevant for some of the later readings).",
                "I think that this course was an amazing chance to read so many different existentialist authors. Professor Khawaja does an amazing job connecting the authors and guiding the weekly discussions. I think the only area I would suggest improvement is that I would love to have the option for the final paper to explore some of the authors more in depth with additional works.",
                "To be transparent, I had mixed feelings about this class at first. The content was fascinating, and we were beginning to unravel core issues in the text and bouncing off ideas in class, yet the class would end without satisfying resolution. It led me to reevaluate the implicit pact I had developed in my mind about college courses: students do the reading, share their thoughts in class, have their thinking affirmed or challenged by peers and the professor, and emerge with consensus, often aligning with the professor's view. But this class is different: it forces you to wrestle with the confusion and frustration of not fully understanding an idea, and read it collaboratively until you do. The professor acts as a guide without revealing answers. The result is much more rewarding and enables reading and understanding with confidence.",
                "Strengths: The syllabus is amazing. The works are fantastic. Professor Khawaja is exceedingly brilliant and thoughtful. You get to ask, puzzle over, and think through some really important and difficult questions about conceptions of the self. The final project is wonderful and gives you a lot of freedom to interact with the texts in ways interesting to you. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It is tempting for me to say that I wish we had more solid definitions given to us in this classthat I wish we were told existentialism is this and isn't that. But philosophy doesn't always work that way. That said, sometimes I wish the seminars were structured a bit more so that we could hear more insights from Professor Khawaja.",
                "I loved how much we were still able to engage during seminar, even though it was virtual. This course has been the closest of any of my courses to feeling normal during the pandemic. I do wish that we had some sort of writing component throughout the semester that we received a grade\/feedback on just so I would have felt more prepared going into the final paper. Especially since it was a class that invited in non-philosophy majors, and many STEM majors this semester, it would've been a useful exercise.",

                "I think the discussion threads were a good, manageable homework assignment during Covid. I do think that two hours of straight conversation, for any class, can be a bit draining over Zoom, so I would have appreciated if perhaps it was split a bit more with a mini lecture \/ explanation of the course material in the first half followed by our discussion in the second half.",

                "Yes. It is a rare course at Yale in the kind of texts and methods with which it lets you engage. Professor Khawaja is also an excellent teacher: this is not the kind of course you should think you shouldn't take because you could read the existentialist canon yourself. The texts she selects are unexpected and fascinating; additionally, she challenges you to think deeply and personally about them in a way I've never previously encountered.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to any other student - regardless of your background in philosophy - to ponder some extremely interesting questions about the self\/identity\/who we are alongside passionate classmates from all disciplines.",
                "Yes! The syllabus is amazing, we read a wide variety of authors (there's sure to be at least one that you really enjoy) from a variety of disciplines. Professor Khawaja and Alison were also great at helping guide the discussion each week to help you glean deeper insights.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students interested in some of the following questions: How do we pursue a way of understanding the world, when we ourselves are transformed in the process of asking that question? How can we pursue truth in which ambiguity is not the enemy, but the condition? How do we relate to one another, express love, or question socially-imprinted identities? How can we understand the racialized and colonialized mind? What does quantum physics have to teach us about social theory? You'll find many more to reflect on and have your mind blown by. With that said, you might get more out of the class if you take an intro philosophy, if only to be familiar with the other philosophers and concepts these ideas wrestle with.",
                "YES!!!! If you get into this course, take it without a doubt!! The material is incredibly challenging, but Prof. Khawaja and Alison are so patient, generous, and willing to help students develop our understanding of the texts and work through our ideas! This is one of those rare courses at Yale that will actually change the way you think, and will push you to reflect critically and think more deeply than you ever thought possible. I believe that very few professors could pull off such an ambitious project as the one of this class, but both Prof. Khawaja and Alison worked very hard to build a space that felt supportive rather than destructive and argumentative, and that made such a difference!!!",
                "I cannot recommend this class (or really any other with Professor Khawaja) enough. This course was unlike any other Philosophy class I have taken at Yale and I loved its orientation towards questions of being and living in the world. A combination of really engaging material, great classmates, and dedicated instructors made for an awesome classroom space.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in thinking through the self, freedom, our limits, the ways in which we have been shaped by society, and more. If you need lots of definitions given to you, I wouldn't recommend this course. That's not to say that Professor Khawaja won't give you wonderful explanations if you ask. But this is a course of doing the work, of thinking through the questions of existentialist philosophers. It's not a course, where you just memorize what each philosopher said about something with neat terms and dates and prescriptive definitions. In that sense, if you are excited about getting to ask the same questions that great philosophers asked, in a very supportive and wonderful enviornment, I highly recommend it!",
                "Absolutely!! Existentialism is such a powerful and thought provoking philosophy that will definitely change the way you see the world and think about yourself. It seems super meta and at times it is but you also come to understand how many areas\/fields existentialist thought can be applied to",
                "Yes! Prof. Khawaja and Alison were wonderful and engaging, and the material was engaging. As someone who hasn't taken many philosophy or religious study seminars, this course was accessible while still being a fun intellectual challenge. The material ended up feeling relevant and came up a lot in my conversations outside of class in ways I would never have expected.",
