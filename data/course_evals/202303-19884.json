I don't think I've thought about the relationship between theory- conceptualization - operationalization, but what I learned through this class has changed how to read and engage with political science papers.",

                "strengths: prof khan, the papers, and her feedback and office hours - i really enjoyed the vignette development exercise in particular \r\nweaknesses: time management during seminars",
                "The course was highly organized and every session felt productive. Dr. Khan had a clear roadmap to guide each session and it was clear that she had a specific idea of what she wanted us to get from each discussion. I like the range of empirical approaches sampled in the syllabus and enjoyed that we got to engage some theoretical work too. My only suggested change is regarding the timeline for assignments--it would be helpful if we had the option of submitting reading responses during the first couple of weeks of the semester (otherwise deadlines tend to cluster around the same time).",
                "Strengths: Professor Khan is a great seminar leader passionate about the subject. She even had us critique her work, which was great since we saw her insights and thoughts into what she was considering while writing her paper and what she would change if she could go back and replicate the study. The application of the content in our term papers (Graduate option) was fantastic since many of us took this an opportunity to build the methodology and conceptual sections of studies we're working on or will work in, including research, dissertation ideas, and senior essays. She also gave helpful advice if you chose to submit a rough draft, making the assignment feel less high stakes and far more educational. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The first two weeks were dense in theory, and while it's 100% necessary for the course to make any sense, I wish we had a bit more framework or a roadmap for approaching those readings. Additionally, we only ever discussed half the readings in the second part of the semester (we usually only discussed the measurement papers) - reworking those weeks would help us know what to focus on.",
                "I think the reading list was certainly a strength. It was well organized and the papers were chosen so thoughtfully. However, sometimes I felt the class discussion was lacking and might be benefited for more prompt feedback.",
                "Generally, I was satisfied with the course.",
                "I think having small assignments that we can build on for the final project helped us develop more developed ideas by the end of the course."

                "Yes! especially if you want to develop robust skills useful across social science research",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I would especially recommend to first-year PhD students (it would facilitate effective research design for other classes/projects).",
                "I recommend this course to any political science, sociology, or history major! Rarely do methods courses focus on conceptualization - there's usually more emphasis on the measurement component. After this course, constructing research questions feels more manageable because I know what to consider when creating questions. I can better critique other works of scholarship that may take certain concepts for granted (which we saw throughout the course significantly weakened their arguments or contributions). Since the class also has a lot of graduate students, the discussions are usually solid and nuanced. There was a wide range of disciplines and interests between the graduate political science and undergraduate students. This made this feel like an actual seminar where you learn from each other, the readings, and the professor.",
                "Yes, it's a great research design class. I think it's also unique in terms of the material it covers.",
                "Sure! This course will helps students to understand why we should care about conceptualization and measurement, and how we can do them in a rigorous way.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The importance of thoughtful development of concepts is something I had not realized until this course, and it will stick with me throughout my career in the social sciences. Although methodology may not seem like the most fun subject matter to some, this course made me realize how important it is to not overlook this step in the research process. I think the ideas taught in this course are crucial to all types of science, and I highly recommend students find the time to take this course. This course has allowed me to read scholarly articles and apply a critical lens to them in a way I was previously unable to do. In addition to the important subject matter, the course is incredibly well organized. When I took the course, I was one of the few undergraduate students in the class  and although I did find the course difficult, listening and engaging with graduate students in my fields of interest was undoubtedly one of the most beneficial things towards my learning.",
