The biweekly problem sets accurately represented the material covered in the previous two weeks, and the final problem set felt challenging but fair. Professor Dayal is a great lecturer, offers a lot of opportunities for extra help, and makes the class really engaging, even for newcomers to semantics.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness might be the length and difficulty level of some assigned readings. For students with a background in linguistics, they might be decipherable, but other students might struggle more. Because of the amount of reading for some weeks, I had to cut corners and therefore couldn't be as prepared when starting a new unit. A potential solution could be breaking the reading into sections, so students would know which parts should be done before which lecture.",

Prof. Dayal is the best person to teach this  she is very forgiving and patient   but this is not the class to take if you are looking for a QR credit.",
