                "The course focused on the idea of formal/\"book-style\"/\"shu1 mian4\" Chinese vs colloquial Chinese, trying to teach us the more formal ways to say the things that maybe we already knew how to say in an informal setting. I learned about some formal grammar structures and vocabulary. Also, as someone whose parents are more \"Americanized\" than the parents of other people in my class, being in the heritage class was great since it gave me the chance to learn more about how other Chinese Americans experience their ethnicity.",
                "I learned to read and write Chinese in a more formal setting with advanced sentence and grammar patterns, as well as practice my oral language skills in class.",
                "I learned many grammatical sentence structures, words, and how to speak more confidently.",
                "More advanced conversational and formal Chinese regarding topics including food, heritage, politics, relationships, and more.",
                "This course provided a strong foundation is Chinese writing and grammar in addition to some speaking skills.",
                "I learned more about Chinese culture and improved my reading and writing comprehension skills.",
                "This course gave me a comfortable space to learn and speak Chinese while learning from my mistakes. My essay-writing skills have improved through the 3 essays that I wrote, especially since we had to edit and revise the essays multiple times. We also learned a lot of more formal phrases that I would otherwise not encounter at home.",
                "From taking this course, I significantly expanded my knowledge of Chinese writing by a few hundred characters. I was also challenged to write my first essay in Chinese, and encouraged to improve my fluency. All in all, this course provided me a fully comprehensive space to improve my Chinese, covering everything from writing, memorizing, to speaking.",
                "I improved my reading, writing, and speaking skills in Chinese.",

                "Strengths: Xu laoshi is so good!! She is super considerate, and she really cares about our learning and general wellbeing. She explains the grammatical concepts very well, and she always has good answers when I ask why a certain usage is wrong etc. She also encourages us in such a supportive way\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of any.",
                "I really liked that it was a small class, and I got to know my classmates and my professor (Xu Laoshi) really well. Not only did the size allow for closeness with my peers, it encouraged me to participate and engage more closely with the material. The course moved at a suitable pace as well; there were times that I felt a little pressured but Xu Laoshi was always understanding and accommodating.",
                "I like how this course has a small number of students. I think it could be improved if there were more oral practices (more time to practice speaking in class).",
                "S: clear feedback throughout, consistent workload but not too difficult, very supportive and positive classroom environment\r\nW: it felt a bit like the last two weeks of class had a lot of work crammed into a short time period.",
                "The course definitely improves your Chinese skills and the projects and essays are enjoyable. Discussions on a wider range of topics could help increase engagement.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The grammar and vocabulary lessons",
                "Strengths: the curriculum was very relatable and applicable. I loved how we learned about food, dating, chinatown, and being Chinese-American -- all of the vocab and content was engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish the textbook included other ways that the vocab words we learned are used for. Because I personally wanted to know, I had to individually search up words, but I feel like it would be really useful to integrate that within the course more frequently.",
                "The biggest strengths of this course was our teacher, Xu. She created a comfortable atmosphere in the class which encouraged us to learn even though the material was challenging, especially for me. I could always count on her if I felt like I was struggling, and it made language learning more of a marathon than a sprint. I have no complaints about the course!",
                "Professor Xu was amazing at making the class engaging and all the material was very structured, easy to follow, and comprehensive. Not much to be improved, very excellent class overall.",
                "We had frequent quizzes and essays to make sure we knew how to write characters, which was helpful because before I had only typed characters for the most part. I think that if we could more practice speaking in small groups that would be good."

                "Although I generally believe that school courses are not the most efficient way to learn language, I found this course useful in that it helped me stay motivated to work on my Chinese during the academic year. I think that if you are truly looking to learn Chinese or any other language, the best option would be to do self-learning in your free time or over the summer, but given that it is often hard (for me at least) to motivate myself to keep informal/personal commitments during the school year, I found this course useful because it gave me a structure in which to learn and an external motivator to do so.",
                "Definitely! Xu Laoshi is one of the best professors I've had so far; she is so kind and understanding and really tries to help all of her students improve their Chinese proficiencies, no matter what level they may be at. The course is also well-structured and you get to learn a lot about various aspects of Chinese culture.",
                "Yes, I was able to greatly improve my Chinese language abilities- speaking, writing, and reading.",
                "Yes! Xu Laoshi is great, the class is structured well for learning, and I always looked forward to it. Would recommend highly.",
                "Yes, it does a great job of preparing to ultimately visit or stay in China.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are proficient in Chinese but would like to improve their reading and writing skills.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class to any student that has a basic understanding of Chinese but wishes to expand their Chinese knowledge. A lot of our class was centered around having conversations as a class or with small groups, which made it really easy to get to know the entire class. By the end of the class and our final project (which was to create a movie with 3 other students), I felt like our entire class had really bonded with each other. This made it really easy and comfortable to make mistakes, because I felt like everyone in the class really cared about learning and improving each other's Chinese level.",
                "If youre a heritage speaker without as much experience in reading and writing, this class is definitely for you. You are required to learn at least a few hundred characters throughout the semester, and the feedback you receive on essays and homework is detailed and comprehensive. I would absolutely recommend this course!",
                "Yes! This course does not have too much of a workload and also is very engaging since Professor Xu does not make the class boring at all. If you want to improve your Chinese, this course will definitely help you with that.",
                "Yes! Great way to improve Chinese vocab and fluency in a relatively low pressure environment."
