   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course would be better if it focused more on problem solving and less on proofs. Oftentimes, class time was spent showing background information rather than solving actual math problems. As a result of this, when I tried to start my pset I would be confused about how to begin problems. Also, because there weren't opportunities to try problems in class, I would run into extra road bumps when I did problems myself and have to go to peer tutor hours frequently to iron them out.",
    "Strengths: Lectures are clear, the problem sets help with learning the content.\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook is unclear and poorly written in some sections.",
    "I think that instructors need to ensure that students understand when the theorems are all applied instead of just teaching us theorems.",
    "Strengths: There are resources to help you out, such as review sessions, peer tutors (Seriously, go to them! Biggest regret this semester is not going to one until there were 3 weeks left in the course), and Thomas is friendly too. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's a difficult course, and it's boring too. I consider myself a moderate math person, but the lectures were sometimes hard for me to pay attention to because I didn't find the material particularly engaging. I heard introductory courses are usually boring, and it gets exciting later on.",
    "A definitie weakness is the variable teaching level across all the TAs\/ teachers. Some teachers emphasize certain sections\/methods more which in fact, are useless\/inconsequential on the exams (Which are written by one professor).",
    "This course is not structured in a good way. If you haven't taken multivariable calculus before, you will have a difficult road ahead of you. The tests are hard and graded very harshly. I recommend studying a little multi before you begin and going to office hours, especially peer office hours frequently. If you don't consider yourself good at math, I would try to get one of the more easily understood professors, Flor, Sudesh, or maybe Miki. Thomas was a very intelligent mathematician, but I think he was too intelligent for me.",
    "This course provided its students with many resources for help and instruction. The review sessions held by the instructors were beneficial to studying and the extra problems\/sample exams were helpful in studying. The weakness of this course was that many of the students had already taken multivariable calculus, which meant that those who did not were at a disadvantage when it came to learning and understanding the material as quickly and performing as well on the exams.",
    "This course is strong in teaching you how the early lessons connect to the later ones and making you use past knowledge to understand the more challenging lessons. Weaknesses are with how different teachers teach at much different rates and styles. Therefore, some students have different preparation for the tests that may not be adequate at times. Sometimes, lessons are just glossed over and focused on for proofs without showing us how to apply it, perhaps due to a lack of time.",
    "I was very disappointed by the quality of instruction of my TA, Thomas Hille. In addition, some of the students who led office hours were mediocre at best. The review sessions before each midterm, though, were excellent.",
    "Could have been more practice in class (worksheets) and less pure note taking"

   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they need to take it for their major. Otherwise, it would be a lot of work for no reason.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You are guaranteed to develop a deeper understanding of calculus and 3D space through this course. The workload is completely manageable. Problem sets take about 3 hours per weak and help you to learn the content.",
    "Don't take this unless you absolutely need to for a major and see if you can Credit\/D it.",
    "Yes, but only if you have an interest in math as it was very frustrating how a lot of people in this course had already taken multivariable in high school.",
    "Don't take this class just for fun or just for a QR. If you need it for your major, really take it seriously from day 1, shop around for a good section, and don't let yourself get behind.",
    "yes, but it really depends on the teacher.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking to further their knowledge and understanding of calculus.",
    "I would recommend it only of the other student did not study under Thomas Hille, who was my TA. Whenever I went to another TA's review session, the concepts became significantly clearer because of the large gap in the quality of explanation. Because of this, I believe that my performance on the exams and my understanding of the concepts would have been stronger had I been placed into another TA's section.",
    "Yes but they have to love math because it is a lot of work."
