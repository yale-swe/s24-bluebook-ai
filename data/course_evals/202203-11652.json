                "I learned to construct basic integrated assessment models for determining climate change mitigation policies. I also gained experience in reading and evaluating economics journal articles.",
                "Nordhaus essentially lectures on the various basic parts of his noble prize-winning economic-climate model. You learn some of the basics of environmental economics (demographics\/growth, resources and use, Hotelling model), and then other topics that closely relate (behavioral economics, integrated assessment models, impacts, discounting, mitigation, policies, uncertainty).",
                "I learned a wealth of information about energy economics. Professor Nordhaus gave a very interesting overview of the subject and made the field feel very tangible.",
                "Learned about demography, resource economics, energy, integrated assessment models, game theory, and behavioral economics. Basically this was a survey course through the lens of the most challenging topic in economics: public goods and externalities",
                "Overview of the economics behind climate change, modeling, etc.",
                "We got a decent how-level overview of factors producing climate change and mitigation strategies informed by large economic models. We skipped over much of the detail and math, although we used Excel heavily in the latter half of the course to model climate change systems",
                "general overview of climate and energy economics.",

                "Broadly learned about the economics of natural resources and climate change. The energy component of the course is mostly focused on natural resources\/Hotelling theory for modeling oil\/fossil-fuel extraction and prices. We took lots of detours and spent weeks on other economic subjects building towards the core of the class. I think I was surprised by how long it took us to get to energy and topics like cap and trade vs. carbon pricing, but later realized thats the nature of large-scale climate-change economics: Building an IAM and modeling future damages from temperature increase require all these other economic sub-disciplines (population dynamics, a little behavioral econ, discounting and interest rates, econ. of uncertainty), so we spent weeks on each of those as well. We essentially built our own simple integrated assessment model in Excel with the classs problem sets, which was occasionally a little frustrating\/tedious but also a very cool real-world exercise. Learned about debates around choosing the right discount rate (which has a big influence on future damages,) improved Excel skills, and grew to see how connected different fields of economics can be. This course incorporates small parts of many.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: interesting topic, challenging to think about, interesting view on climate\r\nWeaknesses: lectures too long, not super engaging, material is somewhat dry, problem sets feel very niche",
                "Professor Nordhaus teaching was excellent and made every lecture very interesting. Furthermore, the TA sessions were very insightful as well!",
                "Strengths: the course hits all the most important points in the area of climate economics, and provides a foundation for further inquiry into the discipline. If you want to understand why there is no alternative to carbon pricing, this class will show you. The problem sets are honestly fun and provide useful experience for constructing climate and economic models. \r\nWeaknesses: much of the discussion in the course is very superficial, the readings are never discussed in class, lectures are often rambling with no clear structure, the instructor presents anecdotal and outdated information as facts, the exams have totally random questions on them and there is scant information provided about their content in advance. The professor literally gave us a midterm from a different course so we could see what kinds of exams he likes to write, and nothing at all to prepare for the final.",
                "The course gave a great overview of the various topics that contribute to economic-climate models. It felt a little disorganized at times with few throughlines, but if you're interested in energy and economics the topics are all very important.",
                "There is barely any TA support for tests and problem sets, and since the lectures only cover the theories, the extension of knowledge to quantitative problems lacks teaching and clarification. The content is super fascinating and relevant, but I really wish the TAs were more transparent in helping us.",
                "Professor Nordhaus organizes the class in a very interesting manner and makes lectures that are interesting and engaging. The only weakness is that the class is geared towards people with economics and environmental backgrounds, and most students only had one or the other. So, it could be difficult for students who didn't have the background of the other subject to play a little bit of catchup.",
                "The course was very interesting but taught at a relatively low level of understanding. Could have been improved with maybe more rigor or pace. The strengths were the notes, TAs, and obviously the professor were great at conveying information. I felt like I learned a lot with each new class from people who clearly knew a lot about the field",
                "Strengths: interesting content from a leader in the field.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: quite disorganized and content is a bit all over the place; lectures delve into challenging concepts at a more surface-level, which is contrasted by the difficult problem sets and exams; curriculum could use fine-tuning, lack of structure inhibited ability to learn.",
                "This course has so much potential. An unconventional approach to a very important field with a Nobel laureate professor. I think where this course falls short is the depth of knowledge presented. Lectures seemed a bit slow and we skipped over a lot of the foundational math. This definitely made the class easier, but the high-level things we learned were also less applicable.",
                "very interesting material though felt a little out of the picture at times. it was hard to relate the material to tangible economic concepts in the present day. \r\npsets were not very intuitive.",
                "Strengths - gamification,\r\ninteraction with the audience\r\nholistic approach",
                "It covered too many different topics and was often hard to relate one class to the next.",
                "Strengths: I loved listening to Professor Nordhauss lectures and hearing him think out loud, especially when he went off script. He is intimidatingly accomplished in this field but comes across as down to earth, light-spirited, and cheerful. Lectures could occasionally feel a bit dry, but the general arc of the course was interesting and I looked forward to them: felt like a low-pressure chance to learn and a nice break from a couple other classes in my schedule where I constantly felt like I needed to be on alert and straining to understand during class. Also did a decent amount of interactive class activities in lecture; Course gives a final paper option, nice to have that flexibility and think I got more out of a paper and enjoyed it more than I would have an exam; the final problem sets where we made an integrated assessment model were really cool and a great application of course concepts, though occasionally hard to interpret instructions; readings are unofficially for enrichment and dont add a headache; good opportunities to get help or go over Excel\/math fundamentals in the beginning of the course. Weaknesses: Professor Nordhaus did give us a road map for the course in the beginning, but I occasionally felt lost when I zoomed out and thought about our progression. Jumped between topics like population dynamics and Hotelling and behavioral econ before going back to climate. The ultimate point is that theyre all tied into economic climate modeling, but the course occasionally felt like it veered away from its title too much; Sections are optional and were hit or miss, sometimes very helpful but sometimes felt ad hoc. A simple slide deck prepared beforehand for sections or a clear goal for each one might help make everyone feel useful.",
                "Strengths: Very relevant to contemporary issues such as climate change and energy crises. This is unique among economics courses at Yale, which typically focus a lot more on academic papers \/ theoretical issues. This focuses on real world applications and skips past a lot of the unnecessary academic jargon surrounding the issues. Also very cool to learn about economics of climate change from a Nobel Prize winner who essentially created the field. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The beginning is somewhat a review of ECON 122 (especially if you had Nordhaus) but it becomes relevant in the second half, so it's almost nice to get a refresher so close to the new material being taught. Somewhat boring at times if you're not super passionate about climate change."

                "Probably not -- it feels only relevant to economics students.",

                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this class if you know very little about the topic and are willing to do some quantitative work. If you're familiar with resource economics and carbon pricing, you will learn very little. If you're an Energy Studies student and want an easy credit, this class is for you.",
                "If you're interested in energy and economics definitely take this course. Hard to find a better course that gives an overview of the current topics, issues, and ideas in the space. If you're somewhat interested in energy and are an economics person I would still likely recommend it; Nordhaus is fascinating and clearly a very intelligent and curious person.",
                "I would only recommend this class if you're sure you like the content or are interested in the theories of environmental economics leading up to the midterm. Be prepared for questionable grading schemes and slightly out of pocket exam questions.",
                "I would recommend this course very strongly. It was engaging, and I learned so much about climate change that I feel is important to have as any citizen of the world.",
                "The most interesting economics course I have taken taught by a Nobel prize winner. Everyone should take this course not just because it is fun, interesting, and not too hard, but because this is the most important economics challenge of our time and everyone should understand it",
                "If you're very much interested in the content and willing to keep yourself engaged the entire time.",
                "I would recommend the course, although it is perhaps not as applicable as the course description makes it out to be. Workload is pretty manageable and content is not too complicated.",
                "Definitely. Nordhaus is an icon himself so to have the opportunity to take a course from him was very fulfilling. If you're interested in climate economics, and learning ways to i.e. price exhaustible resources, this is a great course.",
                "Absolutely yes",
                "Maybe, if you care about climate change and want to take a class with Nordhaus.",
                "Maybe\/leaning yes? I think Im happy I took it given the rest of my schedule but as someone with a preexisting interest in climate\/energy and who had done core econ requirements already, Im not sure how much new I gained from the course. It was definitely cool to take a class on this subject with Professor Nordhaus. If you have some exposure to climate science and econ, then nothing in the class will seem deeply revelatory but I still enjoyed it as 1) a broad overview\/refresher of econ and climate change and 2) a chance to learn about how Professor Nordhaus put together the DICE model. Honestly, one of the biggest things I took away was just how valuable curiosity, a love of learning, and a sense of fascination with the world can be. Nordhaus comes across as so naturally curious, and it was very refreshing to hear him speak in lectures each week, and I think I gained a lot from his side comments during class.",
                "Yes. Very good Econ elective if you're looking for low workload and pretty interesting content with a legend of a Professor. Content is very engaging at times and very boring at times, with 5 psets spread across and course and a midterm and final exam. Exam is optional if you would rather write a paper, only downside is 50% of your final grade. Overall recommend, very cool taking climate change economics course with Nordhaus."
