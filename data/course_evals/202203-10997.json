                "The class overall a great experience. I have two complaints:\r\n\r\nThe critics who come in for mid and final review usually  don't know our project prompts until the hour of, so they often give useless comments like \"maybe you could have tried this\", which would be helpful in the initial stages of the project, but after having decided the theme and worked hard on a project, receiving comments on how to improve what is ACTUALLY being presented would be much more helpful. Also, I wish they would do a \"how to present an architecture project\" workshop because even if you have a great project, if you don't present it well the idea is lost.\r\n\r\nThe class budget of $200 seems like a lot, but once you go through weekly crits of printing costs of $15+, the money is gone instantly. Reimbursement for the course is also a pain, receiving petty cash would probably be more effective, since everyone uses $200+ but can't get the money they used due to difficulty of reimbursement.",
                "This course was fantastic. Great introductory course into architecture.",
                "Love the conceptual approach to the class and the teaching is incredible and really great resources provided. its very fast paced and a ton of very constant, demanding work but teaching time very accommodating \r\n\r\nI wish there was a way of getting feedback besides at reviews eg something at midterm to discuss progress",
                "Strengths: broad, intellectually challenging and stimulating assignments, room to explore and pursue your own ideas.\r\nWeaknesses: more clarity on expectations for amount of work produced. Sometimes a little vague.",
                "Strengths: highly engaged TAs and professors, great cohort to bond with and expand architectural thinking.\r\nWeaknesses: high workload, potentially could be trimmed down to avoid work for works sake. A lot of stress since this is the required class for the major."

                "The most fun studio class I've ever taken, especially because of Trattie! So much room to think, learn, design, and make. Less emphasis on technical design skills and more on the intellectual arguments of your work. Great cohort of students that worked, learned, and hung out together in the studio for many hours a week.",
                "It is a course required for the architecture major, though I wouldn't recommend for anyone who isn't in architecture. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the projects (thinking, drawing, 3D modeling, photography, etc.). It is a course that pushed me and I grew a lot, but definitely experienced a lot of stress in the process."
