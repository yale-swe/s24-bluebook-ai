Lectures covered key components of these novels and gave students insights on how to approach the material. We were shown examples of important literary themes and encouraged to track their development throughout the novels. You learn to contextualize key themes and expand on them in writing assignments.",
                "I learned about the meaning of life :)",
                "I gained a much fuller knowledge of Russian literature from the late 19th century and literary analysis.",
                "About the novels of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky.",
                "This course gave me the opportunity to read some incredible books by incredible authors. It's a great introduction to Russian literature, which has its own unique aesthetics and philosophies.",

                "I came away with a better understanding of who Tolstoy and Dostoevsky were as people and writers, and how their evolving identities informed their writing.",
                "This course helped me to become a more critical reader, to analyze larger texts and to explore larger,more philosophical questions within literature. The close reading assignments were specifically designed for this development of critical reading.",
                "We read several major works by Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Particular attention was paid to close reading, historical context and textual analysis. This course is actually pretty philosophical as well  questions about freedom, morality, choice, love, etc. are definitely present. Sections focused on creative ways of thinking about these texts (e.g., acting them out, connecting to works of art). We received extensive feedback on our written assignments as well.",

                "Strengths: the books are incredible\r\nWeaknesses: section was super mid, lecture was mid, there was way too much emphasis on textual analysis\r\nStrengths: the books are incredible",
                "Strengths: a good breadth of material and excellent lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the discussions felt unfulfilling.",
                "The qualities of Professor Brunson's lectures were incredible.",
                "The lectures were consistently very good and I loved the relaxed vibe in section. It's a lot of reading and many students able to do it all, which I think we found frustrating. But I think that weakness is mine, not the courses. Another huge strength was professor Brunson's flexibility with the schedule. She regularly moved back assignments by reading the room of the class so to speak, and that was absolutely crucial. Without her flexibility this class would have been less joyful and more stressful.",
                "This course had the most engaging lectures I have ever had at Yale. Maybe it be improved by having more guidance for paper writing?",
                "Lectures are the biggest strength: you leave feeling inspired, thinking about the \"Big Questions.\"",
                "More consideration of Russian imperialism is an absolute mustmajor bias in the teaching of this course.",
                "This is an awesome course. Professor Brunson's lectures are AMAZING. Profound, moving, wonderful, thought provoking. The kind of thing that sticks with you for the rest of your life. And the books are just wonderful. I like how we stayed close to the texts for most of the course, while also talking about reading these texts in light of the war in Ukraine in the last week or so. Section with Fiona was also a total highlight, so if she's teaching again, I would definitely recommend taking the course with her as your TA.",
                "Reading was kind of a lot but the lectures were interesting and the discussion sections were great. I really enjoyed the readings too so despite being a lot, I really enjoyed them",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Wonderful lectures, amazing books\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- none",
                "strengths: great selection of works, very engaging lectures \r\nweaknesses: the reading load was, at times, unmanageable. I think spending more time on the two main books and perhaps cutting out some of the smaller works would facilitate student learning better",
                "I liked the short but frequent assignments",
                "Strengths: Prof Brunson is incredible. Her lectures were fun and engaging - I would look forward to them! I also appreciated how flexible the paper prompts were. \r\nWeaknesses: I thought the amount of reading expected was close to impossible to juggle with other Yale courses. I wish the syllabus removed 2-3 of the shorter readings (like Sevastopol in December, The Dream of a Ridiculous Man) to allow more time for the longer works. I also thought the 4th paper felt a bit unnecessary, especially because it was due so close to the final paper and in a period when nearly all Yale courses have things due.",
                "Strengths: great lectures by prof, students taking the course also tend to be engaging and interesting, and of course the books! Short essays are prob also the right move for this course \r\nWeaknesses: TFs hit or miss; personally I wouldve preferred more time on the big novels than the short stories",
                "Brilliant course",
                "Strengths: \r\ngreat readings\r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\nfor people in their underclassmen years",
                "amazing course",
                "Strengths: super compelling lectures by Prof. Brunson, great reading list\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the frequent short papers and weekly reading responses sometimes felt like more work than necessary (but it was nice not to have exams or long papers)",
                "The lectures and section were so engaging, fascinating. I think that yes you have to read a lot but the pay off is so worth it.",
                "Strengths: Every lecture by Professor Brunson astounded me. Each lecture was like watching a movie. Sometimes I don't know if it was more entertaining to read the books we read or listen to Professor Brunson dissect them and uncover hidden meanings. Weaknesses: This is not a weakness of the course as much as it is my own weakness, but the readings can feel very dull and prolonged at times.",
                "Strengths - Prof. Brunson's lectures are great and clearly very thought out, the syllabus is well done and the books are honestly quite good, section was wonderful!\r\nWeaknesses - assignments were a bit backloaded and could do for being more evenly spread out",
                "The lectures in this course were PHENOMENAL! I have always opted to take seminars but this lecture blew me away. I felt inspired and motivated each time I left lecture and made me see the novels in ways I had not thought about. \r\n\r\nWhile it is not a weakness, students interested in taking this class should be aware of the high workload. To truly get the most out of this course, I think it's important to complete every reading (and not skim). As such, I recommend that prospective students are aware of this before registering for the class.",
                "I think the section format of this class was fairly weak. I'd like to have a little more directed learning around the texts since they're very hard to just sit down and read without any sense of where you're headed. \r\nLectures were always interesting, even if you were behind in the book.",
                "Readings were a reasonable length. Lectures were quite hit or miss- some really contributed to my understanding of the texts (the more biographical lectures and those discussing different critics opinions on the texts), while others felt unnecessary and focused on unimportant topics. I wish we could have focused more on the deep philosophical issues discussed in these texts, rather than their genre/literary techniques. When discussion in section was allowed to occur freely, it was very valuable to hear different perspectives on the same writing.",
                "Reading guides would be very nice. Great class.",
                "NO WEAKNESSES!!!!",
                "The strengths: the excellent Professor, Molly Brunson, and the equally excellent teaching fellows. They, working with some of the best novels ever written, made this course one of the very best i've taken at Yale. The only downside in my opinion was the sheer amount of reading--I found it nearly impossible to get through it all, which made it so that I was unable to engage with lecture/section as much as I would have wanted.",

                "Yes!",
                "No. These great novels are soured by a not-so-great teacher. She cares very little about students learning the material, lectures by reading a script, and creates writing assignments that do not better help with an individual's understanding of these novels or their writing skills. She is also rude and unprofessional in meetings. She postures and fakes an intellectual environment, but behind her academic and verbose language is very little substance. Avoid this Professor at all costs, but the TAs ok. You are better off reading these books in your own time.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to another student. I was nervous to take this class as I'm a STEM major and didn't have much experience in literature classes at Yale before this course. However, if you're at all interested in the novels being covered I absolutely recommend taking this class. Professor Brunson gives amazing lectures and it's great to engage with these novels with other people just as interested in them.",
                "Yes. You need to read these books. It's an essential part of being human. \r\n\r\nWith that said, the lectures aren't great. But, you should still take the class to read the books.",
                "Yes, I think it is especially good if you havent been exposed to these works, because then you get to see them for the first time!",
                "1000%. Professor Brunson is one of the most engaging lecturers youll ever have. And of course, taking the course helps motivate read some essential books. I think discussion Russian nationalism in terms of the Ukrainian invasion made the topics of the class especially poignant. Of course, you could read these books by yourself, but the professor she adds important context and insights that really heighten the experience. Also, because the reading load is high, the writing assignments are lighter (2-3 pages through the semester) and the Teaching staff is very receptive to students busy schedules.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in literature. The Tolstoy and Dostoevsky make you think and feel in new ways. That being said, be prepared for a lot of reading. That means you either need to a) do all the reading or b) be okay with the fact that you aren't doing all the reading. When I started falling behind in the course I at first felt really annoyed with myself and that prevented me from enjoying the course and just led to me giving up on some readings. Then I kind of came to terms with it and fell into category b), which is a good place to be. Now I get to finish up these amazing readings over the summer, and the course served simply as a thorough introduction to them.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is willing to put work into the readings. If you do, it will be life changing!",
                "Absolutely. Lots of reading, of course, but you'll be glad to have done it.",
                "Yes! Professor Brunson was incredible and the literature was powerful and important.",
                "YES YES YES YES. These texts changed my life. So many amazing moments in Anna Karenina that I will never forget. Everyone should take this course. Professor Brunson is one of the most gifted lecturers at Yale, full stop.",
                "Take this class if you have even an inkling of interest in Russian Literature or just want an excuse to read during the school year.",
                "Yes!!! Especially if you do all the reading, you will really get so much out of it. It seems like a not but is really not so badyou just have to be consistent.",
                "Definitely, the professor really cuts to the heart of these novels and gives a great understanding of the philosophical questions behind these texts. The books are amazing, too.",
                "Definitely! You have to put in the time to read the novels though",
                "Only take this course if youre comfortable with a really high reading workload. I took this course as a STEM major and I struggled to keep up with the readings. However, the paper prompts were flexible enough that I was able to write them even while being behind on the readings, so overall Im glad I took this course.",
                "Yes! Both Anna Karenina and The Brothers Karamazov are amazing, even life changing if you come in with the right perspective.",
                "Yes I would 100% recommend this course to anyone who wants to read either of these authors with a great guide. I have recommended this course to everyone I have come across.",
                "Yes, it is wonderful if and only if you will do the readings. The lectures are wonderful and the readings are just great.",
                "yes! best class I have taken at yale. Professor Brunson is brilliant and her course is incredible.",
                "Absolutely! Amazing reading list and professor. If you want to take a literature class this is a great one",
                "Yes! If you want to read some essential and brilliant literary texts, be able to understand them and place them in history, have your philosophical perspectives changed, and gain deep insight from a brilliant professor--then this is your class!",
                "Yes!! This course will make you reflect deeply about your own values and moral philosophy.",
                "Yes, with the caveat of you have to be committed to doing the readings. These books are huge... if you fall behind, it is really hard to catch up. But if you're ready to commit to the reading, then for sure! It is manageable so long as you stay caught up and don't try to do multiple chunks at once.",
                "If you want to read \"life-changing\" books, take this course! It's probably the best literature course I have taken at Yale and I want to continue reading and learning about Russian literature after this course. Though you must be aware that the workload is high, it is completely worth it. Professor Brunson's lectures were the best I've heard at Yale as they completely held your attention for 50 minutes and left you leaving class feeling inspired and thinking about the book long after lecture.",
                "Yes and no - I wouldn't recommend it to every student. A lot of people told me that this was \"THE class\" that changed their time at Yale, and a class they think everyone should take. I don't really think that's true. I think a lot of people stand to learn a ton from this class, especially if you're on top of your readings and getting the most out of the books, but if the first week of lectures and readings isn't making your eyes pop out of your head, it might just not be a good fit. I think I expected myself to be someone different when I took this class -- someone who loves to spend their evenings reading (at times depressing, and looooooong) Russian literature, and that's just not the case. I learned a lot from the authors, who are undeniably spectacular, but it is not for everyone.",
                "Yes, not only are these great books which one should read, but the lectures and sections will definitely increase what you take away from them.",
                "If you are interested in doing the readings, you will get a lot out of the course. If not, you will get nothing.",
                "I think this is a MUST TAKE CLASS. The combination of Professor Brunson and Tolstoy & Dostoevsky is unbeatable.",
                "Yes, absolutely. It is a lot of reading, do not get me wrong, but it is so so worth it. Professor Brunson adds a new layer of depth and color to the works of Tolstoevsky, making some of the greatest works of fiction ever written even better. This was the first literature course I took at Yale and I am so happy that I had the opportunity to study Tolstoy and Dostoevsky under the guidance of such a powerful speaker and awesome intellect.",
