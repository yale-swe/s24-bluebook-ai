                "The information was engaging at first but I quickly felt like I got lost in details and it became very hard to keep up and understand why we were studying this information.",
                "Strengths- great professor, great workload, interesting material, relatively straightforward for a non-Stem person, learned a lot of cool stuff \r\ncan't think of any weaknesses",
                "I think the lectures could be a bit more structured so that note taking feels more manageable. I really enjoyed having a break from new material when preparing for an assessment.",
                "Strengths: Forallx textbook and other reading materials were very helpful for understanding the content. Pretty gutty - the important stuff (proofs, translations) takes a bit of practice, but once you get the hang of things this class doesn't require a ton of work. Still felt like I learned a good amount, though.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Pacing was odd -- the first exam was super easy and the second was significantly harder. We could have benefitted from a more systematic approach to FOL translations in class and in the textbook because in the exams, the sentences we were asked to translate could've had a few fairly subjective interpretations. Could have benefitted from including more than 4 psets, as odd as it sounds -- this is the type of class where students should be forced to practice a bit more.",
                "This course was structured very comprehensibly and the assignments/exams were extremely fair. I thought the material was fun.",
                "This course is really easy for anyone who is mathematically inclined. I put minimal effort into the problem sets (which are graded on completion) and didn't do any of the optional homework assignments. I will say that the material can be hard to wrap your head around if you aren't a STEM person, but Professor Winkler is a genuinely great lecturer and really cares about his students.",
                "Professor goes on tangents a lot but theyre very interesting. The grading of this course is not forgiving . You lose points easily on exams despite the material being easy.",
                "The course is a great introduction to formal logic. The end of the course where other types of logic are introduced did not feel very well integrated into the course. Perhaps more interspersing throughout the course would be nice so that all the topics don't come up at the very end.",
                "This class is set up so students have a lot of time to ask questions and work through concepts with the professors and the TFs, even online. The class was difficult, it is by no means an easy QR (I'm a social sciences student). It took a lot of work, and was often stressful. But it is a very well organized class for best understanding of the topic.",
                "Professor Winkler is a strength. His excitement for the material made me care about learning logic more",
                "The instructors for this course were absolutely amazing. I enjoyed Prof. Winkler's lecturing, and I thought he was engaging and instructional. Both the professor and the teaching fellows made themselves very available for questions, which was amazing for improving learning. I also really enjoyed the content of the course, and thought that this class's overview of standard logic was interesting and applicable to many other classes and schools of thought.\r\nThere are little to no areas for improvement. One area for improvement might be that the return of the exams and the problem sets were pretty slow, especially for assessments that were QR-based and didn't have much essay writing.",
                "The class recordings, practice sheets, and discussion sections were all strengths of the course. One weakness of this class is that the textbook is not as helpful in the second half of the semester as it is in the first.",
                "Strengths: Ken Winkler is such a delight, I enjoyed hearing from him about other logics and logical puzzles. I recommend trying to have section with him if possible. The exams are very fair and there are many review opportunities built-into the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would've much preferred to have class in a lecture hall, especially since it was obvious that Professor Winkler feeds off the feedback of a live audience. Obviously that won't be a problem next year.",
                "I think this course had a great organization and was paced at a very manageable rate. There was ample time to talk with the professor and TFs if you had questions and the P-sets, homeworks, and readings were all very straightforward. I don't think this class has any major weaknesses, but you have to be willing to do a bit of tedious work in order to master the skills because they just take some practice. Additionally, sometimes lectures were a bit long, so being able to watch them on 1.5 speed was nice sometimes. But I imagine it would also be more engaging if the lectures were in person so that might make up for the length.",
                "Virtual office hours were very helpful, where I could have a question answered very quickly when needed.",
                "The content was super interesting and the proofs were very fun to do. There were no real weaknesses with the course; it was really outstanding!",
                "This course was very strong in laying the groundwork for first order logic and logical concepts. However, it also expected students to be able to use this groundwork and advance to sometimes very difficult and advanced levels of logical theory and proofs without bridging the gap between or providing much guidance on how to get there.",
                "Strengths: very organized, focuses on students' understanding of the topics taught, provides enough practice materials to improve the skills taught in the class, many opportunities and OHs to ask the professor about anything unclear, discussion sections were good platforms to practice and collaborate\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion sections sometimes covered extra materials which were not necessary for what we were learning in class",
                "Everything about this course is amazing",
                "Only strengths!!! Professor Winkler is an amazing professor who's ready to meet you where you're at and help you have a full understanding of the material. Everything is very clear throughout the course which gives you a great intellectual satisfaction. It actually is so much fun to try your hands on the problem sets. The workload is really low. You just need to practice, and it's fine, because you *will* want to practice.",
                "This course is structured so that you are given plenty of practice with the material. Professor Winkler gives you plenty of worksheets that help you really understand the content of the course. The lectures and section are also extremely helpful and explain the material well. I felt the only weakness was that the textbook readings could sometimes make the course more confusing and were not always helpful.",
                "This course is good and guided me through first order logic very well. I felt prepared for all the exams and was given good problem sets and material to study from. I would have liked more information about how logic is useful for the study of philosophy.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Winkler is super kind, available with many office hours, helpful, and knows his stuff, TA's were great, really stimulating QR credit and great intro to logic, tons of practice problems for exams, very straightforward in what is expected, psets are completion-based to foster actual good-willed effort without fear of failing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: only a few students really cared in my section",
                "Strengths: Manageable workload. Interesting content. The class is focused on an understanding of material over mastery. Practice is encouraged, but it is not overwhelming.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes in-class questions take too long to answer and people who are not confused can get distracted.",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor, manageable (if not really easy) workload, super-doable (if not super-simple) exams, sweet QR credit. Weakness: Exams are too easy and too similar to practice questions (not a con for some, though!)"

One thing that I will mention is that there was a steeper learning curve in the beginning of the class for me with writing the derivations, but once I got a good grasp of it through a bunch of practice problems, the rest of the class went really smoothly (just general conceptions of derivations remained important throughout the course).",
                "The course is an interesting introduction, especially for anyone interested in computer science or computational logic.",
                "This was a QR without any math, it is what is advertised. It was more difficult than I thought, definitely not a gut, and certainly took a high level of engagement to know what was going on. But I would still always take it over calculus",
                "Yes. Interesting material and not super hard or time consuming",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, especially those who are interested in logic or enjoy problem-solving. Professor Winkler is a great instructor who explains the language of logic very thoroughly and provides guidance throughout the course on how to strategically solve logic problems. I found the course to be very fun and enjoyable.",
                "Yes, regardless of the subject area or discipline that you are interested in. This class was foundational in thinking about arguments logically, and was extremely helpful. It was also very enjoyable, and was the perfect amount of work -- the class required engagement, but didn't require anything beyond that. However, it was easy to learn more than was required, which is the perfect balance.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot about how I can use logic, and intend to apply my knowledge to other coursework in the future.",
                "Yes! Professor Winkler is great and the course material challenged me to think in a new way, which I enjoyed. I would highly recommend this course as a QR for humanities students.",
                "I would seriously recommend this course to any student interested in engaging with philosophical arguments in a technical manner. You learn skills here that are not intuitive and start to make you understand the actual work that philosophers do.",
                "Yes. In particular, it's a great QR for those who are not so math inclined (like myself)",
                "Yes! I think it was fun if you like to do written \"mathy\" work, but it really is not like math at all. It is just a systematic process and requires some organization and creativity. There are many people and resources for help and over all a really well organized and taught class. It is a nice class to take as a 5th credit because it feels very different form other classes at Yale so it is a nice break from reading/writing/research/really hard PSETs.",
                "Yes!! Such a cool way of thinking, would strongly recommend",
                "Absolutely! Professor Winkler is amazing, and the content is very interesting and applicable to other disciplines.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are interested in taking a quantitative reasoning course which will challenge them in new ways.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, however, it's not quite the \"QR for Humanities\" class that it's made out to be.  A lot of people struggled with this class and it required a real time commitment, but it's overall interesting and engaging.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone with some interest in logic or philosophy. It is a good introductory course that equips students with the foundational skills and ways of thinking that are essential to further explore either area of study in the future.",
                "Yes! Helps you think.",
                "Yes, this course a great (but slightly challenging way) of receiving a quantitative reasoning credit.",
                "Absolutely. Im not a philosophy major, nor am I really interested in learning any mor philosophy, but this class was so interesting. The skills are so different to anything else Ive learnt in other classes, and I like that Prof Winkler presented arguments from philosophers to contextualise the material, but we were only required to know the mechanics of FOL/TFL",
                "YES YES YES!!! If there was a core curriculum, this course would definitely be there. Everyone should take it. You get to explore an essential tool that would help you with any class you'll take on in the future. (And of course, it's a great QR too!)",
                "I would recommend this course to someone either interested in the content or desperate for a QR. If you are interested in philosophy and logic, then this is a great introductory course. Or, if you need a QR, this one is not too bad. However, the course can still be confusing or stressful at times, so it is definitely not an easy QR.",
                "Yes, but don't take this course if you want a gut QR. You have to study to do well.",
                "Yes, really great QR credit for non-stem people.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in how logic is represented in more formal terms, please take the course. It has no busy-work and is super straightforward. No BS at all. Prof. Winkler is a very great guy who welcomes you into the field. This class got me to think critically about arguments I use and construct in my everyday life and how bad ones arise too. I really enjoyed this class. Many take it for the non-math QR credit, but I took it just for the sake of interest, and I do not regret it at all.",
                "100%!!! LOGIC IS FOUNDATIONAL TO EVERY FIELD. There's no escaping that. This course introduces it very beautifully. Amazing professor, manageable (if not really easy) workload, super-doable (if not super-simple) exams, sweet QR credit. Please take!"
