                "The course grade is 40% midterm, 40% final, 20% problem sets. Because its curved, and the TAs give out the problem set answers, everyone gets 100% on the psets and thus they effectively dont matter for the curve. So the final grade ends up being 50% midterm (there is only one midterm) and 50% final. This makes for minimal engagement because you can sleep through the semester and only show up to peer tutor hours right before each pset is due and cram for the exams as needed. If you do show up, youll realize Tolga is very funny and entertaining, and his lectures are engaging. But I left the class a bit irritated because other than listen to Tolga, there was nothing fun to do and no final project/product (like a paper) to create or be proud of.",
                "A big strength of the course is that the professor shows how the theoretical ideas are applicable to society, especially in terms of public policy. There are no weaknesses to the course.",
                "I felt like I had to hold myself accountable for a lot of the semester and I think having 8 5-question psets would be better than having 4 10-question ones.",
                "The course was taught very well, by a professor clearly experienced with the material. Professor Koker also had plenty of interesting anecdotes to help students understand the concepts taught.",
                "Tolga's class is (for the most part) very interesting and he knows all of the course material by heart. I think the course could be better at forcing students to engage with the material. It's too easy to just show up to lecture, breeze through the infrequent problem sets, and never really be responsible for the material until the final exam.",
                "Strengths: expert instruction, interesting and relevant applications of economic concepts to public policy, problem sets aided learning\r\nWeaknesses: moved very quickly",
                "The class is highly cumulative, which is at once its greatest strength and weakness. Every class follows logically from the previous, but it also means it can be difficult to catch up  especially in the second half of the semester when the pace picks up significantly.",
                "This course covers the basics of micro, and Tolga keeps the lectures interesting with lively stories and examples. The sequence of lectures is also well-organized, and it's clear that Tolga has experience teaching these concepts. I think sometimes explanations of topics could be clearer, but it was always possible to get a firm grasp by combining lecture with some independent review/reading the textbook.",
                "I feel like Professor Koker could do shorter problem sets every week.",
                "It was an amazing class! Again, although I struggled a lot at first, the support that I got from Professor Koker and his teaching assistants Nelson and Tanya has been invaluable! Definitely taking intro to macroeconomics in the future!"

                "Would recommend because I think Econ 110 is more engaging than Econ 115 (the big lecture). It also should clarify to you whether or not you want to pursue Econ. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: the math requirement Tolga outlines in the syllabus is fake. Do not be fooled. He even admits its fake halfway through the course when you learn about adverse selection. You do NOT need to know any math beyond basic derivatives (I.e., that the first deriv of x^2 is 2x) for this course.",
                "Yes definitely. Even if you are not interested in economics, the professor makes the information accessible.",
                "An emphatic no. This course has severely diminished my interest in economics and my view of the econ department at Yale. Instead of focusing on building economic intuition, this course is taught like a test-prep class. In the end, apart of the earlier parts of the course about rational choice and utility, which genuinely has impacted the way I make decisions, it feels like much of the course is about brute memorization of obscure formulas and models (e.g., maximizing profits under four different duopoly models) without teaching us the underlying economic concepts that matter. I simply don't understand the choice of topics for this class. Instead of making us memorize the long-term profit margins of a monopolist under monopsony, would our time not be better spent on understanding the different schools of economics, how each understands agents and firms, and the assumptions of orthodox economics? I also loved Tolga's discussion about the circular flow of the economy, which seems like a rather important topic to understanding economics, but we spent 10 minutes on it and never got into it at all. I leave the class feeling like I still have very little knowledge about the foundations on which economics is built, or why this subject exists in the first place. A further complaint: I don't think the small class size is well utilized in the current state of the class. I came in thinking that the class would be like a seminar -- it's not. We never had actual discussions, and the class atmosphere does not encourage anyone to ask questions. If you need to take intro-micro for your major, just take 115 and get it over with. You will learn very little either way.",
                "No it was boring",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, as it gives you another perspective from which you can view the world. Many of the principles taught can be directly applied to student and professional life.",
                "Yes. Good introduction to econ if that's what you're looking for.",
                "Yes, if youre seeking a comprehensive overview of microeconomics.",
                "Don't take it unless you have to.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in gaining experience in economics.",
                "I'd recommend this course over 115 for students who need to take intro micro. My impression is that 110 was less work and that the smaller lectures were significantly more engaging. Tolga does a good job keeping things interesting. I thought the class gave a good foundation in micro - I'd already taken AP Micro in high school, but there was still a lot I hadn't seen before.",
                "Yes. It's a great introduction to economics and Professor Koker is a very dynamic teacher.",
                "Yes! Take the class with Professor Koker! He makes each class so engaging and fun. The material that you will be exposed to in this class is very standardized, and so it should be! You will learn a lot about both consumer and firm theories.",
                "I would if you're looking for a tough and more competitive economics course to challenge yourself. You're definitely going to leave with a deeper understanding, but it is a lot of work compared to the other intro micro class."
