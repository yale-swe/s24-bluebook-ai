    "This course provided a fantastic opportunity to identify and work through problems in my own writing and others' with my classmates.  The topics of the papers were engaging, and I very much enjoyed our debates.",
    "reading analysis, writing development, critical thinking",
    "I definitely felt I became more comfortable with reading and writing about academic sources, and while Im not sure my writing itself improved, I became more confident writing to prompts.",
    "I gained greater knowledge of the art of writing essays, especially in terms of analyses and concision.",
    "I learned quite a bit about how to think critically about a piece of writing and then respond to it using clear diction.",
    "Reading skills in advanced materials. Learned the basics of research and close reading."

   "comments": [
    "The workshop structure we had for editing one another's papers was extremely beneficial to our learning; we pushed back on the choices each other had made in their writing, and this conversation was essential in refining our ability to construct arguments effectively.",
    "prior to taking this course, my writing skills were not as strong as some other in the class but i was able to learn and develop as a writer",
    "Strengths: class discussions were amazing and really allowed us to explore the topics with more depth; the readings were extremely interesting as well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it wasnt always clear what our teacher expected of us on the papers; I struggled with this throughout the semester.",
    "This class does a good job of improving critical reading and writing skills while maintaining focus on the baseline question of the course: \"what is college for?\" I found myself examining both my opinion and thoughts of the question, and how well I was able to articulate those thoughts in my writing.",
    "It was a little unorganized with the topics we covered; it would have been nice to have a clear direction\/progression. Very interesting course and relevant readings. Good feedback and availability of help."

    "The workshops in this class are worthwhile if you would like extensive feedback on your writing.",

    "Yes! The topic of this course was very interesting.",
    "Yes",
    "Would recommend. We got to dig in deep to the educational topics I had questions about. Great discussions and community. Interesting readings - opened my eyes to a lot of different perspectives in education that I never knew existed."
