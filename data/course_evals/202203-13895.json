                "Spanish 110 moves ridiculously quickly; I felt like I was drowning. I'd say over 70% of my class had taken Spanish in high school. As a result, the student's levels were variable. This was a bit disheartening at times.",
                "Strengths: Very comprehensive and detailed\r\nWeakness: Supersite sometimes felt like busy work rather than work that would improve my skills. Sometimes I felt like I was dedicating time to getting the assignments done when I could be studying the material on my own. \r\n\r\nHaving supersite as an optional learning method would be PERFECT. This would provide students the ability to practice their skills, but also not feel like it is a chore to get done for a grade.",
                "The SuperSite homework was helpful but repetitivehaving more flexible deadlines for the activities, even a 1-day grace period, would have been good. I also think that sections could be more standardized, more information on midterms could be given at least a week in advance, and more clarity about the digital project expectations could be provided.",
                "Course felt a little disorganized. It felt like everyday we were doing something new and not always connected to what we did the day before. I wish we had more of a road map for grammar and why we were learning it in that specific order.",
                "I think a weakness of this course is the varied levels. Some people come into L1 Spanish with truly no experience, whiles others have taken four years of Spanish. As someone who had never taken a Spanish class, I felt unprepared for the course. I was able to adjust as the course went on, but it was a difficult start.",
                "This course was very effective in the amount I practiced writing and comprehending Spanish. I would recommend in future semesters stressing speaking on demand in Spanish slightly more, outside of linguameetings.",
                "Strength: a lot of interactions in class and with homework\r\nImprovement: N/A",
                "I think this course moves way too quickly which makes it extremely difficult to actually retain the language. Along with this, there were way too many sudden changes to the syllabus making it difficult and inconsistent. Also, I feel that we spent little time focusing on the things that are hard to retain like verb conjugation and too much time focusing on vocabulary retention, which was really frustrating. I also think that the attendance policy was far too strict, I was sick multiple times this semester and unfortunately my grade suffered because of it.",
                "The textbook's explanation of grammar is sometimes not very clear, but the online exercises that came along with the textbook are very helpful.",
                "Strength is the amount of engagement with Spanish with classes and homeworks every day but its also the weakness as some stuff is rushed"

If you want to breeze through the language requirement, DO NOT take Spanish. The class is a lot of work, and you actually need to study.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this for people who would like to one day achieve fluency in Spanish and have a background in Spanish. Although it is a beginner course, It would be VERY overwhelming as a beginner. It was difficult for me at times and I took Spanish for 3 years.",
                "If you are really interested in learning Spanish I would take this course, it does move pretty fast though so the success of the student depends on how much time (daily) they are willing to commit.",
