I gained skills of comparative political analysis and examining and weighing the various forces at play (political, social, economic) in shaping events. I gained insight into the broader development of nationalism and national myths, along with an appreciation for the various factors affecting and reasons why people ascribe to the political ideologies they do."

                "I think the readings before class were a great structure. Debating about the readings in class was great given that it clarified and expanded what we read in the prior week. However, I believe that it may have been nice if Professor Aslanidis added a bit some more class lecture content to make sure we get the broad understanding of what was going on before entering the reading comprehension.",
                "The major strengths of the course include the instructor, the readings (relevant and interesting), and the classroom presentations. The mini lectures were very helpful to learning the material. There are no significant weaknesses."

                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone with an interest in Modern Greece or of the Balkan area\/region. There were a mixture of a few Greeks taking the class but mostly non Greeks who wanted to learn more about a country we would learn about in another class.",
                "I would recommend the course for any student interested in general European history and\/or writing research essays."
