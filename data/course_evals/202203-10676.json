                "The professor is very kind and approachable. Makes the class room environment great for all.",
                "Strengths: The consistent engagement with material in Spanish (speaking, reading, and writing)! Class discussion were low pressure, which I feel facilitated more participation (and thus improvement of speaking skills). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did feel the turn around for weekly presentations was a bit too quick and, personally, speaking in these more high-pressure situations on a weekly basis in the first half of the semester didn't really improve my speaking skills. I felt that more low-pressure class-based discussion were more useful in this regard.",
                "A strength is the asynchronous days on Wednesdays, which allowed a change of pace and an opportunity to learn in a different manner. A weakness was the sometimes arbitrary and tedious daily VHL homework. The assigned work did not always follow what we were learning in class. It felt as if a VHL course were designed separately from the Spanish course we took in class. The professor had no idea what was assigned on VHL, as it appeared to be under a domain separate from our classroom.",
                "Strength: the supersite assignments are very helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it goes so quickly through vocab and tenses without enough practice despite already having daily homework and other assignments. I would appreciate more interactive activities in the class aside from filling out so many black-and-white pdfs on Canvas.",
                "The strengths of this course is that you are continually building on concepts and ideas.",
                "This course could be improved by focusing a bit less on grammar and stoic presentations and more on an understanding of how to speak the language fluidly and spontaneously. However, it did yield a great environment for students to become grammatically proficient.",
                "Strengths: The course is well designed to incorporate useful discussion topics while giving you the grammar to deepen your knowledge. I also liked the workload set up of the course; the beginning of the semester had a lot of individual mini presentations and then right near Thanksgiving break we presented our large group projects which made the ending feel really rewarding and less stressful (I was able to better focus on the project without the stress of other finals) and we ended with making our own play which was fun!\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the partner work is hard to coordinate with due to Yalie's schedules -- try to know in advance if there is a partner assignment for the week so scheduling isn't an added hurdle."

The seminar setting facilitates useful class discussion to improve speaking skills, and the cultural concepts (which many assignments focus on) are interesting (or, at least, I found them to be).",
