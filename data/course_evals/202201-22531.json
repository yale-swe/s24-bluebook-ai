                "Very supportive department with many great resources.",
                "The extreme self-guided nature of the course is both a strength and a drawback. I interacted with my advisor only six times, for only about 15 minutes each, every meeting serving only to provide a few suggestion for novel directions to explore and general confirmation that I was on the right track and going at the right pace. This allows students to build their ability to self-direct. I personally found this very challenging, but a great learning experience. As I gather, increased structure is being added to the course starting next semester, so this will not be as true anymore.",
                "so little guidance. very confusing, hard to pick a project and an advisor",
                "We were able to explore our own research interests. Having more informal check-ins might be nice for the future to keep everyone on-track.",
                "I would consider it a weakness how disorganized this course ran. Anything that went positively is due to my adviser and I setting up meetings/setting the course for the project, because otherwise there was no structure enforced by the DUS/course. Communications from the DUS were sparse, and it's frustrating that only recently a timeline for runs of CS490 was drafted via the cs-majors panlist. I'm happy there are changes coming, but it would have been great to have more sense of community and departmental support this semester. It's disappointing that friends in other majors had colloquia/poster presentations to invite their friends to at the end of the semester, meanwhile there's not much to show that I completed the CS major, nor was there much acknowledgement/celebration from the department.",
                "There was not much guidance on how to select a project or advisor, and no official guidance or check-ins from the department throughout the semester until it was time to hand in the projects. One of the strengths is being able to participate in independent research/create your own project, but it could have more structure.",
                "Strengths - it's not like a black box where all of a sudden you have to turn it in. The CS faculty sets deadlines at certain periods so you're able to stay on top of your work. Additionally, the CS student board will hold work sessions to help you stay on top of your work.",
                "It was a really cool experience to work on my project with Dr Blenman my advisor. \r\n\r\nI think that this course needs to have more interaction with its student in terms of sending more updates on canvas and announcements. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would be great there was more help explaining the senior project at the end of junior year and projects that students can do or get involved with",
                "The strength of the course is heavily dependent on the advisor's involvement. Luckily my advisor was very helpful and was willing to take the time to answer my questions and address my concerns.",
                "More formally required meetings with staff would be very helpful.",
                "The idea of a project is a great, especially at the end of my time at Yale. However, there isn't a lot of organization or structure - the deadlines aren't particularly well advertised (you have to go on the cpsc 490 website), and it would be helpful if they gave you some sort of timeline with precise dates rather than \"third thursday of classes\" or \"end of reading period\". This is similar for the process of finding an advisor - I think I was lucky to have started thinking about it early.",
                "The independent structure of the course made it possible to curve my timeline in a way that worked best for me and my advisor.",
                "Feel like it could be more structured in terms of resources, i think the course was a bit unstructured and open ended, and perhaps some optional structure could support continuity. Also I feel that there werent many resources or support, especially if you create your own project. In my opinion, there should be resources and a space for CS students to work on projects and encourage collaboration and promote students teaching each other"
