                "The class is phenomenal and probably the best I have ever taken at Yale. Prof. Bakker is a linguistic genius and really helps illuminate all these concepts. This class is very difficult--so beware--I would not recommend taking this as a fifth course or even with a fifth course if the rest of the schedule is tough. I feel so much more equipped to read Greek texts after this because of the painstaking practice on prose composition and, most importantly, word study. We also learn a ton about particles--often glossed over--but which provide so much insight about what the author is trying to do. For that alone I would take this class."

The class is also brilliantly divided into study of word, study of sentence, and study of text, which provides a holistic view and also ensures that things do not get stale."
