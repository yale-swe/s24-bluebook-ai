Professor Weir is incredibly knowledgeable, both as an academic but also as a researcher with extensive relationships with people and communities involved in terrorism\/political violence both in the US and in Ireland. We were able to speak with a number of people involved in conflicts and ask personal questions about their experiences, goals, and motivations.",

More feedback on the assignments would have been great, but as it was Professor Weir was very engaged with students and adapted the course well to being online. We were able to speak with practitioners, read a range of materials (without it being too much), etc. My one other suggestion would be to have access to the student powerpoints to have as a reference.",

                "Yes!!",
                "Yes. Most people use the term 'terrorist' without a proper understanding of what it means. The first assignment for the course was on the definition of terrorism, as each student understood it. We realized that each person's perception of terrorism is different, so we had to relearn what it really means to refer to others as terrorists.",
                "I absolutely would recommend. If you want to learn about the topic, you will have a great experience with Professor Weir and meet all the learning objectives on the syllabus. It is a very thorough and thoughtful course, and Professor Weir is a great seminar leader and has great related experience and contacts. This is one of those special courses wherein engagement with guest speakers is common and adds a practical element to an academic study.",
                "Yes",
                "This course was remarkable. A must-take class before graduating!!",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The course covered a diverse range of topics related to terrorism, and Professor Weir was adept at moderating class discussions. The guest speakers provided unique insights, and through both their expertise and Professor Weir's, I learnt to examine these evocative topics through multiple perspectives."
