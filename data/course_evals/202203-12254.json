                "I have experienced tremendous growth in my knowledge of American Sign Language. I understand conversations that take place in class, which are entirely in ASL. I could tell you about my favorite hobbies, friends and family, educational background, past and future plans, and stories. I comprehend both general meanings and implied meanings that are expressed by body language, facial expressions or words. I am able to retell complex conversations that are modeled for me. I can use ASL principles like phonology, topicalization, non-manual markers, and classifiers.",
                "In addition to learning the basics of communicating in ASL, I gained a greater appreciation for the rich culture, and common challenges deaf and hard of hearing face. This class opened my eyes and provided a gentle reminder to just take a minute and think about other people, and to reach out and learn from them. This course is by far the most important and meaningful I've taken at Yale and I'd recommend this class to everyone.",
                "I learned how to communicate in ASL. I learned greetings, how to express my feelings, how to talk about my identity, how to talk about my family, and I even learned how to tell fictional stories and about ASL literature.",
                "I was shocked how quickly I was able to learn how to hold basic conversations in ASL. The class is extremely conducive to different learning styles as the professor uses powerpoint, videos, gesturing, lip reading, and context clues to teach signs. It is much easier to pick up on sentence and conversation style communication compared to international spoken languages, which concentrate more heavily on grammar and sentence structure.\r\n\r\nI also learned a lot about the deaf community both at and outside of Yale. The deaf community is a beautiful rich thriving culture and I am very grateful to have the chance to learn a decent amount of a language in a relaxed supportive environment in my senior year."

                "A major strength of this course is that it is fully immersive. It is not about memorizing vocabulary, grammar conjugations, or just memorizing to pass a quiz or test but we actually practice language immersion by just constantly communicating with each other and trying our best."

                "Absolutely, see above.",
                "Absolutely! This class is more than just learning ASL, it's also about learning about the Deaf community and their struggles, their joy, and their livelihoods. It is such a wonderful course whether or not you need a language requirement I would not leave Yale without at least taking L1 ASL.",
                "YES! So fun, so engaging, so insightful. It is an incredibly well rounded course. I also appreciated the 50 minutes of silence every day; it demands a high level of engagement unique from other courses. It's the only class at Yale where you can show up with nothing but yourself and learn everything you need to know, no notes no laptop no phone."
