                "Going through examples in class was more helpful than I expected",
                "weaknesses: This class is a lot of work. 3 hours per week of live lectures. 1 hour per week of tutorials. 3 hours per week of recorded lectures. A pset and quiz every week. \r\n\r\nThe biggest thing that I think could improve the course would be for it to have a tutorial at the same time every week, rather than rotating it every week and wrecking havoc on the schedule.",
                "Strengths: 1) The course content itself is fascinating, 2) Simon is an incredibly knowledgeable and genuinely kind professor, and 3) this fulfills a PHYS requirement for several majors.\r\nWeaknesses: The course organization was absolutely shambolic. I think this may have been due to the online format, but even so Simon and the constantly-changing TAs seemed overwhelmed in a way that regularly made it hard to learn what we were expected to.",
                "strengths: Simon's passion for the material, interesting biological applications, plenty of TA\/office hour availability.\r\nweaknesses: in-person lecture was not very helpful. module and office hours were best. online format made teaching the course more difficult.\r\nCould be improved by merging pre-recorded and live virtual lectures into one format.",
                "I truly loved the group midterms. It really helped take any extra stress of about careless errors, because I knew someone was checking over my work.",
                "Although the class had a rough start (the group quizzes proved to be very difficult for students, which caused a lot of stress), Professor Mochrie was SO understanding and open to working with his students to structure the class better. He was unbelievably kind and open-minded through what must have been an extremely difficult situation for him as an instructor, and he made sure that each student's voice was heard. Truly, I have never worked with such a caring professor. We saw him at several study halls, where he went over problem set questions with us, and never failed to answer my emails in a timely manner. I hope that he remains active in our learning experience next semester as well.",
                "Well first of all, I would just remove this course as a requirement for any major that doesn't lead down the path of biophysics - I am confident that I will never use any of the information from this class in any other course for the three biology-related majors I'm considering\r\nSecond, if you're actually doing everything that this course aims to have students do (and especially without prior experience with physics and\/or probability), this course is a ton of work. I was able to get by on prior knowledge and just never watching videos and putting minimal effort in in general, but this is not an approach most people can take, and is certainly not an approach that facilitates learning. Weekly psets, quizzes, practice quizzes, tutorial sections, quiz make-ups, classes AND prerecorded lectures is a lot to work through, and I understand that at least some of this is necessary to cover sheer volume of material, but much of it is just piling on more work for no good reason. Also, some topics could just be excluded from this course since many are kind of niche approaches that aren't really useful elsewhere in physics\/biophysics.\r\nAlso there's a kinda halfway approach to teaching mathematica where you still need to spend a lot of time to do the mathematica problems they expect you to do, but you don't reach any meaningful understanding of the language\r\nI won't speak ill of the lectures because I just had a really hard time focusing during them and stopped showing up or watching them at all pretty early on in the course which may or may not be just me.\r\nI also generally dislike the heavy reliance of leaning on TAs to give solutions to problems and work through problems with people because there are a lot of complications to many of the problems that are just never addressed in lectures. Most of them are great, and very helpful, but I think this is just demonstrative of the fact that this is just a symptom of the course organization, and that this course would be better as smaller sections or just topically reconstructed, I don't know",
                "The lectures were sometimes entirely unhelpful - the prerecorded lectures were a tiny bit clearer, but it was a bit bad to ask students to watch all the lectures the night before in-person lecture. We were not informed that they would attempt a flipped classroom format, as the time commitment doubles then. The late notices were unhelpful too, as well as late file uploads that left us unable to try to study\/work ahead sometimes, and actually made us fall behind as well. Uploading files and grades on a regular schedule or just having them all up at once would be way better.",
                "The exams and grading were very fair. I think however, there was WAY to much work in this course. This course felt like it was 2-3 credits just because I felt like I was engaging with it 2-3 hours each day. It really drains you and makes you not want to learn.",
                "Strength:\r\nThe questions presented for homework and tests were creative and original.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThis course was essentially entirely self-taught. Except it was even more difficult because the questions were so abstract that you couldn't even consult google for additional help even if you wanted to.",
                "there is way too much content being expected for us to learn",
                "Learning in group settings was extremely valuable. However, the system for scheduling was extremely inconvenient. We were randomly placed with groups and then were asked to schedule a different tutorial with a different TA each week, leading some groups to regularly have tutorial at 9 or 10 PM Eastern, or at various times on weekends. In the interest of respecting the time of both students and teaching assistants, this issue could be resolved by simply including a discussion section in the course.",
                "The professor didn't do a good job of explaining systems in class and I thought it was absurd that he was trying to have us code in a physics class",
                "Strengths: class content is absolutely fascinating; professor cares a great deal about his students; great accessibility of peer tutors and teaching fellows to help with difficult problem sets\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets often required aid from the teaching fellows and would be impossible to do independently, making study halls must-attends",
                "Strengths: the study halls were super helpful \r\n\r\n\r\nWeakness: the prerecorded video lectures were a lot of extra class time that was hard to manage",
                "Dr. Mochrie is super nice\/enthusiastic. The format of the class could definitely have used some adjustment (understandable given the circumstances of the pandemic). Although I understand that the combination of pre-watched lectures and discussion sections and in-person lectures was meant to foster course engagement, fewer more high-priority class items would have made the course more engaging.",
                "Strengths: the course is focused solely on how much you're learning and as long as you put work into it, then you'll get an A\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: experience in the course is heavily dependent on who your peers are, sometimes topics don't really make sense until it all comes together in the end, introduction of Mathematica in the course with limited help from ULAs (who don't know it because it's new) and limited teaching on how to work the program in general",
                "I really liked how the course has a lot of biology applications. The connections that Professor Mochrie made to DNA, cells, and other biology topics made the course very interesting. One weakness was that the problem sets are super long and difficult, so I found myself more focused on finishing the problem sets than understanding the material.",
                "I think many of the weaknesses this class presented at the beginning of the semester were addressed. The late recordings and the way the weekly quizzes were administered weren't great, but Professor Mochrie adjusted this after hearing our opinions. I liked the fact that all of our assignments were group assignments.",
                "One of the strengths of this course was Professor Mochrie and the teaching staff, who seemed quite dedicated and taught well. However, I do think that the combination of live and recorded lectures was a weakness, since sometimes material that was covered in recorded lectures  was essentially just repeated in live lecturesthis sort of repetition felt like it perhaps wasn't the best use of time, during or outside of class time.",
                "It had a lot busy work but overall I liked the group project dynamic.",

                "Simon definitely responded to feedback, which was incredibly helpful. The course, as it was at the beginning, was difficult, particularly because the textbook was hard to understand. The pre-class lectures should've come with some kind of powerpoint. Powerpoint in general, with basic ideas and concepts, would've been helpful if posted so we could review slides. It was hard to follow a lot of concepts using only the lectures and module notes. Also, a how-to for the problems would have been great, rather than the somewhat random example problems",
                "strengths: study halls, professor, and TA\/ULAs all provided assistance in a timely manner and seeking assistance outside of lecture\/module notes was honestly the only way to do well\/learn concepts in class\r\n\r\nweaknesses: mandatory lectures; poll everywhere was used as an attendance record in a sense but limitations of a computer screen made it hard to remember what the questions were asking or referring to; eliminating lectures as mandatory or finding a way to keep problems up with references would make poll everywhere more useful. content was taught in a way where physics terms were implicitly taught as needed, making it very difficult to understand some concepts given I've never taken physics before. Learning definitions of terms and what they represent in an applied fashion in a very very explicit and clear manner would make learning more accessible",
                "This course sucks up a huge amount of time. Having live lectures and recorded video makes it really a lot. It helped when Monday quizzes began taking the whole class time on Mondays to slow down the content. I would highly recommend setting a routine schedule for tutorials, if possible. They were helpful, but very hard to schedule. I never really liked the \"explain in words\" types of problem set\/exam questions as they often felt too open-ended and arbitrary, and the TAs often struggled to answer these questions as well.",
                "Strengths: a lot of help is available \r\nWeakness: this class takes SO much time (more than my other classes combined)",
                "This course was so focused on demonstrating how physics could be related to life science that sometimes it felt as though we were not learning something that would be relevant in terms of physics principles. The course felt much harder than an introductory course and it highly depended on us having prior knowledge of biochemical content or other material in order to succeed. The course was also very time consuming.",
                "This course had so many requirements. Not only did it have 3 times a week lecture but also, tutorial with a TA weekly, 3 times a week study hall, a problem set every week, two midterms and a final project. It definitely forced you to be on top of the material but it was a huge time commitment. The tutorial was not beneficial at all, although being able to work with a group during lecture and the group exams honestly helped me to learn the information and stay on top of it much better. Working with a group prevented me from falling behind when I didn't understand and having to cram at the end. This was a great component of the class! Also study hall is super beneficial as time consuming as it is.",
                "I think one of the main strengths of this course was that groupwork was encouraged. At times, STEM classes end up being a competition, but in encouraging this and assigning us smaller groups to work in, I think that it was easier to learn and ask for help\/",
                "The implementation of group quizzes suffered due to the initial difficulty of communicating over Zoom. That being said, I dont believe that the quizzes could have been done better, especially as the process improved over the fall.",
                "Strengths: The course is very collaborative. The tests, quizes, and psets were collaborative, which was a really nice feature. I think being able to work on physics problems in a group helped to facilitate learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The psets contained problems that we were never taught how to do, so they took hours to complete and were nearly impossible to do without visiting office hours. We had to attend live sessions and watch pre-recorded lectures, so it was almost double the amount of class time that we had to attend. I think one way to improve the class would definitely be to get rid of the pre-recorded lectures. We did not cover many of what I would consider basic and essential topics in an introductory physics course in that we did not do any problems that included numbers, so I do not feel as though this class prepared me well at all for future physics courses.",
                "Strengths: groups fostered a community feel\r\nWeaknesses: coding aspect of the class came out of left field and added immense stress to the class, course required excessive time commitment to do well on psets etc.",
                "Strengths: I think the teaching team did a remarkable job creating a collaborative environment that felt like it was about learning rather than weeding out worse students. This is the best introductory STEM class Ive ever taken, without a doubt. The quality of the teaching was also extremely high compared to other intro STEM classes. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The number of components in the course (e.g. tutorials, quizzes, problem sets, exams, exam corrections, final project) was a bit difficult to keep track of, so I feel like the class might be hard to manage if youre in other classes with a high quantity of assignments.",
                "Strengths: Prof was pretty responsive to feedback and ideas and was flexible which was appreciated during the pandemic. Abundance of study halls was appreciated. Kudos on making a module thing, a bit confusing but great to create a curriculum that follows through in a genuinely interesting way. Weaknesses: TUTORIALS. very obnoxious system to put into place; it was very chaotic on the part of both students and TAs to have to make time and coordinate on a weekly basis to meet for an overall not especially helpful thing. and to have a grade on it? madness. Please don't ever do that again.",
                "The flipped classroom format was tough workload-wise. Watching pre-recorded lectures and reading the textbook ahead of time, before attending lectures during the normal lecture time, in addition to weekly quizzes and psets was a lot of work. It would have been great to do the pre-recorded lectures during normal lecture time, then just use the weekly psets to work through problems. I appreciate the work and preparation that went into the pre-recorded lectures, but the workload ended up being quite high. In addition, more opportunities to work individually would be great (for exams, for example)! I think working in a group made it easier to do well without fully understanding the material and disincentivized staying on top of work.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Mochrie is really passionate about the course material\r\nWeaknesses: The TFs and help sessions were disorganized at times and I felt like this class took more time than necessary",
                "Strengths of the course include the instructor because of his flexibility and enthusiasm. Not only were triweekly study halls scheduled, but Professor Mochrie himself was in attendance at these. He listened to student concerns and adapted the course accordingly when appropriate but also stood his ground to preserve some of the components he studied\/believed in such as switching study groups midway since the educational value of group work is lost without occasional changes. Exams were fair\/based on the problem sets, example quizzes were given, and it was a big help to have a study group to work with on the assessments. Despite not liking the occasional coding work we were assigned, I was really excited to model something for the final project, and if you attend study hall for the Mathematica problems, you will have sample codes to directly modify to do so. The tutorials were sometimes tough to schedule, but switching the time to an agreed upon one each week actually helped me, and these small group sessions did force you to engage with the material. The course could be improved by slowing down the Poll Everywhere questions so that we could actually work on them rather than feeling pressured to guess before Professor Mochrie moved on and our work wouldn't be counted. The pre-class recordings were a little much in the beginning of the semester, but they slowed down later on.",
                "Kind of pedantic in how we are expected to learn. Too much math manipulation on PSETs. Kind of topical to biology but in a super simplified way.",
                "There are a lot of moving parts that seem somewhat redundant at times, but actually the culmination of all the class aspects make for a solid learning environment.",
                "The strength was how interesting the course material could be and some of the TAs who were superb at assisting our experiences. \r\nThe weakness was the format. Unfortunately the module system at times failed due to the density of the material not being broken down into digestible chunks and the harder parts not given more attention  than the basic concepts. \r\nThere was also a huge advantage to people who knew how to code or took linear algebra despite many students' understanding that this was an intro-physics course requiring only Calc 1 as a pre-req.",
                "This course is challenging by nature, especially for someone who is not necessarily mathematically prepared. This in conjunction with the high workload and time-investment made this course one of the more challenging for the semester. However, there are so many resources in the form of peer tutors, TFs, and Prof Mochrie himself. I always felt that I could get a question answered if need be,",
                "Strengths - Psets, quizzes and exams were all completed in groups! This was super helpful because physics is not easy, and working with other students helped me understand problems a lot better. Also, tons of support was available throughout the week in the form of office hours and study halls to work on psets way in advance and answer questions about quizzes and exams, which was incredibly helpful; I do not know how I would have gotten through this course without the help  of the amazing team of TA's and learning assistants! They were all incredibly kind, helpful and accessible, and I liked that we could also collaborate with other students in study halls to work on assignments. I also really liked that Simon posted lecture videos before each live lecture; this was very helpful in my understanding of course content, and I liked that we reinforced the video content with example problems in class. This helped me gauge my understanding of the video content. I didn't find the module notes as helpful; personally, the notes in the module were confusing without the context of the videos, which explained everything in a much more accessible way. Finally, I appreciated that Simon posted as many resources as possible on the class website to help us in advance - module notes, psets, lecture videos, practice exams, answer keys, etc. Professors often don't post material in a timely fashion before exams, however Simon always did! This gave you the chance to get a head-start on all the pset assignments as well. I also liked that, in lieu of a final exam, we were able to apply what we learned in class and carry out a creative project; I think I learned more from this project than I would have from a final exam because it applied our knowledge from class in a real-world context! I got to see how physics in the life sciences is actually used in the real world! \r\n\r\nHonestly, I cannot think of any weaknesses of this class; Simon really did everything in his power to make PHYS 170 accessible and not overly-challenging in light of the virtual format. Since Simon clearly dedicated so much time, effort and resources to this class, learning physics online was not nearly as bad as it could have been!",
                "the course improved steadily over the semester. the main issue at the beginning is that mochrie didn't adapt the course to online at all. once he did, it ended up being much better. also, honestly, Yale pre-meds are quite annoying and they mostly populated this class.",

                "having effectively 6 hours of lecture per week. it is too much.",
                "The prerecorded lectures were good, though they just ended up making the in-person classes somewhat repetitive. The \"study groups\" of 3-5 students that completed quizzes, exams, and tutorials together were great, until Simon decided to rearrange them halfway through the course, just as we were beginning to bond with our fellow group members.  Tutorials were fun, but it would have been better to develop a relationship with the same TA over several weeks.",
                "Virtual study halls were not very helpful. Unclear when\/which TA would be present, went through problems very slowly.",
                "I think the group work was a bit challenging, to be honest. The group quizzes proved to be more difficult than expected, resulting in low scores across the board. However, Prof. Mochrie allowed for quiz revisions for 100% of your lost points, which was amazing. I think the module structure was great, and the in-person lectures were interesting as well. Overall, I think given the online format of the class, Prof. Mochrie did a stellar job.",
                "The course was not well adapted to COVID learning. The class asks for a lot of work and time from students, and I think that with the COVID-19 adjustment the class just asked for more work. A strength of the class is the TF team who is very helpful for problem sets and preparing for tests.",
                "Groups was a good idea I think, and it took some adjustments, but the current format is actually pretty good.",
                "Again, the file uploads were a real problem - I was unable to try to work ahead. The mandatory tutorials were also entirely unhelpful as most of the TAs didn't even seem to want to teach effectively in a virtual format by just staring at us and not guide us through on a whiteboard. The study halls varied in effectiveness - a lot of TAs were the same ones who just didn't want to teach and would just blaze through problem set answers and explain things too quickly or just straight up not explain. The live lectures were a waste of time as the professor would try to go too fast, and it ended up that students would ask about concepts that were many slides backwards and the professor would spend the rest of time attempting to explain that part while the rest were all left hanging with our own questions, as we were all over the place in terms of understanding - again, many of us would be unable to watch prerecorded lectures or have watched different ones at different times. The uploading schedule and the way lecture videos were organized were also unhelpful in that sometimes the lecture videos simply were named by just number or module number, but even THOSE numbers would be incorrect sometimes. Appropriate, more detailed naming of lecture videos and regular timing of video uploads (maybe even just uploading them all at once) with captions would be really, really helpful to student learning facilitation.\r\nThe beginning of the semester with the random study groups was a bit stressful. I lucked out with two good study groups, but I heard horror stories from friends who had study groups where they would all just not respond in the breakout rooms or stay silent and not do their parts on groupwork. We know we are supposed to report this type of behavior, but it truly was stress-inducing in the beginning. The group midterms were good, though, albeit a bit buggy sometimes because of problems with Zoom screenshare, but that's not the fault of the teaching team. It worked out in the end.",
                "The live lectures could be more helpful. They tried to make it a problem solving session but I think it would've been better if they just did live lecture. There was just way too many things going on with this course. I was forced to do physics every single day when I had other courses to be concerned about.",

                "The virtual study halls were incredibly helpful for learning content in an interactive way, which can be challenging in large Zoom lectures. I also found tutorial problems to be helpful for learning the material, and using the whiteboard feature on Zoom was an effective way to allow groups to collaborate.",
                "I don't think we should've had to code at all. Definitely also should've given students an asynchronous option",
                "I was frustrated that this class exceeded its allotted lecture time; we had lives lectures, tutorials (weekly section), and recorded lectures. It made planning for other courses difficult. On the positive side, the professor made sure there was collaboration in the class though by making mandatory study groups which took some of the pressure off for tests and quizzes. The utilization of a Zoom chat link was incredibly helpful in facilitating study halls\/",
                "The study groups were still very helpful in my opinion, especially during an online format. The tutorials were unnecessary because it just served as more time I had to dedicate towards the class that didn't help at all with my level of understanding of the week's content. The final project in lieu of the exam took a lot of stress off the shoulder of students and highlights what we got out of the course at the end of the semester, which I really enjoyed.",

I think that I was better able to learn the material and having group members to bounce ideas off of was very helpful.\r\n\r\nI think that the only improvement I would recommend is to make the course more manageable. The sheer amount of time into this class was overwhelming: we had pre-recorded lectures, live virtual lectures, tutorials, the extremely long problem sets, and weekly quizzes.

It helped me form relationships with my peers and form a support network which I would have lacked in an online setting.\r\n\r\nI also thought adding a coding component to the course was unnecessary.  I took this class to learn about physics and biology.  If I had wanted to learn how to code, I would have taken a computer science class.

It was also an additional hour of zooming after a long week of staring at my computer.",

Also the before class lectures would have been more helpful if they were just covered in class time.",

Using class time to teach concepts then psets to reinforce \/ practice solving problems might lessen the heavy workload of this course, even when the concepts were not the most difficult to master. It was also a little frustrating to have discussion sections at different times each week with different TF's. Plus, flipping study groups in the middle of the semester, while I understand the reasoning behind doing it, was quite frustrating \/ unbalancing mid-term.",
                "The group assessments really adapted PHYS 170 to the pandemic by emphasizing the parts of the course that have always worked well, namely study groups and collaborative problem sets.

                "I do not believe that three live zoom sessions were needed. Maximum one.",
                "The course required one to spend too many hours on zoom\/staring at a screen, way more hours than would have been spent in person in normal semesters. Between watching pre-recorded lectures, live lectures, study hall hours, and tutorials, not even mentioning any additional office hours, a student could easily log a minimum of 10+ online hours per week just for this class. Also the group format, which was supposed to be useful to offset the difficulties of online learning, made things a lot worse in some cases. First, the groups were randomly assigned, not taking into time zone or scheduling availability, which made tutorials very hard to schedule (sometimes it wasnt even a student issue rather the TA wouldnt reach out with their availability until half way through the week). Also, over zoom taking an exam with multiple peoples voices talking and zooms glitches was very stressful (students with exam accommodations were denied any exception and had to take the exam in these groups, even if this style was a detriment to their learning). Working in groups was also harder because one could be placed in a good group where everyone worked together and spilt the work equally or at least all out in effort, or at times the groups could be terrible. Many students had experiences in which they were with other students who didnt study, prepare, or try, but rather relied on the efforts of their other group mates. Especially when it seems to be just one group member that cares enough to want a good grade in the course, there was a possibility that a student could be taking the group quiz\/exams by themselves while the other kept their camera\/audio off, but still got the credit\/good score. Additionally, the professor included a coding component and did not screen the TAs to see which TAs could assist students who did not have a strong coding background (any form a coding was not listed as a prerequisite for the course). There ended up being only 1 TA who knew the coding program we used for the course, which made getting help even harder. The professor was also really hesitant to change any aspect of the course format even hen multiple students would raise these issues.",

If you're able to place into PHYS 200 I think I've heard great things about that one. 170 and 180 are just way too much work for an intro physics course and could be taught in a much better way. These really suck for students who have had no exposure to physics and are just trying to begin learning.",
                "No, unless it is required. This course takes up way too much time and you don't feel like you get much from it. It's not rewarding even if you do well. I honestly felt like I spent so much time on this course when I could've taken 2 other courses that I would've gotten much more from.",
                "Probably would not recommend this course, unless there was a similar version of it available that focused on physics (without the bio). Otherwise, I would probably recommend taking PHYS 180, even though there is more math involved. PHYS170 was practically entirely self-taught. Any student who says otherwise must've came into this course having already taken physics of some sort in high school or elsewhere. In this class a student was expected to watch and learn from the recorded lectures before each class, and then actually attend the zoom class (in which no true instruction would occur, just rapidly answering difficult questions using the PollEverywhere app and not explanation as to why the answer was correct\/incorrect). Problem sets were extremely difficult, requiring over 12 hours of work for most of them and having to teach yourself through each problem. On top of that, \"tutorial\" sessions were required once a week, in which students were essentially graded on their knowledge of the concepts and ability to solve a problem (being graded on how well you were able to teach yourself...?) In addition to all of that, there was no textbook to reference from. The course concepts were not likely found on the internet at all, so if you had questions or wanted to figure something out, there was almost no way to go about it. This course was abstract and diverged from the physics that I was once excited to learn. I feel that the material was broad, complex, and niche, all at the same time, and that I would have difficult solving even the most simple standard physics question since my foundations are so weak. This is disappointing since most students in the class are pre-med and take this class in order to prepare for the physics on the MCAT. None of this material would relate to the MCAT, except maybe F= ma.",
                "no",
                "No because it wasn't taught in a way that all students would've been able to learn (some need pictures, others need more words, others need more examples shown)",
                "Yes, the topics of the course are fascinating. I can't imagine any other physics course using nonlinear differential equations to predict COVID-19 infections-- especially an introductory physics course that makes this sort of calculation is accessible. More broadly, the course gives you a background in vectors, kinematics, work, energy, statistics and probability, diffusion, random walks, and statistical mechanics as applied to biology and is really intellectually exciting. That being said, be prepared to work on problem sets that are often difficult and require a TA's assistance. The resources are all there for you to succeed in this course-- it is only a matter of taking advantage of them.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student. The topics are very niche and overall pretty interesting. I didn't know what I was doing half the time, but because it's a class that heavily stresses collaboration and learning, I realized I ended up learning a lot more than I thought I did, which is a pleasant surprise.",
                "I really liked Professor Mochrie and the biology applications of this physics course.",
                "Yes, if they have a passion for physics and biology.",
                "You have to take a physics class - between 170 and 180 I don't think there's a huge difference between the two, but definitely shop them both ( I didn't). I definitely think I enjoyed the biological focus of this class much more than I thought I would so I think 170 was the right choice for me.",
                "Yes. Lots of work but it pays off. Also TA's are absolutely wonderful. Must go to study hall. Suuuuuper key for p-sets",
                "I've heard very good things about PHYS 180; that said, I do not know math enough to handle 180 nor did I desire to take more math beyond 112 so 170 it is. Physics is a premed req and this class is interesting at some points when it makes sense. For what it is, 170 gets the prereq out of the way and can be less stressful depending on how much time you have to put into it, especially as you almost need to attend 6 hours of study hall to understand the pset questions. Definitely take it with friends. While initial lessons\/teaching is difficult to follow, there are a lot of supports and TAs\/ULAs are very understanding of how difficult the course matter is and are patient and willing to help.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: there is no actual introductory physics course at Yale for someone who has never taken physics in high school so you have two options: take 180 if you're comfortable with calc, take 170 if you think bio application would help you be more engaged in class, also take whichever you have a support system in (peers etc.)",
                "Yes.  If you need to take physics as a prerequisite for graduate school (or your major), this is a great course for more biology-oriented students.",
                "Yes! For pre-meds\/life sciences majors looking for a more interesting, fun course, take this over 180! Especially if you don't love the rigorous math 180 is known for. The final coding project makes this class particularly alluring if you have any familiarity with programming (if not, that's fine too, as you will learn the basics throughout the class, and the final really is not much work even if you've never written a line of code before). This course will teach you a lot of everything--physics, a little biology, a good amount of statistics, and a hint of linear algebra (don't worry--it is really simple linear algebra that is explained clearly!). Mochrie is incredibly kind and helpful, and adjusts based on feedback (a rare quality in stem professors!). He explains things well, too. The group work is a huge pro of this class as well--one of the few collaborative Yale courses!",
                "I would only recommend this class to a pre-med who has not taken multivariable calculus.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student. The course was very time consuming and was not very well structured. The pset questions were incredibly difficult and could only be completed with the help of a TA. The professor often makes mistakes during lectures, leading to confusion amongst the students when his ideas and work does not match up.",
                "Yes if you have to take it. They ensure that students do well in the class and actually learn the material with the weekly psets. That being said it is a ton of work week to week.",
                "I would say yes, I do recommend this course to another student. I think that this course is geared towards helping students learn the material instead of memorizing it and I believe that is important.",
                "I would recommend the course, as it makes physics more interesting through its application to other sciences and everyday processes.",
                "Definitely not. I am a premed student who thought I would take this class because I'm not all that into physics and thought that a more bio related physics class would be easier and more interesting and would adequately prepare me for MCAT physics. I could not have been more wrong, and I really wish I had taken Phys 180. If you are deciding between 170 and 180, TAKE 180. I don't feel as though I learned anything in this class, and yet it gave me by far the most work out of any class this semester. In addition to having to watch both live and prerecorded lectures, which meant twice as much class time, the problem sets consistently featured numerous problems that we had never learned. This meant that in order to do well on them you had to go to additional office hours and study hall times. Furthermore, on many problem sets and the final project we were required to do coding in the coding language mathematica, which we had never been taught and only one of the TAs actually knew how to use. Additionally there were quizzes every week to add to the amount of work required for this class. The textbook that the class uses is an unfinished textbook written by the professor himself, so if you don't understand what is going on in class ever, you can't even turn to the textbook for an explanation because it has the exact same explanation and problems written by him. Overall I feel as though this class was a huge waste of time. I didn't learn any actually useful physics and had to put in far more work each week than for my other classes.",
                "If you are interested in biological physics.",
                "This class is a big time commitment, but this is one of the times where I dont think that should scare you off. I highly recommend this class. Professor Mochrie, Professor Sweeney, and the ULA team are so kind, helpful, and extremely committed to the students learning. Theyve managed to create an environment thats more collaborative and fun than any other STEM lecture Ive taken at Yale. Especially if youre a pre-med choosing between physics classes, I couldnt recommend this one more.",
                "I would recommend this if either 1) you need physics for a biological application or 2) you've taken traditional physics before but need to take physics anyway because this is not a traditional physics class. Frankly, it deviates very far from regular physics syllabi but I think that's what makes it so interesting! Very sick class and reasonable expectations when it comes to work.",
                "If you are considering this course, you probably need it for a requirement. I took this course because I'm premed, but don't have the math requirements for PHYS 180. I would say that it was actually really interesting to learn about physics as applied to biology and will likely prove more useful than PHYS 180 if pursuing medicine\/biological sciences work.Prof. Mochrie is really sweet and cares a lot about the students doing well \/ learning. While it was difficult transitioning the course to an online format, Prof. Mochrie was very forgiving with grading. Definitely would recommend the course in an in-person format if possible, but would still recommend the virtual format with some adjustments to the flipped classroom format.",
                "Yes, but maybe the course would be better in person. It was exhausting to have so much content\/screen time for this class",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who doesn't like physics and has a passion for biology\/medicine because I managed to enjoy it and redefine physics itself over the course of the semester.",
                "I would recommend this class to any student who wants a different perspective to physics. This class emphasizes how physics can be applied to biological phenomena, however, it definitely does not go over typical physics concepts that you might want if you've never been exposed to physics before.",
                "I would recommend this class to pre-med majors that want to learn physics with less math and biological applications.",
                "No, this is not a \"fun\" class.  While the class reveals many fascinating relationships and patterns in the world, the workload is just too much to merit taking it for any reason besides to fulfill pre-med requirements.  And apparently the office hours in Phys 180 make that class preferable to many.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in learning basic physics concepts behind common biological phenomena.",
                "I assume people mostly take this class for pre-med requirements.",
                "If you have to take physics take it with professor Mochrie he is kind and understanding and wants his students to succeed",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, definitely especially for biological sciences adjacent people.",
                "Yes actually.",
                "No, if it is a requirement, just push through the math in PHYS 180. This type of pain and suffering is not worth it.",
                "Yes its a very interesting course, relating physics to biology."
