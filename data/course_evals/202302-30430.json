                "Generally it was a very valuable course which gave me a more holistic understanding of psychology as a whole. In terms of knowledge, most aspects of psychology (experimental and clinical) were discussed throughout the course, enriching my knowledge of this field. Communication skills and writing skills were also enhanced through class discussions and writing assignment. I believe I also gained more insights in solving the question \"who am I\" (as myself and as a human) and understanding more about our mind.",
                "Introductory psychological concepts such as what allows us to have memory, what are emotions, and why do we sleep.",
                "I gained insight into research methods in various fields within psychology, and I learned how to substantiate arguments using relevant evidence from results of psychological experiments.",

            "comments": [
                "Strength: \r\n-Self-paced: I think the time for finishing assignments and viewing lectures are very flexible\r\n-Suitable workload: can be completed within given time\r\n-Engaging in class discussion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Maybe lectures can have subtitles? \r\n-I think it would be helpful to have more times when we go into breakout rooms, so more people get a chance to speak",
                "Strengths: Assignments were clearly communicated. Assignments were structured in order for us to really engage with the material and grading/feedback was always returned before the class the assignment corresponded with. The class offers a wide variety of cool psychological information (I say this as a non-psych major who just finds the field interesting)!\r\nWeaknesses: Workload is a little heavier than the other summer classes i've taken in the past (but not unmanageable).",
                "The material was taught in a way that was both easy to understand and enjoyable, with each important concept being explained through a connection to everyday life or to pop culture. Another strength was that what was discussed in the synchronous class meetings and the prerecorded lectures bounced off of each other nicely. The only weakness would be that the bulk of the content had to be learned asynchronously via a prerecorded format, but since this was an online course, I feel that it was inevitable.",
                "Strengths: the content is interesting and the Professor and TA are pleasant. Opportunities for improvement: (1) please update the lecture videos or at least post updated information about content, particularly for the lectures where the Professor stated that the videos filmed seven years ago were out of touch with his current views; (2) please consider offering drop-in office hours every week at a set time; (3) please consider publishing a mid-semester feedback form, which was discussed but didn't end up happening; (4) I would appreciate faster email responses from the Professor (ideally 24-48 hours instead of six days out of a five week course--I understand that life happens, so a heads up at least that he won't be responding to emails would be appreciated); (5) please do not set extra credit assignments due past the last day of summer session classes; (6) please upload specific, detailed rubrics for homework assignments and examples of satisfactory responses (when points are sometimes docked because a response failed to achieve an standard for concreteness within the word limit, it would be helpful to see clear examples and rubrics of the type of response desired).\r\n\r\nI appreciate the challenges of condensing a course to the five-week online summer session format, and I think both Professor Dunham and Pinar (the graduate student) wanted the course to be a success. I have taken another online summer course that was very engaging and organized, and I think this course could become more enriching, too, if the above points were addressed.",
                "I do not learn well with a flipped classroom model. I would rather have a lecture and then go to a separate discussion section.",

                "Yes, definitely! It's a great introduction to the basics of psychology and can really give you a taste of what you might be interested in!",
                "Yes I would recommend this course. Firstly I think it is a course that really helps enhance students' knowledge and it would be helpful for no matter high school students who wish to major in psych in the future, or students who are just generally interested in the course. Secondly, the course is organized in a way that is easy to follow and would not get you too stressful during the summer, so one can still have some time to rest while studying. Lastly, I just generally think that it really helps answer some big question we as human might have, such as 'why am I who I am', 'what makes as human', 'what is going on in our mind' and other questions like these.",
                "Yes. The material was explained thoroughly and parsably, and the writing assignments were thought-provoking and helpful in solidifying my understanding of the content. The content itself was also intriguing and, much of the time, applicable to real life.",
                "No. I have taken another online introductory Yale summer session course that was engaging and I learned a lot from it. This course was not up to that standard.\r\n\r\nOn multiple occasions the Professor said that the seven-year-old lecture videos were out of date, but did not provide explanations on how the concepts have changed. The TA and Professor alternated teaching the classes, so of the nine hour-and-a-half meetings (the last one being the final exam), the Professor led five and the TA led four. When the Professor turned the course over to Pinar (the graduate student) for a week, he did not respond to email for this time, which makes up 20% of a five week course. We didn't have the time to cover many of the concepts discussed in the lecture; I would have appreciated if there were office hours to go to in order to discuss the material more. The grading felt arbitrary at times; I would have appreciated concrete rubrics or at least examples of homework responses. At the beginning of the semester, we were told that there would be an opportunity for us to give mid-semester feedback about the course, but there was no follow through.",
