Even on days where I felt crummy about the work I'd produced, my advisor found the good in it, and encouraged me to see my ideas through to the end. And I think that's probably one of the best things about the experience of the Writing Concentration: you learn how to undertake a large, expansive project, and how to tough-it out through those periods in the writing process where you want to scrap everything and quit. It's an experience that will teach you resilience, and while it can be extremely challenging, it is altogether very rewarding. And oftentimes, very fun.",

Not only were our group meetings not very helpful, but Professor Zarin was regularly dismissive and unkind to students both in one-on-one meetings and in front of everyone else for no apparent reason. For one (relatively mild, but typical) example, she once responded to a classmate's project update, \"You know the deadline is in two weeks, right?,\" implying that their project was not as developed as that classmate had initially thought. This response seemed, at the very least, unhelpful, if not humiliating. I was nervous before every meeting, and I know that I am not the only student who felt this way. I have never written a course evaluation like this before, but the Writing Concentration added so much stress to an already difficult semester and I want future creative writing students to know that if they experience this, they are not alone. I would advise younger students to consider an independent study in creative writing rather than the Concentration."
