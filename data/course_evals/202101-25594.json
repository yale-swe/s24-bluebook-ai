                "I learned a lot about how conceptions of nature and wilderness and how those are related to the concepts of settler colonialism, slavery, racism, and capitalism. I also gained new insights and skills in analyzing art, especially art that depicts nature and landscapes. This class made me rethink a lot of the ways I think about the outdoors, and how we interact, or don't, with nature. I also developed my analytical skills in reading pretty in depth theoretical texts.",
                "I learned a lot about how to think about how to think about race in the context about American history and American relations with wilderness. I also developed visual analysis skills.",
                "I learned so much about racial theory and understandings of wilderness, savagery, landscape, and how they intersect with understandings and literary\/artistic representations of race in American history. I definitely learned a lot about how to incorporate theory and visual analysis in my final paper.",
                "This course really changed my way of thinking about the origins of conceptions of wilderness and human in the United States and the world. We read a variety of texts ranging from Locke and Thoreau, to Wilderson and Mbembe, among others, and discussed in class about how wilderness is constructed, and how the position of the human is intertwined with this. Further, we also learned about art history in relation to these topics."

                "I think one strength of this course was how we approached 'wilderness' from many angles and in various parts of history. The readings were all very informative and interesting. Some were very heavy and more dense than others. I think the reading load was a bit heavy to begin with, but the lowered reading load once we started looking at art was very helpful. I think another weakness was that sometimes class felt more like a lecture because the readings were so dense and we often spend most of the class just going over them as opposed to discussing them. I think one improvement could be to include more small group discussions and then coming back as a whole.",
                "I really enjoyed the readings. I would say that the course could be improved by connecting it more explicitly to wilderness and nature.",
                "This class is very theory-heavy. I definitely learned a lot about Afropessimist scholarship, but the secondary readings often took up more class time than the primary texts or artworks. I learnt a lot about the underlying frameworks that define the relationship between humans and nature and their roots in chattel slavery, but there was less time spent on the actual encounters with wilderness. This class will certainly give you much to think about and forces you to rethink many basic assumptions about the modern world, but much of the reading is not directly about wilderness. Because the readings included a lot of dense theory, most of class time was spent doing chronological read-throughs of the text. If you like a lecture style, this is great, but there was little class discussion outside of the Canvas posts. The presentation assignments also focused on the readings, so there was a lot of repetition between class presentations and discussion.",
                "Strengths: I LOVED the course material and how interdisciplinary it was, I loved how we learned about environmental racism, racism in the context of early American literature and painting, and racism in and land politics in law. The second half of the course was particularly engaging, and listening to speakers who came in and talked about art was also really great.\r\nWeaknesses: I thought that the readings were super interesting and important, but I wish that we did more in class than discuss our homework (readings and films\/artwork we looked at before class). I think it may have been a lot more engaging and fruitful if we looked at real world examples in class or expanded the conversation past the readings themselves. I don't know if this would have been possible given the restraints of the class or the schedule, but if we looked at what environmental racism looked like in a modern context or spent time making more explicit connections between the historical and the contemporary."

                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who plans to study any environmental-related field. I think it is so important for people to understand the histories of the environmental and preservation movements. The class is a lot of reading but in the end it is worthwhile and I think provides a good foundation on critical race theory and radical authors who are thinking about broad topics such as race, the 'human,' nature, and landscape.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot about how to discuss Blackness in the context of American history. Even though that wasn't exactly what I thought I had signed up for with this course, I ended up engaging really deeply with the course material and appreciating that slant to the issue of wilderness.",
                "YES! The course was so fascinating, eye-opening, and really changed the way that I consider landscape, art, and idealized notions of nature, which have racialized roots. I think that the syllabus is fantastic and I learned so much.",
