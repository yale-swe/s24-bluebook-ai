Anyone who is interested in anything related to global stuff, like international geopolitics, culture, language, history, geography, I highly recommend this course. A great way to further pursue your passions while also improving your writing, which is extremely important in this field.",

He gives constructive feedback for your writing which helps you to improve your paper greatly and improve the way you approach your writing. Always encouraging and very knowledgeable on the topic. Best class by far."
