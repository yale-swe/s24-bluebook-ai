   "comments": [
    "I developed an understanding of what genius is and what enables it- the types of cognitive processes and internal traits, such as analogical thinking, curiosity, and passion. I learned how to be more creative in my own life.",
    "I was able to think more deeply than ever before on the questions of creativity, genius and prodigies. We explored topics salient to the life of illustrious figures such as Da Vinci, Newton, Einstein and many others. In so doing, we explored common enablers of genius and creativity, some of which can be developed through simple ways! I learned that before attempting to solve a problem, it is useful to watch something funny. This course was surprisingly more applicable to everyday life than I initially thought.",
    "I learned a lot about important historical figures that I didn't know a lot about before. This course also encouraged me to explore questions and ideas to a much greater extent than I am used to and dig far beyond their surface. Lastly, taking this course forced me to learn how to manage my time better and plan out when I will complete my assignments far in advance.",
    "I definitely strengthened my writing skills in this course. I also learned a lot about the common traits of genius which include the flaws they often possess. The class really makes you wonder whether chasing genius is worth it.",
    "I learned about society's relationship with and inflated view of the genius. I also learned the complexity of genius and the suspected enablers of genius. I thoroughly enjoyed having the opportunity to read about the lives of specific geniuses across a variety of interests.",
    "Refined writing skills, developed an understanding of genius.",
    "Writing and critical thinking skills",
    "My ability to write concisely improved because of this course. The paper topics were such that 10, even 20 pages would not have been inappropriate, but the strict and short word limits forced me to focus on only the most salient details while still ensuring the paper was well structured and read well. Outside of that strict academic context, I also learned certain life skills, namely how to facilitate creativity, and what matters most between IQ and EQ. It was a wonderful, informative course.",
    "I learned about the nuances associated with a complex topic, as well as practical skills related to researching and learning about new breakthroughs in psychology. I developed insight into the importance of etymology and tackling issues from as many different angles as possible. I also improved my writing.",
    "I was able to learn a lot about the historical definition of genius and who has fit that definition over time. We focused on individuals from a variety of fields that were all labeled geniusthey shared the same enablers but each were unique in how they expressed their enablers",
    "I learned a lot about the nuances and history of genius, a familiar notion, but something I had never really explored with much philosophical or historical depth. Much of what I learned is applicable to daily life, as I learned about the psychology and neuroscience of creativity, as well. This course also greatly improved my writing skills.",
    "I gained knowledge regarding the history of the notion of \"genius,\" examples of genius, and the common enablers and characteristics of geniuis."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The content is a strength, as are the essay topics (I've really enjoyed writing them). However, I found the essay grading to be unnecessarily harsh. I got a low grade on an essay because it was too broad in scope and then another low grade on an essay that was supposedly too narrow; be careful to do exactly what the task is asking of you. For a class that emphasizes creativity and thinking out of the box, this is a bit of a paradox. Overall, the course was very interesting and I'm glad I took it.",
    "Stengths:\r\n- Clear feedback on the papers to improve writing\r\n- having a writing tutor was a big advantage\r\n- the questions accompanying the reading enabled better comprehension of the texts and were useful to index specific information in a text when I had to find quotes\r\n- the discussion sections, more so than the powerpoints perhaps, helped cement understanding of key terms and expand my views on certain topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- the powerpoints were perhaps not as interactive as they could have been\r\n- the hand raising option in-built in zoom might be a neater way to divide screen time among students who wish to speak; the physical hand raising is often missed via Zoom\r\n- the prompt on the third essay was perhaps too scattered. The motivating questions are useful but they need to be accompanied by a succinct and direct prompt.",
    "The readings assigned in this course were relevant and captivating. The fact that the questions assigned with the readings had page numbers that corresponded with the text made completing the assignments a lot more efficient. Another helpful aspect of the course was the resources provided to help with writing the papers. On top of that, the instructors made themselves available to meet and answered all questions very quickly. One thing that would improve this course is if there was a way to view and access all of the readings at once; this would make writing papers easier.",
    "I enjoyed the class discussion along with the readings about various geniuses. Another strength of the course was its structure. It was kind of like a high school class where you had regular homework and engagement with the material. So you worked with the material almost every day and I think that helps you get more out of the class.",
    "kind of unorganized, loved the opportunity to resubmit essays",
    "Strengths were some of the discussions. Interesting to read about various people who are revered as geniuses.\r\nThe central weakness of the course was that it sometimes seemed to lack rigor. I don't think we ever got to the bottom of whether 'genius' is a social construct or not. For papers, we were told to assume that 'genius' was a real thing, but we were also told that it was just a social idea. I also don't think that the course touched on the role of luck enough. If you have to change the world to be a genius, you need to be lucky, too. We seemed to gloss over that point. We also could have talked about whether the concept of genius was at all valuable, or if it was  completely superficial. \r\nSome of the readings were simplistic. People like Malcolm Gladwell are just pop psychology--should we really be reading them? Given that the course was being taught by two people with strictly humanities backgrounds, I think it would have been better to steer clear of psychology all together. \r\nLastly, I thought many of the paper prompts were unclear or overly complicated relative to the paper lengths. In no other course at Yale have I been asked to write so many papers under 1000 words. I don't really think these short papers help improve writing that much.",
    "Very strong course. Enjoyed it very much. Well rounded course that teaches humanities, writing, and culture.",
    "The class length was ideal, because longer sections in summer classes can become hard to focus on. I thought the reading quizzes were helpful, as were the reading assignments, but many of the video assignments seemed redundant. Because the readings served as the source material for most of the papers, I think the videos and video questions could be eliminated.",
    "The strengths of the course include the multiple avenues that facilitated student learning. Through in-person seminars, video lectures, readings, and research essays, we were able to engage with the topic in a variety of different ways. The instructor feedback could have been more extensive or in-depth than it was. I would like to have seen scheduled office hour times.",
    "The biggest strength of the course was definitely prof. Wright and our TA Jakub. They were both very insightful in the subject area and you can tell that they truly care about students me success. I feel that while this class isnt necessarily easy, it is a low-stress environment that allows you to focus on learning rather than grades. The only weakness I can think of would be that the videos we had to watch and their subsequent questions were at times a bit tedious to answerI think that the questions should either be shortened or the some of the videos be a bit shorter.",
    "I think the structure of the class with the video responses, readings, and daily quizzes were really good for a summer course, as they kept me engaged and not slacking at all throughout the process."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you would like to learn more about prominent (mostly Western, historical) figures and discuss what enables genius (mostly from a psychological perspective, also from sociological and neuroscientific perspectives). This course is a writing credit, but if you're looking specifically to improve your writing, try English 114 or another course.",
    "I would if one is interested in exploring eccentric and mysterious characters of the past and getting tips on how to perhaps be more like them.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It combines humanities and psychology in a very comprehensive way and is overall very interesting as well as informative. The work load can be a bit overwhelming at times but it is mostly manageable.",
    "I would. The course material is very interesting, the professors were very accommodating during the pandemic, and it's a good way to improve your writing.",
    "absolutely, best writing class i could ever take",
    "It was fine but not great. I don't think we really got too far on the actual concept of genius. After a couple weeks, we were simply expected to accept the professor's definition. So, you have to want to learn about this specific (somewhat random) group of people. Otherwise, there are likely better WR courses or humanities courses.",
    "Yes, fantastic course that is really interesting and engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in improving their writing in a stress-free environment or who just wants to learn more about what made some of history's perennial figures tick.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. This course is an example of the level of high intellect and interdisciplinary thinking that I would no less expect from a course at Yale. This has been one of my favorite classes so far and it has changed my perspective and outlook on various topics.",
    "Yes! Very interesting material on genius.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you need to take a WR, this is a class that is both interesting and is not solely focused on writing techniques. Unlike an English course, the papers are largely argumentative, allowing you to develop your own opinions from the reading and vouch for them rather than merely elaborate on the ideas of others. Low-stress, stimulating class with a professor that genuinely cares about his students and the classyou can tell this is Prof. Wrights passion project.",
    "Absolutely! I enjoyed the course a lot content-wise. The amount of writing, while abundant for such a short period of time, is very feasible with good planning.",
    "I would, as it is good exposure to a concept of genius that, while certainly not applicable to most, one can draw hints from to improve their own work. I also thought that the writing process of revision and working with the peer tutor greatly helped my abilities."
