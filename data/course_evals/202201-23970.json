                "I learned so much from this course, it was truly amazing. Definitely a lot of work and moves very fast, but totally worth it.",
                "Learning how to think through philosophical arguments, writing essays, coming up with my own philosophical ideas",
                "I have developed much of my close reading, comprehension and analytical skills. I have learnt to read a text closely and pose questions to aid in my understanding of the text and to challenge the author on their views. I have learnt to engage with the texts studied in a classroom environment, practicing listening and participating in argumentative discussion in a non-dominating and respectful manner. The assigned essays have allowed me to work on my philosophy writing skills and challenge myself, exploring new and different styles.",
                "This course was incredibly helpful for improving my writing and reading skills (especially reading of difficult philosophy). Most importantly, I think I greatly improved my critical thinking, which will be helpful in any class I'm in in the future.",
                "I learned about how a number of philosophical issues from the fall semester of DS evolved from Descartes to 20th century philosophy.",
                "I gained a general overview of modern philosophy.",
                "Thinking critically.\r\nEngaging with classmates\r\nLearning to be comfortable with unknowability, and overcoming moments of terrifying cluelessness.",
                "I gained an overview of modern Western philosophy and expanded on the practice of reading and evaluating philosophy that I had begun in the first semester of DS. This semester was especially focused on considerations of identity and existence, duty and justice, and the purpose of philosophy more broadly.",

                "I think we should have looked at philosophy from more diverse sources near the end of the course. I think having like two women and nothing else (du Bois was in H&P!) really did not help, and I know I KNOW there are black and other bipoc philosophers out there, that have emerged from whatever the western canon means. Obviously we're not going to delve into a whole nother realm of philosophy, but I think it would be helpful to have multiple perspectives please for the love of god DS it's been like a billion years can we please get less white men in here",
                "I don't have anything to improve about this course  it was truly amazing and I already miss it. Especially Professor Grimstad's teaching! From what I've heard from friends in other sections, the experience of 2nd semester depended a lot on the professor, and I feel so lucky to have had him.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- covers a broad range of philosophical works from the western canon \r\n- gives a substantial platform for reading and discussing philosophy further\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- sometimes the speed at which the course is covered sacrifices depth for breadth \r\n- despite the broad syllabus, at times certain philosophers felt significant to western thought but were not studied i.e. they were skipped",
                "This was an incredible course! The journey through modern philosophy gave me a great foundation. I think the first half of the syllabus was stronger than the second. Post Kant, I think the syllabus felt a bit disjointed. I thought Beauvoir would have been better if we had a proper foundation in existentialism. Reading some Hegel and Heidegger probably would have been useful. I think Wittgenstein could have been helpful in the last week or so as well, especially once we got to Anscombe.",
                "this course was amazing in basically every way.",
                "Mostly strengths, Grimstad is a fabulous professor and he facilitated class discussions extremely well and really made sure we understood the most important aspects of the material. Its weaknesses were really the weaknesses of DS in general in that we moved extremely quickly and read almost entirely male authors.",
                "Strengths: Clear explanations of readings in class. This ensured the discussion afterward would be more productive.\r\n\r\nWeakness: If I have to nitpick, not covering Fichte panicked me a little in the moment but in hindsight, was completely harmless.",
                "Second semester philosophy does a good job of drawing connections between the authors we read and helping us understand how ideas progress. There were times when I started getting lost with the more abstract concepts, and I think it would have been beneficial to receive a simpler breakdown of the ideas either in class or in lecture. When I was reviewing for the final, I realized that there were some significant gaps in my understanding, and it would have been helpful to have some sort of check-ins throughout the semester to make sure that I was keeping up conceptually. Overall though, a well-structured course.",
                "I enjoyed this course a lot. Although we couldn't spend much time on any one philosopher, it was gratifying at the end of the semester to look back on all the different themes and see how the different thinkers connected to one another."

Second semester of DS is amazing because it's like the reward you worked for all first semester  the discussions tie everything together and made me think more deeply about my beliefs and views on the world than any class I've ever had. Wish I could do 4 more years of this!",
                "I would absolutely recommend Directed Studies to another student who I feel could fit the program well and would enjoy its structure and content. I thoroughly enjoyed DS, especially the philosophy tract, but I would not recommend it to any student wishing to take the three disciplines. Taking Directed Studies and combining them in this way is very particular and does demand a slightly different degree of motivation and interest. I would strongly recommend the directed studies philosophy tract, especially from the Spring, to anyone who wants a solid introductory understanding of western philosophical texts.",
                "YES! Anyone with any interest in philosophy, ethics, or just thinking should take this course! It gave me the most incredible foundation in Western philosophy. Even if I never take a philosophy course again (which is unlikely considering how much I enjoyed this course), I think what I learned will serve me so well in my academics and just my life in the future.",
                "I would completely recommend this course. it changed how i view the world, and it is incredibly stimulating intellectually. especially if you are interested in metaphysics and epistemology",

                "yes",

Together with first semester DS philosophy, I felt like I came out of it with a pretty solid understanding of major thinkers in Western philosophy that I will be able to take with me regardless of what I'm studying in the future. Learning how to write a philosophy paper is an especially helpful skill that feels applicable to other fields.",
