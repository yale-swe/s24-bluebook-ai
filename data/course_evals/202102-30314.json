I think I now have a much stronger grasp of how to apply linear algebra in other classes/circumstances.",
                "After taking Math S222, I've got a basic understanding of linear algebra. I learnt matrix operations and the way to solve a linear system; I knew the concept of vector space and linear transformation, then some more in-depth knowledge of matrices, like orthogonalization, determinant, and eigenvalue. Also, linear algrbra enables me to simplify my calculation in solving linear equations. This course has developed my insight into \"linear transformation\".",

                "Accelerated math classes can never be as good as the class during the normal semester but I believe James had a decent way of condensing the class. The concept of the four fundamental subspaces did not have enough explanation and we didn't really get to cover the spectral theorem fully either. One can only cover so much in 5 weeks.",
                "This course was very strong. The only thing that I wished had been different was that I wish we had had more time to learn about the Spectral Theorem and Singular Value Decomposition at the end.",
                "The course was very accessible regardless of prior math experience, which was nice. It moved a bit slowly and could possibly be improved by quickening the pace and introducing more topics.",
                "I think this course is successful in laying the foundation of linear algebra for students. It covers the knowledge in a comprehensive way and I think I've mastered basic knowledge of linear algebra after this course even if the course itself is compressed and fast-paced. \r\nHowever, I think the course still has something to improve. In my opinion, the introduction of matrix multiplication, a crucial concept in linear algebra, is a little abrupt in this course. I think matrix multiplication is a generalization of matrix multiplying a vector, and the result of \"a matrix multiplying a vector\" is abstracted from linear equations. Therefore I think there might be some more detailed depiction of matrix multiplication, which can help lay a more solid foundation for students. Also, from my point of view, the introduction of linear transformation is also a little bit too fast-paced and maybe too early. In the last few lessons, this concept is frequently used, so I was a little frustrated at that time. So I think the order of the lessons can be moderated a little bit.",
                "The expectations of the course were communicated well, and it was very thorough in its scope.  The main weakness is that there were problems due every day on content learned the day before, which limits one's opportunities to ask questions before turning in graded work.",
                "Loved the mid class breaks. Didnt like the difficulty of daily homework",
                "The strength of this course is that it meets every day, which allows for shorter and more regular lectures. One weakness of the course was that since the problem sets were assigned one day and due the next, it could sometimes be difficult to get help if needed."

                "No, not in a compressed summer timeline! Prof James is an entertaining and a good professor but 222 in a summer format is TERRIBLE. There is daily class with daily p sets and weekly tests which really add up. If you are taking a non-gut 2nd summer session class, this is torturous. There is no time for catchup and you will be spending several hours on the class each day, which is not always possible/you may not want to do it some days. This class is probably 10x more manageable if taught during the school year since overall the tests were fair and Prof James' handouts were super helpful. Another annoying thing is that the HWs are worth a large part of the grade, but it is hard to consistently get high grades on them when they are daily, not much time to check answers, and there are no answer keys.",
