Tense used to be difficult for me to differentiate when to use each of the types, and now Im able to use them not only in writing but speaking as well.",
                "I was able to improve on my oral ability to speak French and build tremendously on my vocabulary.",
                "I developed strong french reading/writing/listening/speaking skills. After taking L1 and L2, I could do basic French but I couldn't call myself a French speaker. But now I feel no guilt about writing French skills - intermediate on my resume. I also engaged with various literature and films in the French world. Formed strong bonds with classmates.",

The course strengthens your French vocabulary and grammar a lot (verb tenses and conjugations, subjonctif, conditionals, articles, feminine vs masculine etc). You get acquainted with classics of French literature (The Stranger by Camus) and film (Jules et Jim).",
                "Intermediate to advanced knowledge of the French language as well as culture.",
                "Better French speaking, writing, and listening skills. My ability to converse in French greatly increased, and I've also developed an affinity for reading books in French.",

                "I not only greatly improved my French vocabulary and grammar exercises throughout this semester, but I learned a lot about French literature, film, and culture through the class' syllabus."

            "comments": [
                "I think that the five tests throughout the semester were unnecessarily difficult and the course was generally not suited for learning how to use the language but rather know strange grammar rules. Not enough emphasis on vocabulary.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. I think it was challenging but having an attentive professor really aided my learning and facilitated my growth. I also really enjoyed the mixed media in the course and the opportunity to connect more with the culture through it. However, I think there are some parts of the class, workload wise, that make it almost impossible to succeed and enjoy the process of learning.",
                "This course was highly engaging. I think thats what facilitated our learning of the language. Rather than having a standard lecture based setting, it was dynamic and constructive. No weaknesses.",
                "Strength - Seminar and participation style provokes more engagement\r\nWeaknesses - In order for the students to connect to the language, there must be fluidity or humanity in the class. If the class is too strict, it reduces the excitement to learn more French and at the end goal should be for students to comfortably speak and practice. Practice is key.",
                "Strengths: Xinyu is a great teacher and she is very friendly, accommodating, and brilliant in her way of teaching. Her teaching philosophy is well-established and consistent. If you go to class every day and do all the homework, there is literally no room for your French skills to NOT grow. There is a reason why students keep taking French despite the antiquity of its materials: the course itself is solid. But Xinyu really made the class shine, and despite all my friends telling me to withdraw from this class (that I didn't need to graduate or to complete my STEM major), I took this class alongside 4 other classes because she made every single class worth it. The entire class was brought close as classmates because she facilitated our friendship and camaraderie. / Weaknesses: On the other hand, the French department is not as lenient, with standards that are often strict for the sake of being strict. The materials that we study (literature, films) are chosen by the department and they are quite outdated. The course could benefit from more diverse readings with more female / non-white writers and characters especially to reflect the growing diversity of the course. One's growth in French heavily depends on the quality of your instructor and classmates.",
                "Strengths: an incredible professor, accommodations, prolonged office hours, individual attention, creative and engaging assignments, yummy food and a guest puppy during sections. I loved the movies we got to watch. My French improved immensely. Weaknesses: none!! The grading cutoffs mandated by the French department are a bit stressful, but honestly it was worth it! I have no regrets.",
                "Workload is far too intense, and the course is often more structured around memorization of plot points or quotes from specific readings than actual working knowledge of the French language.",
                "The syllabus feels a bit outdated. Everything we read was by white men, and I think it's time to diversify the reading list.",
                "There is quite a bit of work, especially if you have a tough professor, but you can do it. I enjoy learning French and felt I had all of the tools necessary to improve. I had Xinyu, who is one of the kindest people I've ever met. If you have a great professor, you might actually enjoy your language! \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the design of this course is that we do very little conversational speaking, or speaking at all. We memorize poems and quotes and have to respond to questions on the oral exams. Although, I don't feel as though I got enough practice carrying a conversation.",
                "The strengths of this course were the teaching and the class exercises. Coming to French class every day was undoubtedly the best part of my day, and that is largely due to Professor Guan's teaching and the sense of community she cultivated among our class. Our collaboration and the creative exercises Professor Guan created greatly improved my learning over the course of the semester. However, the weaknesses of this course were the department's grading policies. Oftentimes, the French department was overly punitive in its grading thresholds, deemphasizing learning the language for learning's sake and making the tests stressful. While Professor Guan's teaching offset this stress and underscored the fun of learning French, I think the department itself could revise its grading policies in the future!"

                "I would recommend my section wholeheartedly, but not so much for French 130 as a whole. It really depends on the class. Language learning is highly dependent on its social factor. Without a cooperative, uplifting team, its easy to lose interest in the language itself. Yes, students are going to be forced to study for the sake of results, but they can easily lose sight of the objective: to have a chance of becoming multilingual. That alone can deter them from moving forward and continuing with French here at Yale.",
                "I would but I would definitely warn them about the lack of humanity and connections and understanding in the course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if you are taught by a great instructor like Xinyu.",
                "YES! I would absolutely recommend this course (Xinyu's section in particular) to anyone, especially to those who want to learn French but are intimidated by the strict atmosphere in the French department and feel like they need more compassion and support in an academic environment. Learning French in Xinyu's section felt like having more of a personal tutor and friend instead of a distant professor + a close peer group who genuinely like coming to and engaging in class. I can't express how lucky I am to have gotten into this section, because my French genuinely improved, and I felt very supported throughout the whole semester.",
                "This is a required language course if you choose to take French, but if the student had the option, I would not recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes. If you are prepared to put work and effort into this course, you can succeed.",
                "I had Xinyu, a fantastic professor, and a fun group of classmates, so I would recommend this course. Although my experience was probably unique. If you have to take this class for a requirement, you might as well try to enjoy it. I looked forward to coming to class most days, and I liked that the work I was doing was pretty different from that of my other classes; I had some variety in my workload.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Taking French has been one of the best decisions I have made at Yale, and the community and skills I have gained from this course have been unparalleled! I greatly enjoyed coming to class each day. Professor Guan created unique and fun exercises each day, and the community she created improved our French skills by encouraging us to discuss a wide range of subjects with one another. The course's syllabus was also very strong this semester. This class reintroduced to my love for learning languages, and I am so glad that I decided to take it this semester.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are aware of the time commitment and exited to learn French, Your language skills with improve but you will also suffer at time during the semester especially when studying for exams."
