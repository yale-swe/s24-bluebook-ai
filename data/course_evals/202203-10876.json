                "I personally felt that the curriculum of this class was excessively theoretical. We certainly learned a lot about the theory of distributed systems as advertised, but there was essentially no connection back to how the material in question could be remotely relevant to real-world distributed computing problems. Additionally, while it was nice that there were no exams and only 5 problem sets, I felt that this decreased my retention of course information because there was no incentive to build real understanding of the material beyond what was necessary to complete the short problem sets.",
                "Strength: Super interesting topics. Hes a good lecturer. \r\nWeakness: Very niche topics related to profs research. Some times can move too fast. While its nice the workload was super low, feel like having midterms would keep the class more engaged.",
                "The course notes were incredible! I learned so much by just reading them. \r\n\r\nOn the other side of the coin, the course notes were so good that I didn't go to lecture or engage in the class significantly outside of them.",
                "No weaknesses. Course overall was very good.",
                "could be improved with perhaps an interesting project, other than this it is pretty complete. One think that could be improved is grading speed and amount of feedback given.",
                "The lectures can cover a lot of ground, and sometimes the proofs are hard to follow.\r\nIt would be useful if the main objective/ result of the proof is explicitly stated before starting the proof, and once it's completed.\r\nA five minute summary of the main results from the previous lecture would also be useful.",
                "Interesting problem sets.",
                "strength:  The instructor was organized, well prepared, and used class time efficiently.\r\nweakness: sometimes I hardly keep up with course content, due to the difficult and obscure knowledge",
                "strength: assignments are interesting to do; weakness: lectures can be fast-paced and ambiguous sometimes",
                "The strengths: First, professor Aspnes provided inclusive notes. You can find everything you need in the notes. Second, professor Aspnes created a discord channel for this course and always stood by, answering numerous questions about the homework, which is also really helpful. Third, the lecture was well-recorded. You can refer to the video whenever you want. \r\nThe weakness: The course content takes a lot of time to understand. Although each problem set has only two or three problems, it can take days to figure everything out.",
                "Professor is very knowledgeable and kind! He was very helpful and patient on Ed. The recordings and homework were very helpful. One weakness is that Professor's handwritten class notes were not clear from time to time, so I would suggest that Professor uses PPT in class :)",
                "The notes were very valuable and the lectures were also fresh and provided new material to the notes, to some degree. I think that engagement could be improved on when it comes to students and participating in lectures.",
                "Strengths: distributed is (one of) Aspnes' area of expertise. He is a pretty humorous lecturer (an occurring image is adversaries as triangles with devil horns and pointy teeth), and his lecture notes are accessibly written. Weaknesses: it was hard to keep up with everything covered in the lecture, and the topic and pace make it hard to follow if you fall behind"

A lot of times I found myself understanding the more general overview of a particular topic at the start of lectures, but near the middle of the lecture I would start getting quite confused. This is definitely one of those classes where you get how much work you put in, and is quite chill.",

The course pace is pretty fast. Almost every lecture covers one topic. Although you don't need to understand all of them to figure out the problem sets, you still could take days to figure them out.",
