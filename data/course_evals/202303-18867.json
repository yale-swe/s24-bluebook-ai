                "From this course I developed a further insight on the way we approach the concept of \"genius\" in the world and what exactly we deem to be genius. I understood the influences of culture, ethnicity, and race on the way such notions were preconceived into influencing ideas of what is deemed to be canonical or great, often creating a group of people which are oppressed by such hierarchies of great bodies of work and ideas. That being said I learned this broad notion through researching into various artworks were deemed canonical and as a class we ventured into understanding what or who deemed these bodies of work to be \"genius\" and/or \"great.\" From a writing standpoint, I learned to polish the format if the art historical analysis, learning to engage the viewer with my perspective on encountering bodies of works.",
                "We definitely practiced a lot of close looking. For the three 3-5 page papers we wrote, we had to pick a specific work of art (relevant to the piece out of the 12 that we were looking at currently) and really hone in on different factors in a work of art (e.g. composition, facture, materiality, perspective, etc.). Professor Armstrong really stressed specificity, and I think being able to analyze a work of art to such an extent is an important skill to have in the pursuit of art history (and, on a fundamental level, can be useful in other disciplines as well).\r\n\r\nAnother broader concept we talked about was the idea of the \"canon\"in this class, Professor Armstrong explicitly chose 12 WESTERN works that she thought formed a sort of Western art history canon, but we also discussed works that were left out of her list of 12. I loved our final paper: we had to pick 6-12 works, this time from ANYWHERE in the world, and argue that they comprised a canon with some sort of logic/throughline that linked them all. It prompted a lot of questions about the arbitrariness of how the Western canon has been formed."

                "The strengths of this course are its ability to pose various inquiries on the interaction between humanity and art. We were given various artworks and readings which allowed us to further analyze the overpowering rule of society towards the perceptions of art. I think through this process, we developed a deeper understanding of what is and what it can be based on moral values and our own opinions and experiences. However, I feel as though the course felt could be improved in engaging further in these discussions. Often time it felt has though the class was more of a lecture, with discussions shortened due to time. Although I enjoyed the ability for students to introduce varying inquiries, I also feel as though at times it did not allow for a deeply thorough understanding of the bodies of work or the notion of the canon.",
                "Professor Armstrong was super organized. Class met twice a week: on one day, we were in the classroom and Professor Armstrong gave a 45-60 minute presentation on one out of the 12 works of art and the historical context surrounding it, followed by a discussion about the readings, often led by a member of the class. On the other day, we went to the YUAG and looked at corollary works to the piece we were looking at in class at the time. I could also tell that Professor Armstrong was extremely knowledgeable about the material.\r\n\r\nAlso, the actual content of the course was pretty fascinating. Art history is another way of looking at the history of the world, and I found that a lot of the ideas we talked about (for example, about the formation of the \"canon\" in art history) could be applied to other areas as well (especially literature). It was also amazing to go to the YUAG once a week, and truly enhanced by appreciation of and excitement about art.\r\n\r\nI do feel that the class discussions could've been a bit longer/livelier. The readings were rather long and oftentimes pretty challenging, so after a few classes, I think a lot of students stopped doing them/taking them seriouslycoupled with the fact that we didn't spend too much time talking about them in class, it felt like the readings weren't that helpful in enhancing our knowledge. That being said, I did really enjoy some of them; I just wish we spent a bit more time on them in class and maybe received a bit more support in breaking them down."

Being someone who's always been interested in art and art history but haven't taken an art history class since 10th grade, this was an extremely welcoming yet also super intellectually stimulating class to get myself back into the discipline.
