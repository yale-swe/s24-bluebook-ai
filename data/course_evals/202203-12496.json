I also learned the concepts behind asynchronous circuits, including all the timing considerations that designers must deal with to ensure that their chip works properly.\r\n\r\nTopics covered: transistor physics, transistor-level circuit design, designing circuits as functional blocks, communication between circuits when transferring data, designing an asynchronous-synchronous circuit interface\r\n\r\nThings you should have: experience writing hardware description languages, experience writing C, basic understanding of semiconductor device physics",

                "Strengths: Professor Manohar's engaging lectures and care for his students. He was understanding and lenient and structured everything in the course around facilitating student learning, nothing felt arbitrary or impractical. Weaknesses: The tools we had to use in the class were relatively poorly documented and un-googlable, unfortunately there is not much getting around this due to how niche the subject is.",
                "Strengths: This course is really good as a senior elective because it ties together all the knowledge and skills from previous engineering/CS courses; this course is a logical culmination of an undergrad program in EE/EECS. This course also the exact area of research that Professor Manohar's lab works on, so Prof. Manohar is very knowledgeable and very passionate about the subject matter. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think this course throws too much at us all at once. The nature of the course content (designing an asynchronous chip at all levels of abstraction) requires us to have prior expertise in/learn a lot about many topics in rapid succession. In theory, this is a great course for someone who already understands a lot of these topics or is a super genius, but realistically, it's very tough for most undergrads. For our projects, we were required to use a special language developed by Prof. Manohar's lab, which added a layer of difficulty to our projects. Not only did we need to come up with a good conceptual design, we also had to figure out how to implement it in a language that we had never seen before. The software tools we were required to use for our projects also required a lot of set-up time (because we had to install/use Docker), which also added another layer of complexity.  I talked to some other students in the class, and we were all constantly struggling to keep up, even when we helped each other out.",
                "Strengths were that it was clearly presented mostly, however for the handshaking stuff there could have been more of an expansion",
                "Great course overall, no weaknesses.",
                "The only thing that can be improved, in my opinion, are the tools used. They are outdated and have a few bugs."

                "I have mixed feelings about this course. This class is definitely the most interesting class I've ever taken at Yale, as far as the content goes. However, the projects require a lot of work and are extremely tough to execute well. Furthermore, it's easy to become disengaged in lecture if you don't understand everything perfectly; if you don't completely understand the contents of one lecture, you can forget about trying to understand any remaining lectures on the same topic. \r\n\r\nI would recommend this class if you are very interested in learning how chips are designed, from beginning to end, from top to bottom, but only if you have a lot of experience in this area/are a genius/are willing to spend the majority of your time on this one class.",
