                "Overall, while the instructor had a clear passion and interest for educating students, this course had a serious lack of direction and organization. There was little transparency on the course listing about what this class would be about, students did not learn what we signed up for, and it felt each week a new topic was talked about on the spot. Often, lectures were centered around very long Jupyter Notebook files, which were confusing to understand and unorganized. We would skip around these Jupyter Notebook files, only completing a small fraction of the lectures with little understanding of what we were learning, why it was important, or where the class was going. It felt as if these materials were borrowed from a different class and an attempt was made to repurpose them for this class. Homework (particularly in the beginning) did not align at all with what was taught in the class. By front-loading students with the abstract math of tensors and optimization algorithms to read on their own, the class was structured such that did not understand what was being taught or where to apply it. We would then shift gears, only to return to a similar topic 8 weeks later. We received little feedback on our assignments that made it difficult to improve. With time, it was evident that students became very discouraged and would 'shut down' in the class, not participating or answering questions, because nobody knew what was expected of us or the class organization.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the class, we spent time doing linear algebra but spent so long on fundamentals (that were pre-requisites and taught in math classes) that we never applied it much to machine learning algorithms. \r\n\r\nFor a class about computational tools for data science, we worked very little with data, which was disappointing.  \r\n\r\nIt's clear the instructor is highly knowledgeable about the subject and has a desire to help students, but time should be taken to develop a curriculum that can be followed. I believe SDS 230 with Ethan Meyers with would be a great course to use as a reference, where lectures were organized and from the beginning there was a structured understanding of what would be taught.",
                "strength: assignment based\r\nweakness: don't feel that we learned how to do the assignments in class.",
                "This class is definitely gives you a crash course in tools for data scientists. However, it focuses WAY too much on theory. I think it needs to stick to teaching technical things more as that is the purpose of the class. We get enough linear algebra theory elsewhere...",
                "Strengths: Professor Lederman (Roy) is a kind and patient professor and wants his students to understand the material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was largely unstructured, lectures were not very engaging or organized, the order of topics throughout the semester was confusing and did not relate to each other, overall unorganized.",
                "Most people were not very engaged with the material.",
                "Strengths-- interesting content\r\nWeaknesses- poorly organised",
                "This course offers several notable strengths that contribute to a comprehensive learning experience. It provides valuable insights into diverse aspects of data analysis, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of the subject matter. The course is rigorous in nature, challenging students to delve deep into the topics covered. Additionally, it covers a wide range of relevant subjects, providing a broad knowledge base for students. However, there are certain areas where improvements could be made. The instructor's approach assumes a high level of pre-existing knowledge, which may create difficulties for some students. The homework assignments follow an unconventional pattern, which can be confusing for learners. Moreover, the grading system places excessive emphasis on the absence of errors in the code, rather than evaluating the overall completeness and correctness of the assignments. Addressing these weaknesses by providing clearer instructions and incorporating a more comprehensive grading approach would enhance the course's effectiveness and overall learning experience.",
                "strength: gained us comprehensive knowledge on many fields, which is good as an introductory course\r\nweakness: the level of involvement of linear algebra is too high, which makes it also a hard class"

                "No, I would not recommend this class. Students do not learn computational tools for data science, work with data very little, and walk away with little understanding of any skills. The course is very unorganized and there is a lack of clear materials for students to follow and learn from. The homework is very time consuming because it does not align with what is done in class. In addition to homework, lengthy classwork was 'assigned' if it wasn't completed as a class due to mismanagement of time.",
                "100%! Roy is an awesome instructor and the concepts you were help learn computer science and applying statistics to this.",
                "I don't know. I guess you do learn how to use some technical tools for data scientists, but the fact that there is quite a significant focus on theory as well and linear algebra, I don't know if this is the best class to gain technical expertise. I like Roy's philosophy of not giving exams because in reality you will always be able to look things up, but the homework assignments he does give have quite a lot of errors which makes it very confusing. If he polishes up the assignments it would go very far in making this course better.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think that the theoretical stuff that appears on the homework needs to be covered more in lecture. The tutorials on Python can be done on our own time, whereas reviewing linear algebra many of us haven't seen in a while is significantly harder.",
                "No, I wouldn't. This does fulfill some requirements of some majors, but I believe there are better options out there. It's not very difficult or stressful, but attendance is mandatory and lectures are supremely boring. Roy is a great guy and professor and I wanted to be more engaged with the class, but the way it is structured made that very difficult.",
                "Honestly, no. The problem sets don't really reflect what's learned in class (especially the first pset, you essentially had to self-learn the entirety of it with the readings and through other online resources). There's mistakes and typos in the psets that make the questions feel hastily done, and the vague wording of some of the problems make these psets a bit frustrating because I'd often have to go back to change my answers based on a GitHub Issues answer, when it should've just been clear from the start. Most of the lectures were just walkthroughs of Jupyter Notebooks, so it was hard to stay engaged sometimes.",
                "This course was not exactly my favorite. Roy is clearly passionate about the material, and this was the best part of the class. The assignments, though, were  unclear at times and the grading process was not very up front. Much of the material, though useful!, was pretty dry.",
                "Only to complete certain requirements, like for the data science certificate",
                "I would recommend this course with certain caveats. If you are pursuing a Data Science certificate or have a strong interest in the subject, this course could be beneficial. It offers valuable insights into different aspects of data analysis and covers a wide range of topics. However, it is important to note that the course has some weaknesses, such as the expectation of prior knowledge from the start and the grading system that focuses more on code errors rather than overall understanding. If you are prepared to overcome these challenges and are committed to acquiring knowledge in data analysis, then this course can be a valuable addition to your learning journey.",
