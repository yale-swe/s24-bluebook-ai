I found myself actually looking forward to the assignments and I honestly may have spent more time on the non-traditional, creative assignments than I would have spent on the classic essay assignment. The very small section was great-- I felt like I was able to delve deeply into the topic and connect to it better than compared to other classes with huge sections.",
                "I think this course is wonderful for someone who has little to no art history background, so it's approachability is a strength. However, I was wanting a bit more practice on some technical terms (in Japanese). Perhaps a bit of the class could be focused on memorizing these terms so that when Prof. Yiengpruksawan lectures, it is a bit more clear what she is referring to.",
                "great teacher",
                "Mimi and the TFs were so nice and accommodating, taking into account the potential challenges of online learning and adjusting course requirements as they saw fit. I personally found the subject matter (Japanese screen painting) very interesting. It was also nice to have open-ended assignments, so that I could think and write about the things I was interested in from lectures and readings. Kind of like a \"choose your own adventure\" type of course!",
                "I love this course. It gave students so much freedom and had such a relaxed learning environment.",
                "This course was exceptional. It was very relaxed, with sections optional but very helpful, and the content clearly explained.",
                "it was slightly repetitive but very interesting content",
                "This course was very low stress, and Professor Mimi always tried to accommodate for the current circumstances. This was the single biggest strength of the course. As far as weaknesses go, honestly, not much to say.",

There were optional sections to attend, I appreciated the flexibility that we had to meet in break out rooms after the lecture portion of the course, and Mimi was always available to meet. The subject itself was interesting, and the course truly allowed me to freely explore a subject that I had never had the opportunity to explore before.",

It was a shame that we couldn't see the works in the YUAG in person, but the quality of the images and the explanation of their content was very effective given the circumstances.",

The works we look at are beautiful, and an understanding of Japanese art has really complemented my visual analysis skills. For art history\/ east asian studies students and students outside the major, this is a cracking class that you are sure to get a lot out of. There's no expectation of any existing knowledge of Japanese art or the language, and you are guided through the works by an exceptional professor and group of TAs.",

Japanese art is so beautiful and Japanese screens are an integral part of Japanese culture. Anyone interested in learning about East Asia, Japan or the visual arts should take this course.",
