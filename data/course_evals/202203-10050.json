                "I learned about abortion, birth control, reproductive rights and contraceptives all from a historical, scientific and political lens.",
                "Learned a lot about reproductive health over the centuries. Was especially interesting given Dobbs/ more recent events.",
                "I developed a much greater knowledge of the history of reproductive health that I didn't even know existed. I feel much better informed about what is going on in the world surrounding it.",
                "I felt that I was taught a pretty surface-level overview of reproductive health in the United States. I appreciated the depth we went into for a couple of topics, including the birth control congressional hearings and the rise and fall of the IUD, as they helped to evince the nonlinear trends of history.",
                "great class",
                "I enhanced my abilities to critically evaluate historical papers, sources, authors, and institutions. I gained insight into the nuanced history of reproductive health in a interdisciplinary manner.",
                "I learned so much about the history of reproductive health. I think this information is important due to the overturning of Roe v Wade. I feel better educated to discuss topics such as that and be knowledgeable about them.",
                "The readings were informative and interesting. I felt like I learned a lot of history.",
                "I have a much more holistic view of reproductive history in the US. I wanted to understand reproductive history in the US more after the Dobbs decision, and I feel like I can contextualize our post-Roe world better in our history.",
                "I learned about a wide range of topics related to reproductive health in the United States",
                "I learned so much valuable info about the histories of reproductive health and also about contemporary issues. I learned about how long abortions have been around and how people are so mislead by politicians and stuff",
                "though i stopped going to class because of how poor the teaching style was and the white feminism that was being taught, it was interesting to read and self-learn about the history of reproductive health in the US beyond a white women perspective.",
                "I learned about reproductive health, the disparities within it, and different reproductive issues, but honestly most of what I learned was either from readings or section - not lecture.",
                "I learned about all aspects of reproductive history!",
                "Learned broad picture history of advancements in reproductive health technology, field of gynecology and obstetrics, etc and how different people are affected by these technologies, laws, etc. based on their identity.",
                "I learned how to craft a historical argument and analyze primary sources. I learned about multiple issues in the field of reproductive justice and about the history of reproductive care, gynecology and obstetrics, the medicalization of pregnancy, and abortion rights.",
                "I learned so much more about the history of reproductive health than I thought I originally knew. We go from the beginnings of reproductive health and service, with midwives in colonial America to recent topics such as Roe v. Wade (which was also very relevant). It covered a very wide area and different aspects of reproductive health, and I'm glad that I was able to see all the ways historical themes and implications affect today's issues and systems.",
                "so much knowledge about the history of reproduction, abortion, birth control, gynecology, etc.",
                "I learned so much about the history of reproductive health that I think I would continue to talk about long after I finished the course. I also learned how to write an argumentative history paper.",
                "This class begins all the way in colonial times until present events, which is a lot of content to cover! It's very interesting to see how reproductive health has evolved, how much has changed and how much is truly similar",
                "Throughout the course, I was able to learn a lot about the history and discrimination of women and women of color in the realms of reprodctive health by both society and the professionalization of the medical field.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of reproductive health in the U.S. and how many concepts we take for granted today (birth control, contraceptives in general, etc) came about and were accepted culturally.",
                "Extensive history of reproductive health and what brought us to where we are today. A lot of knowledge everyone should learn about.",
                "Learned a lot about women's reproductive health, how women's reproductive rights have developed throughout history, and how women of color are still disproportionately affected today.",
                "The readings were the highlight of the course - super interesting material",
                "histories of reproduction, contraception, family planning in Colonial America, midwifery, the rise of the gynecology field, the eugenics movement, the Comstock Laws, the birth of the Pill, the abortion rights movement, reproductive justice",
                "I learned about the history of reproductive medical interventions, like how different contraceptives were developed",
                "I have learnt a lot about the history of reproductive medicine and about a wide range of topics from abortion, eugenics, to technologies of reproductive control. I also learnt about historical analysis and proper primary source analysis.",
                "I learned about the important events and figures in addition to the movements, ideas, and individual experiences in this history (but as Prof. O'Donnell points out - histories!). This class also helped me construct a historical argument and do historical research.",
                "you learn a lot about reproductive health",
                "reproductive health and medicine in the United States and how it has evolved throughout history; also learned how to read and analyze primary and secondary sources and how to write an academic paper",
                "increase in knowledge about the history of reproductive health, information well beyond abortion \r\nrefined my skills in writing historical papers",
                "Details about the reproductive history of the united states. Exactly what you'd expect",
                "crafting historical arguments, analyzing primary sources",
                "I definitely learned more about the obscure histories that exist in America's overarching history, especially about the histories that pertain to women and their reproductive bodies, freedom, and choices. I was very shocked at some of the things we learned, especially because in common conversation, these topics do not come up often.",
                "I learned about how our attitudes towards reproductive rights have shifted over time and how the rise of certain science and technologies (e.g. ultrasound, understanding the menstrual cycle, gynecology) negatively impacted reproductive justice and reproductive rights. We discussed quickening, the origin of fetal personhood, medical experimentation on enslaved black women, and the advent of different birth control & contraceptive technology. Lots of interesting topics!",
                "I learned about the early forms of reproductive care in the United States, the transition to a professionalized patriarchal system of modern medicine, and how the 20th century brought many changes in the form of the pill, roe v. wade and technological advances in ultrasound. There was also an interesting unit about the purity politics of Anthony Comstock.",
                "I learned quite a bit, a lot more than I thought I would have! I expected this to just be about birth, but it was actually such an enriching course about racism, sexism, power, and everything. I could really mold the course into what I wanted it to be.",
                "This course focused on some of the main moments and technological developments in reproductive health.",
                "how to look at history critically and see how small details tell the trie stories of our past rather than just big events",
                "Knowledge about the troubling history of reproductive health.",
                "A much deeper and broader understanding of reproductive rights in the United States.",
                "I learned about a reproductive condition through a historical perspective, something a traditional history class does not teach.",
                "I developed the skills necessary to analyze the relationship between history of reproductive health and the modern state of reproductive health care in America.",
                "I learned about the history of reproductive health (as the title implies) but also how many of today's policies and social beliefs are reflective of these histories."

                "Strengths: the course is not time consuming, and the topics covered are interesting in and of themselves\r\nWeaknesses: there is very little content in the course--our lectures for the first half of the semester ended after about twenty minutes, and we watched movies three times over the course of the semester; there is little buildup for the longer assignments; we weren't assigned academic articles, generally short pieces that were not peer reviewed; we had to do a primary source analysis for the midterm wherein the primary source consisted of a single line of text",
                "very laidback but still worthwhile",
                "Strengths: We were able to go over a large section of reproductive history in America so I do feel I have a better understanding of how it developed and changed over time. \r\nWeaknesses: The breadth of content made it hard to feel like we were really diving deep into any subject discussed in classes. Readings and section helped to supplement my understanding, but I wish more class interaction could have been had.",
                "a little too broad, didn't touch on some important subjects/topics",
                "The strengths of the course are Professor O'Donnell's passion for what she's teaching, and it makes the course so engaging.",
                "The readings are great. Lecture was itself not very helpful in my opinion in solidifying the themes and facts from the readings.",
                "I really liked the readings and lecture material. I wish the discussion sections were a little bit more based on the lecture and readings, rather than individual student thoughts,",

                "Loved the prof and everything",
                "The course leaves out a lot of important history and tends to center white women.",
                "weaknesses: professor is racist in the way she teaches her course material; even though she assigned readings of people of color, she barely mentioned them in class with any historical context (for example, she talked about indigenous communities and the white supremacist state but did not mention settler colonialism??). her analysis of people of color was one or two lines of summary, and then it went back to centering an incredibly white women perspective. i'd have no issue with this if she had said that she was teaching a class on the history of white women's reproductive health, but her first lecture she specifically stated that she was teaching the historiES of reproductive health and, even more, through a reproductive justice lens. but to explain reproductive justice she played a gory video (no trigger warnings either, so the whole class was stunned) from game of thrones of a white, rich, fictional queen?? instead of very real life examples. i think after that i stopped going to class because everything was absurd, but underlying everything was prof o donnell's refusal and like, laziness (she frequently would just not teach because the projector wasn't working) to teach anything but white women and abortion. the whole class is the centering of white straight women over all the other groups that have a very real stake in reproductive justice and reproductive health, which was just very tiring to me. labelling the class as historiES of reproductive health was disingenous and a lie.",
                "Strengths: The readings were great. I learned the most from the readings and they were interesting and relevant. Section was also good; we talked about the readings and overall trends in reproductive health as well as takeaways from the lecture/readings of the week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This lecture was not taught in depth at all. I was shocked by how generalized the material was, despite the readings being very interesting and specific. Typically, readings serve as an addition and nice complement to lectures, however, the lecture was so generalized and not in depth that I barely gained anything from it. Basically, if you did the readings you would not learn anything else from lecture, which is usually the opposite for most classes. Also, the way the information was presented in lecture was not great - it seemed like Professor O'Donnell wasn't very passionate or cared about the information presented.",
                "The weaknesses this course has is that it is very white-centric. It primarily focuses on the reproductive history of white women, and always treats the histories of women of color as \"add-ons\" to the white history. I think it should focus more on the histories of women of color and give them more representation in the class' material.",
                "No weaknesses! LOVED this course!",
                "Interesting material, prof and TAs very nice, helpful, and understanding. I wish there had been more time devoted to the end of class, though  I was hoping to learn more about changes to reproductive health access in recent years.",

                "Strengths: a broad variety of topics, about 75% of the readings were really interesting and helpful, section provided a much needed opportunity to discuss topics, grade dispersed evenly with multiple opportunities to do well \r\nWeaknesses: because the time range is so broad, you lose the depth of going into some really impactful topics that I felt needed more time spent on. But I think this would require the class to be broken up due to the sheer amount of content. Towards the end the readings got a bit less credible, less peer reviewed, and I really wish we had gone more in depth of the Dobbs v. Jackson decision!",
                "This course was great at combining out of class reading with in class lecture content, though at times the two were not as convergent as they could have been.",
                "Good structure. Exams allowed students to actually engage with the material and think about it. However, this course was not graded fairly as some TFs helped their students with assignments more than others. Frustrating to be put at a disadvantage.",
                "Strengths: fascinating readings, strong group of TAs with critical perspectives on the history laid out in the syllabus. Weaknesses: I didn't learn anything new from the lectures, which mainly rehashed the details of the readings and leaned on teaching tools that I found ineffective, such as New York Times quizzes and graphic clips from television shows that were presented with no warning to the class.",
                "I though the lectures could have focused on less topics and gone more in depth on specific ones that chose to be included.",

                "The classes and readings did not relate too much.",

We had some pretty interesting readings that were not mentioned much in class. Also, it would have been better to have had rubrics for every writing assignment we had to do just so that we didn't get points taken away for things that we weren't explicitly directed to do.",
                "I wish that this course explained medical terminology more and that we went more in depth into the medical aspects of reproductive health. I also which that there was a clarification that this course mainly focuses on female reproductive health and medicine.",
                "strengths: the lectures were very informative and the section provides a forum for discussion. I think for many students, this information is completely new and changed their perspectives. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: at times the lectures felt very generic. In my opinion, lectures repeated information from the readings without adding much more.",
                "Strengths - Great introduction/survey course about history of medicine, specifically reproductive medicine. The TFs were great, and lectures were pretty engaging. Section was always great and the readings tended to be pretty interesting on the whole. Weakness - This is simply due to the nature of this being a survey course, but sometimes topics didn't get delved into as deep as I would have liked. Also, there was just so much content that inevitably things get left out.",
                "A lot of the assigned readings were articles in popular media outlets instead of academic research. I would have preferred fewer newspaper articles and more academic research.",
                "This course provoked interesting discussions and some of the readings were extremely interesting. Also, discussions of the flaws and missing voices/parts were identified throughout the course. This course could be improved by having more of the readings from books and intellectual pieces instead of nursingclio and newspaper articles. Also, the lectures could build on the readings better instead of summarizing.",
                "Strengths - very interesting and topical material, lectures and readings were very interesting\r\nWeaknesses - a lot of the material was very white/privileged focused, could be improved by adding more attention to the intersectional issues throughout history with more context",
                "strengths: engaging, covered a lot of information, engaging slides \r\nweaknesses: fact-learning oriented class, left-leaning ideology that made it difficult to disagree with (especially in the way that the information was presented when it was something the professor didn't agree with and labeled it as \"hateful, stupid, or anti-human rights\") If inclusivity is the goal with Yale courses, then there should be room for exploring and learning from viewpoints we don't agree with",
                "Strengths: I really loved the readings, and I looked forward to section each week to talk in depth about topics that were missed in the lectures. The content of this course is extremely relevant for anyone, and I took a lot away from the content itself/readings. Weaknesses: Lectures were not incredibly engaging and not necessary to the success of the course. If you did the readings and went to section, you would be fine. I wish Prof O'Donnell was able to add more nuance to her lectures rather than just giving a broad overview of the history and leaving the fine print to discussion section. I also wanted to have more conversation about gender (what it means to be a reproductive body who does not identify as a woman) and non-traditional methods of reproduction (IVF, surrogacy, etc.).",
                "The lectures are interesting. However, the slides are not comprehensible without the lecture. It's really impossible to review anything after lecture because the slides are all just pictures. In addition, the readings are only discussed in section and never talked about once during class. I feel like the class could be really enhanced if the readings were discussed during class as well.\r\n\r\nOverall, I did not like this class as much as I wanted to. The content was interesting, but focused on a lot of topics I didn't expect. There was no synthesis of the information during lecture, and the actual meaning of a lot of the information taught was only discussed in section. It would have been great to see some analysis of themes during lecture and from our professor as well, instead of just from my TA.",
                "strengths - great TAs, lectures are always available to view, manageable workload\r\nnegatives - none really!",
                "The major strength of this course was the readings which covered each week's topic very thoroughly and from a variety of angles using an appreciated mix of documentaries, journal articles, and op-eds. \r\nThat being said, actual lectures were a bit surface-level and felt somewhat repetitive each week.",
                "One strength was that the topic matter was very interesting. However, one weakness is that the class is not very engaging and I wish there were more opportunities to engage with the material during the lectures.",
                "Strengths: welcoming environment, good introduction even for those with little experience in the study of reproductive health\r\nWeaknesses: work piled up towards the end of the semester, and there was not much structured feedback throughout the course",
                "Strengths - good TAs, interesting readings & lectures, use of different media for teaching, cool guest lectures as well, the repro reports",
                "I think this class has a lot of potential. However, I think the lectures are really surface-level and often don't dive into topics, events, or trends as much as present them superficially without critically engaging with them. It's also a bit whitewashed, even though there is a lot of discussion about slavery it sorta forgets that black and queer bodies exist in the 20th century. A lot of the material is interesting and not something you can learn in other big lectures, but I wish there was more.",
                "I loved the take home exams. The professor recognized that history majors are bad at exams! It felt like a timed essay, which was perfect for me. Thank you so much.",
                "This course had relatively little course content. Most of the content could be obtained by just reading off the class slides. In addition, most arguments were presented without referencing any content or historical framework. It could be improved by increasing the discussion of the historical context behind reproductive health so that students can understand how the history informs current thinking.",
                "At times, the lectures were cut a bit short despite class length already being quite brief.",
                "Weaknesses: Professor O'Donnell didn't provide examples or rubrics for the midterm or repro report even upon request, so it was almost impossible to figure out what to write or how to format it (the final was explained very well though). Because of this, students completed their papers differently and grades were based on what some students did instead of the meager instructions that were given.\r\n\r\nStrengths: My TA, Kenya Loudd, was incredible. She was empathetic, engaging, understanding, and enthusiastic and made the class for me. Lectures were perfectly paced, insanely interesting, and the exact right length of time to engage but not go on too long. The content was fascinating and useful and I always left class feeling enlightened and inspired. The best part for me was being able to write my repro report on anything I wanted, because I could take the foundations of the class and apply them to niche topics that fascinated me.",
                "Strengths were the lectures that really got into the history of the topics. Weaknesses were the days where lecture was kind of vague and short. I really wanted to learn as much as possible about the subjects and I feel like we barely scratched the surface on most of them. I know its a survey course, but I think we could have learned more.",
                "Strengths: very engaging lecture, manageable workload, interesting readings, and a lot of freedom to pursue your own interests. Weaknesses: The different TAs have very different grading systems and teaching styles which can dramatically impact your grade and the ease of the class.",
                "Strengths: Low commitment/low stakes class which made it 10x more enjoyable and the content was really intriguing\r\nWeakness: A little too hands on, would've liked a bit more engagement",
                "While this class covered a wide variety of topics within the history of reproductive health, Professor O'Donnell managed to approach each topic with appropriate depth and nuance. The readings complimented Professor O'Donnell's lectures well, adding new information, fresh perspectives, and multiple entry points to the conversation on reproductive health care in the past and present. The Repro Report assignment helped me improve the way I write historical arguments and helped me understand the relationship between reproductive health care history and current events in more depth. Though the content of the course was often heavy, Professor O'Donnell offered a sense of humor and clear passion that made it fun to come to class.",
                "The course is excellent in serving as a broad overview course, especially for those who are new to humanities or HSHM-related studies. This being said, some of my peers noted that the course lacked serious depth and often did not properly address the experiences of those who are and have been underrepresented. This is, however, Professor O'Donnell's first semester teaching this course and so student feedback will perhaps shift this."

                "Yes, it was very enlightening.",

                "Yes! Super interesting and a good humanities credit with low work load.",
                "I would recommend this class to any girl because they should know the history of their rights and what it has looked like in our country.",
                "No. This course could be accurately described as a podcast rather than a Yale course. For the first half of the semester, the amount of content was meager: we ended class after only twenty-five minutes multiple times. We also read primarily short, non-peer-reviewed articles that did little to contribute to my learning. What was presented as the central question of the course--the path from Roe to Dobbs--went unanswered.",
                "yes great class",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because I believe everyone should learn about this topic.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material felt interesting and relevant. Professor O'Donnell's lectures and the readings were always very engaging. I also felt like, although I learned a lot from the course, I also didn't find it too stressful.",
                "super interesting, manageable workload",
                "I loved this course and would highly recommend it.",
                "Yes! Although the course was not particularly intellectually challenging, it was an amazing opportunity to learn about such an important and relevant history. I highly recommend it.",
                "Yes, it's an interesting course that isn't very demanding. A good choice of course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course! If you are at all interested in reproductive health, this will allow you to have a much wider perspective.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Some students may have a better time than others because it covers a lot of topics generally. Some students may already be familiar with a lot of the topics, but I feel like everyone will learn something new from this class.",
                "Yes!! Super interesting and valuable information.",
                "No. The way this course was taught was pretty upsetting, particularly for people of color taking the class.",
                "no, especially if you are poc -- stay away and take carolyn roberts' courses!! unless you are dying to take a class on white women and abortion, you will just get frustrated by the lack of effort put into other people's histories of reproductive health. there's nothing wrong with focusing on white women's reproductive health, but i have a big issue with a white female professor who centers white women over all other groups if her class is an intersectional overview of reproductive health in general.",
                "Absolutely! I believe that the subject matter taught by Professor O'Donnell is something that everyone should learn or at least be exposed to. Professor O'Donnell was also very engaging.",
                "NO! I would not recommend this course. This is quite unfortunate because the information surrounding reproductive health and medicine is SO interesting. The course was just taught so poorly! While the readings were interesting, the lecture was not at all. The lecture focused primarily on white women's reproductive health, which is important to learn about, however, the lecture was advertised as histories of reproductive health and promoted as one that would center around many different narratives - so it was misleading. Also, the lecture was not engaging and did not go in depth at all. I would always leave class thinking I did not learn anything, which is sad to say, and was confused by how I learned more from the readings than in lecture.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student because it focuses on white reproductive history rather than more women of color's reproductive history.",
                "Yes!! Professor ODonnell is amazing!",
                "Yes, interesting content, totally manageable workload, and very nice teaching team. Dont expect it to be the most rigorous class, but you will learn!",
                "Yes! Very interesting and the workload is super manageable.",
                "Yes! This is such a relevant topic especially when we are in Post-Roe. I think that this course teaches you a lot about the history behind reproductive health and injustices, and it really makes you think about repeating patterns and themes in that history.",
                "Yes definitely. Super interesting. Definitely my favorite class at Yale so far",
                "yes, absolutely! this course is foundational to our historical knowledge, and it is really interesting. especially with Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), everyone should take this course",
                "Yes! No matter what background you come from, I think it is important for everyone to hear the lessons shared in this course. Also overall this course was fun to be in and we had some great conversations during discussion section!",
                "If you're okay with not going super in depth to the history of reproductive health and are okay with a more broader overview of history then yes! Personally, I thought I was pretty well versed in reproductive health history and I still learned so much, I hope to take more HSHM classes that are perhaps more specific in order to allow further depth in material. Also, EVERYONE should be encouraged to take this class, not just a certain demographic of students, reproductive health especially post Dobbs affects everyone!",
                "If you are interested in women's rights and the history of reproductive health, I would definitely recommend the class. We are provided with readings every week that help you learn more about the real-life experiences of women in history and how they dealt before the creation of modern reproductive medicine.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking to learn more about the history of reproductive health in the U.S., especially in terms of understanding how that history has affected marginalized communities.",
                "Not particularly. For people who already know a lot about reproductive health history, this course doesn't seem to offer much more. For people who don't know much, the course is not the most engaging.",
                "Yes, everyone should take this course! It is a great way to expand your knowledge about reproductive health. The readings are also interesting.",
                "Yes definitely material everyone should learn about.",
                "If you're looking to understand this moment in history, try to find a lecture rather than taking this class. This class proved that it's impossible to capture the breadth of experiences with reproductive rights in America in a lecture of this size, and I found the discussion of Dobbs to be extremely lacking.",
                "Yes! If you want to learn about reproductive health in a more a casual setting, this is the place to do it.",
                "Yes",
                "If you want to have an introduction to reproductive health - this is the class to take.",
                "Yes, the course is interesting and the workload wasn't super bad.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this to another course to another student, especially if they are unfamiliar with the subject. If one already knows a decent amount about reproductive justice, the course will not be super interesting, but they will gain the opportunity to write about it, speak with grad student TFs and receive feedback.",
                "Yes! It is a great introductory course to the history of medicine and incredibly pertinent to the time. It also provides a great opportunity to work on historical analysis and primary source analysis.",
                "Not if they have taken even one class on the history of reproductive health in America, since I found this course repeats what I had already learned in other classes.",
                "I would recommend this course. With the Dobbs decision, this class is especially helpful to give you context for the present. This course will help you better understand the current issues our country faces in reproductive health and how the history plays into this.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot from this course that I genuinely knew nothing of previously.",
                "Yes! Everyone should take a course like this, especially if you want to go into medicine. It really opens your eyes to the ways in which reproductive history has evolved and how such changes still affect us today (especially after the overturning of Roe)",
                "kind of, pretty average information taught, but still good if you don't know much about the history of abortion, the pill, contraception, and the medicalization of gynecology",
                "I think there are some who will like this class, but I would not recommend it to everyone. I got a lot out of the readings that we were assigned, but maybe it's just because I don't often take classes that are actually applicable to my personal life. If it sounds interesting to you, definitely shop the class, but look further down the line to see if the style of lecture (which I found quite surface-level) is something that you will find fruitful.",
                "Only if you are really interested in reproductive health. I took this class because I was interested in the HSHM major and wanted to take any course I could get my hands on. I happened to get a spot in this lecture despite not having much interest in reproductive health specifically, and my main take away from the class is that I really don't actually care that much about reproductive health. It's definitely a gut, if that's what you're looking for, but I would have preferred more assignments if it meant better analysis of the information. Overall, there are probably better HSHM lectures out there, and if you don't have a special calling to this one, it's not worth it.",
                "I would 100% recommend this to any student. Reproductive health in America is a very interesting and prevalent topic, and everyone should be educated on it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this source to students who are very interested in reproductive medicine and just the history of medicine in general.",
                "I would recommend. This classes discusses important issues that are directly relevant to current events. The workload is not much at all, although it does get heavy towards the end of the semester. Experiences in the course overall seemed to vary strongly based on which TA taught your section.",
                "Yes - it's interesting history and not too much work. the assignments are guided by your personal interests, which was nice too",
                "I want to recommend this class to everyone but I think I would mostly recommend it as a class to someone who is interested in reproductive health and has not taken many or any history classes at Yale. As a senior history major, I was frustrated by the level of detail, critical analysis, and rigor of the class.",
                "I would! It's incredibly important for even STEM majors. We learned about the dynamics of power within medicine, and within society. Would totally recommend.",
                "This is one of my least favorite courses that I have taken at Yale. The readings were good but not really discussed in lecture. Almost every lecture ended early and I felt that there was a lot of historical information and arguments missing from each lecture.",
                "Absolutely. It is fascinating and exciting, and I loved every lecture. However, I recommend that students ask others who have already taken the class for repro report/midterm examples because we received virtually no instruction on what either assignment should look like.",
                "I would recommend it as an interesting gut. The workload was great - especially appreciated the take home exams. And the subject matter overall is very interesting and extremely important. Just dont expect this to be an in depth history course.",
                "Yes! It's really great and interesting and important",
                "Yes! The lesser workload really allows you to enjoy the course content. I would highly recommend to anyone interested in learning about reproductive history.",
                "I highly recommend this course. Professor O'Donnell is a great lecturer, and this history is important for understanding the current state of reproductive health care in America. This class is also a great entry point into learning about the history of American health care in general.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if you are new to humanities courses or if you are new to HSHM-related studies. The course serves as a broad overview where very little pre-existing knowledge is expected coming to the course, making it very accessible."
