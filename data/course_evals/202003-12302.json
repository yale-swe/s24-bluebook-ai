In general, the course covers a lot of material and complex government systems, so it can sometimes feel like each lecture is completely different from the last; however, it seems necessary for it to be that way due to the amount of content to cover.",

I learned how to U.S. system works in particular and how it differs so greatly from many other countries.  We also spent lots of time analyzing how science policy continues to be influential in politics.",
                "I learned about the interplay of the government, public, scientists, and industry in developing science policy. It turns out that the process for setting the rules and funding for science is way more decentralized and complex than I had thought. I learned how to effectively craft policy memos, figuring out along the way what motivates different politicians in making decisions.",
                "I got a good introduction to how the government interacts with science and how policy is created for science, and how science is used to create policy for problems unrelated to science.

The writing component was also a completely new type of writing for me and taught me about the formalities of policy writing, the angles we must write to when dealing with political figures, and how to be more concise.",

            "comments": [
                "strengths: Prof. Demers and Fleming are incredible, along with the TFs Emily and Talia!! Received good feedback on memos. Also you receive a lot of flexibility with the memos and final assignment. Weaknesses: honestly none. If asked maybe a month into the semester, I would've asked for more guidelines for writing memos",
                "The biggest strength was the guest lecturers. It was incredible to hear from so many different experts in different fields relating to the topic of science and public policy. \r\nI gained a lot of practical skills, including greater insight into writing concise policy memos and a greater knowledge of how the U.S. government actually works.\r\nI also loved the Science in the News portion at the beginning of each lecture wherein students presented current events in science and public policy.\r\nOne weakness was that the book that was used for readings and lectures was pretty outdated. The examples used didn't always feel relevant.",
                "I think the class was a bit misleadingly named. To me, science and public policy refers to how science informs discussions in public policy, such as using ecological research to determine policies around trophy hunting. This class focused much more on the public policy around science, such as how public funds are obtained for research. A shift in focus would have made the class more interesting.",
                "I think the guest speakers are a real strength of the course. Collectively, they give a really comprehensive overview of different interactions between science and policy and effectively give real-world examples of the content from lectures and the textbooks.\r\n\r\nI think the manner in which the policy memos are approached is a bit of a weakness. Prior to this course, I had never written policy memos before and I felt a bit like we were thrown into the deep end on the first memo. We were given a lot more guidance after the first because the grades were so poor and across the board, students did much better on the final two. To account for this, the professors did adjust the grading so that the first memo counted for less than the final two. In future years, I think it would be helpful to dedicate a class to detailing policy memo best practices.",
                "I definitely liked how the assessments in the course were based pretty abstractly on the material we learned in lecture.  The assessments were three memos and a research paper, which were less about determining how much material you learned in lecture and more about making you do the research necessary to get an understanding of how science policy is actually made using practical examples.  \r\n\r\nI also definitely enjoyed the guest lecturers.  They were all both interesting and very relevant for the course material.",
                "This course covered a broad topic, a survey of all of the players and issues in science policy. Strengths: By discussing science in the news at the beginning of each class, this course was well-structured for student engagement. Furthermore, the guest speakers invited were very experienced and inspiring people. Their perspectives on modern issues was something unique this class gave me. Weaknesses: I wish the assignments, writing policy memos, were more geared toward learning the course material. One could get a good grade in this class without ever reading the textbook or paying attention in lecture so long as they wrote an effective policy memo. Luckily, the lectures are engaging enough to draw people in.",
                "The readings were interesting, but they were long and dense and would take me many hours per week to do. It was really hard to engage with the reading and stay focused on it. The lectures basically covered every reading, so it didn't seem too necessary to do the readings thoroughly. It would have been nice if there were more case examples or something extra in the lectures so they wouldn't just be the readings in lecture form. These were still very interesting topics and lectures, but some diversity in class activities would have been appreciated and increased engagement in my opinion. The only assignments for the semester were three memos, and one long research paper on a topic of our choice. However, I felt we were never taught how to write a memo, so this was incredibly difficult for me. I think lots of students in my discussion section were confused on what exactly was expected from our memos, especially because we were never even given rubrics before they were due, or a filled in rubric after. We were given some notes by our TAs on things we should do, but these were never ranked by importance level or anything. I also would have liked to go through some example memo strategies in class or in discussion section, where we could have read a memo together and made an outline of a successful memo or something. I really struggled with having no clear expectations for the memos or an example template or something to follow. Other students I spoke to had the same concerns and questions as I did.",
                "The Professors were very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the topics covered in class which was a strength. The guest speakers were also a huge strength in the course.",
                "Strengths: fascinating material, great professors and guest lecturers, wonderful TAs. The policy memos were really interesting pieces of writing and required tons of real research. The textbook is very America-centric and the class did a good job of challenging this fact. The class promotes social awareness among STEM majors as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more graded motivation to actually do the book readings, since it really is a fascinating textbook, but the discussion in section had to touch on so many topics that it became relatively superficial and so I didn't feel like I needed to read the book at all. I also think the bills for the policy memos could have been slightly better chosen (Memo 2 in particular had a choice where the memos were almost 100% political, with very little need for knowledge of science policy).",
                "Strengths: course content, clear instruction of expectations and assignments, engagement of professors with students \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes felt like too quick of an overview without time to process\/digest",
                "I enjoyed the idea of the many speakers from various areas in science policy throughout the semester. It was especially helpful for the many STEM majors in the course considering science policy careers later on. Some speakers were better than others, but that's a given. I loved the science in the news segment every class and gained a lot from that. I got to hear about some interesting issues and it also got me much more engaged in reading the news weekly and keeping up on current events. In many ways, I think that form of weekly reading was more beneficial than the textbook. I also love that this course in itself exists, but think it was a little too physics-centric. I think it would be more beneficial to have maybe one science prof. and one poli sci\/policy prof., or at least a mix of TFs. It was more of a challenge in terms of the TFs since one did not have any experience writing policy memos or working in policy, but they were the people grading our memos and who we had to ask policy questions of in section.",
                "Very well organized. The textbook was a bit out of date but the course more than made up for that with amazing lectures and guest speakers. A really wonderful class!",
                "Weaknesses were that it could be a bit boring but loved the professors and the writing assignments!",
                "The biggest strength of this course was the guest speakers. Guest speakers shared practical and really cool insights into the world of policy, science, and their intersections. The greatest weakness was the lectures without guest speakers. Often lectures were repetitive of the textbook readings and didn't teach us any new material. Another strength were the TAs and feedback. The feedback really help me improve my memo writing."

                "The lectures and guest speakers were all on zoom, but none were recorded. I would have loved for both of these to be recorded so I could've gone back when working on memos or watched them when I couldn't make it to class a few times. I would've liked some diversity in class activities instead of a lecture every day, especially because attendance was required. My favorite part of class every day was probably the science in the news part, because I got to hear from students (and lots of great insight and comments from professors and TAs) about topics I might not have heard much about before, and that weren't in the reading we had to do before class. That part was fun to mix up class activities a bit, but it was very short. I would have appreciated being able to miss a few more classes and watch them after.",
                "The use of breakout rooms in section based on student questions\/work was incredibly thoughtfully done; beginning each live lecture with student opinions\/insights and spending a few minutes to introduce everyone for every guest lecture made online learning some more engaging and personable.",
                "I think lectures not being recorded was not the best during the pandemic. I understand wanting to encourage attendance to live lectures, but this was certainly a semester where things come up and, even though we were allowed to miss a few and still get the bonus points, they then weren't available to watch after and we miss out on good talks or questions that were asked that can't be included in the lecture slides. Maybe a recording could be made and then only sent out to students who had to miss class, but ask for the recording directly?",

                "I would recommend this to any student interested in working in STEM or public policy in the future. It exposed me to a lot of politics that I will have to navigate should I become a scientist. Since Professor Fleming and Professor Demers are particle physicists (the field I am interested in), their perspective on public policy and funding from the perspectives of particle physicists was invaluable for me. Also, the guest speakers were all awesome.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who already knows a lot about politics and public policy. It was very difficult for me to jump in to make comments in class or to participate a lot in discussions because I didn't know much at all about public policy coming into this class. This was the first real introduction I had to the topic and it felt like I was behind everyone else the whole time. I would recommend this class if you know how to write memos (because they didn't really teach us how) or if you did debate or something in high school and are confident with your ability to analyze and fight bills and such and if you're interested in science. If you're just interested in science and need a writing credit or a social science credit, I would advise against taking this class unless you have a good foundation in politics and policy. This was my case and I struggled.",
