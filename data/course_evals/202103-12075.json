One of the most enjoyable classes I've taken at Yale, and low stakes if you want to take an art class but are worried you're not artistic. It was such a fun class and we went on several trips out of the classroom around Yale, and just was genuinely such a nice break from normal lectures and seminars.",
                "I learned so much in this class! I hadn't taken an art class since my first year of high school, so I was scared that I would be totally out of my league, but we all learned together. I learned so much about our perceptions of color, the ways color can be used in art, and how color is present in all aspects of our life. I became much more confident in my collaging skills and pushed myself to learn some painting as well.",
                "Amazing class. Learned more than I ever thought there was to know about color theory.",

                "Anoka and Alex were a great professor / TA team, and they gave us a lot of really exciting opportunities to learn about and observe color through campus resources in the Haas Arts library, the Peabody Museum, and the YUAG. I really appreciated the structure of starting with Albers exercises and then spending a large chunk of the second half of the semester working on personalized final projects. This allowed each student to take the time needed to find something they were really excited about that had a personal voice, and to actually execute it. People's extra commitment to their finals was definitely evident in the class's final crit, which was made better due to everyone having art they were excited to share. The one weakness I would point out is that all of our class critiques were exclusively positive, and never really giving constructive criticism. This precedent was set by Anoka, and I wish she provided us with more comments about what wasn't working in our art so that we could make more dramatic improvements in our following projects.",
                "This class was wonderful! It was super well organized and low workload, but I never felt cheated or like it was an empty credit. I was always excited to do the work and knew how it connected to our semester plan. Both the professor and TF were super kind and attentive and always had feedback to share and famous artists to recommend. \r\n\r\nIt could be cool to have a little more freedom even in the beginning of the course. Maybe with each exercise get to do a small piece inspired by it?",
                "Strength is definitely the course set up. It starts with informative exercises and assignments and culminates in a very fun and constructive final critique",
                "Class is very laid back and you get what you want out of it. There are essentially no grades outside of participation, which means if this isnt your thing, then youll potentially have a rough time.",
                "strengths: lots of fun, very chill, pretty open-ended, field trips were awesome\r\nweaknesses: transition from albers exercises to very open ended final project is kind of abrupt and maybe there could be another assignment bridging the gap between albers concepts and final pieces. The class could maybe also just include more work in assignments in general and some more discussion of color theory and its application in art history (but that is kind of outside \"color practice\"",

This is also one of those classes where the more time you put in the more you get out of it, and it's super fulfilling to get the opportunity to spend such a significant amount of time on the final with the helpful guidance of Anoka - so if you take it, dive in!",
                "Yes. Everyone should take this is you're even remotely into art or even just into color.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It was great for art and non-art majors alike. For most projects, you got a lot of independence and the class was designed to help students succeed and explore.",
                "Definitely. Whats not to like? Colors, painting, collaging you learn a lot and you have a great time doing it.",
                "Yes, great course and very interesting and enjoyable assignments - professor and TA were both very nice and great teachers",
                "If you want this to be a gut and youre not typically into this style of courses, dont do it. If you consider yourself into art and want to understand it better, then maybe do.",
                "yes, it's a very fun and chill class that will get you thinking about color. Approachable to non art majors -- over half of our class were non art majors. It's definitely not a color theory class so don't expect it to be. Prof. Faruqee is really nice and encouraging in critiques.",
                "yes. its really fun and relaxing to make collages. also colors are everywhere and a huge part of our perception / experience"
