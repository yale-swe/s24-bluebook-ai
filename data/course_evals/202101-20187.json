                "learned how to push myself to write chapters of a novel. also how to write with a partner.",
                "I learned about young adult writing, from an analysis of the techniques used by some of the best YA novels, to actually writing 5 chapters of one myself. In general, though, the class was much more pragmatic compared to a class like ENGL120. I also learned a lot about what it was like being a writer as a profession, and more about Jake's personal journey as one.\r\n\r\nThe way the class is structured is that in the first half, we do some combination of an activity or Q&A session about a writer or a presentation, then we spend some time talking really informally about that week's YA novel reading, and then in the last half of class, we workshop two to three pieces.",
                "I really learned how to begin world building and workshop stories in an intense but supportive environment.",
                "I feel much more confident in my ability to write a novel! It's something I've always wanted to do but never had the guts to try to pull off. It takes grit, but this class showed me anyone can do it, and you don't even have to be the best writer. You just have to have motivation and a compelling story.",
                "I gained so many valuable insights into how to craft a storyfrom avoiding information dumps to slowing the pacingthat it would be impossible for me to describe all of them here. The process of working on a single, sustained piece of fiction throughout the semester also gave me a better sense of how to structure and pace the first few chapters of a novel."

                "the prof made this class the best",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\n- Jake. (Professor Halpern, but we call him Jake). He's sweet, he's funny, he's charismatic, he's brilliant, he gives amazing feedback, and he just cares so much about his students.\r\n- Classes are pretty much the most comfortable environment I've ever been in - Jake provides an incredibly safe space for feedback. He also sprinkles in fun activities and presentations and Q&As at the beginning of class sometimes.\r\n- The House system is fantastic for getting closer with a smaller group of students in the class, and getting more personalized, focused feedback. \r\n- I love the flexible aspect of the class and development of the course. It's constantly evolving, yet there's still a clear undercurrent of structure keeping things on track to writing the four to five chapters by the end of the course.\r\n- I love that Jake really downplays grades and trusts his students to go beyond the grade and write the best work we can make. It took a ton of stress off of us students and gave us the mental space to thrive. \r\n- Allowing us to select our own YA novels was so fun, and branching out to watching TV shows each week was a great way to switch it up and learn other ways of writing stories.\r\n- I loved how Jake treated the chapter feedback less as perfecting each one, but rather, focusing on continually pushing forward instead, as if we were actually writing a book. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\n- This is really minor, but the weekly feedback we were supposed to give for workshops was sometimes a little confusing. We were supposed to write 150 words as if we were the writer ourselves, but this was tough time-wise with reading three works a week, and some students didn't even",
                "I loved how hands-on the course was-- you really begin writing a book from the get-go. However, I would have appreciated maybe one lecture on craft and the basics of YA writing just to get accustomed to the style before you dive if head-first. The biggest strengths of the class were definitely the office hours, workshopping, and \"house\" meetings (workshopping groups that met outside of class). I really felt like I got clear feedback  and support on my work, and it made me feel less alone as a writer.",
                "I loved the feedback we got from the professor and classmates that really helped me fine-tune my narrative. I think expecting us to read, give detailed feedback, and \"rewrite\" 150-200 words of 2-3 other students' stories each week was a big ask, and I would have enjoyed being able to focus more on my own story.",
                "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale! In the era of Zoom, this was the one course I looked forward to every week. I loved the opportunity to spend hours writing and to produce almost 40 pages of a novel; I loved reading my classmates' work and critiquing it during workshops. Professor Halpern also had us read the first week chapters of a different YA novel each week, which generated fascinating discussions about what makes published novels work and how they could be improved. By meeting every week in smaller \"House groups\" of around 3 students, I also found two people with whom I could discuss even the most ridiculous plot ideas. Professor Halpern was endlessly supportive of my attempt to write a novel and offered me invaluable suggestions during office hours."

                "YES, if you are interested in creative writing you absolutely must take this course. I cannot recommend it enough!",

                "yes if u like writing, especially YA fiction. you also get to read and watch YA books and TV shows",
                "YES YES YES!! You HAVE to try to take this class, and if you can get into this seminar, you ABSOLUTELY must take it! Jake is one of the best professors I've had at Yale so far. He's wholesome, brilliant, down-to-earth, cares about his students, and just emanates passion about his craft. He has a ton of soothing life advice, and ... I've just run out of superlatives to describe this class. And if you're looking to become a professional writer, you can't learn any better than from Jake's own inspiring story from a Yale student to Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist.\r\n\r\nBeyond Jake, though, the content matter itself is just so interesting and fun. Everyone in the class grew up reading YA novels like Harry Potter and it was so fun to be able to write one ourselves. Of course there were crunch times before a deadline, and it's not like the class is a walk in the park, but the fact that the content matter is so passion and interest-driven made it much less of an academic burden. It was a much-welcome change of pace from the analytical writing we do in other Yale writing classes. \r\n\r\nFinally, this class is just socially awesome. In a year that has been remote academically, it's been so isolating, and Jake's House system not only gives students the chance to get more personalized academic feedback on their stories (we meet weekly), but also for me personally, put me in contact with two of the coolest and most interesting people at Yale, who I would have never met otherwise before. Jake invited all of his students into his home to walk his super fluffy dog Milo and meet his wife and kids (all adhering to covid protocols, of course), and when my House members convinced me to come down to New Haven, Jake even spontaneously threw together a walk for a visit. Like, I've never met a professor who cared that much about his students before- it was mind-blowing. \r\n\r\nENGL428 is academically awesome, socially awesome, professionally awesome ... This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and I'm going to remember it for the rest of my life.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to write A LOT. It is challenging but rewarding. Confusingly, this class is not a writing credit, so be mindful of that.",
                "Yes!!! Professor Halpern is one of a kind and cares about supporting his students in writing, regardless of where they're starting at. Take it for him alone! The syllabus material is interesting and you eventually help create the syllabus.",
                "Take this course! If you've ever dreamed of writing a novel, I can almost guarantee that this will be one of your favorite courses at Yale. Jake is an incredible professor, the kind who can offer sage advice about everything from how to craft the love triangle in your YA novel to how to find meaning in life. You'll get to create a fictional world and spend hours living and working in it, you'll read YA books, and you'll discuss your classmate's fantasy stories during workshops. What's not to love?",
                "I would absolutely recommend the course. Jake genuinely cares about his students and does a wonderful job of creating a supportive and open community that transcended the classroom. Even during covid, it meant a lot to have a space to enjoy storytelling together and push each other to write and create. I highly recommend the class if you have any interest in fantasy novels and stories and want to explore writing yourself in a low-stress, supportive, collaborative setting."
