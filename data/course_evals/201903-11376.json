    "Very intimate which is good, sometimes seemed a little disorganized and topics seemed to bounce around in one class day instead of focusing on one thing.",
    "Professor Lalli was a fantastic teacher, adapting the material to our class and slowing down\/speeding up and adjusting as needed. Im not sure how much it could be improved!",
    "This class was strong in that it mixed work on paper with work at the piano very well.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it covers a lot of material. One of the weaknesses of this course was that it moved very quickly."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Especially with Professor Lalli, this course was fun to be engaged with, and if you get invested in music theory, you will greatly benefit from taking this course with Lalli because he will teach you all you want to know!",
    "Yes very much so, great introduction to music.",
    "Yes if the student is interested in learning how to read and write music at a basic level, teacher was every engaging.",
    "100%! It can be a fair bit of work with the worksheets, but they dont take terribly long and really help you learn. Take it with Lalli! It wasnt too much of a time commitment, but if you stay engaged, come to class, and keep up, you will get so much out of this course. One of my favorites Ive taken at Yale.",
    "For anyone interested in music, even casually, this is a great class. Just don't expect it to be easy!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who has any interest in music because the course drills in a lot of material in just one semester"
