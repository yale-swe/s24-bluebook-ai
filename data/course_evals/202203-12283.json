                "I learned how to find meaning in dance performances and write about it in a lot of descriptive and analytical detail.",
                "This course taught me to respect and appreciate the art of dance criticism as one where the performer, observer, and choreographer are one. They continuously influence one another, making each other's presence known through movement, rhythm, and tempo.",
                "Learned how to write about movement- and in that process, much about the movement itself! The class was a broad survey of all types of dance, which definitely posed a challenge in the writing process. Also became more comfortable with descriptive language required in writing about dance, as well as concision, clarity, and economy of words."

                "This course is a great opportunity to be really thoughtful and meaningful about writing. I loved the topic, and I appreciated that there were students of varying experiences with dance in the course. The open-endedness of the assignments was great, since it allowed people to get more or less academic and be very creative. The workshopping in class was also fun, and the field trips were rewarding AND allowed me to connect with my classmates. At times, the class felt very monotonous, so switching the order of things up a bit may help.",
                "I enjoyed the setup of the class of few readings, a weekly 500-750 word essay, and feedback on our writing in class from classmates. The field trips to New York were also a highlight of the course (and of my semester). For what the course provides, it does not have many weaknesses. The only thing is that the professor can be a somewhat strict grader. Additionally, the all day trips tended to be very tiring.",
                "Strength: Extremely interactive course whose professor radiated a passion for the subject. \r\n\r\nWeakness: None",
                "Strengths- the class size is perfect for discussion, which greatly helped with the workshop process! The course is primarily a workshop class, so you get wonderful, honest, and helpful feedback on your writing consistently. Not to mention field trips to NYC (to see globally famous dance companies). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- this is primarily a writing class, so if youre a dancer without a writing background the course load will be difficult. Professor Seiberts feedback can seem harsh, but the criticism is solely constructive and helped my writing a lot!"

I believe interest in dance is necessary for you to really get everything out of it, but that doesn't mean you need experience. Its a great opportunity to be creative.",
                "I would recommend this as a writing credit for any student. I took it as a STEM student looking for my last writing credit and it was a great course for both accomplishing this and having a fun and interesting course.",
                "Absolutely!! This is a course that not only challenges your current view of what dance is, but it also makes you tear it apart, and individually understand it's underlying technique."
