There were a couple class periods, though, when we switched from more of a lecture-based format to a more seminar-style discussion  I thought that was particularly engaging, and looking back I wonder if it couldn't be integrated into the course more prominently.",

The beginning part of the course on linguistics felt a little mundane at times (when I wanted to dive right into hieroglyphics), but the material in the first few weeks ends up being very useful in analyzing the Mayan language. The progression of the course through the textbook is clear and naturally builds on itself. This maximized my understanding of the material and allowed me to feel comfortable with the language by the end of the course. The only weakness that I can think of was that homework assignments could be unpredictable and some took much longer than others."
