                "This course was super engaging in class and covers a lot of really important and fun Japanese material. Assignments outside of class are occasionally quite interesting. Class time focuses a lot on spoken Japanese which is very helpful. The biggest weakness in the course is organization. I never knew what we would be doing in class before I came to class so I never had a chance to prepare or read the relevant section of the textbook. I had many times in this course where I would only learn of an exam or quiz the week of (at worst, 2 days in advance) and have to scramble to study. The progression of assessments did not follow a stable pattern either, so it was hard to prioritize studying effectively before learning of assessment times. Feedback came back at a stable rate in this course for most assessments, but I never got feedback on my oral assessments. I think this course would improve loads if there was a more comprehensive syllabus with a calendar.",
                "I think this course covered a lot of Japanese grammar and their uses. However, more opportunities for listening and reading practice would be appreciated.",
                "There is a lot of work that students need to do in order to prepare for every class, but its framed in a way to make learning easy if you put in the work and its very engaging and fun.",

                "I'd recommend this course to a student that is really interested in studying Japanese and continuing onto higher level courses, and who has a lot of time to put into the course.",
                "I would recommend this to any student interested in learning more Japanese. However, I think the teacher of the class has a big impact on your experience.",
                "Yes. I think this course is very engaging and fun, however, you must be prepared for a large workload because you need to put in a lot of work in order to succeed. However, it is very fulfilling and a great language to learn.",
