                "Strengths: I learned MATLAB, small class size (< 10 students)\r\nWeaknesses: too much economic theory in a class that is not listed for economics. This course should really be under ECON, not PSYC. The fundamental principles are economics, not psychology. Equations were presented without much explanation about what the parameters were or what they meant. I was honestly lost around week 4 of this class and never quite caught up. \r\n\r\nThis course could be improved by clearly defining terms (risk aversion, loss aversion, prospect theory) and parameters in the equations and models presented in class. The problem sets were also due on Thursday at 11:59pm, even though they were only made available on Wednesdays around 9:00am. Considering that you need the information in that week's course, which meets Wednesdays 9:25-11:15am to complete the problem set, this leaves you with a mere 36 hours to complete the problem set. The rationale was that the TA needed time to grade our problem sets before next week, which makes sense, but still.... I'm left wondering why it makes sense that students get 36 hours to complete the problem set while it takes five days to grade our work?",
                "Strengths: really difficult content helps you feel like you're learning things that are complex but important; concept are engaging and interesting, and material has implications for the present and future.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: content and assignments were both extremely difficult for beginners to computational modeling and a more thorough intro to both would have been much much more helpful in the beginning; be prepared to be challenged and spend a lot of time trying to understand this complex discipline.",
                "There wasn't much instruction on matlab for the homeworks so had to figure out amongst ourselves",
                "Strengths: Good lectures and great profs\r\nWeaknesses: P-sets at the beginning weren't the best and were hard to get started on due to the learning curve.",
                "A lot of the material covered in the class is really interesting. The papers assigned for readings were long but interesting. One downside to the class is that we spent a lot of time reviewing the last week's homework before diving into the actual material for that day. The homework policy is also unconventional (you are only given a small window of time to complete each assignment) so that could be frustrating if you tend to be busy on that day.",
                "Strengths: Great course to take if you're on the quantitative side of psychology. Exposure to Matlab is great and is useful for future research. Psets are designed to be challenging but also collaborating so a lot of the class is a group effort. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been useful to take some more time to define what computational models were at the beginning of the class. I don't see why problem sets had to be turned in 24 hours after assignmentif you have a heavy schedule for the day of this class, it probably isn't worth it to take this class.",

                "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless they came from an economics background. I personally did not struggle with the coding portions of this class, since I have been involved in computational research and am familiar with the utility of stackoverflow, but I definitely struggled with the economics concepts that this class so heavily relied upon. I know some of my peers struggled with the coding portions of this class, so if you aren't familiar with prospect theory or matlab, don't take this class. (I wasn't proficient in Matlab before starting the class, but I did have experience with R, Bash, and a little Python, so was fine debugging code on my own. Some of my peers really struggled with this, though.) \r\n\r\nI imagine that there are much better PSYC 200+ level courses that can be taken to fulfill the research methods requirement. Additionally, I don't think that this class was relevant to my research or my future career at all, which was somewhat disappointing. I wonder if I would have gained more by taking Prof Turk-Browne's research methods class, which is hard, but would probably have been more relevant to my career path.",

If you are up for an intense but fruitful challenge, then yes. If you are prepared to spend a lot of time doing homework and understanding material (and asking for help), then yes. If you are a beginner to coding or psych or have no interest in the complex and tedious processes that go into a computational modeling approach, then no. Overall, be interested in the content and be prepared to step up your game and work hard to succeed.",

                "Yes, but only if you're interested in quantitative psychology and coding. This class is different from other psych classes because it is beneficial to have coding experience beforehand. It is a much greater challenge to go into MATLAB with no coding experience.\r\n\r\n The due date for psets being 1 day after class is a struggle and more so in a non-virtual semester. If you have a heavy workload on the days of this class, it would be smart to hold off on this class. Overall, keep in mind that the workload is a lot for the psychology department, especially the final paper. You'll also get skills in how to code, how to ask questions, and how to perform research, but this isn't a class to learn about material per-se.",
