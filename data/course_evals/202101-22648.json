He is always wiling to meet outside of office hours and is always happy to talking through paper topics with you. The readings Professor Cameron chose were really interesting! \r\n\r\nWeakness: There is a lot of reading for this course, about a book a week (some weeks are lighter). Also at times, seminar would become a bit lecture-like but overall the seminar got better as the semester went on! (I attribute some of these weaknesses to the online format of the course)."

I wasn't thrilled by the material because I'm not particularly interested in comparative European politics, but that's more a matter of personal preference than it is a reflection on the course. The class is great, I'd probably just recommend it only if you're genuinely interested in comparative political and economic systems in Europe.",

The seminar does feel a bit like a lecture at times and some of the readings do get confusing (there is quite a bit of reading in this seminar), but if you are willing to do the readings then you will get a lot out of this course."
