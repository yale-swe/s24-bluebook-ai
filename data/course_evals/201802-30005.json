    "I acquired the skills to identify every single bone in the human body as well as the major bony landmarks and muscle attachments. The lectures also presented some knowledge on the evolutionary history of certain features as well as some techniques for aging and sexing.",
    "I've learned all the human bones. Not only am I able to identify the 200 bones or so, but I am also able to understand their functions and how they serve in the skeletomuscular system. This course helped me develop a skill which is memorizing a whole bunch of terms in less than a week",
    "Learned all the bones of the human body and muscle attachments and some nerves",
    "I now have a relatively thorough understanding of the human skeletal body. The study of Anthropology has become one of my future areas of pursuits thanks to this class.",
    "Bones and their features, memorization, lab time management",
    "I learned how to identify all of the parts of the human skeleton and learn other skills such as sexing and aging different bones.  I also learned about muscle attachments and movements.",
    "I learned to identify each bone in the human body and important features of the bones."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the expectations are very clear and the assessments were always fair in the sense that if you truly internalized the material you'll do well.",
    "There are no weaknesses in this course, it is pretty straight forward and I like that.",
    "Yale has such a great osteological collection that this class taps into. For what the class sets out to do, it does so perfectly.",
    "The class is extremely engaging, unique, and interesting. Students are each given a box of human bones for study and practice.\r\nThe class could meet more often.",
    "Strengths: Content, labs, lectures, quizzes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "I think that the class time could be cut down a little shorter as I learn better on my own and could have studied in my dorm.  However, it was useful to have the professor there if I had any questions.",
    "One wonderful thing about this course was its lab. It was a rare and brilliant opportunity for a high school student to access all those specimens."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it if you're into bones! One thing to note is that the class is primarily in a flipped classroom format, so do take that into consideration.",
    "I would totally recommend this course to someone who is planning to study medicine or anthropology. I personally took this class because it was the closest I could get to medicine. This course gave me an insight of what studying medicine will actually be like (learning and memorizing a lot of anatomical terms). If the person is not interested in human anatomy though, then I wouldn't recommend this course because they will not enjoy all the work and effort they have to do.",
    "If you want a cool, relatively easy science credit, go for it! Be prepared this class is entirely based off of memorization -- you learn bones and features and then are tested on being able to identify them on other specimens. While there is a textbook on the syllabus, you don't need it at all.",
    "Yes. This kind of course is not offered in any other university's summer sessions. In a short 30-days period, a student can gain essential knowledge of the human body. Remarkable and memorable experience.",
    "If you are serious about learning the material, I would recommend this class. This is not for people who plan on procrastinating or giving 50%.",
    "Although I don't have any other courses to compare this to as I am a high school student that took one other course, I would recommend this course to students wishing to pursue science majors as all the information I learned is important for understanding the human body.",
    "Yes. Osteology is new to many students, but the course is introductory and suits students with all knowledge background. It was awesome to access real human bone, and Yale has such an amazing collection of specimens for this subject."
