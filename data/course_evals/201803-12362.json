   "comments": [
    "The strength is that this class helped me use and improve my Arabic. I learned new vocab and enjoyed watching the movies\/reading the stories that we did in class. Class was engaging. \r\nOne weakness is that doing the same thing (same structure) can get a bit repetitive at times.",
    "I liked the news presentations and the stories we read. I wish we had been forced to speak more in class!",
    "The course only meets three times per week, including a section, as compared with five days per week for previous levels. Less class time means that we are not able to cover as much material. I wish that we had spent a bit more time on grammar review and general conversation practice. I liked reading Arabic short stories, but I would have enjoyed discussing them more in class. The students in the course had a wide range of Arabic experience and ability, which made it hard for all lessons to be accessible and interesting for everyone. Section was fun, but I think I would prefer spending Fridays with Professor Aziz."
