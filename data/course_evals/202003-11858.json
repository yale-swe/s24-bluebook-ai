                "Strengths: The lecture-discussion format of this seminar was very effective. We would discuss papers in class that were relevant to what we had just learned in our lectures, which helped reinforce the topics. The professors were very kind and knowledgeable. We also didn't have a final cumulative exam technically, just a third exam.\r\nWeaknesses: None really stand out. I think with any course that has multiple professors, it can take a while for students to adjust to each professor's new teaching style, but that's all.",
                "Strengths were interesting content and thoughtful professors. \r\n\r\nBiggest weakness was the discussions. Some students didnt do the reading beforehand, and others went out of their way to speak for as long as possible. This made things feel very inorganic\/forced. I dont think its helpful to have professors taking notes on who says what and how often they speak because it creates a very competitive environment where the focus is on getting a grade rather than actually thinking and speaking critically about the paper.",
                "Strengths the lectures were pretty great, the papers we discussed were almost all really interesting, the exam format was very reasonable, and the final assignments (explaining an epigenetics concept to a non-scientist, writing a news&views) were the best assignments I've had for a MCDB class. I think it's great to test our ability to communicate science. Weaknesses  it's so much harder to stay focused during online lectures. Since they were an hour and 15 mins long, I often had to make notes like 'check recording' so I'd know where I lost the thread of the lecture. It would've been very helpful to take a short break halfway through. I also wish we could've gone over some common figures as a primer in our primary literature discussions  something like, here's how to interpret ChIP-seq\/RNA-seq\/etc. results, since those came up a bit but in discussions you kinda have to rely on hopefully interpreting it right on your own or having classmates that already know how to interpret these figures. Spoiler: previous MCDB classes went over these techniques but I don't remember one actually covering how to interpret real results.",
                "I thought lectures and discussions were very engaging. I thought it was more helpful and effective to go into breakout rooms to discuss the paper and then come together as a group.",
                "The content presented in this course is interesting. All three professors (Jacob, van Wolfswinkel, and Nadya) are strong teachers and give clear, organized, and interesting lectures. They are very receptive to students questions (in fact, they make multiple stops to ask if there are questions) and are patient with replying to them. Most of the time the professors had an outline slide that was helpful for giving the students a sense of what to expect from the lecture. I also thought that the video assignment was a fun addition to the course. \r\nA weakness of this course was the exam structurewhich in my opinion was not very well adapted for the remote circumstances. Prof. Dimitrovas exam was open notes and was still adequately challenging (and thus was well adapted for the new circumstances), but Prof. Jacob and Prof. van Wolfswinkel relied on the honor code for their exams. While the professors likely made an effort to not make questions that could just be answered by looking at the slides, a sizeable number of the questions were likely still easily answered if the students looked at their notes. I would suggest that Prof. Jacob and Prof. van Wolfswinkel also switch to open-notes exam in this remote learning situation so as to not disadvantage students who stick by the honor code.",
                "the format of the discussion sections was inconsistent, wouldve been nice if it was more consistent throughout the semester",

                "The professors and TA offer a lot of support in and out of class giving students many opportunities to see the material and to understand it in a way that works for them. Professors encourage students to ask questions which helps to create an environment conducive for learning.",
                "the material for the lectures is interesting and overall the class is not too overwhelming. All three exams are worth the same amount of points even though one exam took several hours while the others were one hour short answer in class, so I think it would be better if all three exams were a bit more similar in difficulty and length. I enjoyed the lecture aspect of the course more than the discussion sections."

                "I thought both lectures and discussion were engaging.",
                "Succeeded: Some of the professors did slow down the rate at which they presented (which was helpful), and having access to recordings was a huge boon (especially since it was hard to understand the instructors' speech sometimes in real time). \r\nCould be improved: Some of the instructors forgot to slow down---I know it's tough since there's no feedback from the students and the instructors can't see the students' faces easily to gauge whether they're going too fast, but it was really challenging to understand what was going on sometimes, even with the recording. One of my other seminars called on students, making discussion a lot easier and more organized. Sometimes, discussions in this class would be unorganized and speaking time would be left up for grabs, which was frustrating and stress-inducing. My other classes compensated for these technical difficulties by providing more access to TAs, professor office hours, or in general being a little nicer on student feedback\/grades. This course didn't have those fallbacks. As a result, I think students sometimes struggled to learn, an effect that was only compounded by the stress of keeping up in a high-level science course while living in the middle of a pandemic.",
                "The recorded lectures really helped with studying. We didnt really make use of the discussion board on Canvas, but thats mostly on the students. As mentioned above, the exams (barring Prof. Dimitrovas take home exam) were not well adjusted for the remote learning environment--it is not difficult for students to cheat by looking at their notes while being proctored on zoom.
