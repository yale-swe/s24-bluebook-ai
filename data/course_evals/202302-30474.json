I also got a new understanding toward the differences between sex and gender. I also foster a correlation between races and classes,  and how these inequalities lead to negative feeling and attitudes, racial segregations, and other affirmatives actions that exaggerate the issue.",

                "I learned the facts about and perspectives on the inequity of gender, race, and class in the U.S. I learned that history is important in shaping inequities of a certain society. The most valuable insight is that we must have faith in building a equitable world though it may seem impossible.",
                "-definitions of sociological terms including race, racism, gender, sexism, class, classism\r\n-read current and non current work of sociologists \r\n-how race, gender, and class have looked in the history of the US and today\r\n-how race, gender, and class are similar, and different, and intersect",
                "i gain more knowledge about inequities, not just in the US, but also from around the world. noticing everyday interaction and how it is actually a real implementation of inequities is such an eye-opening experience",
                "I now understand how the systems work especially in the US!",
                "Learning in this class has enhanced the basic foundation of my understanding regarding race, class, and gender. Through the class readings, lectures, and group discussions, I have further understood race, gender, and class as social constructs and how they affect the daily lives of society. Although the context of the topic in this class mainly caters to the United States, I could implement what I have learned in a broader context of other countries, namely my hometown of Indonesia. Additionally, this class increased my critical thinking, writing, and public speaking skills.",
                "I gained knowledge on the issues of race, gender, and class in the scope of the U.S. and universally. I have learnt that race, gender, and class inequities stem from various issues and affect the micro, macro, and meso levels. I also gained the skills of writing a research proposal and editing academic videos."

Maybe YSS could set an upper limit on course enrollment and reduce the number of students.",
                "Discussions among huge amount of articles and essays on differnet perspectives and approaches. Very broad range of topics that allow intersections to form between different groups, and also requires great amount of thinking and effort paid into it.",
                "Having discussions with students during class was good to me",
                "Strengths: encourage students to better understand what is happening in the world\r\nWeakness: too many reading materials, limited time",
                "The course has many inspiring materials, including readings and the teacher's PPT. However, it may be difficult for international students without many American cultural backgrounds to understand. It may be improved by explaining some key cultural backgrounds in the readings ahead instead of just bringing them up during discussion.",
                "Strengths\r\n- the Professor was a great lecturer \r\n- the slideshows \r\n- the pacing\r\n- the final project\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- some of the readings were too long",
                "i love how the professor trying to gave us example that close with our daily lives. this is the biggest class I've take in YSS, and I think I makes me easily distracted sometimes.",
                "because the people who are in class mostly outside from the US, I only wish there are more US Student so the topics can be more relatable",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. Balanced time allocation for lectures, seminars, and group discussions made it easier to follow the learning process and understand the class materials. \r\n2. The professor and TAs were proactive and appreciative of every student's responses in class, creating a comfortable environment for students to continue engaging in class discussions. They also provided clear and informative feedback on every assignment, which made it easy for students to keep improving their work.\r\n3. All material resources are organized completely and well on Canvas, making it easier to access.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. The amount of readings differs from how long students have to read everything. Thus, I think it would be helpful if the key terms and PowerPoint presentation slides were given at least 24 hours before class. Therefore, students will have a guide to the readings and a head-start on the most essential terms to focus on.",
                "The strength lies in how interactive the class is -- not only with the lecturers but also between students through group readings and weekly correspondences. The weakness is probably the burden of the pre-readings which can be overwhelming at times but is still tolerable in my opinion."

The class was engaging and had different types of learning and various assignment types. I think any student would benefit and learn from this class, no matter what major.",
