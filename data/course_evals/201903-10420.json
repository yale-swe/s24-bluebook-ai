    "i learned how to approach design problems by applying new principles that I learned about, and also how to think creatively and artistically. I love that this class has changed how i take in the world. for example, now I always walk around and notice bits of \"design\" and think about why i like them or don't like them, and how it might inspire projects that I decide to work on. I also learned that I want to be creative in my career, and that i might even switch my major to the arts!",

    "Very engaging. Very hands-on.",
    "this was an amazing class, my favorite at yale so far! the assignments were well organized and exciting, and henk was an awesome professor who always provided useful guidance and was also a funny, down to earth guy. earlier in the semester, assignments could sometimes pile up all at once and then there would be periods of no work, but honestly sometimes this was just the nature of the project at hand and it was never a huge problem. henk was very flexible as long as we got the work done, and I never felt stressed about work. it was really fun and relaxing to do the assignments.",
    "strengths: very intense, projects make you think creatively \r\nweaknesses: specs of each project was not clearly delineated, a lot of times we'd get assignments but be unclear on the parameters",
    "Personally, I loved the handmade aspect of the course. Getting to work with my hands was such a change from my other courses, and I believe the results it produced were much better than a digital means.",
    "Class is great, but the workload is a bit much. We did our projects by hand, which seemed kind of silly at first since I assumed we would be using Photoshop and Illustrator to make things, but it paid off in the end since working by hand helped me more than by working on the computer. There are things that you can only observe when approaching projects by hand.",
    "Strengths: studio projects, a lot of learning happened through group critiques.\r\nWeaknesses: maybe more lecture\/instruction on the typography poster.",
    "It's a great course if you're even remotely interested in graphic design. The work process is very refreshing and a change of pace from standard courses, but be prepared to put a ton of time into your work.",
    "The small size, great feedback culture and hands-on curriculum are great. I would say the only part that could be improved would be that needed material should at best be provided, especially since we paid a \"materials fee\" but then had to buy additional things to work with.",
    "Strengths: crits are always informative and never hurtful; you learn about the very fundamentals of design before anything else, so it's accessible regardless of previous experience; by the end of the class you feel like you've really gained a skill.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the workload is extremely high, not in terms of intellectual challenge but in hours you have to devote to completing the assignments. Looking back at it now, I feel that most of it was necessary, but still think that the intensity of the course could be reduced a little bit."

    "I'm putting the answers to all these questions here because it's the one that appears first on CourseTable (saving you a few clicks, folks). First thing to note if you're unaware is that this is NOT a class on graphic design softwareyou'll be building everything by hand, using collage techniques. If you think this is fun, like I do, then you'll probably be into this class, because the vast majority of the total time that you'll spend for this class will involve things like cutting paper with X-Acto knives and gluing them to each other. As you might expect, this kind of class is fairly vague and nontechnical. What I mean by this is that throughout the class only a small amount of specialized vocabulary is built up, and while talking about each other's art almost everything said is fairly subjective. \r\n\r\nGraphic design basically has three components. First, you have to come up with a message; then, you have to figure out how to successfully convey the message; third, you have to make the actual product look nice. At the start of the semester, our assignments were relatively \"content-free\" and so the comments tended to be about just whether the thing actually looked good or not. This is where you first learn about the \"principles of design,\" which Henk defines as follows: balance (symmetrical and asymmetrical), direction, positive\/negative space, contrast (size, value, etc.), visual rhythm, three-dimensional space, and repetition (with variety). I'm placing this list here so that, even if you decide not to take this class, you will at least get to learn what a highly acclaimed graphic design professor believes to be the most important aspects of his own field. Pretty sweet. Later in the class, meanwhile, a lot more attention is paid to the interaction between form and content; in other words, whether the art that one makes adequately conveys one's message. This is where things get a little moreas we say in the math biz\"hand-wavey.\" Still pretty cool though, if you like making art and talking about other people's art. IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't be fooled by the extremely fast pace of assignments in the early weeks of the semester. You have to apply for this class, which just so everyone knows involves not only the written statement that he puts on the syllabus but ALSO a pair of collages involving black lines on a white background, representing two opposite abstract conceptsours were \"density\" and \"transparency.\" (He only mentions this in class, which is a clever ploy to weed out people who don't attend the first sessionif you actually want to take this class, don't fall for that one and make sure to show up the first time!) After that, there are a lot of assignments in quick succession and you're gonna be like \"dang, this class might actually be insanely hard.\" Good news: the pace of assignments quickly abates. The majority of the class consists of alternating work sessions and critiques. The work sessions are pretty useless because you could just do the same thing. The critiques are extremely fun and interesting.\r\n\r\nA note on \"critiques,\" since it's the kind of thing that sounds intimidating if you're a non-art major: it's actually not. You basically put your work on the wall and then go around and make both positive and negative comments on someone's work for a while, after which Henk makes a few comments. It feels very supportive\/constructive and there's not a lot of tearing apart people's work. It's also really interesting to see what people did and to talk through them. Workshops like this are one of the few kinds of class where you get to see how different the work that various people do is, and I find that pretty cool. In terms of Henk himself, he's willing to be brutally honest when necessary, but he's also super chill and easy to talk to and just seems like a cool guy. One of my favorite professors at Yale just for that reason.\r\n\r\nThe New York trip at the end is probably the highlight: you visit the MoMa and his studio.",
    "yes!",
    "yes yes yes!!!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student looking to go into design or maybe just get the basics",
    "YES! I absolutely loved going to class and doing all the assignments. I think anyone, regardless of experience or major, will find this course valuable.",
    "Yes because this course was very well taught and the professor, Henk, is an amazing guy and teacher. He truly helps you work through all of the projects and gives you lots of constructive criticism and guidance through each of your projects. He genuinely cares about your development and growth as a designer. On top of that, the end-of-semester trip to New York is amazing, so that is a plus.",
    "Yes! It's an excellent introduction to graphic design.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely. Henk is an outstanding teacher, and he gives so much individualized time and attention to all of his students. While there is a lot of work, it is well worth the time and energy you put into it.",
    "Absolutely! I loved the diversity of the group (I believe it is great that non-art majors could take the class) and talking over our work has opened my eyes to many new perspectives.",
    "Even though I loved this course and would definitely recommend it to another student, I would definitely preface my recommendation by saying that the workload of the course is really high (you spend so much time cutting paper with an xacto knife!) and most of it is done alone. I learned so much, and had a lot of fun, but think that anyone who wants to take Intro Graphic Design should pause to consider how the work will affect their semester."
