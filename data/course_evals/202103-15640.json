I went in feeling incredibly shaky in my capacity with the language and I was pleasantly surprised by the level of fluency that this course unlocked for me. The content was incredibly healing and provided me with a far more full vision of the culture. There was a very immersive element to the class that definitely sat with a student well beyond the academic environment.",
                "I did not know any Portuguese before this class, but now I can speak a little bit and read Portuguese.",
                "I learned so much about Brazillian culture! I also felt like I learned so much Portuguese!",

                "This course's main strengths were its ability to be effective and giving me the skills and experience that I was looking to glean from an introductory language course. The professor also was really reasonable and understanding, although the class could sometimes be a bit unengaging due to low student participation. I think that there is little this class could do differently to be improved.",
                "This course was amazing at providing a very fluent understanding of Brazilian culture! It took a very holistic approach that made class feel very comfortable. The creativity that we were allowed to express with assignments was incredibly fun and I feel as if this was definitely a class that was enjoyable to engage in. I think that on the flip side, however, the lack of structure sometimes led to a lack of clarity on assignment submissions. I got the sense that there was an acknowledgment of that lack of structure that bred a little bit of ambiguity in regards to completion, so it was easy to have leniency in regards to the completion of work. I think that this ambiguity could easily be ameliorated through more comprehensive utilization of Canvas, which provides a great structure for clarity!",
                "This class is very comforting, but also challenging. There is little to no English spoken in the course, which makes it hard for someone who has never spoken Portuguese, but it forces me to learn quickly and embrace the challenge.",
                "This class was a low-stress way to learn a lot of a language and a lot about culture. I really can't think of any weaknesses, I loved this class and I thought the Prof. was amazing.",
                "Strengths: supportive atmosphere, everyone in the Portuguese department demonstrates their passion and wants students to be involved in Brazilian culture, we got to attend an art exhibit involving our works and got to meet students of other sections\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grading is heavily delayed, the professor reviews for the exams a day before, homework is assigned without a warning"

                "Absolutely! I think that the cultural knowledge and practice that the course provides is incredibly beneficial. You learn a surprising amount by the end of the semester that is hard to acquire through traditionally structured language courses. I think that this course was incredibly unique in the way that it tossed students into the fray and promoted our engagement with the language. It challenged us adequately in a manner that really promoted fluency and acquisition of the language.",
                "Absolutely if you want to try a new language that was no offered to you in high school.",
                "YES YES YES! I felt like a learned so much, and really enjoyed going to class every day. I never felt stressed about this class, but it wasn't a gut, I just felt like all of the work we were assigned was really meaningful.",
