                "This course was a good way to learn how to present on mathematical topics, especially ones you arent familiar with. We learned techniques to teach and engage people in topics related to the Laplacian, which has many applications.",

                "How to give a math talk",
                "In Professor O'Neill's 480, we focused all our lectures around the Laplacian in some way. There was a real emphasis on applications and connections between different branches of math. Not all of the topics held my interest, especially some of the grittier analysis and DE, and some I was overly familiar with, like graph theory; I think that'd be true of everyone. But it was a smorgasbord of a syllabus, so by the end of the semester everyone was stuffed, one way or another. I got to brush up on my complex analysis. I saw eigenspectra in way more contexts than I ever had before - in general I realized how lacking my linear algebra education was here at Yale. I also really enjoyed our \"capstone topic\" for the course, Hearing the Shape of a Drum, and all the variations people explored on it. \r\n\r\nBut while I definitely picked up some new math and encountered neat ideas like lazy random walks and expander graphs, the biggest ways this course helped me were more of life skills. Planning my own lectures, managing time, cutting topics, anticipating questions, incorporating feedback - this was all really hard, but I got better each time. And while I was always nervous presenting, by the end I was also pretty excited. I cannot overstate how positive and friendly of an environment everyone maintained, nor how much that comforted me before my lectures."

                "The class was well-structured. The course definitely depends on the number of people enrolled. We presented about five times, but I dont think more would be good. It took a long to time to learn and prepare for the presentations.",
                "The strengths were that it was a stress free environment and that we got feedback after the talks. The only weakness was that we had a relatively high number of talks to give",
                "The course was relatively good overall, for a required course like this. I learned some interesting math while improving my presenting skills. Can't think of any needed improvements.",
                "Most of the strengths could also be weaknesses, and vice versa, depending on perspective. Is it a strength or a weakness that 480 assumed little background knowledge even as a senior math course? Or that engagement with other students' topics was largely optional, since there were no tests or assignments on the material? Or that we didn't have to \/ get to choose our own topics, since they were laid out as part of a larger schedule for the class?\r\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised by my experience and I think I took a lot out of it. Professor O'Neill in particular was fantastic. But if I was to suggest changes, I think the class would work better with even more sections. I'm pretty sure ours was the smaller of the two, and even then it felt like too long of a wait between any given person's talks. With something like 3 or 4 sections, each focusing on its own topic, people could choose the one that interested them, and the class could assume more prereq knowledge and form a tighter-knit group. I find it hard to believe the department couldn't find 4 lecturers a semester to spend some time with the graduating seniors. Maybe it's even an idea to send out a survey at the end of each academic year so that rising seniors could vote on the topics for the next year's seminars?\r\n'"
