            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Bush was a great and incredibly knowledgable professor who makes the seminar worth it by herself. She explains complicated concepts super well, and makes the seminar actively fun to attend by fostering a spirited but polite debate. The course also benefits from some guest appearances from experts which keep things interesting, as well as readings that were not overly long but actually were quite informative. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the 8 two page response papers across the semester is quite a fair amount of writing, and reducing this number just a little (or making more, but 1 page responses) would reduce the headache that this class can occasionally cause on Monday afternoon.",
                "Strengths: great readings, great discussions, mix of podcasts and movies, interactive worksheets in class\r\nWeakness: would like to hear more about democracy promotion through an imperialist lens (i.e., how has the US' democracy promotion efforts worsened its credibility and continued its imperialist patterns that devastate nations in the global South?)",
                "This course is called democracy promotion and its critics but its light on the critics part. Its mostly about democracy promotion with some critique of the efficacy of the strategies, but not a lot of discussion about the validity of democracy promotion as a whole. Democracy = good was an underlying assumption for most of the course, so the critique of democracy promotion was more surface level. Heavy on the western supremacy a lot of times. However it was still a good class and I learned a lot.",
                "Great discussion, learned a lot.",
                "It is a really interesting course, and the professor does a great job of building a good atmosphere for discussion. The course has a lot of technical work, sometimes harder to follow, but mostly a learning experience. I would not at all recommend reducing reading complexity, but just be prepared to be a little unfamiliar with methodology. Additionally, the course does not do as much historical construction, so having some familiarity with foreign policy in the later 20th century would be a really nice background to have for the course, but is not necessary.",
                "I think the course was very well structured, had a well-selected set of readings, and made for pretty interesting discussions. Like many GLBL and PLSC seminars, the topic was quite niche and specific, so at times (especially towards the end of the course) I felt like I wasn't learning a lot of new material, but I do feel like we dove deep into the subject area.",
                "Strengths - approachable professor, engaging classroom environment, interesting guest lectures\r\nWeaknesses - dense reading material, should not be a PLSC 100 level class, weekly assignments expected",
                "Professor Bush is a wonderful teacher. She is not only extremely sharp and engaging, but also exceptionally kind and generous with her time and advice outside of class. Seminars were always well-managed and interesting, and she really ably led all the sections so that we could not only cover key concepts in our readings, but also discuss the questions and tensions that emerged from the work.\r\n\r\nI am a little torn on the 'weakness' of the class, which for me is that the content was a little different from what I expected it to be. I was primarily interested in the \"and its critics\" part of democracy promotion. While there were certainly acknowledgments that democracy promotion had its problems, most of the classes took the view that democracy promotion is good, but that it is superceded or undermined by other American interests. While true, I was hoping for a more substantive engagement with the issues of imposing democracy itself, and what it assumes/does not assume about a given country. Instead, the class seemed to accept the premises about the virtues of democracy instead of engaging as deeply with the topic as I had hoped. I was interested in talking about the imperialist/neo-colonial associations of democracy promotion, but there wasn't a lot of literature that engaged with this. The only article that, for me, substantively addressed the pitfalls of a universalist vision of democracy and of progress was discussed in class as an argument for 'cultural relativism', which I personally felt missed the point dramatically. But this is like comparing a great apple to a great orange. I still enjoyed the class for what it was, which is a survey into the history of democracy promotion in the west, and some of the most prominent strategies being discussed in Washington policy circles. It was just a different approach from what I expected, with American foreign policy/interests at the very center.",
                "Professor Bush fostered a positive, open, and collaborative class environment that allowed for great class discussion.",
                "I really liked how the bulk of the coursework was based on reading responses, because I found that it really helped keep me accountable for engaging with the material"

                "If you are interested at all in U.S. foreign policy, this is a great course to take. It gives you a really interesting lens through which to view the past half-century of U.S. engagement with the world, and added a lot to my understanding. One doesn't have to even like the idea of Democracy promotion to love this class its not ideological in the slightest, but a nuanced exploration of a topic. Professor Bush is also a fantastic person and professor, so taking the course is worth it for that alone. \r\n\r\nDefinitely take it if you are remotely interested in the topic.",
                "Yes!! I loved learning more about democracy promotion considering my own knowledge on the topic isn't as comprehensive as Professor Bush's. It was interesting to hear about the successes of democracy promotion when I have typically viewed the concept in a negative light. The readings touched a wide variety of topics: conditionality, gender, election observers, etc. This was a really good class to learn about the basics of democracy promotion and learn more about how democracy is shifting around the world throughout history and today.",
                "If you want to learn about democracy promotion through the lens of imperialism and colonialism, this is not the right class. If youre just interested in democracy promotion and its mechanisms, definitely take this class. There are weekly response papers which can be a little tedious, but not too bad.",
                "Yes, it was very interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the material, skeptical or a major advocate. We had a lot of perspectives in the class, which was really great. The professor is also excellent, and a really creative researcher in her own right, which makes for very interesting discussion.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It's a nice global/polisci seminar, and it covers a subject area I had never learned about before. Prof. Bush is also wonderful, and she does a great job of leading interesting discussions. The workload is also very manageable.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are interested in global affairs/international relations. Professor Bush is great, but be wary of the kind of kid a class like this attracts. It was one of the more polarized classes Ive been in, and coupled with being kind of over my head, I often felt a bit out of my league.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, if they are interested in analyzing democracy promotion as a policy/strategic issue. It's a wonderful, wonderful class to get a grounding on 1) how to define democracy promotion and 2) how democracy is actually practiced and managed alongside other geostrategic priorities. In my opinion there isn't a lot of theoretical engagement with 1) why democracy and 2) the ethics of promotion, 3) the pitfalls of US-led or US-centric views of democracy, but I got the sense that Professor Bush felt that dwelling on these questions might muddy discussions of its specific practices and case studies. Overall, it struck me as a sort of practitioners' course (for DC policy hacks and would-be politicians), which I did still enjoy, but I don't think it's for everyone. For me it was worth it just to take a class with Professor Bush.\r\n'",
                "Absolutely!",
