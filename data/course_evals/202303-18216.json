                "This course provides an overview of the methods to model and control robots in a computer simulation, a skill which is needed in order to program complex robotic systems. It's extremely math-heavy, going into the details of control theory.",

From the problem sets, I now have working code for a number of these things. However, I'm not sure I'd say I actually understand it well, because most of the code was either given to us or just a very simple fill-in-the-blank.",

                "This course covers a massive amount of content that is foundational to modern robotics in a clear and effective manner. Despite moving quickly, the workload remained reasonable save for two or three points in the semester.",
                "We relied upon Professor Abraham's notes, as there was no textbook for the course. When I found his notes confusing, there were not many other places to turn for help. More office hours would have been helpful. Since each of the assignments were a coding problem, most time at office hours was spent troubleshooting code rather than increasing my understanding of the subject.",
                "Strengths: The topics were interesting, the course notes were solid, and I liked the midterm and final projects.\r\nWeaknesses: I thought this class tried to cover too much content, and I was left not deeply understanding much of it. The lectures were very math-heavy. I was able to follow the individual steps, but I would get lost in the weeds and lose track of the big picture, and I'm not sure I'd be able to apply much of the math. When we had to apply things on the problem sets, there was so much guidance in the comments that I could complete the assignments without actually understanding the content. From talking to other students, I know many people had similar experiences with the class."

You will gain a strong background in modeling and simulation through this class, and if you continue to study robotics, you will reference the lecture notes from this class for years to come. However, only take this course if you have solid experience in Python and a background in (or willingness to try out) abstract math.",

On the other hand, I don't feel that I left the class with a deep understanding of the material. We covered so much that we had to rush through it, so the lectures moved quickly through very complicated math, and the problem sets did a lot of the work for us. I think the class would have been better if we'd covered less but did it more thoroughly.",
                "This course should not be taken as an introduction to robotics. There is a lot of information here and it comes at you fast so be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to this course.",

                "Highly recommend! This is a great crash course in robot modelling and control. If you're interested in these subjects, this course covers the must-know material."
