            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Homeworks are organized for student learning and engagement, I think they were an appropriate difficulty.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes we would cover new things and they were not explained well, but I understand that it's hard to go over every single function or line of code when we're trying to learn a new language from scratch.",
                "Strength: breadth of topics covered in the course\r\nWeakness: professor doesn't go into that much detail on the topics covered; there is a gap between what is taught in the lecture and what he covers in the exam.",
                "Strengths: the class notes and homework were really helpful (alongside the solutions for them that were posted as well)\r\nWeaknesses: perhaps delving a little deeper into the why\/how of the methods used would further enhance understanding",
                "Strengths - helpful homework assignments, pretty clear lectures, good familiarity with the R language. \r\n\r\nweaknesses - lectures were often dry, and it was unclear how to study for the exams. It didn't seem like a class that lent itself well to exams.",
                "The course was very well organized and flowed well from topic to topic. The statistics lectures and R-focused lectures were balanced well and contributed to a more well-rounded understanding, but perhaps less background statistics could be covered to make way for more R-based topics.",
                "Strengths: Super well-organized. Prof Meyers really knew his stuff, especially the statistical concepts, and did a really good job answering questions. His slides were very well-suited to have students understand the concepts well, and he explained things well. I felt like I got a lot out of the class.\r\nWeaknesses: ambiguity in some exam questions and homework questions. also, typos in pset assignments and many other class materials. Also, when you asked questions to the TAs, they would often just nod along and say \"yeah, that seems correct\" even when it in fact turned out to not be correct, or there was a better way to accomplish the same task.",
                "Strengths: the class covers a lot of ground and touches on lots of methods of analyzing and visualizing data. The PSETs also really help with learning R and learning how to code effectively. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there isn't enough of an emphasis on the theory that we're taught in lecture on the PSETs, this makes it really hard to study for the exams which are notoriously hard. There's also an emphasis on hand-writing code which I don't think was particularly helpful and I think a better way to demonstrate our knowledge of statistical concepts and coding would have been to make the final project worth a lot more and minimize the emphasis on exams since in the real world the type of work we were doing on the project is more of what would happen.",
                "This course was amazing pretty much from top-to-bottom. The lectures were informative and engaging. The skills we learned were important and interesting. The homeworks were thoughtfully planned such that they were a great learning tool, not just regurgitation. One weakness is that the exams often didn't reflect what we did on homeworks. We could use some homework with practice exam-type questions or tying in more directly.",
                "The strength is that homework is very well-designed.  The weakness is that can spend more time on statistics theory because sometimes I am really confused about why certain formulas are given.",
                "The lectures were a little slow and there was some content that was put in for the final project that didn't necessarily need entire lectures. However, the rest of the topics were explained relatively well and the problem sets helped to reinforce confusing topics.",
                "Course teaches computer sections very well, could use more in depth reviews on statistical concepts. Could also use a key concepts chart that summarizes in depth topics in a few key sentences.",
                "Strengths are how well organized it is and the pacing. Weakness is the exam formats and time consuming ness of the HWs and projects. The exams are incredibly stressful and it feels like all the questions are designed to intentionally trip up students. Poor format and handwriting code is awful.",
                "Weaknesses: The course was taught in a dull and unengaging way. The pests were long, and the class explanation was insufficient. The TAs were pretty bad and helpful most of the time.\r\n\r\nstrengths: a lot of new information about statistics",
                "Strengths: In-life applications using R through weekly problem sets",
                "The scope of the course was pretty wide, so maybe a bit more time on each topic. Otherwise I enjoyed the course a lot.",
                "- Synthesizing theory with practice",
                "I think its a lot of memorizing code, so if you want a coding class with a statistic perspective take this.   I wish there was more emphasis on statistical concepts because thats what the final was all about.",
                "The TA office hours were helpful, but often times the exams dont reflect the homeworks as much",
                "The strengths are the balance between R and understanding statistics concepts. The main weakness was the method of assessment--a huge part of coding and learning to code is trial and error--running a code, seeing that something is off, and attempting to figure out what's wrong and fixing it.  I think assessing our coding skills on paper is not an accurate gauge of what we've learned in the class.",
                "The course does a nice job of balancing between statistics concepts and practical programming. The homework are well designed and help to reinforce learning, and the final project helps to bring all the concepts from the course together in a practical situation. Class lectures are engaging. My only critique is that a few of the statistics topics were rushed at the end.",
                "Strengths: Psets were interesting and followed lecture notes so Psets were easy enough to figure out. Weaknesses: lectures felt pretty impersonal, but I don't think that's the prof's fault.",
                "The class lectures and homework were often a very different style than the exams.",

Each lesson compounded on the previous and helped shape a student to be well rounded in the basics and some intermediate levels of coding and data manipulation. Personally, the material took a long time to understand and replicate on an exam. In particular, the midterm could have gone much better if more time was allowed to complete it. Would recommend extending the time for completing the midterm in the future.",
                "Better scaffolding for graduate students",
                "strength: direct application to data I collected in the lab \r\nweakness: could spend a little more time on things like PCA or other higher level of statistics - it would be great to learn systematically how to interpret those graphs",
                "Ethan meyers is a great professor, you can tell how he is much more focused on students learning and not just the grades. The course is well organized and the information is interesting. It gets a little boring towards the end (when working on regressions and such but its not bad). The weakness for me would be that we spent a little too long on statistical concepts and the exams and the psets were pretty different, but again, very manageable",
                "I think the PSETs were good at facilitating learning.\r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved if the professor spent more time on the math sections of the course, like calculating and using various statistics.  I felt a lack of guidance and support in relation to the final project.",
                "Great instructor, classes, assignments are great!",

                "I think the description should be clearer on which students would benefit from it. I dont think I would have taken the course knowing now that I likely wont apply it during my PhD",
                "The pace of the course is way too fast, and there is a lot of ground covered. It felt like a brief overview of a lot of things, and often the concepts underlying the hard coding we did in RMarkdown were not explained well. That being said, I had never used R before and I feel like I got a really good introduction to it",
                ".",
                "Strengths: Good professor\r\nWeaknesses: too much homework",
                "The material isn't super exciting or engaging. But the class is taught very well and is very practical",
                "I really liked how this course was organized. As someone with no R background and a little statistical background, it was really helpful to review some of the intro stats methods\/ideas while I was first learning to use R, and then learning more complex statistical methods as I got more comfortable with R. Also, Ethan is a really engaging lecturer and he made the classes enjoyable.",
                "The course is very well-organized. The quality of the lecture material and homework are perfect.",
                "A strength of the course is that the professor seems to understand its purpose. What I mean by this is that the course was not made unnecessarily difficult by, for example, making you memorize formulas, understand the mathematical theory behind different statistical methods, or forcing you to figure out how to program things in R yourself. On the other hand, the course was not so easy as to give you no real useful knowledge. The assignments still took a fair bit of time, and the exams did require you to genuinely understand concepts from lectures. As such, I think the course is very fair and balanced, and there isn't a whole lot that needs improving in this respect. I think it could have been nice to go more deeply into certain topics, and maybe spend a bit less time doing live coding in R, especially after the first few weeks had passed and everyone had generally gotten used to doing it, but I can also appreciate the necessity of doing so, given that the course assumes no prior coding knowledge (which I had going in). Other than that, I have no real suggestions for how the course could be improved."

A basic understanding of statistics and how to implement these measures on real-world data (ie: work in R) is very important for any academically focused person in the 21st century.",
                "Yes! Super useful. I had heard it was quite easy coming in, but it turned out to be much less easy than I expected. It was awesome though! Coming into the class, I thought I would probably not use R again that much if ever in the future (since Python is more commonly used in science, it seems), but now I feel like I might actually use R in the future sometimes for data visualizations.

                "I would recommend this course to students who wish to foster statistics skills further than intro stats",
                "Yes, but its definitely best taken after another introductory statistics class.",
                "Yes! A great introduction to statistics, an amazing spread of resources, helpful ULAS, TAs, and office hours. Homework was challenging without being mentally unbearable. Final exam was rough however.",
                "Not sure. If you are really good at learning on your own then yes, because its very self instructed. Problem sets were fun.",
                "not really",
                "Take S&DS 230 in the spring with JDRS instead",
                "Yes, if you need it",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a good way to learn coding side by side statistics.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about a variety of basic tools and programming techniques for exploring, analyzing, and presenting data.",
                "If you want a refresher of AP Stats and learn some cool stuff in R, go ahead! If you don't want to do a lot of coding, maybe not. I came in expecting much more statistical theory, but I stayed for the R.",
                "If you're not looking for too much math and want to learn statistics, could be good. If you want a greater in depth knowledge, probably take a more mathematical class like 241\/242.",
                "Yes. Gives you practical tools applicable in many diverse fields",
                "This is a great course for a student that doesn't have too much of a load from other courses. This class required the majority of my time.",
                "For undergrads but not grad students",
                "yes \r\ngreat course of intro statistics!",
                "Yes! It was very interesting and I learned a lot of R in the class. If you are an Econ major, I recommend this as one of the statistics class to take on top of econometrics to fulfill prerequisites for higher level classes. Some of the regression material was reminiscent of Econ 117, but just a bit",
                "yes",
                "Yes. I think it's a beneficial course. It deepens your understanding of statistics, and I think hypothesis testing is a really powerful tool.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn statistics in R",
                "Yes, I learned practical skills.",
                "Yes, the Professor is very clear when explaining and the skillset gained for learning information from data is very valuable.",
                "I would not recommend this course to other PhD students. Combined with work in the lab and other commitments (classes, teaching, etc.), this course's workload is NOT suited for PhD students. Personally, I believe the majority of principles taught cannot be applied to analyze the data I will likely accumulate during my PhD in molecular biology\/genetics.",
                "Yes",
                "Maybe. Depends on if they want to take it",
                "Yes because it really teaches you to code in R which is very valuable skill in professional life",
                "Yes, it is really insightful and builds knowledge in both statistics and R.",
                "YES! This course was both extremely useful and fun! I actually enjoyed going to class despite it being a 9am lecture because Ethan is such an engaging lecturer, and he explains things in a really clear and intuitive way. As someone with no R background and a little statistical background, I thought that the class was organized in a way that really facilitated my learning in both, and I definitely came out of the class with useful skills that I will bring into my research. If you think that learning statistics or R would be useful, this class is an enjoyable way to do that.",
                "Strongly recommend. This course really teaches us things!",
                "Yes, as I think some knowledge of statistics is useful to have, especially if you know how to apply that knowledge by running your own tests and writing up your own reports, which this class does teach you a bit of. The workload of this class is also quite low (a consistent 4-5 hours per week for the assignments in my experience), making it a good addition to a workload-heavy schedule."
