                "The strength of this course was its consistent use of the textbook. This helped facilitate better learning. The weakness was that lecture did not always match the intensity of problem type that was seen on the exams.",
                "Course moved very fast, exams are brutal.",
                "I severely struggled with comprehending the curriculum, and the speed at which I would comprehend the material added struggle to my overall performance in the course. However, through the struggle I feel like I learned a great deal more.",
                "Great course overall but heavily dependent on teaching style. There's a lack of standardization.",
                "strengths are a well organized umbrella canvas site with very helpful \"explores\" that introduce the material and give students a chance to start to understand the material before class. Also lots of peer tutor office hours and availability to work with students. I wish there had been more interaction in the classroom, both with the professor and with other students (like working in groups on problems).",
                "Strengths - I enjoyed the explorations and concept checks, even if they were a little tedious at times. The problem sets were 11 problems each week, not too much and not too little. Weaknesses - I did not enjoy the Calculus Story module included in the course, as it was not applicable to me as someone who was taking this class for the QR credit and do not expect to go into STEM.",
                "I think there are certain concepts that could be easily taught, such as Simpson's Rule and the Root Test, that could be taught. Focusing on shells and Riemann sums at this level seem pointless.",
                "The professor was great at explaining the materials and the psets really helped solidify my understanding. However, the quizzes before class sometimes left me really confused. It might be better to have a post class quiz instead.",
                "From what I've heard and experienced through speaking to students in other classes, the experience for Math 115 varies extremely widely depending on section. I think that disparity might be improved by streamlining curriculum and teaching methods between TAs.",
                "Though it was a challenging calculus course that I did learn a lot in, this course was not very engaging. It had no connection to anything outside the classrooms, and felt very \"high-school\". I think it would have been helpful to have the teaching broken from just the instructor speaking in front of the black board each day to maybe doing an activity\/group work\/discussion etc!"

This course, however, did not facilitate learning in the same way. I think part of the issue was that, being taught by a graduate student, there was a lack of connection with the professor. A huge part of my positive experience with a similar version of this content was the fact that the instructor was more engaging and also encouraged more group work\/learning from peers versus always lecturing.",
