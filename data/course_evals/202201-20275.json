It is possible to not pay attention in class and still do fine by just looking over the posted class codes because it seems Professor Mak is just looking at prewritten code and copying it down anyways. I really wish this course was updated and switched to python, something much more applicable (MATLAB seems to mostly be used in bio labs) in general.",

                "The course was very well organized, but I wish there were more office hours available.",
                "The material after the midterm was significantly harder than before the midterm. I think midterm one should be earlier and that material can be taught quicker. The units after the midterm should be given more time.",

                "Strengths: TFs and peer tutor, pretty reasonable pset difficulty level, practice exams that are exactly like the midterm/final\r\nWeaknesses: The course escalated in difficulty that felt exponential (second half of course felt way more difficult than first). Generally dry lectures, didnt seem like live-coding was the most efficient way of teaching",
                "I liked how the course was structured. The material was easy to follow and lead from one subject to the next for the most part, so we were always building on older material. The one thing I would say could be improved was the amount of biomedical applications as it felt like we only began to cover them more in-depth at the end of class.",

                "The course lecture was kind of dull with not much to be excited about. It was easier to find myself more interested in getting the homework than sitting through the lecture. This is sort of the natural state of computing courses but it didn't help that nothing was done to make it more interesting. Despite the class being boring, it is informational.",
                "Strengths: TAs were strong (Luke you were the best thanks so much for the help). Mak was super flexible and listened to feedback (added more exercises, posted lecture slides and other things when students would ask)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were dry/slow so hard to pay attention. Definitely better in person than online. Not a lot of practice or resources outside lecture slides which were kind of hard to understand",

Coming from someone with basically no coding experience, there is definitely a steep learning curve, but it is manageable if you go to office hours and work on PSETs with friends. Mak is a little monotonous as a lecturer, but the course is very organized and well-structured. TAs and peer tutors were very helpful. Exams are very fair and practice material is super helpful.",
                "I think adding an additional TA session would be very helpful.",
