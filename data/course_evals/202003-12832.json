I also got a basic understanding of a lot of the science behind climate change, which is often misunderstood.",
                "I learned about different climate processes, especially those that relate to climate change (e.g. ocean acidification, hurricanes, wildfires). I learned how to break down complex scholarly papers to learn what the main arguments, motivation, and conclusions of the study were.",
                "I learned about the various aspects of climate change, starting with hurricanes and the role of oceans in tackling global warming and ending with climate change communication and geoengineering, and got an amazing introduction to Earth & Planetary studies. I also significantly improved my scientific writing and reading skills.",
                "I learned about various mechanisms of climate change and climate uncertainty - a broad survey of global climate modeling, paleoclimatology, warming and cooling mechanisms, earth systems, ocean acidification and the carbon cycle, geoengineering, and more. I also learned basic methods of writing and researching a literature review-based scientific paper.",
                "Introductory yet rigorous knowledge of the science of climate change, ranging from its physical science basis to its impacts on the Earth system (wildfires, ice, storms, etc.). Occasional threads into some of the scientific policy of mitigating and managing climate change. How to really read and summarize research papers related to climate change in a wide variety of subfields of study. An introduction on how to communicate climate change science (especially via writing) and research to non-experts and the general public.",

                "Fantastic class covering the science of climate change - we learned the earth and human processes that drive it, the many sources of evidence (which are all very exciting!), ways of understanding feedback cycles and uncertainties in the data\/predictions, and the ways the earth's climate has evolved through millions of years. I learned how to carefully defend this science, and how to understand the nuances of why climate science is confusing. Fantastic class for both a big-picture and nuanced understanding, and helpful for folks from any kind of humanities or STEM background alike.",
                "This course gave me a pretty broad overview of many of the mechanisms and consequences of climate change. We spent each week on a different subject, including fires, sea-level rise, coral reefs, etc. I would also say that this course really taught me how to read peer-reviewed research articles and actually understand much of the content, even if it was an unfamiliar subject. This is the first course I've had with a research paper (two, actually) and it helped me feel a lot more comfortable using literature to write my own papers.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Two instructors. Noah and Professor Timmermans are both extremely interesting, and because they come from very different sides of the climate science spectrum, their insights were extremely complementary while also being quite different. The partnered weekly writing assignments were also really great because if you were unsure about a specific topic or paper you could discuss it with someone or they could take the lead on that part of the assignment while you focused on other parts, and it was really great to work together on something. Also, we had to come up with questions based off the readings for a weekly discussion and it was extremely engaging and often helped clarify the reading and climate ideas very organically, as well as providing ideas for paper topics. Overall, though, the grounding in climate science was extremely good.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it felt like you had to have more of a background in climate science and Earth dynamics than everyone actually had, and it could be really confusing when there wasn't clarification. I also felt like some of the material was rushed. Also, trying to have discussions over Zoom was kind of weird and sometimes challenging and awkward, but if the class was held in person I'm sure that problem would go away.",
                "Strengths: good structure of the class, great professors, interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: topics were sometimes difficult to understand, even though this is supposed to be an intro class\r\n\r\nThis class has a good formateverything is centered around the readings for that week. During one class, a professor lectures on the topic the reading covers, and during the next class, you all discuss the reading. I enjoyed this format because it allowed us to learn from the professors and from each other! However, some topics were not as engaging compared to others, so the discussion\/lecture wasn't as exciting.",
                "The main strength of the course is the introduction of students to the main aspects of climate change, without going too deep into any of them. The class provides a strong general understanding of climatology as a whole. Texts were diverse, new, and often challenged conventional ideas on the subject. I also enjoyed a balanced mix of lecture- and discussion-based formats, as well as the speakers professors invited to our class. The course is also heavily science-based, which was a plus for me. The idea of assigning partners for small weekly assignments was not very productive because we ended up just dividing work in two with little interaction with each other. At the same time, it did not impede any progress with the assignment. I feel cooperation on bigger assignments might be more fruitful. Overall, the course was very thought-out, and there is little room for improvement.",
                "Strengths: One of the strengths of this course was the group weekly assignments and the seminar's small size. I really enjoyed getting to know my classmates through these assignments and collaborating during the virtual semester. Mary-Louise and Noah are the other great strengths of this class. They are really passionate, wonderful instructors who value student learning and student perspectives and are so open to answering questions and being mentors in the sciences. The weekly assignments and reading helped me internalize a lot of the differing concepts we learned. Additionally, the opportunity to regularly speak with and hear from scientists who are at the cutting edge in their respective fields was amazing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very few! I just wish that the syllabus was a little bit more detailed about the topics we would cover in advance, and since there was lots of consistent writing, I do think a writing credit may have been warranted for the course as well.",
                "Strengths: ample discussion, good presentation from the co-instructors, assignments were the right balance of learning, work, and rigor\r\nWeaknesses: no major weaknesses, though some concepts presented in the lecture part of class could have received better explanation and more attention",
                "The strengths of this class are providing insight into how climate change is impacting our world, and the TF. Sophie Westacott absolutely made this class and it would have been almost unbearable without her.",
                "Love that the weekly assignments were partner assignments",
                "Strengths: the seminar consisted of a self-selected group of students who really wanted to learn about climate change. There was a good mix of students from various majors. The readings were also mostly helpful and relevant to our weekly topics. The TA (Sophie) was also really nice.\r\nWeaknesses: I would've really preferred it if this course were a lecure instead of a seminar. Being an intro class, and since discussion questions weren't provided in advance, I was often completely unsure of how to approach the discussion questions, which often had little to do with the factual information presented in the readings. Whereas students who had taken a few EPS courses (there were even upperclassmen within the major) felt more confident, I felt discouraged from participating in discussions. I'd also rather walk away from a lecture feeling I have a systematic understanding of how the climate works than participate in a seminar that gives me bits and pieces of information. The weekly writing assignments plus the two 10-page 1.5-line-spacing papers were also excessive: the course requires more writing than many writing-credit courses. I wished the course actually provided space for improving scientific writing (e.g. submit incremental drafts for one long paper instead of two) instead of purely emphasizing quantity. I also hope the slides can be uploaded to Canvas after each class and the discussion questions can be provided to students ahead of time.",
                "The class was excellent! Mini-lectures were electrifying; Noah and Mary-louise are great at explaining key, complex ideas and getting folks from different backgrounds excited. Each week explores a different topic; the material was challenging but engaging. Lectures\/assignments were fun and really helped synthesize the material and scientific uncertainties; I left the class with an ability to explain climate science to a broad audience and define its shortcomings and promise. Also, lots of the science we learned was astonishingfrom the complex feedback loops to how temperature impacts the impact of CO2 itself. I loved the ability to explore different ideas in our term papers too. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- very little, honestly!! professors were great; their sunny, fun dispositions made this class a joy despite COVID. We went on tangents, but I truly felt these were fruitful and followed the interests of the students. There were maybe 1-2 students that slacked off in the weekly projects\/ I had to pull extra weight, but it was fine because we rotatated away. You never work with the same person 2x.",
                "I really enjoyed having ML and Noah teach together, as they both come from different areas of research within EPS and provided different perspectives on things. Also, I enjoyed the one-topic-a-week structure as it allowed us to learn a lot over the course of the semester, even if some lectures had to be rushed to fit everything in. Also, we had a guest speaker nearly every week which was very valuable.\r\n\r\nAs for improvements, I think that some of the more in-depth science portions of the lectures felt unnecessary and just confusing. I don't really think that going over a specific series of chemical reactions really helped my understanding of ocean acidification, for example, and felt like it would better be left for a more specific course rather than an overview of climate change.",

It was easy to stay engaged; the varied topics kept us on our feet, and I felt like there was a little community because of the paired-up assignments. Sophie, our TA, was always available and added to the great experience of the class, she was able to tell whenever students were confused, and she piped up in the chat with additional explanations. Her detailed notes on our homework made us feel like she was right there with us; I'm insanely grateful for her dedication during such a challenging semester. This was one of the best classes, hands down, that I've experienced during COVID.",

Whether you're interested in EPS or you're looking for good science credit, it's literally not possible to be a citizen of the world without having a good background in climate science and climate change. The instructors are super personable and genuinely care about any questions or concerns you have, and this course has really helped me solidify my understandings while also exposing me to a lot of the uncertainty that is actually out there about climate change and ways to adapt or mitigate it.",

However, this course doesn't cover the societal aspect of climate change (policies, effects on people, environmental injustice, etc.). I would've liked for this class to discuss more about these aspects. The workload is manageablereadings aren't too long and response papers (while annoying) are fairly easy, especially because you work with a partner. The midterm and final papers are definitely stressful, considering this is an intro class. The professors are very chill and kind, which is what made class enjoyable.",

Whether you are interested in majoring in earth and planetary sciences or a non-major, this course is a wonderful introduction to the field in a small, seminar-like format. There were so many unforgettable experiences we shared this semester. Being over Zoom, we were able to hear from Hurricane Hunters directly, talk to the primary authors of major headline-driving climate science studies, and speak with Ph.D. candidates who are in the field conducting research. Mary-Louise and Noah are amazing professors and people, and are great mentors and advisors. For someone like me who had very little experience writing scientific papers, they were really helpful in getting me to narrow down my topic of interest.",
                "Absolutely. Unfortunately this class was a limited enrollment seminar, but everyone who can take this class should. While those focused more on policy and the humanities might find the class too scientific and technical (in which case, look elsewhere), those interested in learning about climate change in its interdisciplinary scientific nature will love this class. Intersecting with some geology, biology, chemistry, and physics, climate change is the perfect way to integrate multiple fields of scientific study with an all-too urgent and consequential global issue. You will also learn a lot about how various types of climate change research is done, how to read research papers, and how to communicate scientific and technical findings and knowledge with the general public. It's an all-around really good class.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they were really interested in learning about climate change from a scientific perspective. Do not go into this course expecting to learn about it from a policy perspective because you will be disappointed. Other than that, the professors really tried to make this course interesting and it was clear that they had a passion of the subject. This class just wasn't the right fit for me.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to every student. It was a challenging but not at all overwhelming science credit that helped me think critically about climate change. Both of the professors are so engaged and give clear and exciting lectures. Loved this class",
                "Yes, absolutely! This class is worth every minute; and there might not be another class at Yale that you remember more! The material is so important, and it is brought to life in an exciting way. The professors encourage you to ask questions, and this opens up so many new avenues of explorration As a STEM major I loved this class and learned something new in each lecture\/paper.",
                "Yes! I think during a non-virtual semester, this class would be a lot better, but I still learned so much about climate change and also just research papers in general, so I think it's a great course for both STEM and non-STEM students alike. The workload is relatively light (just a single 1-2 page paper a week with a partner and two longer research papers throughout the semester) and the topics are really engaging and also incredibly important for every student to know.",
                "YES!! If you're interested in climate change and want to learn about the science of climate change, this is the class for you! You don't need much of a science background, this class is made for people who are in humanities. But you learn a lot. You learn to read scientific papers, think critically about the science of climate change and how to write about complex scientific topics for the general reader.
