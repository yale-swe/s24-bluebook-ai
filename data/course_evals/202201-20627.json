The class is exclusively focused on machine learning techniques for use on text data. There was also a portion of the class on webscraping, and twitter scraping, which we also learned a bit about. I also learned a good amount about R, the statistical language used. I would now feel confident scraping data from a website, using supervised or unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze it, and interpreting results. I don't have a great understanding of the underlying mathematics of the techniques, although they were covered in class and that may be more on me.",
                "I learned some text based supervised and unsupervised machine learning skills such as creating topic models based on the words used in political campaign ads or political speeches, as well as twitter data scraping and analysis. Developed more R skills.",

            "comments": [
                "I really like that there is a machine learning class that is taught in R - this makes machine learning more accessible to those of us who study S&DS instead of CS and are familiar with the language. I also really like that this class encourages small groups to work together on psets and the final project - this makes it a lot easier to move forward when stuck and also helps to have multiple perspectives on a topic given people from different departments take this course. Finally, I liked that the psets required taking the code we saw in class and adapting it to fit the pset's needs to make sure we understood what the code was doing. From a coding perspective, I feel like I learned a lot. From a conceptual perspective, though, I struggled to fully internalize what we went over in the slides because the math and statistics background required was much above my level.",
                "The strengths of the course is that you learn a lot about the subject matter, and the problem sets are accessible and teach you a lot about what you're doing. At times lecture was difficult to understand, in part because it was often focused on the mathematics and underlying theory, but this makes sense as the class is somewhat geared towards graduate and Phd students.",
                "Strengths: The homeworks are fairly straightforward if you work in a group and go to office hours for help, and they give you the opportunity to put into practice the things you go through in class. The open ended final project is good too! The skills feel fairly transferrable that you can basically do anything you're interested in for the final project using the coding tools/functions you learn in class. The last time this class was run the course evaluations said the professor took a long time to release the homeworks; I'd definitely say he has improved as most of the homeworks were released on time and we had two weeks to complete them.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures can be very theoretical, especially if you do not have much background in probability. Sometimes there is a lot of theory in lecture and not much time in class to go through the class code. It might be helpful to allocate more time to go through code in class. However, if you don't get all of it you can go to office hours and the theory isn't examined so that does reduce stress! Additionally, having a two hour continuous lecture/class at 9.25am can be a little tiring. It might be helpful to build in a five minute break in the middle for going to the bathroom etc. to maintain focus! Also, it can be intimidating to be an undergrad in a class with a lot of grad students who know what they're doing. Try and make friends with the undergrads in the class or take the class with a friend!",
                "I thought the topics we covered were really interesting and useful, but I definitely would have appreciated going through more coding examples in class. Especially because there were no TAs or ULAs for this course, a lot of the coding was done by working through it at home which was fine but I think going through some more real-life examples (how you go from start to finish) would have helped. I often felt a little lost in class (might be because I don't have a super strong probability background) and the speed that we went through pre-written code was a little too fast for me. John was very helpful and approachable, but overall I felt like the 2-hr class time was a little dense and I struggled to relate some of the content to real-life examples until I worked through it on a problem set. Breaking the 2 hours into a twice a week class probably would have helped with focus and generally time to process.",
                "Strengths: office hours are INCREDIBLY helpful, go to them!!!",
                "Strength: the lectures were clear and helped clarify some of the more difficult assigned readings, the homework assignments were very useful. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The primary focus on text analysis."

                "If you are familiar with R and seeking to use it for machine learning, this is a good place to start. It's less intimidating than other ML classes and has a fair workload that is balanced across a group for the psets. I learned a lot about coding, but I'm not sure I learned as much of the theory of ML, not because it wasn't presented but because I really struggled with the math and statistics - a warning that this may still be too advanced from a conceptual standpoint, even if you technically meet the prerecs.",
                "If the student is interested in doing and learning about textual analysis, particularly of political text, then this class would be a great way to learn. If you are also generally interested in quantitative methods for political science then this is also a useful and interesting class where I learned about ideas and techniques not covered elsewhere. The workload is manageable, Professor Henderson is kind, and the material can be very useful.",
                "I'd recommend this if you're looking for a way to pick up some R skills for machine learning specifically related to some form of political text (e.g. speeches, tweets, ads). If you don't have much coding or probability background, definitely shop the class first and try take it with a friend as the material can be very daunting to handle by yourself, especially because the class was mostly grad students. However, even though the material can be challenging, the grading is very fairpassing the class is doable if you're willing to put in the time or have a group of friends to collaborate on the homeworks and projects with.",
                "Yes! Very useful if you are interested in text as data or are new to machine learning. In general, I find the stats courses in the political science department to be set up to facilitate better learning compared to the larger lecture stem courses and this was no exception. I think I got better at coding and learned some useful techniques I will take forward into my future studies/career!",
                "If you're doing the SDS cert and this is the course you qualify for because of pre reqs and such, I'd say this is a good course to have to take for the SDS. Not very applicable because it is directed towards PhD PoliSci students, but some of the stuff we learn is pretty cool. The Psets are scary but just review the class code and go to office hours and find a group of friends in class to work with and you'll be totally fine. It is hard to go to a two hour seminar/lecture at 9:25 though so plan ahead for that.",
                "Yes, for any student wanting to learn about machine learning this is a useful introductory course."
