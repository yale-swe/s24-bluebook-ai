                "Strengths: Professor Cheng Li\r\nNo real weaknesses",
                "The strength is that it is a very structured and well organized class. I felt that the content was the perfect level of difficulty. I took the class with Li Laoshi and felt that he made the learning experience very engaging and exciting. The biggest weakness of the course is that I felt a lot of the homework was overly repetitive and not intellectually stimulating.",
                "Strength: High engagement and fun teachers. Weakness: There are assignments pretty much every single day, which was tedious, but they werent particularly hard (felt too much like busywork).",
                "NO WEAKNESSES. Li Laoshi is awesome. Super engaging, helpful, he makes sure you are learning and gives you the opportunity to speak alot. He wants the best for his students and really cares about our progress!!",
                "I thought the course was well structured. As a language course, it made sense to meet daily and review our textbook and discuss the lesson. The weekly discussion posts were very interesting and I learned more about Chinese culture beyond just language. I think it would have been helpful to have more of the cultural aspect incorporated and to have more class discussions.",
                "Overall, the class is amazing and fun. Cheng Li was an awesome teacher and the material was very detailed and structured. The only thing is the topics that we talked about from the textbook is are sometimes outdated and not relevant to real world situations.",
                "Strengths: amazing teacher who really cared about his students and his students' success! Super supportive.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: virtual format really is not the same.",
                "Although every online course has its pitfalls, this course was the most engaging and productive of all the courses I've taken this academic year. The mix of learning formats - lecture, discussion, grammar practice, debates, watching videos - kept the course interesting throughout the semester.",
                "I think the course is very focused on memorization at this level of Chinese and it could benefit by more breaking down of how to better understand the construction of Chinese characters.",
                "Strong teachers facilitate in-class student engagement, with is vital for language learning. I appreciated the class' well thought out structure. The minimal weaknesses, such as difficulties finding time to converse with students in the language, were due to online class."

Although it is rigorous in its workload and very fast-paced, every assignment and in-class exercise serves a purpose in bettering your understanding of the Chinese language and culture. CHNS 042 was one of the most rewarding courses I've taken.",
