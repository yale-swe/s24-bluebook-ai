                "I developed the practice of writing automatically which allows me to tap into my unconscious desires of my own playwrights voice and of my characters. I learned how much playwriting is not a linear process and the benefit of writing in a group of writers. How playwriting is truly an art to be heard not only read. I learned also to trust my characters and to not over calculate an ending."

                "This course was a really excellent production seminar that I loved attending every Monday and Wednesday. Its both a strength and a weakness that it is a production seminar, because while Deb provides excellent guidance, she ultimately is not giving you weekly assignments of write exactly this and you need to be able to hold yourself accountable in order to finish your final play. However, its totally worth it, and if you have the emotional energy to invest in writing a play during the semester you take this course, you will feel so incredibly rewarded upon your drafts completion.",
                "Strength: Debs various fill in the blank prompts, and around the circle questions prompt meaningful reflections on the human condition.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish the consumption and discussion of plays played a larger role in the class, especially toward the start of the semester. I feel like I didnt get enough on the consumption end before I needed to produce my own play."

                "Yes, 100%. If youre even the slightest bit interested in playwriting, this course is for you. Fair warning that it does take a lot of self-motivation, as there arent a lot of hard deadlines other than the midterm and final, so if you struggle with that, make sure you find a way to hold yourself accountable.",
                "100%. If you have any interest in playwriting, but dont prioritize it, Debs class will make you want to! Her practices, even if you resist them, will render the writing a part of your life and you will leave the class with a rough draft of a play. What more could you want!",
