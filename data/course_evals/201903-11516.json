   "comments": [
    "I have gone from knowing 0 things about philosophy to knowing lots of things about ancient philosophy.",
    "I think this course helped me develop as a writer for philosophy papers. It helped me learn how to write precise, clear, and concise papers. I also think that it helped me learn how to evaluate arguments authors make with greater ease.",
    "This course is helpful for developing close-reading and argumentative writing skills. It is also great for understanding foundations of Western philosophical thought, and you can really see how the ideas and thinkers studied in the course have influenced Western societies, religions, etc.",
    "I get to learn the ideas of main philosophers in Greco-Roman World, and also analyze their account in philosophical languages. Writing paper is hard, but I did learn a lot.",
    "We studied early greek philosophers, Plato\/Socrates, Aristotle, the Stoic Epictetus, Epicureans, and Empiricists.",
    "I learned how to conduct philosophical analysis and write a philosophy paper. This course offered both an in-depth look at well-known philosophical texts from Plato and Aristotle as well as a (very) brief survey of a few other ancient philosophers.",
    "Good foundation in argument reconstruction and ancient philosophical texts",
    "This was about the tenth philosophy course I've taken, including a semester-long seminar on Aristotle, but I still found this course worthwhile in two specific ways. First, Dr. Harte got into a helpful level of exegetical detail when dealing with our texts; her detailed handouts were quite valuable in this regard. Second, the clarity with which the expectations for writing were defined was very sharp. My TF (Dan Ferguson) was excellent and gave me quite detailed feedback.",
    "How to structure your thought better, so you start with some basic assumptions to reach a complex (and sometimes surprising) conclusion. Understanding of some concepts discussed by Philosophers in Ancient Greece.",
    "It helped me develop a new appreciation for philosophy.",
    "I learned about the basics of philosophy.",
    "I learned how to think in a rigorous and philosophical way through taking this class.",
    "I basically learned how to write a cohesive, well-written philosophy paper and to understand ancient philosophical texts that were very challenging for me at the beginning of the year.",
    "I definitely developed a greater understanding of Ancient Greek philosophy. I also learned how to write a philosophy paper and improved my overall ability to analyze texts and ideas.",
    "Plato, Aristotle, pre-Socratic philosophy, Stoics, Epicureanism, Skepticism...\r\nPhilosophical writing",
    "Learned valuable overview of ancient western philosophy.",
    "I solidified my knowledge of writing for philosophy + reading texts from an analytical perspective.",
    "I learned how to work out the arguments of philosophers which is useful in developing skill using logic and the such.",
    "Besides learning the major ideas of key ancient philosophers, I really feel like the strengths of this course lie in teaching us how to break apart, interpret, and respond to a written argument.",
    "Good introduction to ancient philosophy.",
    "I learned a lot about ancient philosophy and how to analyze a philosophical arguement",
    "Good Intro to Philosophy course, heavy focus on Aristotle and Plato. Philosophy does a great job teaching critical analysis, reading skills and logical writing.",
    "It gave me good background for where many common philosophical views originate",
    "This course taught various arguments and positions of Greco-Roman philosophers in the ancient world (related specifically to happiness and agency). But more importantly, it taught the skills of analyzing, objecting to, and defending these arguments.",
    "In this course, I learned how to write philosophical papers and the basics of early Greek philosophers. This class is a great introduction to Western philosophy pre-5th century.",
    "My writing skills improved",
    "The argumentative and writing skills that go with a philosophy class were taught well in this course. I learned some of the logical and philosophical ways to make, defend, and attack an argument.",
    "Learned to critically engage with ancient philosophers, and gained some writing skills by writing three essays.",
    "I learned a lot about greco-roman ancient philosophers and about how to write philosophy papers. The course allowed me to develop a new approach to thinking and writing.",
    "I felt Verity Harte did an exceptional job of showing how to think like a philosopher and the way in which to approach thinking about ancient philosophy.",
    "I developed both my knowledge of ancient philosophy and my writing skills in how to write an argumentative philosophical essay in this course.",
    "I learned how to write a Philosophy paper, which is a VERY different skill from the way Ive learned to write. I also learned how to deal with sub-par teaching fellows.",
    "I better developed an ability to understand ancient texts and think in such a different way about how to analyze them in accordance to philosophy. The course definitely showed me a new way of approaching papers as well.",
    "I gained a very comprehensive understanding of Aristotle's Ethics and Plato's Republic.  I felt it was a good background in ancient philosophy, and would recommend if that specifically is what you are looking for.",
    "Surface level knowledge of a random assortment of ideas from Plato and Aristotle, with a few other names mentioned briefly",
    "Improved logic skills and ability to closely read texts",
    "The best part of this course was the essay writing and feedback I received",
    "A general understanding of the framework of ancient Greek philosophy. Close reading & reasoning skills. Writing concisely.",
    "I learned a colorful and in-depth overview of ancient Greek philosophers and those adjacent to them. Additionally, I was shown thoroughly how to write a philosophy paper.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall, this course provides a very good foundation in the history of philosophy and philosophical argumentation. Writing a philosophy paper can be challenging for students who have no experience in this area, and while argument reconstruction was heavily focused on in the beginning of the semester, I feel that more focus could be placed (in lecture and especially in section) on the process of forming and defending objections. Additionally, philosophy requires thinking about implicit logical steps in arguments, which I feel could be practiced more as well.",
    "The structure of the class is great. It focuses on some of the main philosophers, while spend a lot of time on Plato and Aristotle, who have the greatest importance in Greco-Roman philosophy. This structure helps students go deep in philosophical analysis.\r\nThe weakness might be that we did not get to read a lot from other schools like Stoicsm, Epicureanism and Skepticism. I wish the course could be designed spending more time on these schools, as their ideas are actually interesting but we only have superficial understanding on them at the end of the course.",
    "The syllabus is well-organized.",
    "The lectures could be a bit more engaging. They all consist of the professor speaking through a series of bullet points on a handout given to us. At times I found the lack of a visual component (slides, pictures, etc.) to be a hinderance in paying attention during class.",
    "Prof Harte certainly knows what she's talking about in her lectures and is very kind, but lectures aren't the most engaging",
    "Strengths: PHIL-125 with Verity Harte gets into an appropriate level of exegetical and argumentative detail while remaining appropriate to an entry-level course. The handouts (which trace the lecture content) are excellent and both summarize the material and frequently cite primary source passages. The \"Survivor\" session on the last day of class is great! Please keep this. The prompts and topics for the three essays for the WR version of the course are helpfully varied. Weaknesses: The lectures can be a bit slow-paced and sometimes follow the handout so closely that they seem slightly superfluous. For me, at least, being a visual learning, I might appreciate more use of diagrams (e.g.) on the whiteboard to give some backdrop to the lecture handouts\/outline.",
    "Strengths: Engaging topics, readings and discussions. \r\nWeaknesses: Not enough discussion in lectures (but I guess that's what sections are for)",
    "I liked the class as it was.",
    "I wish there could have been more help in the beginning when writing the first essay. There wasn't really any example to go off of, and for someone who's writing a philosophical essay for the first time, it seemed like a steep learning curve.",
    "I wish that lecture was a little more dynamic or discussion-based, as in I wish that students had more opportunity to ask questions and better engage with material in lecture. Although this was the point of having discussion sessions, I felt that frequently we were just trying to understand the philosophical ideas in these sessions from lecture rather than truly discuss why these ideas are important.",
    "Strength: the handouts are very clear and concise... The final is pretty manageable.",
    "It was a very typical, well-run, intro class. Good lectures, good reading, good feedback on writing.",
    "This course was well-organized. The lecture sheets were very helpful and I found the reading and writing schedule to be manageable.",
    "I found it super hard to pay attention in class, which really did not help me with this class. I think a weakness is that the material is interesting and important.",
    "As I said in question 1, I think the major strength was learning to follow and understand an argument (logic), and I think the course did this through its essay prompts. I feel like I learned the most in this course when I was planning and writing my 3 papers. I do also think, however, that besides papers being basically our entire grade, writing was under-emphasized in lecture. I didn't really feel like what we were spending class time doing was necessarily lining up with how we were being graded, and I would have really liked to spend more time talking about logic in class, and about writing in philosophy.",
    "Lectures were difficult to understand and the philosophical concepts were not coherently covered.",
    "It is very hard for visual learners since it is all talking in lecture and no visual aid. Professor Harte is brilliant but it is very hard to know what is important or not and with no clear ways to take notes it makes the lectures somewhat monotonous.",
    "Section was a huge strength, and the Task were very available. I thought lecture was a good review of the material but rarely increased my understanding of the text passed what it already was.",
    "The lecture handouts seemed unnecessarily vague, and it made it harder to review. Now you might say \"take more lecture notes\", but in a class like philosophy it is easier to understand arguments if you focus in class.",
    "Strengths:\r\nGreat handouts.\r\nInformative and enjoyable papers.\r\nGreat assistance from TA's in writing papers to meet Prof. Harte's standards.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nLectures were tough to sit through, even for a 50 minute long class.\r\nThe final was very different from the work we had done across the course of the semester.",
    "If you read you learn, if you don't you don't.",
    "Strength: The lecture handouts were extremely helpful, especially with reviewing the material after class. The discussion sections as well were interesting and where I felt most of the learning and comprehension happened. \r\n\r\nWeakness:  I would have liked to have spent a bit more time on other philosophical schools as we did at the end of the semester and shorten the time spent on either Plato or Aristotle.",
    "The biggest strength was that you could tell Professor Harte was giving a more than basic account of what was going on in these texts. She raised relevant historical points and demonstrated how one might go about investigating what the author really means. I particularly appreciated the numerous occasions on which she raised interpretive questions, and cited her reasoning for choosing one interpretation over the other. I thought that this made the philosophers seem less infallible, and helped to exemplify the task of engaging with historical figures. \r\nThe only weakness was that the lectures could sometimes drag a bit on occasion, when the topic was less gripping. It would be nice if they were more interactive, but that's what section is for, really.",
    "Overall, the course was fine--the professor and the TA's were all extremely interested in philosophy which helped students become more enthusiastic. They had many office hours and a lot of support for when I needed extra help, as well. I don't think there were any weaknesses.",
    "While very informative I felt that they were looking for a specific kind of essay in the writing portions of the class and these standards were not unveiled to us. Accordingly, it felt like I was aiming at a target I couldn't see.",
    "Very steady course, Prof could be nicer about accommodations for medical stuff",
    "A weakness were that examples of how the essays should be written were not posted beforehand but a strength was that the teacher fellow and professor provided guidance.",
    "The main weakness of this course was that there were no clear guidelines for how a first-time philosophy student should even go about writing the first paper of the course, giving an advantage to students who had already taken a philosophy course, which should not be acceptable, given that it is an Intro course. I also could not receive evaluative feedback on my first paper prior to its due date, leaving me destined to do poorly.",
    "Prof Harte was not the most engaging lecturer.  A visual aid would have REALLY helped with this, not just the handouts but a powerpoint where it was clear where we were.   I actually enjoyed this class way more than modern philosophy.",
    "Changing up style of lecture could improve course. Feeling like the professor was just reading word-for-word off of handouts distributed every day in class made it very challenging to pay attention and stay focused. It also discouraged actually attending lecture because the same information could be gained from spending five minutes reading the handout that we would spend fifty minutes slowly moving through in class. \r\n\r\nI would also have appreciated more guidance into why we selected and omitted the passages that we did. We jumped around so much in each work without explanation that I often felt lost as to the overall meaning of what we were reading, and I came away from this course without feeling like I had learned anything more than a few nice phrases to throw out at cocktail parties. \r\n\r\nAlso the lack of substantial feedback or constructive criticism on papers in a WR-credit class was very disappointing for me. I have taken multiple philosophy courses and appreciate the honest grading policies of the department. At the same time, in this course it felt like papers were being graded very harshly without providing any criticism or suggestions for improvement. This combination made the assignments feel incredibly demoralizing. If this was the only philosophy class I had taken, I'm very confident I would have walked out of this course hating the department and swearing never to take another philosophy class again.",
    "I think the course in general is a good introduction to philosophy, although a real weakness are the essay prompts - the third prompt for the WR section of the course was frankly unanswerable in 6 pages, and so it necessarily led students to giving answers that were not in sufficient detail and we're not structured as standard Philosophy papers.",
    "I wish more time was spent going over essays and how to improve them, especially for the WR credit sections",
    "interesting content. friendly prof. more review time."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely",
    "I would recommend this course to students considering the philosophy major or who have a genuine, deep interest in ancient Western philosophy. However, I would not recommend this course for someone who is just looking for a philosophy class to try out for fun as a new subject. The material and assignments can be challenging, and other philosophy courses may be better suited for students who just want to try something new.",
    "I recommend this course. It really reinvent me to some extent. Never had I thought about taking a philosophy class before coming to Yale, but the first time I read Plato's Republic, it evoked my interest in this area of study. Workload is actually lower than most of the humanity classes, while we still learnt a lot in this class. Also I am lucky to have a really welcoming discussion session.",
    "Yes. Philosophy helps you organize and express your thoughts logically.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that has never taken a philosophy course before.",
    "I would recommend, but not if you look to get an easy A because essays take alot of work to ace",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone. It is well-organized and moderately-paced. Expectations for paper quality is high, and a number of students struggled especially early on with adapting to the expectations of philosophical writing, but it does teach you how to craft a compelling philosophy paper.",
    "Definitely! As I have said, learning how Philosophers in Ancient Greece thought about various concepts and notions is extremely useful for any sort of abstract and concrete discussion.",
    "I would reccomend this course because the material was very interesting.",
    "Only if they are passionate about philosophy.  I took it for the writing credit and while I did learn something from the class, I think I would have been better off taking a writing credit that I cared more about.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class because it has a workload that is evenly distributed throughout the semester so there's not a lot of work during finals week. The readings were a little dense sometimes, but one would get the hang of it pretty well.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in ancient philosophy or classic civilizations, who want to engage with ancient primary sources and understand the cool philosophical views of Aristotle and Plato, just to name a few. I would recommend that students, if they choose to take the class, be diligent about doing the readings and learning the material over the course of the semester in preparation for the final.",
    "Hmm... for a non-major student, probably taking other more engaging classes.",
    "If you're interested in ancient philosophy or you need it for the major, then yes -- it's a good course. Otherwise, not particularly thrilling material.",
    "Yes. This is a great preparation for other philosophy courses",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are genuinely interested in the readings--the lectures are lackluster and the TAs are not great, so the only benefit is what you obtain personally from reading the texts and analyzing stuff for papers.",
    "I would hesitate to recommend this course because I had trouble getting really into it and engaging with the material. Nonetheless, I know there are a lot of people who liked it so maybe it was just me.",
    "I would recommend an intro philosophy course with a writing credit to anyone, because I think the skills you build in reading and writing philosophy are important in developing anyone's thinking. I would not necessarily recommend this course specifically, though, since I think the content could be more engaging in other philosopher classes.",
    "Not unless the student is a philosophy major.",
    "No, it's good if you need a writing credit but it's basically DS philosophy if you are not in DS. The material I didn't find too interesting and it the readings were very dense and took a substantial amount of time.",
    "If you're interested in Philosophy. The papers are toughly but fairly graded.",
    "Absolutely, intro philosophy should be mandatory, maybe not ancient phil tho.",
    "I would recommend this course to prospective Philosophy majors and those who have a distinct interest in Ancient Philosophy. Though I have found Philosophy seminars to be much more fruitful, this lecture does cover a wide variety of topics in a decent amount of depth. A great first-year class to learn how to write college-level papers.",
    "I think it is a good introduction to philosophy, especially the writing which teaches you a new method of argumentation. The lectures could get a bit boring if you had already done the reading ahead of time because it was mostly just summarizing what was in the reading. On the flipside of that, missing a reading wasn't that bad because you would just get a comprehensive handout for each lecture. Overall it was a good course and anyone interested in philosophy but not sure where or how to start should at least look into this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the history of various philosophical themes. The grading on papers is harder than average, so students looking simply to easily fulfill a writing requirement should consider whether they'd enjoy the material on its own. We received really helpful feedback on the essays, though, and I think I became a better writer via this course.",
    "I would only recommend this course to someone who is interested in philosophy--otherwise, I don't think they would be very engaged in the course.",
    "Yes if they are interested in ancient philosophy. I am not quite sure I would try to convince someone who isn't already disposed to being interested.",
    "Id recommend it if youre a PHIL major or if youre particularly interested in ancient Phil.",
    "I would if they are interested in the material or how to write a philosophical essay.",
    "Yes, because while my experience in the class was not an enjoyable one due to my teaching fellow, the content and philosophers we read about and discussed were very interesting, so for someone else the class could be a good one.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It teaches a very unique process of analysis and way of thinking that I think everyone should expose themselves to at least a little.",
    "It is required for the philosophy major, so if you fall into that camp you don't have a choice\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to take a philosophy class just for fun\/ curiosity, please take a different one. There are so many incredibly fascinating and intellectually stimulating classes available every semester. Please do not just take this class and assume that this is all philosophy has to offer. There is so much more out there, and it is an incredible discipline. This class unfortunately will not give you a taste of that. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a WR credit, take a different one. There are so many options where you will actually get feedback on your writing and tips to improve. That did not happen once in this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who was interested in learning about ancient Philosophy specifically, although if someone was trying to figure out if they liked philosophy as a field, I would recommend they take intro modern Phil instead, since I think that course is more representative of other philosophy at Yale.",
    "This course offered a nice overview of ancient philosophy. The lectures were hard to pay attention to at times, but each lecture had a concise handout which was extremely helpful.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes",
    "yes. you learn basic ancient philosophy"
