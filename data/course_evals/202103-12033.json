                "I learned how to analyze, contrast, and write about dance. The intimate discussion based class style was wonderful - for every piece we watched I got to hear six unique interpretations. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I became a much better writer in this class. Mr. Seibert prints out every assignment and annotates it with corrections, as well as writing multi-paragraph feedback on an additional sheet of paper. We also had writing sessions, where we got to read each other's writing and talk as a class about what worked and what didn't. For anyone that is interested in becoming a more effective communicator, I highly recommend this course.",
                "This course manages to combine a writing workshop with a very comprehensive syllabus on dance history. I feel like I came out of this class a better writer and with a ton of knowledge on American dance."

                "The class is a great mix of writing, watching videos, and even learning small dance sequences. The variety is entertaining, but you still get to have writing workshops. The smaller class size was nice since it encouraged a lot of good conversation. Some weeks there are a lot of readings and videos to go through, which results in fewer people completing the readings and less engagement in class.",
                "Strengths included the wonderful writing sessions where we discussed our work, the extensive feedback on our essays, and the fascinating discussions that we had about the pieces we watched. My concept of what choreography is and its role in society evolved almost every class. I found that sometimes if one did not particularly enjoy the style of dance studied that week, the required videos and readings were a bit extensive, but one could always triage what they were going to focus on in preparation for each class.",
                "This class' main strength was its intensity. You learn a lot, you talk a lot, and it's hard but very valuable. The access to the dance world is also amazing. I couldn't believe the superstars we got to interact with. The weakness, I would say, is the workshop aspect of the class. It never seemed like we had enough time to dig into what people were writing. I struggled with whether my pieces should sound more like reviews or more like classic history/lit papers. Professor Seibert is great but he's among the hardest graders I've had at Yale--that was good for me, because I was looking for thorough feedback and constructive criticism, but he's really hard to please!! I honestly think that this class might work better if the workshop aspect was cut out and it was just a dance history course--but in that case, I would still want Professor Seibert to give the same level of feedback he was giving before. So, I don't know."

                "Take this course if you love dance! It was a wonderful experience having discussions with Mr. Seibert and the other students, having guests such as Renee Robinson who was with Alvin Ailey for 30+ years and Robert Garland who is the resident choreographer of Dance Theatre of Harlem, and getting incredibly detailed feedback on my essays. Highly recommend.",
                "Yes, but don't expect it to be easy! The amount of writing is pretty intense. Also, if you don't know anything about dance, don't be afraid to take this course! It's a really cool introduction that manages to give you breadth and depth at the same time."
