    "This class was a huge disappointment.  Our professor never made herself available for any conferences or discussion outside of class and , in class, devoted a significant part of the course to rambling discussions of her theater career.  Though we were told that there would be a final project in which we'd complete an entire act of a musical, at semester's end, no mention was made of this, and no assignment was ever requested. In class, virtually every student idea was met with the identical response:  \"Very interesting!\" \r\n\r\n This was a huge waste of class time and tuition.",
    "I learned about the structure of a musical, as well as how to create one myself.",
    "The professor provided some good advice, and was kind and engaging, however there was no syllabus, and classes seemed to be about whatever she felt like talking about that day",
    "I learned about the conventions, the framework, and the secrets behind crafting the perfect arc of a story including important plot checkpoints, character arcs, and song structure",
    "I formed a deeper engagement into the art behind playmaking and playwright.",
    "How to write a libretto, what audiences find engaging, how to interact in a workshop setting."

   "comments": [
    "No doubt Marsha Norman is a terrific writer.  She is a terrible teacher.",
    "More clear feedback and knowledge about how it will be graded",
    "It's basically a weekly college tea with Marsha Norman. Sometimes she assigns no work, and other times, she assigns a ton out of nowhere. It's a treat to get to hear her opinions on a subject she knows so well, but I would also have loved a little bit more consistency throughout.",
    "This course was a very special opportunity. To be in a classroom and have a conversation with someone as influential and experienced as Marsha Norman was in and of itself a learning experience. I valued classes in which Marsha focused discussions on specific ideas\/concepts. For example, the day we spent discussing conflict, sharing personal anecdotes of recent conflicts and developing those into narratives was wonderful, as were the classes in which we worked on adapting popular fairy tales. There were times when the discussion was less focused, and it was harder to walk away feeling like I'd learned something applicable to my own work. Marsha has many incredible things to share, and I think a more thematically organized series of discussions would allow us to learn as much as we can from all she has to offer.",
    "Strengths- it is taught by a working playwright, who gives her thoughts and advice on playwrighting and who offers to use her connections for her students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-no syllabus or real structure.",
    "Strengths: relaxed environment, Marsha is a GENIUS, collaborative assignments, and freedom to work on personal projects\r\nWeaknesses: lack of structure, ambiguity behind assignments and their due dates",
    "Strength: A high level of classroom engagement\r\n\r\nWeakness: Unclear assignments sometimes",
    "There are no weaknesses. Such a fun course. Even if the course was just Marsha Norman talking for two hours every week (which it wasn't), that would have been enough."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely not.",
    "It's a fun course and you learn a lot about musical theatre, but I would have gotten more out of it had it been a little more structured.",
    "Absolutely. You get out what you put into the course, as you are not asked to turn in assignments but instead just share things you've been working on. Really how all courses should be.",
    "I would, purely for the connections one can make in the class",
    "I would! If you are interested at all in musicals and how they are made, Marsha has a wealth of experience and knowledge that she shares weekly.",
    "Depends on who you are. Some big pros, but some huge cons.\r\n\r\nPros: \r\nThe course didn't have a syllabus, which was exciting at the beginning of the semester. \r\nProfessor Norman gave students memberships to the Dramatist's Guild, which is super nice of her. \r\nDepending on your background, you can have a great rapport with the professor.\r\n\r\nCons: \r\nGrading criteria were only addressed on the last day, which was not helpful. \r\nProfessor Norman was not easily reachable.\r\nDiscussions were all over the place and often off topic. When Norman gave theater advice or feedback on specific projects, it was great. But significant time in class was spent on something random and personal to Norman (e.g. time was spent talking about Norman's home dishware, TV shows, and the glycemic index of m&ms). This would have been totally fine if supplemented with more instruction, feedback or communication. But it wasn't, and I didn't learn much about book writing. \r\n\r\nBiggest cons: Objectively, you don't learn much in this class. Subjectively, the professor treated students differently in regards to calling on them and speaking to them, and it seemed to correlate with students' backgrounds. The amount of support and mentorship you'd expect the professor to give all students seemed skewed towards those with similar backgrounds to the professor. All things considered, I wouldn't recommend the class to someone from an underrepresented background in this space.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! There is no reason NOT to take this course. There is essentially no work for it and it's the most joyful course I've taken at Yale."
