I was exposed to a high volume of professional screenplays, and was asked to perform writing activities associated with many of the scripts I wrote which helped me develop a more critical and keener eye in terms of what makes good screenwriting. Similarly, we were constantly workshopping our scripts both in and out of class, and at the end of the class we were expected to have written a complete 8-12 page screenplay. This helped me understand how to flush a complete story with a concrete beginning, climax, and ending. Overall, I have learned so much from this class and I am so excited to take Intermediate Screenwriting to build on the knowledge I gained this semester.",

                "The content of this class was incredibly strong, and I felt that I really learned a lot about screenwriting. The in-class workshops were also extremely helpful; this aspect of creative writing classes has always been enjoyable and valuable.",
                "There were no weaknesses in this class, I loved absolutely every moment of it. Obviously, I wish it could've been in person, but that is the only thing that didn't make this class completely perfect. Our 2 hour virtual seminar meetings allowed me to develop great and close bonds with both my professor and all the other students in the class. The strength of the class is based mainly in how both personable and knowledgeable Professor Lapadula is. He makes learning about screenwriting seriously engaging because he looks directly at your work, and you get to workshop both your own work and the work of your classmates, this highly hands-on experience allows you to make changes and understand what about your own writing works and what doesn't. I truly don't think this class can be improved upon, it is amazing.",
                "The class is well organized, with a good balance between lecture, discussion, and meeting in small groups outside of class. There were effectively two homework assignments, a midterm and a final, both of which took a fairly long time to complete. It might be more kind to split up when certain components of each folder are due.",
                "Strengths: It's fun! Brainstorming ideas for a short film, writing the screenplay, and workshopping it--as well as workshopping my classmates' screenplays--was a lot of fun. It's a really cool thing to be able to do in an academic environment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's hard. You have to figure out quite a lot on your own with regards to actually making a short screenplay. You are given examples of previous students' work, and you are given feedback on your script in the workshop, as well as in your discussions with your small group, but you need to figure out many things on your own. I think having a text of some form to read with the class about the basics of story structure could be very helpful. Much of the class consisted of watching clips from films and the professor explaining why the clips are exciting\/a good scene. I think that reading a professional short script and breaking down the story structure in the first couple weeks could be extremely helpful, as well as potentially reading some short essays about typical story structure. For students that have never written fiction before, it can be very difficult to try and write a good, successful story without a sense of what makes a story work.",
                "Seminars are very interactive. Professor Lapadula can go on a few rants here and there, but understandable, given the scope of what we're covering.",
                "This course has been my favorite taught at Yale so far. There is a level of engagement and dedication to its students through personal meetings and discussion of movies as they relate to the writing that I havent found in any other media course."

                "Only if they hope to take intermediate and advanced screenwriting afterwards. The majority of this course involves you teaching yourself how to write a script, and it is fun to do so and have yourself evaluated by your peers; however, you can do this on your own if you want by reading Save the Cat (or some other book on screenwriting) and then having a group of friends read\/workshop your writing. Much of what this class teaches can be learned in other ways, and so I would only recommend it if you are dying to write longer screenplays later on and hope to do so in an academic setting.",
                "Yes. You learn some good, verified tips from someone who's still active in the screenwriting business. You also get to hang out with a small group of classmates from the class every week and read some really cool work.",
