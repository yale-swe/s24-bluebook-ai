                "The films are very interesting, and the classes are relatively low stakes. Very fun class!",

                "The course is a great introduction to excellent Latin American cinema. The only shame is that there are so many things that we do not get to watch! In the future, more fiction might be nice, but many of the documentaries were really excellent. I can only think of one or two movies that I did not really like in the class, a testament to Prof. Tortora.",
                "Strengths: great variety of films, lots of interesting discussions\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes felt disorganized between the Modules, unclear about what exactly we had to prepare for each class, went over time every class",
                "One of my favorite aspects of this course was getting to talk to a lot of Latin-American filmmakers. Learning about their filmmaking process and about the things they took into consideration we handling the subjects they wanted to talk about was a lot of fun.",
                "Strengths: Films are diverse and great examples of the diversity of Latin America and the Caribbean and their accents, the assigned essays were a good practice of writing skills, student presentations were a good way to practice speaking\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can be hard to keep up with because there are many assignments",
                "This course does an excellent job of overviewing the breadth of Latin American film available to view, and I appreciated how thorough and diverse the syllabus' offerings were. The assignments were engaging and deepened my understandings of the topics; however, I think spacing out the Canvas forum discussions and the critical essays would make those assignments a bit easier to manage."

She also made available other opportunities which were very nice to communicate in Spanish, such as with her friend from Ecuador on Zoom. One thing that was hard was watching video clips of Spanish movies through Zoom. It was already hard for me to understand Spanish, but through the medium of Zoom it became even more difficult to make out the dialogue in the clips that we watched during class (admittedly a very small part of the course).",
                "Getting to talk to film makers hundreds of miles away from the comfort of my dorm room was really amazing. The advent of zoom probably made this a lot more convenient. Lecture felt a little disengaging at times, and it was a little difficult to interaction with classmates.",

I was not particularly confident with the language and now feel much better about it, although I certainly have more to improve. I would guess that I had less exposure to the language than most other students in the class, but I still managed to complete the assignments and do well. It is an excellent course in which you learn a lot and have a great time doing it.",
                "If you are interested in the topic, yes. We talk to a lot of cool filmmakers and watch a lot of great movies. There is a lot of work for the class, though, so you have to be willing to put that in.",
                "If you're interested in learning more about the history of Latin America through the context of film. I'd definitely recommend this course. Your mileage may vary with all the different movies you're assigned to watch, but most of them are very interesting or at the very least have an important message to share.",
                "Absolutely! Be ready to do quite a few assignments but Profesora Tortora's feedback on every assignment is very thorough and helpful. A great introduction to Latin American histories, and film studies too.",

Profesora Tortora's expertise is truly invaluable for this course, and the perspectives she brings nin through the guest speakers is not to be missed."
