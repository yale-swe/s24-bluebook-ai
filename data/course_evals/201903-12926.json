    "Before this course, my grammar was okay, at best, and I had not dived into Francophone literature with the exception of No Exit and The Stranger. This course really transformed my French. It forced me to master grammar concepts that I always felt okay with but never confident in. We covered hundreds of pages of grammar, doing pages of exercise for each class. Additionally, we were also constantly reading stories that harped on similar themes of solitude and society. Alongside these books and short stories, we also learned vocabulary that also helped build my French. Just today, I attended my first ever dinner with the Francophone society and, while this course didn't make my nerves go away, I did feel more and more confident talking and expressing myself - using some of the same vocabulary we learned in class. The books and movies we engaged with were also very diverse. I learned about reading an allegorical play, reading older literary French, and reading denser works like Boule de Suif. Our class discussions really helped improve my literary analysis and critical thinking.",
    "Grammar",
    "I greatly improved my French grammar and reading skills.",
    "I strengthened my grammar knowledge and developed better reading, writing, and speaking skills.",
    "Having taken this class, I greatly improved my French reading, writing, and speaking skills. I learned a lot about writing stylistically and idiomatically in French. I also enjoyed the texts we read and films we watched, which really helped my French by seeing different styles from different time periods. Additionally, I greatly benefitted from the oral exams we had to take because it forced me to articulate an entire argument, which is something I was not able to do previously."

   "comments": [
    "This course is really well organized. The weekly program helped us manage our time throughout the week to get our work done. The breadth of the coursework is also wide so we were exposed to a lot of Francophone culture and customs, history and literary styles. I would have appreciated having explored more contemporary works and media. There was one lesson where we discussed current immigration and refugee issues in Europe which connected to one of our works and I wish we could have done more of that.",
    "Covered a lot of books\/films which was good.",
    "My instructor was amazing, but she had to teach within the framework of French 150, and that sometimes hindered our learning.",
    "Strength is that the books and films we read and watch are very interesting. Cant really think about a weakness. Its a very good language course.",
    "The texts and films of this class are definitely a strength. Students are exposed to sources and authors from so many different time periods, which exposes them to different styles of French, greatly improving their vocabulary and writing abilities. I think the amount of grammar exercises would be the only weakness to this class. There were so many assignments having to do with grammar, that we never had time to discuss in class, which makes it more difficult to learn the grammar rules."

    "I would recommend this course to students who are serious about their love for French since it is a heavy workload, at least compared to my other classes. I did really enjoy it, but it may not be for everyone.",
    "Yes, good for improving language skills, especially in grammar. Also, topics covered were interesting",
    "yes! such an amazing class.",
    "Yes. If you wanna keep learning french.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is looking to read more famous French works, as well as practice their writing and speaking skills. Know that there is a lot of grammar work!"
