    "I learned about dense economic models in this course, as well as how these models don't always describe psychological reality in general.",
    "Behavioral economics, and looking at non-standard models of choice.",
    "I learned about various models of choice behavior, as well as their real world applications.",
    "This was a crash course in various new innovative models in behavioral economics.",
    "Learned about several different economic models of decision-making, how they have been better adapted to describe real behavior, and the ways in which they still fall short. Very focused on mathematically rigorous proofs.",
    "Survey of landmark behavioral economic models and ideas",
    "Very heavy on psychological proofing and understanding experiments and how they prove certain theories (or dont). We never had to prove anything on our own except for in the problem set, but we did have to discuss theories in our paper and presentation.",
    "I already had a solid empirical background in behavioral economics, but this course provided me with a much more theoretical and rigorous set of models that underlie behavior.",
    "Great intro to behavioral econ",
    "From this course, you really get to step back and intuitively analyze the foundations of all economics learned before. You learn logical reasoning, proof language, and most importantly, how people REALLY think about the world and make decisions. It's an amazing course for anyone interested in human behavior.",
    "This was a great course to combine the principals of econ and psych in a theoretical and model based way",
    "An introduction to the many theories that introduce elements of psychology into basic economic principles, as well as the results and implications of such introductions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was extremely boring during the first half, as it was mostly the professor lecturing. It was difficult to pay attention and remain engaged during the class because it was not collaborative in any way. The course could be improved by introducing the models in a more engaging way. One of the strengths of the course was the introduction to economic modeling in a unique and thorough way.",
    "Strength: Very knowledgeable prof\r\nWeakness: Disorganization with the assignments and grading.",
    "Strengths: Prof Noor is a clear and engaging lecturer who presented the material in an easy to understand way. He also uploaded all his lecture notes, which was helpful for doing the pset. \r\nWeaknesses: we had a few classes of student presentations, which was less easy to follow.",
    "By the end of the semester, it was clear that the professor had initially planned to teach a traditional economics lecture course, but for whatever reason, partway through the semester, made changes to the syllabus to make it more of a seminar feel. The way this professor taught the course makes me feel like a lecture format with problem sets and exams would have been much more appropriate for the material, rather than a seminar format with presentations and a paper. That may be a quirk of the professor though, and not a consequence of the actual content of the course.",
    "Strengths: the subject matter is really interesting and relevant to the real world, Prof. Noor can be pretty funny at times\r\nWeaknesses: course expectations were very unclear, lecture could be tough to follow at times, not many opportunities to interact with the material before assignments, which were all at the end of the semester allowing no opportunities for feedback",
    "Wonderful course! Well organized and presented - Prof Noor is a fantastic and approachable instructor who is willing to put in the time to help students. Expectations were always very clear and grading was fair -",
    "Cool subject, but lots of material and a bit unclear how we should go about assignments.",
    "Strengths: Professor Noor was very accessible and open to answering questions, the course was very discussion-based, and the student presentations\/papers really allowed us to explore areas of interest in depth\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course could have been more organized on Canvas during shopping period and the first few weeks of the course",
    "Taught well",
    "Strengths: great professor, very thorough lecture notes, interesting classes, light workload, good breadth of material covered\r\nOpportunities for Improvement: The grading was determined completely by 3 assignments, and that puts a lot of pressure on the individual assignments. the p-set was especially difficult as my group and others weren't exactly sure what level of rigor we were supposed to put into the proofs."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless really interested in economics as a graduate subject. I thought the class would be about behavioral economics, but it did not incorporate psychology that much and was mostly centered on economics.",
    "There are better Econ electives out there.",
    "Honestly, the topic is super interesting and Jawwad is a very nice professor. If you find out that the course will be taught in a lecture format, then I highly recommend taking this course.",
    "I would not recommend this course. The class is very much focused on theoretical modeling, and there is very little discussion of psychological evidence. We learned mainly proofs and propositions from the models, and I didn't really feel like I came away with a good grasp on behavioral econ. The course was also so disorganized, and I felt like I did not know at all what was expected of me on the assignments.",
    "If you like psychology and math, and arent afraid to be a bit confused sometimes due to the complexity of the subject, take it.",
    "Yes! Most behavioral science courses at Yale are very empirical in nature (Psych courses, SOM courses, etc.), so it's very important to have a theoretical understanding of behavioral economics, which this course provided.",
    "If you have interest in economics, psychology, or just thinking in general, this course will be amazing for you. It teaches you how to break free from the simplified models of classical economics and allows you to start modeling real human behavior. The professor, however, is a visiting professor, and he is certainly the one who made the class so good. I'd check out the background of other professors if this course is offered again without Prof. Noor.",
    "Definitely! Take this class if youre interested in decision making"
