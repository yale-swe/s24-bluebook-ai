                "Great class! Learned so much and can read\/say more in Japanese now. Very high learning curve but the grammar does get harder in L2",
                "Well structured, could be good to have a formal introduction of vocabulary words at the start of each chapter rather than just self-study.",
                "The strengths of this class was the definitely the way that it was taught (all of the students were very engaged and the environment was always very amicable and conducive to learning). There is no way that I think this course could be improved.",
                "The course was well organized with homework and assessments laid out in weekly schedules. The lectures usually have conversation sessions to practice speaking with classmates, which makes the course more engaging and also helps you connect with your classmates better. Since lessons 11 and 12 are in a new textbook with more vocabularies and longer conversations, certain vocabularies are practiced less during lectures and clinic sessions, making them harder to memorize and use well."

                "I liked the breakout rooms to practice speaking Japanese with my peers, but sometimes it was difficult to hear students who were in the classroom (a lot of background noise). However, I understand that is something a bit unavoidable.",
                "Usage of breakout rooms was effective in still allowing students to talk to each other as if they were in a classroom. Usage of the modules system on Canvas made homework easily accessible and assignment due dates easily understandable.",
                "Having our mics unmuted the entire time because truthfully there was one student (who I am pretty sure is somewhat knowledgeable about Chinese language(s) which holds similarity to Japanese) and he often made it his role to speak over everyone. In those moments, I couldn't even hear myself speak, and I felt like I was missing out on learning opportunities.",
                "This was the only in-person class I had and it worked very well. It was a huge relief to have some normalcy in this semester and helped me mentally and academically throughout. Also got to know people in the class and engage better.",
                "I think that having the in-person option was very helpful to create a community atmosphere in the class and both the in-person and remote students were able to seamlessly switch in and out of breakout rooms and converse with each other.",
                "The live lectures were well organized, and I didn't feel like it is worse than the in-person lectures. The breakout rooms in Zoom worked really well for conversation sessions, although we do have some technical problems every so often, it does not significantly impact learning."
