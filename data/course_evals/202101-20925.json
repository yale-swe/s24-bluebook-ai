                "The course was well organized with homework and assessments laid out in weekly schedules. The lectures usually have conversation sessions to practice speaking with classmates, which makes the course more engaging and also helps you connect with your classmates better. Since lessons 11 and 12 are in a new textbook with more vocabularies and longer conversations, certain vocabularies are practiced less during lectures and clinic sessions, making them harder to memorize and use well."

In those moments, I couldn't even hear myself speak, and I felt like I was missing out on learning opportunities.",

                "The live lectures were well organized, and I didn't feel like it is worse than the in-person lectures. The breakout rooms in Zoom worked really well for conversation sessions, although we do have some technical problems every so often, it does not significantly impact learning."
