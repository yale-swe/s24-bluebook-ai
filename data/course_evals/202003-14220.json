                "During this class, I strengthened my understanding of various facets contributing to the abstract definitions of space and time, as well as their intersectionality. I also was able to challenge my Western thinking pattens and my perspective in learning about colonialism and the disentanglement process, especially for African cities.",
                "I learned how to critically think about urban space and work outside of Eurocentric standards of urban thinking such as deconstructing space and non-linear time. Most of the topic areas were familiar, but in this class we actually developed new insights and challenged what we were originally took as fact in other urban studies courses at this university. Denise has crafted an incredible and thoughtful syllabus! Another skill we developed over the semester was how to use visual sociology: what does it mean to analyze artifacts and objects?",
                "It's in the title, but this course really does an incredible job exploring the assumptions we make for how to define and understand space, time, and not just African urbanism, but cities in general. It also puts an emphasis on visual sociology and building skills to become a more critical, thoughtful viewer of artwork and photography.",
                "Thinking about definitions of space, time, and cities in an African context. We learned about and practiced tools used in visual sociology, museum curation, and interdisciplinary research in our discussion posts, short writing assignments, as well as our final papers. We talked about different conceptions of time that centered different ways of knowing. We looked at several different case studies around the African continent, engaging with multimedia evidence and diverse representations of urban life.",
                "I developed a much more critical understanding of sociology and urban studies through a historically informed lens of African cities. I learned new research skills to further triangulate issues and problematize social norms rooted in colonialism and racism.",
                "I learned so much from this course. Using all different forms of media and art as valid data is not something other courses typically do, and it definitely contributed to a richer understanding of the themes and cities we studied. I learned a lot about the complexities of artistic representation, and will carry many of the insights with me into future work."

                "I loved this course and I have no suggestions on how it could be improved.",
                "The strengths of this course is definitely the wide array of topic areas, cultural artifacts, and cultural landscapes we analyzed. Most of these arent covered in other syllabi. If you can take this class with Denise Lim please do!!! Im so thankful I took it before graduating, she is amazing. As for weaknesses, to be honest I cant think of any. I imagine the course wouldve been twice as better had we been in person, but it definitely didnt fall short because Denise was so considerate and thoughtful with structuring the course in the midst of a pandemic.",
                "This is definitely the best class I've taken this semester. The course covers one topic each week, so we had the chance to explore a diverse variety of aspects. We often had guest speakers come in to share their work with us, and it was always inspiring and exciting to meet the author of the piece we were reading and know their insights. All the reading materials were carefully chosen and relate to each other, they often challenge my assumptions about how I view the world and stimulated thoughtful and fruitful discussions both in class and in the discussion posts. We were asked to post questions\/ thoughts about the reading & cultural artifacts on Canvas before every class, and it was always great and inspiring to see what other classmates think about the same readings. \r\n With assignments, the difficulty increased gradually as we develop more skills and knowledge in class, from putting one artifact and one reading in conversation with each other to writing a final essay\/ presentation with individually researched sources, I felt like we were challenged but not overwhelmed by the assignments. \r\nThe only thing I think that would make this course even better is to have clearer instructions\/ expectations on the assignments. I understand that since this course was taught the first time, the outcome of the assignments might not be easily anticipated. As a result, I didn't have a clear picture of what I should do for the assignment. However, with clarification from Denise I was able to understand the expectations so it went fine.",
                "Professor Lim is the strength, her ability to lead discussions ensures each class is a valuable time. The readings she selects are also great.",
                "Strengths: this class had a really good balance between small groups, full class discussion, guest visits from outside professors, and activities related to watching a video or looking at an art piece to break up class time (which was really helpful over zoom). The reading for each class is paired with a cultural artifact, which I think made for much richer discussion, putting text and more theoretical ideas in conversation with visual art\/experiences. Outside of regular discussion posts, all writing assignments and revisions build up to the final project, making the end of semester work feel manageable. Weaknesses: Honestly, I can think of none - the only challenge was running out of time to discuss everything, especially when we had guest speakers!",
                "I think this class could have been better structured as a once a week seminar. Two discussion posts and two different sets of readings in one week was a bit overwhelming. Sometimes we ran out of time to get through all of the readings and resolve questions and ideas from earlier in the semester. I appreciate Denise's willingness to listen and incorporate feedback from her students. Later in the semester, the format of the discussion posts changed a bit to address questions for previous weeks. This course fills an important gap in Urban Studies and I hope more classes that focus on urbanism in the Global South are featured! \r\n\r\nI enjoyed the different guest speakers we were able to engage with, but also felt a bit constrained for time. It was a great honor hearing from African scholars and designers about their perspectives on our discussions and on our final projects. I also wish we were more grounded in a smaller geographic context. It was difficult to wrestle with new ideas and thinkers without being firmly grounded in a specific location. I love the flexibility students have to choose their final project topic. Each student brought a unique perspective and interpretation of the ideas we discussed this past semester. I really enjoyed learning from my classmates and felt supported by my peers during a virtual semester.",
                "The material covered in class were diverse and all challenged student perspectives very deeply about what is considered urban and how racial constructions lend themselves to the development of spaces and places. Many students each class session would grapple with very difficult, philosophical questions. I greatly appreciated that the class was so open to inviting guest speakers and guest classmates; it added to our conversation in ways that would not have been possible with in person class. I saw no weaknesses in this course.",
                "The strengths of this course were the variety of readings, the cross-disciplinary themes, and the class discussions. There is a good amount of work involved in this course, but it's difficult to identify any weaknesses. I think it could be improved by there being a little more to tie in previous weeks to later themes in the course."

One class was always more geared towards discussion, and the other to a visiting guest or a video tour of a site we were reading about. We also would shift in class to smaller break-out groups and watch a video to generate new discussion questions.",
                "Denise was very considerate and understanding about technical difficulties. I really enjoyed screensharing images and discussing our observations together. We were also able to watch videos and listen to music together through Zoom. Our guest speakers came from all around the world and it was great to hear about what they were thinking about and working on. Denise also did a great job making smaller breakout rooms (2 or 3 students) earlier in the semester to discuss the readings and build relationships with each other.",

You will definitely learn the course material but more importantly you will gain a fundamental understanding of how to think critically and push your intellectual limits. Denise is so so supportive and helpful and kind! She pushes you to be the best writer and thinker that you can be, which other quite frankly other professors at this school could learn a thing or two from her about. If you have the opportunity please take this class!",

Prof. Lim is incredible at leading internal class discussions, bringing in fascinating guest speakers, and provides detailed feedback on each writing assignment. The emphasis on visual sociology is really valuable regardless of your major, and the course covers important African urban case studies that are often excluded from Western-canon core urban studies\/architecture classes.",
                "Yes! Really loved learning from Denise and my peers! This class gives you the tools to challenge Eurocentric ideals about planning and urban life. Interesting readings and media (for example, one week we watched Black Panther). Flexible final project. Good relationships with my classmates.",
                "YES. I don't know if Professor Lim will teach this again but this course is so important. There are few architecture or urban studies courses that focus on the southern hemisphere, let alone Africa. There is so much to learn in this area and more students could benefit from taking coursework in this field. The visitors we had in class all added to a rich learning experience and I left each class thinking deeply about what was discussed. Professor Lim's dedication and encouragement of students' interests made this course even better. If you have a chance to take this class, do!",
