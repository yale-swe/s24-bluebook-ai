                "This course is what the economics department at Yale is missing. A low-pressure seminar to discuss actually relevant topics and recent developments in the field of economics. The class is broadly focused, but Prof Tsyvinskis deep knowledge allows him to weave in some of the most interesting recent papers in economics academia and ground them for an audience in a way that is engaging, but not prohibitively technical. Our final paper is also completely one of our interests and choices, and we are encouraged to explore abstract ideas in economics through a low-pressure forum.",
                "I learned a lot about how to think, something i feel other classes at Yale fail to focus on, and what mentality to employ as an economist.",
                "A beginning understanding of macroeconomic modeling, but more importantly just a re-evaluation of how I think and approach problems.",

                "You learn to think like Aleh Tsyvinski, a Sterling Professor in economics at Yale. Aleh's career precedes him; distinguished as a professor at various universities but also as someone in the seem of real-time macroeconomic policy and thought. He I uniquely capable of distilling complex topic into simple frameworks and conversations.",
                "We covered a range of topics including macroeconomic crises, inequality and climate change. The impactfulness of our discussions came through Alehs style of teaching. He makes sure to make the concepts being discussed make sense and consistently boils them down to their simplest parts and then builds out complex connections and consequences. This course increased my confidence in my economics knowledge.",
                "I learned about an unbelievable range of things, many of which I was completely unfamiliar with coming in. Most importantly, I learned how to frame interesting questions and how economists look at answering them.",

                "It was very well organized to cover a breadth of economic topics, including the climate crisis as well as development economics. It has been the best class that I have taken at Yale, and I looked forward to going to class everyday.",
                "Aleh is the strength. he leads discussions like no other",
                "Strengths: Professor Tsyvinski is brilliant; the range of his knowledge on so many different facets of economics is impressive, and it allows him to talk fluently about some of the most seemingly obscure topics in the field. The class is super low-pressure, participation in discussions is a huge part of the class but also rewarded. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of.",
                "Strengths: Incredible professor, engaging material, untraditional course structure, really well thought out class\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses",
                "Honestly, I think this class could meet twice a week and we would only get more out of it. Aleh Tsyvinsky is a wonderful thinker and even better teacher, and I wish I could take the course all over again.",
                "Strength: Prof Tsyvinski is really knowledgeable, passionate, and friendly. Discussion topics in seminar are super interesting. The class is generally relaxed and Prof does a wonderful job engaging everyone in the seminar. \r\n\r\nWeakness: You don't really know what grade you will get in the class because you don't have any turn-in assignment until your final paper. The class is pretty difficult to get into.",
                "Amazing course and material!",
                "I do not think there are any weaknesses in this course. Genuinely, this course has been the favorite that I have taken at Yale and was by far the most engaging seminar that I have taken. I find it hard to imagine that there are many more rewarding courses than this one.",
                "Meets once a week for 2 hrs. It's great to have that much time in one go so Professor Tsyvinski can run through a longer economic narrative without getting cut off.",
                "Probably the best class I have taken at Yale. Seminars were engaging, covered a wide range of relevant topics, and encouraged the participation of all students. Professor Tsyvinski is simply fantastic.  No weaknesses.",
                "Aleh - his teaching is phenomenal. Hes able to deliver a great course without overburdening students with readings and assignments. The cold-calling is also really effective. He also makes a point to connect with every student personally throughout the semester. We also met in the yuag for two sessions which is absolutely iconic and a testament to how fun and laid-back the class can feel. The only weakness I could think of is perhaps classroom diversity. Over 50% of students were of the same demographic which I found surprising given that 250+ students apply to take this course every time its offered.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tsyvinski and the community that you build in the class. Weaknesses: the classroom choice could've been better.",
                "Strengths were the smaller seminar-style format, which allowed for a lot more interaction between students and with the professor as compared to larger lecture classes. Professor Tsyvinski is also an amazing professor to get to know and learn from; I would not pass up the chance to take a class from him.\r\nIn my opinion, the only weakness was the relative lack of feedback during the semester - the class is heavily weighted toward the final paper. It can otherwise be hard to gauge how well you're doing, so I would recommend having at least one or perhaps two other formal assignments in the first part of the semester as well."

                "Yes. This is the best course I have taken at Yale with an incredible incredible professor. Aleh is amazing and this is the perfect opportunity to pick his brain about whatever you may want to learn. Take this class if you can get in.",
                "Absolutely. It should be a required class for every Yale student.",
                "Yes! If you're comfortable with open discussion format and don't mind not knowing what grade you have in the class exactly, this is a great course. There is practically no turn-in assignments for this class until the final paper. The professor is extremely accomplished and passionate about macroeconomic theory and how they can be applied in our every day lives, anyone would be lucky to spend a semester with him! He also tries to get to know about you as an individual.",
                "Yes, I love it.",
                "There is no other course that I would recommend more to another student than this course. This is mostly because it is an honor to meet Professor Tsyvinski on a personal level since he is such a brilliant and entertaining person.",
                "Take this course. I've taken most of the great Econ electives and this has been my favorite.",
                "Absolutely. Seminars were the highlight of my week. Learning about research currently being conducted in the field of economics with the insight sof Professor Tsyvinski was fascinating. Our learning was clearly Professor Tsyvinski's main objective, and this was reflected in the way he led seminars.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. This is hands-down the best economics course offered at Yale.",
                "This is an absolute must-take, if you can. There's no other course like it. Essentially weekly 2-hour conversations with one of Yale's best professors on whatever he or you think is interesting to talk about that day. Tons of fun, not too serious, but you learn a lot.",
                "Definitely! Professor Tsyvinski is an amazing professor, and if this class is offered in a seminar format again, I would highly recommend taking it if only to be able to learn from him."
