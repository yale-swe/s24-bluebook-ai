                "This class is an extraordinarily comprehensive deep dive into the world of longform reporting and writing. The class covered reporting strategies, from initial story conception to public documents work to trauma-informed interviews to improvising stories on the fly. It also covered the nuts and bolts of craft and structure. I came away from the course with a comprehensive sense of what it takes to conceive, report, and write a rigorous and moving longform piece, at every stage of the process. I also came away with two pieces I'm really proud of, and much more confidence in my ability to report and write ambitious feature pieces.",
                "I learned so many applicable writing and reporting skills in this course",
                "I learned a lot about long-form reporting and writing. I got hands-on experience in looking for stories, sourcing, interviewing, and navigating journalism ethics.",
                "Quite simply, and more so than any other opportunity at Yale, this class taught me how to do reporting. I learned how to interview people compassionately, reach sensitive sources and documents, work strategically through an ambitious project, use sequencing to build drama and narrative arcs, work across and up a story's 'ladder of abstraction', and above, how to look and develop an instinct for detail. This may seem overwrought, but I genuinely think I learned to be a more empathetic person in this class -- just by virtue of the interviews I did, some of which deeply moved me, and the stories we read. Long-form journalism has that effect.",
                "Reporting, writing, editing.",
                "I was excited and also extremely anxious joining this class. I knew that I wanted to report journalism, but I was still hesitant. Now, I feel more confident in my abilities to write and to report, and I owe it all to my amazing classmates and especially to Sarah Stillman.",
                "How to be a reporter! We learned so much it is hard to cover it all here, but it was cool how we learned how to file FOIA requests and access legal documents into our stories. I also really loved Prof. Stillman's \"ladder of abstraction\" and \"the chron\"  which are awesome tools for thinking about how to approach a story.",
                "This is a true crash course in investigative reporting. You are thrown into the fire in a lot of ways, and if you are a person with no reporting experience prior to this course, you are probably going to be pretty overwhelmed. But I don't think there is a way I could have enjoyed this course any more than I did, it was fantastic. You learn everything from the granular sentence formation to the big picture ethics questions behind sourcing and topic selection. Seriously, everything there is to no about this specific style of writing."

            "comments": [
                "I mean, I've loved this course. It's been such a wonderful community and Sarah is so kind and generous with her time and wisdom. I wasn't really sure what learning about journalism would even look like but I feel like I've gotten a lot out of this class, not only from the syllabus but from my peers. \r\n\r\nMaybe  as a technical point  making it part of the application for the course to submit a full pitch for the first story assignment? Not sure how realistic it would be but I think with the semester being online during the first few weeks, the tail end of the semester felt like quite the crunch, so jumping headfirst into the first assignment could be cool. Also, while I think the felony murder project is really compelling and important, the goals and expectations for our specific contributions could have been better clarified.",
                "Strengths: By far the biggest strength of this course is Prof Stillman, hands down. Another strength is that the way the course is structured means that you're forced to spend a ton of time reporting on and writing your pieces, since you have to submit a full first draft a fair bit before the final deadline. I also really loved how much the course was structured around workshopping pieces. I got to know my classmates' work and writing in ways I've never been able to in other courses. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The one weakness is that I didn't receive comments or a grade on the final draft of my first assignment (Prof. Stillman gave comprehensive comments on the first draft), but honestly, in the context of all the other work and attention she put into our pieces, I didn't find that to be much of a big deal at all.",
                "Prof Stillman is a very well accoladed journalist and has a lot of experience with reporting big, difficult stories. She's a great resource and very available to students. Her enthusiasm in class helps with student buy-in. My only criticism of this course is that I think workshopping took up too much of this course. I don't know that everyone in the course had to workshop both of their stories. I would have liked spending more time on the readings and talking through reporting methods. I don't know that workshopping is that helpful. I thought the first part of the course was the best, when we spent less time workshopping.",
                "So! many! strengths! I think setting a great class routine\/culture and expectations ahead of time was a strength of this class. I always felt like my classmates were bringing their best, and gave really thoughtful comments on one another's drafts. The readings were incredible, especially when we had the time to dissect them: to shout out a few favorites, Kathryn Schulz, Katherine Boo, and Rachel Aviv. I loved the workshop format in the second half of the course. And the true star of the course is Professor Stillman herself, who is fantastic and motivating seminar leader on top of being an excellent writer and teacher of interview, investigation, and narrative. The one thing I'd change was the timeline for the second long-form article (our investigative piece), which seemed very compressed by the end of the semester. To remedy this, I would suggest pitching the second article MUCH earlier in the semester, even while working on article 1, just so that future students can begin thinking about article 2 way ahead of time (and maybe take preliminary steps toward sourcing etc). The progress I did make toward the second article was largely thanks to sources I'd had before starting the class, just because the investigative articles take so much time.",
                "The other students in the course were sometimes not engaged, which diminished the power of the seminar.",
                "The strength of this course are Sarah Stillman and the classmates. You learn so many technical and aesthetic skills from readings and workshopping classmates work makes you realize how many stories are out there (and how much isnt on the national media forefront).",
                "Prof. Stillman is FANTASTIC! So supportive of her students, and absolutely brilliant. The main weakness of this class was the workload it was overwhelming at times. That said, Prof. Stillman was super receptive to our feedback and worked with us to reschedule deadlines, which was amazing. Super thankful for that!"

                "Absolutely -- though it feels like a class where engagement can vary substantially and what you get out is what you put in. I don't think you have to have a background in journalism to take this, either; I quite liked how intellectually diverse our cohort was.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who thinks they want to try their hand at longform reporting and writing. That said, this class is very intense and has a very high workload (one of the highest of any class I've taken at Yale), so make sure you're excited about the prospect of spending a ton of time reporting and writing, and that you won't be overwhelmed by your other classes. It also helps to have a few story ideas formulated before the class starts.",
                "Yes absolutely!!",
                "I would. This course is a lot of work, but I think there's a lot of payoff. By the end, you should have two polished, deeply reported stories. Professor Stillman is very accessible and makes a lot of time for students. She helps a lot with talking through story ideas and reporting problems. She also gives good feedback on drafts.",
                "In a heartbeat. Speaking as a senior, this is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The amount of useful skills you learn (and the output of good work that emerges) are unparalleled. Prof Stillman is a deeply lucid thinker when it comes to investigations, nonfiction, and interviewing, and also quite compassionate and funny; in addition, the class itself came together with a great sense of teamwork and camaraderie by the end. Both of those factors really inspired me to work hard and put out work I was really proud of. This course made me fall in love with narrative nonfiction and investigative journalism.",
                "This course was amazing. But, it was organized in an odd way, and sometimes classroom time was wasted on odd activities that didn't pertain to our assignments or what we had been working on. And, it is a rush to do the reporting for two essays in a semester.",
                "I HIGHLY recommend this course to anyone interested in finding and telling a story (whatever it is). Even if you dont think that youre creative or that youre the journalistic type, I absolutely think that you should take this course. You will be amazingly proud of your work and the classmates you meet.",
                "YES YES YES! You should take this class. Prof. Stillman is amazing. But do be aware of the workload!! I took this class when I was taking two senior seminars (which was really not my best idea). I recommend taking this fantastic course when you are taking a lighter course load so you can really invest the time and energy that this class deserves.",
                "This is by FAR the best class I have taken at Yale. By far. Of course, that is likely because I am someone that intends to go into journalism professionally, but I think any writer will absolutely adore this class and this professor. I am coming out of it feeling more empowered to be a writer than I ever have in my life, and also with an immense new set of tools that I think will prove invaluable to me throughout my entire career. I could not recommend a class more highly, and for any prospective journalists out there, it is nothing short of essential to find your way into this course."
