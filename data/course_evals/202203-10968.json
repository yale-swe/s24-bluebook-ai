                "I think the final assignment is a strength, it really helps you bring all the concepts together and give you an opportunity to realize how useful these tools are. Datacamp was very useful too, definitely another strength, no need to worry about the grade, just learn, since the exercises are graded completion based. For the weaknesses, I feel like I was lost at many times during the semester, and there was a lot of self learning and Google. However, I understand that's the best way to learn for this types of concepts. If you are really stuck just ask for help and you'll get it.",
                "I think one way the class could be improved would be more in class examples of code.",
                "I wish there were more exercises in addition to the weekly Datacamp.",
                "This class has access to DataCamp which helps to practice and learn bash and R. The class does a good job of giving a ground-up understanding of RNA sequencing analysis, but maybe more time could be spent on the analysis part of the course since this felt more glossed over.",
                "Very well constructured learnings and lots of support from teaching staff - only weakness would be additional assignments and attention paid to elements of pipeline following DESeq. I think the course could have benefitted from additional work in DESeq visualizations as well as functional annotations, getting into GSEA particularly.",
                "I learned far better by doing exercises in the cluster rather than watching data camp videos. Essentially the entirety of the DESeq workflow was taught through these data camp videos and the first time I had really done a full analysis was for the final project which was a big task for me and many of my classmates. \r\nI really loved the flexibility of this class and the option to complete work on our own time. This allowed me to move through the lab activities at my own pace because it can be hard to sit through a lab for 4+ hours with good focus."
