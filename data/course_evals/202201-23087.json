We briefly touched upon the orbits of satellites, properties of reflectance, the electromagnetic spectrum, the statistics behind image classification and the science of the atmosphere. With our individual projects, there were plenty of applications not discussed in class that we could have implemented and reviewed. That being said, the content of the course could look very different depending on the direction of your final project. Because of this, I was able to become fairly competent in Arcmap.",

                "This was an incredibly strong course. The labs were a great addition to the course. I enjoyed getting some hand on experience and apply what we covered in lecture. I also really enjoyed the final few weeks of the semester where researchers from various disciplines explained how remote sensing can be used in each of their fields. I feel like, while very broad, the lecture content gave me the background necessary to understand exactly what I was doing when interacting with satellite data and guide my approach to solving the issues that arose as I executed my final project. The open-ended final project was a great opportunity to think creatively regarding how remote sensing can be used as a versatile tool. I was VERY appreciative of how we didn't have any homework or exams in the second half of the semester. This gave me the chance to make my final project actually come together in time."

The applications of remote sensing are truly limitless and with some creativity it can be used to answer some pretty outlandish questions. Seeing the completion of everyone's final project at the end of the course really goes to show how the course excels in giving students what they need to actually understand and apply remote sensing to answer the questions they find most interesting. Working with the data can be frustrating and time consuming at times, but with enough patience and planning this course is an absolute pleasure to take."
