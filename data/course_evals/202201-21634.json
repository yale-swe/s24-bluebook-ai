                "Pat taught the course in a very engaging and fun way, so I was able to work through dense and confusing ideas and understand what was going on without too much difficulty. The structure of the course seemed nonlinear at times, like we were going between unrelated topics, but that seems inevitable in an analysis class.",
                "More homework assignments would be good for practice.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Great ULAs. They were extremely helpful during their OHs and went beyond my expectation in terms of their engage with students and encouraging collaboration among students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Grades for assignments should be returned to students in a more timely fashion. \r\n- If grades cannot be provided sooner, then the assignment answers should be posted after assignments are complete because they will help students study for midterms and the final.",
                "Strengths: pretty much everything about this course, from the material to the professor (Pat) to the assignments and take-home exams.\r\nWeaknesses: hard to think of any. It will be hard to improve on this course when Pat is teaching it.",
                "Introductory real analysis can be a dull class. However, Pat has a great, great talent for teaching mathematics in a fun, engaging, and approachable way. The course was very successful on the merits of Pat alone. The lectures were very followable, even as more difficult topics were broached. The course didn't follow a textbook very closely, which made review a little more difficult, especially as no lecture notes or guides were posted beyond the second week.",
                "Strengths: Pat is wonderful! Weaknesses: Grading is very slow and pset answers are not regularly posted, which makes it difficult to learn from previous mistakes",
                "The course is deeply engaging and well taught. However, homework was assigned somewhat inconsistently and take-home exams (though convenient) made the course feel slightly informal.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was the lectures. They were very engaging and informative; I definitely learned a lot. The psets were also enjoyable, they took a decent amount of time especially as someone who has never done proofs before, but they were never a waste of time. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course was its timing. A lot of the grading took a super long time, so we had four psets and a midterm handed in before even getting the second pset back.",
                "Pat is really cool and makes the class enjoyable",
                "Strengths: Pat! Pat is one of the best professors I've ever had at Yale. The content is also interesting and combines in ways that allow you to solve cool problems. Weaknesses: There's so much in the course that sometimes I wasn't sure how everything fit together, but usually if you hold on long enough it'll come together soon.",
                "pat is a FANTASTIC instructor so sad to see him leave, he made material very engaging.",
                "I really appreciated the support that Pat and the ULAs gave, such as office hours, workshops, lounge hours and reviews. Pat is an amazing professor and very fair when it comes to grading.",
                "Strengths: Pat is an incredible lecturer and made the material extremely accessible and enjoyable to study. The p-sets and exams were very manageable and generally fun to work on. Weaknesses: feedback on our assignments was often delayed.",
                "Strengths: Pat is awesome.\r\nWeaknesses: Weeks without psets made understanding material more difficult. Didn't necessarily want more work for this class, but more evenly spaced work would have been better.",
                "strength: supportive ULAs and a collaborative environment, another strength of the course was the professor - Pat",
                "The strength is hands-down Pat Devlin. The best Math professor that the Yale math department has seen in a while, who unfortunately is leaving Yale. Pat is the reason I wanted to be a math major and Pat is the reason why so many of my friends and I got interested in math. He made it fun, interesting, and exciting, and he made it a welcoming, inclusive space.",
                "very proof based if you like that, i definitely do. psets are not too time consuming and generally interesting and super relevant to the material",
                "I think we could have spent more time on different notions of continuity. The course slowed down a ton while developing the tools for derivatives and integrals when it did not need to. Due to the large size of the course and lack of graders/ULAs we didn't get feedback in a timely manner. The learning culture that Pat creates is second to none. Because students are encourage to work together and talk through problems, they gain a deeper understanding than they would get on their own. The support from the teacher was first-rate.",
                "This course was good at presenting the often-thorny ideas of analysis in an intuitive, digestible way. It was especially friendly to non-math majors. The ULAs and office hours were great. However, for people with significant prior experience in college-level math, the first half of the course proceeded slowly. (That said, there were always fun, completely optional problems as extra challenges on both psets and exams.) Also, it took a while to get feedback on problem sets and exams.",
                "I think this class was very well taught for student learning. The psets were difficult but good at helping us learn and practice the material. The lectures were engaging and the exams felt like good checkpoints for learning what I needed to work on. The TAs were incredibly approachable and helpful, and office hours were held often which was amazing.",
                "Strengths: Really interesting material. Really taught me how to write better rigorous proofs. Made me excited for future real and complex analysis courses. Pat and his ULAs are so amazing, but I won't focus too much on them here since Pat's leaving for Swarthmore next year. Weaknesses: Figuring the psets out might be a pain if you're adamant about not going to office hours (which are amazing, super chill, and extremely helpful). My humanities/social science major friends who took this got really overwhelmed even when taking it on Cr/D, so it might be worth considering a different course if you're 100% sure you don't want to major in math (or physics).",
                "Strengths were the support system behind the class, including Pat and the TAs. Lectures were interesting and office hours were helpful. Could be improved by making exams in person. Exams felt like another pset. Weaknesses were that barely any feedback was given and it took way too long to grade problem sets.",
                "The course is organized really well, the TAs were helpful, and the lectures were interesting",
                "The class's strength's are Pat's engaging lectures and all the lengths he would go to accommodate different students.",
                "Strengths: Pat is great, and the material is super cool when all of the concepts come together.\r\nWeaknesses: There is a pretty steep learning curve at the start of the course if you don't have experience with that kind of mathematical thinking.",
                "Pat explained the material very well, however, much of the class was still virtual",
                "PAT IS SO AMAZING I only wish he responded a little more to emails. Yale you are very stupid for letting him leave.",
                "One word: Pat",
                "Classes were fun to attend. Material was pretty good. The homeworks were long. I enjoyed the take home format of the exams.",
                "Professor Devlins teaching is the greatest strength of this course. The problem sets are directly based on the material covered in class, where complex concepts are taught clearly and in depth. I would not change anything about this course, Professor Devlin is fantastic!",
                "Strengths: I thought the class was taught really well. It was taught chronologically, and made a lot of sense. The psets were a little more challenging than the exams, but I loved them. They really made me think creatively. Take home exams was very fair as well. Favorite class of the semester. \r\nWeaknesses: No real weaknesses.",
                "This is my favorite course Ive taken at Yale so far. Pat is a wonderful person.",
                "This course is great the way it is!",
                "One strength of the course is that it gives a broad overview of the basic topics in Analysis. I didn't feel like we dived very deeply into any topics, though.",
                "This class had a very strong support system of peer tutors, and the professor was clearly kind. At the same time, the professor seemed to be a bit disorganized and there are some very important analysis topics that we did not learn. That said, the homework and exams were rigorous and helped us learn analysis. I think the professors teaching style can be a little casual, which is great for first years but for upperclassmen can feel a little frustrating when you want a rigorous solution. He clearly cared about the class, though, and seemingly had personal things going on that prevented better instruction throughout. Homework and exams were graded very late, so we had very limited feedback to go off of for future homework and exams. This got much better as the course went on, but was definitely a problem at the beginning. Overall, the restructuring of curriculum from 230 was great, but perhaps a new version of 300 for upperclassmen would have been helpful to learn more.",
                "I think the course is very good, just oddly paced at some times, which could be improved.",
                "Strengths: Pat is such a good teacher. The class was taught at a very manageable pace and everything felt very conceptual and understanding-based. Each topic naturally followed from the previous topics. PSETs were challenging at times (although probably not if you have a math background) but never overwhelming, and there were so many resources available (office hours, workshops, TAs). Exams were take-home and honor-system, which worked really well because you could just focus on applying your understanding rather than trying to regurgitate a bunch of theorems as fast as possible. I never felt like there was a \"method\" to memorize for how to solve a specific kind of problem  you spend the semester doing a bunch of proofs and by the end it feels like a pretty natural form of problem solving.\r\nWeaknesses: Pat is leaving and I don't know how much of this class being good was just because of the professor being good.",
                "Pat is a godpat also didnt care because he was leaving.",
                "The class is insanely inviting and accessible with Pat, and he explained the material in very intuitive ways. \r\n\r\nMy only drawback is that sonce Pat didnt plan the lectures very much, I feel we may not have gotten as comprehensive a course.",
                "I think this was a very strong class. The class felt difficult without being impossible as the professor had a constant role in helping and guiding students. The material was taught in such a more intuitive and understandable manner than the typical Analysis class using Rudin. I never sat in class and wondered why we were learning a specific proof, as you could see the direction the class was going.",
                "The course was a good pace and easy to follow!",
                "Strengths: Pat is a wonderful lecturer: even when the material wasn't very interesting to me, I was consistently engaged in the lectures. Also, I really like the 'for funzies' questions - even though I didn't do most of them, they were fun to think about. Their being optional meant I could do them when I had time and was interested, but didn't have to complete them when busy. It also, I think, let different students choose what was best for their own learning, which I think is really valuable especially in math classes.",
                "The little amount of pset work (only six) required for the class was both a strength and a weakness. The class became low-stress, which was great, but I did rather poorly on the exams due to lack of practice (which may be on me). A big weakness of the class was that grades came out very slowly, and I did not know how well I was doing in the class.",
                "Way too hard",
                "Pat is leaving next year so Im imaging this class would be wildly different in good and bad ways. We love you Pat!",
                "Overall a very good class. The class was very well taught and the concepts built well on each other. Proofs were interesting.",
                "Additional materials such as readings, class notes, or important proofs to review without rewatching hours of lecture.",
                "Strengths: I think a great community developed in the course over the course of working on problem sets in office hours, and I'm leaving with some new friends! It also was very approachable as a first proof-based course, even though I hadn't taken MATH 255 (but rather MATH 222). I feel a lot more confident in my proof skills (and just about math in general) after having a couple of--shall we say rough?--experiences with the department. Much of this atmosphere for the course is due to the efforts of Pat, as well as our ULAs Matt and Max, who really championed this approachable and supportive mindset throughout class and office hours. It seems like a small thing, but Pat always started each class by writing \"Glad you're here\" on the board, and let's just say I believed him.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I mean, problem sets were challenging and time-consuming, but looking back on the whole, I think they were manageable and really did help me learn. One improvement might be getting grades back faster? On the whole, I'm pleased with my experience in the course.",
                "Strengths are that the material was well explained, the TAs (Matt and Max) were absolutely amazing, Pat was so great at teaching, and everyone in that class loved to talk and learn about math together. No weaknesses.",
                "Excellent teachings, PSETS could sometimes get a little much but never too often.",
                "A really great paced math class with reasonable proofs and assignments.",
                "Strengths: course was very flexible, Pat gave us two chances to submit Psets late if needed, and made exams take-home, both of which helped us stay better prepared. He also would let us often decide what we were going to learn about in class, so it was very flexible and engaging in that way too.",
                "Strengths: Pat is an incredible professor; Yale's math department is sustaining a huge loss as he leaves this year. Lectures were engaging; problem sets and exams were of comparable difficulty to each other; and, if students were interested in exploring the topics beyond the curriculum, this was made very accessible.\r\nWeaknesses: The only potential weakness I can think of is that the pace of the lectures felt a tad slow to me, though this is perhaps attributable to the fact that I have prior experience with proof-based math.",
                "Strenghts: simple, straightforward, fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures a little too casual",
                "Pat is the best math professor I have ever had. He knows how to explain things clearly and make math approachable.",
                "The course is fine, though I wish it followed reference materials more closely.",
                "Strengths: PSETs built soooo nicely on the in-class material; Pat is a super engaging lecturer; great community within the class for finishing PSETs.; take-home exams were fair and challenging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes felt like Pat may not have been fully engaged? and feedback took a while.",
                "This course was so cool! I think the world was very manageable in terms of both problem sets and exams. I loved the take-home exams in particular. Not only were they well-designed, but the format allowed me to really think about how best to answer each question, which was very nice. The theorems and topics presented in class were cool and fit nicely together. No real weaknesses to speak of.",
                "Pat is so nice!! I love the course (actually it's the second time of me taking this, but yeah this time is way better than the previous one)",
                "Strengths: The overall atmosphere of the class is very oriented towards to collaboration, which I really appreciate because writing proofs can be a lonely process otherwise. Moreover, Pat is just a very clear and concise teacher. The problem sets are also quite straightforward as long as we review the content covered in class. \r\nWeakness: It took a while for each problem set and midterm to be graded, so often it was hard to tell how we were doing in the course.",
                "Pat is awesome -- great presentation style and amazing at office hours. Honestly, no improvements.",
                "Great course, overall. Could be improved by faster feedback allowing students to improve.",
                "Problem sets are fantastic and very well done, lectures are overall very engaging; occasionally lectures felt a little bit slow but that is certainly preferable to feeling like they are too fast.",
                "The instructor was very accommodating and worked actively to engage with his students."

                "Only if you're interested in proof-type math. There are a lot of hand-wavy, vague concepts you'll go over without much application, so the only real reason to take analysis is if you're actually interested in proving things from the ground up. A good part of the class is also non-calculus concepts, so if you're hoping for a harder calculus class, that's not exactly this class.",
                "Yes, it is required.",
                "Yes - for any student looking to take graduate school, then taking a class on real analysis will help formulate the reasoning and comprehension needed to read academic papers, especially papers that are math heavy.",
                "Yes--this course made me love math. The material is cool, interesting, often surprising, and beautiful, and Pat is an amazingly entertaining, fun, funny, kind, likeable, charismatic, friendly, helpful, reasonable, and brilliant person. I highly recommend this course to anyone (interested in math or not)!",
                "I would recommend this course to any burgeoning mathematics student. This course can easily be taken by any student who has completed AP Calculus BC. The workload is not so intense, but you come away with a strong conceptual understanding of real analysis and a better intuition behind the results of calculus.",
                "Absolutely. Very sad that Pat is leaving though.",
                "Absolutely! The content of this course is fascinating.",
                "Yes, it was a great introduction to proofs. I learned a lot and had a fun time.",
                "it can get boring sometimes because it's so abstract and theoretical and not a lot of applications, but if you enjoy abstract thinking and math this is a great class",
                "Yes, if you want to become a better mathematician or want to improve your problem-solving skills, this is a great course to take",
                "Yes! It's a really interesting area of math that will help you think in new ways. Plus, office hours are a great way to get to know students from areas across math, statistics, economics, even some bold humanities majors. It's a foundational course if you want to take more math, and even if this is the last math class you take, it rounds out all of the questions you have about how we understand calculus in a rigorous, proof-based way.",
                "yes but if you like proof-based math. material is very interesting however has no real-world application",
                "Yes! This class was very cool and great for improving problem solving.",
                "Since Pat is leaving, depends on the new professor",
                "Yes, 100%, regardless of the instructor -- analysis is an incredibly fascinating and intuitive area of math (though perhaps I'm biased because I had Pat as an instructor) and should be studied by anyone who took and enjoyed calculus. Of course having Pat as an instructor was a huge plus.",
                "Yes, but it won't be taught by Pat in the future, so I can't say for sure.",
                "I would if Pat was the professor. I tried taking it last semester with another professor, but had to drop it because it did not cater to students who did not have a proof-writing background",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning proof-based math. Take Math 225 (linear algebra) first though; it's a nicer introduction. By the way, I only took the course because Pat was teaching it. Be careful taking this in the future; it's a pre-req for a lot of classes as an intro-sequence class, but I think Pat was a gem. Should see what future teachers for this class are like.",
                "yes, if you're interested in pure mathematics. It's so interesting and a great way to learn how to write proofs and such",
                "100% Take this course if you're curious at all about math. The course won't quite be the same without Pat, but real analysis is cool and it doesn't take much thought to see how useful it is for every part of math.",
                "I would recommend this course if you're interested in the subject but don't have much proof-based math experience. If you want to be a math major and have any experience with analysis at all, I'd recommend the intensive versionyou'll be more engaged from earlier on, and you'll see some important things you'd miss in this course (we didn't cover compactness, for example).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! You have to be interested in math, but it is accessible and there is a lot of support.",
                "For a math major, you have to take it (and don't fret, it's a great class! :). For a humanities/social science major, probably not. For any STE majors, real analysis is a beautiful area of mathematics, but it has no real (hehe) applications, so don't expect to learn anything in this class that will be useful for your field -- with the exception that physicists might take this with the intention of taking complex analysis (which actually does have applications in physics :)",
                "Yes, Pat is a great lecturer and the course is vital for the understanding of more advanced analysis courses",
                "I think this class will look pretty different with Pat. If he were teaching, I would unequivocally recommend the class to another student. Without Pat, I would recommend the class to anyone who wants to explore pure math and think about calculus in an abstract way.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It is very informative and teaches useful skills. I learned a lot about writing proofs and analysis.",
                "Yes for math majors, because you learn a lot of interesting concepts.",
                "Yes, especially if you want to expand what your conception of math is. There are no calculations - it's all problem solving. You get to think outside the box and learn some really cool concepts. It can be pretty frustrating at times if you are stuck on a proof, but it's really rewarding to get to the end of a problem set.",
                "Yes! Pat is an awesome professor and the material is very interesting.",
                "This was one of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale, but that was almost entirely because of Pat. I think the professor makes your experience in this course.",
                "If Pat is teaching, this class is a no-brainer",
                "I would recommend this class if youre needing to fulfill a math elective for a major. I dont think its super applicable or would help me a lot in my major.",
                "Absolutely! Because Professor Devlin is leaving, Im not sure how the course will change in the future, but I would absolutely recommend it to another student if it will be taught in a similar way.",
                "If I were to recommend this class, 99% of the reason would be because Pat teaches it. Unfortunately he will be leaving Yale after the semester :( That said, the material itself is pretty interesting to learn (it's like the proofs behind very basic calculus), so if it interests you then definitely at least shop this class. That said, you won't get into derivatives or integrals until pretty late in the semester. We mostly focused on all the foundational stuff that you need to know before learning about those things, i.e. sets, neighborhoods, sequences, limits, etc. You will probably end the semester looking at the fundamental theorem of calculus.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Understand that this class has very few applications to the real world, but is a great class to get more in the nitty-gritty of math. It feels like we are continuously solving different math puzzles. The difficulty was a good level as well.",
                "Yes! Honestly, I only took this course because Pat was teaching it, but it was super helpful for physics and statistics classes! I loved the material.",
                "Yes! Pat did a great job and made this class enjoyable.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to a math (or econ?) major. Seems like a good foundational class.",
                "I would recommend this class! Its such a kind and nice introduction to math, and while the material can take time to get used to, the class is well-equipped to help facilitate learning and growth. Would recommend to any major.",
                "Yes, with Pat! Hes great and approaches math very intuitively. And in general, analysis is a very applicable topic and is a good beginning to proof writing.",
                "Yes, but only if they want to do math.",
                "It was a great course, very interesting and applicable, and you learn how to write proofs which is very useful. But a lot of that is because Pat is a great teacher; I don't know what the next professor will be like.",
                "Ya, you likely need it if you are reading this",
                "Yes! Although I loved the class so much mainly because of Pat (who is leaving :((( ) the material was super interesting. If you love pure math, youll most likely enjoy the material a lot.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to others, but this is mostly due to the brilliance and wonderfulness of the professor!",
                "Yes! Especially if you're planning on majoring in math.",
                "Yes, if interested in or curious about proof-based math (although a lot of this class was Pat, and I can't vouch for it without him). I personally was not sure whether I was interested in proof-based math, and after taking the class I am still somewhat unsure, but leaning no. This in no way reflects on the class - I enjoyed it most of the time, and never felt that it was too difficult - it just didn't feel that exciting to me.",
                "Yes, although I can only speak for Pat (who is leaving) when I say this. He's probably one of the best math professors out there, and it's unfortunate that future math students won't get to experience Pat's engaging lectures. He had a great support system in place for everyone. He along with the TAs were incredibly dedicated to office hours, holding them from afternoon to evening almost every weekday. The only problem with the class was everyone involved experienced serious burnout, which slowed the pacing and the lessened the amount of content we covered. Just be a bit more cautious about how you write your proofs, because the graders for 255 were shockingly harsh.",
                "No. In fact I have told many people not to take it.",
                "Again, next year will be different but I think the material is super fun as someone whos interested in proof based calc",
                "Yes, with a good teacher, this class can be quite interesting. The proofs were fun to think about and was a very manageable class.",
                "Yes. Pat was a phenomenal instructor and helped shape the course into an intuitive introduction to analysis and promote a strong idea of proof and reason.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if it's run similarly to how it was this semester. Pat was a wonderfully encouraging professor and really did make math fun. I always liked calculus, so I found the material really interesting as well! It also was very approachable as a first proof-based course, even though I hadn't taken MATH 255 (but rather MATH 222). I feel a lot more confident in my proof skills (and just about math in general) after having a couple of--shall we say rough?--experiences with the department. Much of this atmosphere for the course is due to the efforts of Pat, as well as our ULAs Matt and Max, who really championed this approachable and supportive mindset throughout class and office hours. I know Pat's leaving after this semester, so I hope that whoever teaches this class in the future continues to foster this kind of atmosphere.",
                "Yes 100%. Regardless of whether you are considering the math major, please please take real analysis. From learning how to organize logical thoughts into the form of a proof to struggling together with others to solve a problem, this course does wonders for how you look at math in the future.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. For anybody scared about the learning curve of a math class, this class facilitates that curve extremely well.",
                "Yes, It is an interesting class that helps you better understand everything you learn in calculus - limits, derivatives, integrals, etc. If you are interested in math and want to learn to write proofs and study math in a more rigorous way than your calc classes, then take MATH 255",
                "Yes! This course strikes the ideal balance of being challenging enough to stimulate students without overworking them and burning them out. Though I'm not sure how it will be handled by future professors, I imagine it will remain one of the best options for exploring proof-based math for those who don't have much background in the subject matter.",
                "Its a nice, easy math class, one that you should be excited to take as a math major.  You can consider taking it as a non-math major but to be honest analysis is not really useful in pure math.",
                "Yes! Especially if you think you don't like math. This was the first math course I took that made me want to learn more of it.",
                "YES. Any course with Pat!",
                "Yes! Go Pat! The class was very interestingit was an interesting subject taught by an interesting professor.",
                "YES!!! Analysis is super cool, and some of the proofs/theorems we covered were very pretty. I think everyone should take a proof-based course, and this is a really nice one to take.",
                "take more time on this course, the content is difficult",
                "Yes. Pat is amazing at teaching. I thought real analysis would be very hard, but he made it fun.",
                "Yes! Completely recommend! Interesting content and exciting to see 'behind the scenes' of calculus.",
                "Yes!",
                "If you like pure math, absolutely, this class is very enjoyable and interesting, and not overwhelming.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student especially if they are a mathematics major as analysis is one of the fundamental pillars of mathematics."
