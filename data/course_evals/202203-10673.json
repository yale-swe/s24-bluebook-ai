I also feel like the activities in class were fun but that test prep and conceptual reviews would be more helpful in place of theses activities. I also believe that more cumulative reviews would be beneficial.",
                "The course is done well in conjunction with VHL Learning (Supersite) as that website gives good preparation for the grammatical structures we are to learn in class. In terms of weaknesses, the class is very fast paced. Sometimes too fast paced to learn from. The course covers a large amount of breadth, but rarely the depth necessary to truly understand anything. I feel like I was not given ample time to struggle with the language in class, as the curriculum was so faced paced that the professor was forced to move on and simply give me the answer. I feel like struggling with the language is a crucial step in learning the language and I wish I was given the chance to do so. I hope future students are given that chance.",
                "I think a weakness of this course was too much extra assignments and work. The time spent on some of the extra assignments could have been used to study and practice the fundamentals.",

                "The amount of professor teaching of concepts could be improved. Minimal strengths of this course.",
                "strength: you acquire a working knowledge of a language by participating every day. weaknesses: the course moves extremely quickly. its often difficult to tell which concepts are important and which are just included as busy work. important concepts are often touched on once and then never revisited. everything is in spanish, so if you don't understand something you are quickly left behind. no time is allotted to solidify understanding before moving on to a completely new topic."
