   "comments": [
    "I gained an overall understanding of American Indian educational history, institutional resistance, and cultural perseverance. I developed a deeper knowledge of the inhuman, assimilative practices that Indigenous people were (are in many ways continue to be) subject to. In contrast, I also learned how tribal, sovereign nations have used their power to establish their own schools, with intentions of preserving and strengthening their communities and traditions for future generations.",
    "I think I greatly improved my research skills and my writing skills, particularly with our final research paper assignment.  However, the most important thing I gained from this course was an understanding of Native perspectives throughout history and in the current day.  Prior to taking this class, I had been ignorant about this subject and was fascinated with learning more; today, I know so much more about Native history and current struggles and successes in society.",
    "I learned about American Indian history from the lens of education. I improved my writing, especially for the book review, and wrote a lengthy historical research paper for the first time.",
    "I learned about the educational history of Native Americans, analyzing historic events and their effects on Native Americans. We also learned how to write effective, college-level papers.",
    "grammar help\r\nhow to develop a thesis",
    "I gained a great insight into the world of Native Americans in Higher Education.",
    "Some skills that I developed are being able to write more effectively and smoothly so that my point comes across a lot stronger and finding a deep analysis of texts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The conversations were not as engaging and lively as they could have been, perhaps due to the early start time of the seminar. Maybe being guided by a few discussion questions each class would help instigate conversation. I think that I would have liked to learn more about current action that American Indians are apart of as it pertains to education. This could be improved by providing more material that is recent, talking with American Indian educational institutions that are currently in operation.",
    "This course was very interesting and I appreciated that we read different types of sources to get a more comprehensive image of Native roles in higher education.  Other strengths of this course include a good balance between lecture and class discussion and multimedia projects.  The only weakness I can see in this course is that it seemed unstructured at times, especially in the second half of the semester.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- historical research paper at the end\r\n- discussion based\r\n- good work load\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- sometimes class wasn't productive because we'd get off topic or the professor would take too long to explain a simple concept\r\n- field trips could have been more organized\r\n- office hours only once a week and focused on graduate students\r\n- I didn't really know my classmates even though it's a seminar class. There could've been more community building in the first weeks.",
    "The course was very student driven, helping to keep students engaged and interested. There was nothing of note in regards to weaknesses.",
    "strengths - important content and lots of respect paid to the material we were studying, brought in awesome speakers from many backgrounds, gave us a lot of freedom on final project which I feel helped us learn more!!\r\n\r\nweaknesses - prof could give more instruction\/articulated more of what he wanted to see so we could improve",
    "Strength:\r\nVery hands on, the professor cares about us and our journey through this new field of study for us, the assigned readings were a great introductory lesson into American Indians in general\r\nWeakness:\r\nThe course could get a tad sluggish at times, and it was felt that a small amount of class time was wasted from time to time",
    "The strengths of this course were the interactive aspect of the class, the wonderful texts we analyzed, and the group environment. The weakness of this course was the lack of conversation that happened at some points, but that was also partly the fault of the students in the class and their lack of participation."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend it for another student, especially if you have a connection toward Indian boarding schools and\/or are interested in the educational history of American Indians. The topic is extremely interesting, and it taught me a lot.",
    "I would recommend every student to take this course because knowledge of indigenous topics is essential to combatting ignorance, and it is fascinating to learn about subjects that are rarely taught in our current educational system.  Even more importantly than drastic improvement in writing and confidence in research and paper organization is the appreciation of Native cultures, history, and peoples that this class establishes.",
    "If you haven't taken any classes about American Indian history, I'd recommend it because it's a good overview of information. However, it was broad and could be viewed as a wasteful class since the discussions didn't aid my learning (just the readings).",
    "Yes, it was very interesting and engaging, with Professor Blackhawk encouraging students to come to new and interesting ideas.",
    "yes!!!! learn about things you've probably never heard of before!!",
    "Yes, I would highly encourage this to anyone who desires to become more enriched with the American Indian history and pathways through higher ed",
    "Yes!! This class was amazing and exposed me to a lot of history that I was never told about in high school history classes. Also, the field trips and different forms of teaching (visiting lectures, art gallery, etc) were truly amazing and allowed me to learn in different formats. I really enjoyed the class and the way we were able to do so many things."
