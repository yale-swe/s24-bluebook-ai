                "How to use different tools (graphite, charcoal, conte crayon, colored pencil), drawing tips and techniques, collage",
                "I learnt to draw! Now it's a regular part of my life. This class was really good motivation to tackle increasingly interesting artistic assignments. I went from not knowing how to draw to sketching regularly for fun and making it a regular habit. The collage assignment was also really valuable, because it gave me a new appreciation for the things around me and a desire to make cool and beautiful things. I loved spending the semester with these 19 people, because seeing their art styles develop was incredibly valuable to mine. Fantastic class which I'm really glad I took.",
                "In this class, I learned what it is to be an artist. What is means to think about art and how to translate those ideas into a piece. I learned how to truly appreciate others' art in deeper ways by observing the artists' thought processes behind the piece and why they made specific choices. Everything from material used, placement, strokes, and even empty space are all conscious decisions. I learned to apply this to my own art and thanks to this class, developed a more nuanced understanding of the entire process of making art.",
                "I really grew a lot in my artistic abilities, confidence, and my ability to think thoughtfully/critically about other art.",
                "I earned about composition, scaling/ proportions, and different mark-making and was encouraged to tap into creativity and explore various mediums/art forms such as collage. I also appreciated the emphasis on critiquing each other's work, observing deeply and learning to recognize different elements of art."

                "Fantastic engagement, great comments from the instructor and TF. You really improve and it's wonderful to get to see 19 other people improving alongside you.",
                "The weaknesses truly depend on what you wanted to get out of this course. If you wanted to learn basic drawing skills from scratch, this is not the class for you. The target demographic for this course is someone who is artistically inclined, which is not to mean they are good at art. But at least someone that would be open to learning about art and is receptive to the values the professor is trying to teach. This class truly teaches you how to mold your existing skills into something more, something you probably wouldn't have even thought of. You get to develop some of those skills, but that isn't the point. The point is to incorporate the feedback and to change your way of thinking about art. And that is exactly what it did for me. I am grateful that it was like this because you can learn to draw anywhere, but there are only a few places when you can learn to think like an artist and how to incorporate it in your life. Another strength is that you have the opportunity to try various media and are given the space to truly let your creativity run wild. I would find myself sitting in my room just thinking what I wanted to do for my next project, planning it out in my head, and that was honestly my favorite part, giving myself the dedicated time to be creative.",
                "The first two units (still life and figure drawing) were really well organized to help facilitate our learning and also help us experiment with different materials. The feedback we received was clear and consistent, helping us discover our styles and explore different approaches. The last two units (collage and our final project) were interesting and good but I wish we had a little more structure (perhaps smaller portions of each class to do more in-class drawing to keep up the routines).",
                "Strengths: very flexible and open, able to develop projects in any direction; supportive teaching; loved Alex, our TA, as well as the field trips to the YUAG  and the Yale British Art Gallery\r\nWeaknesses: I would have appreciated a bit more technical instruction at the beginning (students came from different levels of experience, so at times, it felt like some techniques/ concepts were assumed knowledge)",
                "I really liked the class but felt a bit confused why we did collage instead of drawing with ink like other classes. Also I wouldve loved more discussion on anatomy and figure drawing focused more on the body than the clothes"

                "Yes! I felt like I improved so much, especially as someone who is not necessarily artisitically gifted",
                "As a non-art-major, I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who is remotely interested in art or drawing, regardless of how bad of an artist you think you are. It doesn't matter if you suck at drawing, the class focuses more on the thought behind the artwork and the decisions made, rather than how realistically you can render an object in front of you with perfect accuracy. Of course, some of the other students in the class will be crazy talented, but I think Matt does a good job of leveling the playing field by encouraging experienced artists out of their comfort zone, so that the class is engaging for everyone. He also often praises the work of non-art-majors due to their unique approaches that they take, which someone who has years of art training would never think to do. In terms of workload, the class is pretty chill, and you usually get time in class to work on projects so you don't need to spend a ton of time outside of class if you're making good use of that time. Sidenote: This class will make you look at things differently, like noticing the patterns of light and shadow on your friends' faces, which I think is really cool.",
                "Absolutely. If you've ever felt the desire to learn to draw, this is the class for you!",
                "Absolutely. Although you must be willing to give this class your all. That doesn't mean it'll take all of your time, but when you are in it, it requires a special type of focus unlike any other class of have taken at Yale. Only that way can you maximize your enjoyment.",
                "Yes, definitely!",
