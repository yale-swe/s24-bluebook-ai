    "This course has given me a good foundation in Italian grammar and vocabulary. I think it will prove useful for my further studies in Italian and languages generally. It also incorporated readings about Italian culture into the language work in an interesting and accessible way.",
    "Significantly improved my competency w\/r\/t key italian grammar\/vocab, improved written\/spoken skill",
    "In the span of five weeks, I really feel I was able to improve my grasp of Italian. This class clearly emphasized speaking, and we were given many opportunities to practice. I now feel far more confident in my ability to speak Italian. I also feel I have a better grasp of the grammar I learned in L1 and L2 and I can access a more vivid vocabulary. I also learned more about Italian culture.",
    "I learned Intermediate Italian. We worked out of the textbook mostly, with some presentations and other activities. I learned extensive vocabulary and reviewed grammatical structures.",
    "A better understanding of Italian grammar and much better conversational skills.",
    "A far better understanding of the Italian language and culture, that concluded my experience of Italian on a satisfying and enjoyable note.",
    "Learning a language remotely sucks",
    "Italian grammar, writing, reading, vocabulary, speaking, etc."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: awesome teachers, very organized, quick grading\r\n\r\nDisadvantages: none",
    "Although Simona and Sarah were given a short amount of time to adapt this class from its original in person setting in Italy to an alternative online version, they did a wonderful job. I felt we were given ample time to practice our spoken Italian in class. The online textbook was a great resource, and Simona and Sarah used it very well; we always had access to extra activities for practice, but the workload never felt overwhelming. I also truly enjoyed going to this class everyday because the professors and students alike created such an encouraging and engaging environment. Sarah and Simona were also extremely receptive to feedback throughout the course. The only weakness was that I would have liked more specific feedback on oral exams, but by the end of the course this had already been changed because of how receptive the professors were to student feedback.",
    "Strengths -- Sarah and Simona worked really well together, online format was executed with few glitches, it was fun talking to the other students in the breakout rooms (in Italian). The presentations were good.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- No huge ones. Oral quizzes were stressful but I really liked the TA so it wasn't so bad.\r\n\r\nIt isn't the Siena program but it was still pretty darn fun!",
    "Had a really good emphasis on conversational skills and explained grammar concepts very well, but I felt like they expected too high of a level of speaking given our level.",
    "I enjoyed almost every aspect of the course except for some of the technological aspects, which I think the professors know about are addressing. I do think that orals and compositions were marked too harshly which was a little discouraging.",
    "It was a very good class. The best thing was having the 10 minute break in between sessions",
    "Great course, I like the way the sequence is structured. L3 is review-based, and I felt like I needed to brush up on everything I previously learned.\r\nAligned well with my motivations in that sense."

    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to develop a basic understanding of Italian language and culture. It is both fun and instructive.",
    "Yes, very well taught; thoroughly enjoyed the class",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student and have already recommended classes in the Italian department to many of my friends at Yale. I truly enjoyed this class--the professors were kind and engaging, the workload was consistent and fair, the content was interesting and fun, and the class environment was extremely supportive. I have found the Italian department to be one of my favorite departments at Yale, and this class has only further strengthened my interest in taking more Italian classes in the future.",
    "Yes! It's a laid-back way to get your language credit done over the summer. Cool professors and cool students. I learned a lot and had fun.",
    "Yes, it was a good class and adapted very well given the pandemic.",
    "Yes, Sarah and Simona are wonderful to work with, and their different approaches to teaching balanced each other well.",
    "Nah",
    "Absolutely, I love the Italian dept and everything about it."
