                "I really loved how accomodating and welcoming this course and the teaching team were throughout the 5 week course. I couldn't have asked for a better way to learn physics! Having the built-in extensions and an incredible TA truly made this course exceptional and I am so grateful that I was a part of it.\r\n\r\nOne piece of feedback would be about the PLAs. Having PLAs really increased the workload due on Sundays and made the course a bit overwhelming. I also think having 3 PLAs was taxing and 1 or 2 would do and serve the purpose of getting us a hands-on experience.",
                "Strengths of the course include a very clear instructions, interesting experiments, and amazing teaching assistants/professors. It could be improved by encouraging more group collaboration.",
                "I actually really enjoyed how this class was set up. Everything felt practical to the class.",
                "Interesting topics but it got a little tiring to watch all the videos online. the PLA assignments were a bit repetitive considering we had to turn in two lab reports a week already.",
                "Strengths - well adapted to online learning, instructors were very enthusiastic and passionate\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - very tedious work at times, a lot of busy work",
                "The course does a great job trying to replicate the in-person experience for the online semesters. I think the lab-handouts do a great job explaining and helping students through understanding the material. The only thing I think that could be improved is an explanation of how the course will work at the very first lab because we were just thrown in without really knowing what to do. Additionally, I think it could be more explicitly explained what the expectations of the PLAs are.",
                "Some of the labs are great and straight-forward, but some of the labs are hopelessly confusing and do not provide clarity about physics or physics lab techniques. This could be as a result of the online format through which I took both physics general labs.",
                "Most of the labs were too long to finish during the lab session. So, I had to finish the end of the lab by myself, without a professor or TF there. There aren't really office hours for this course, which is another significant weakness, as there isn't always time to talk about the material during the lab session. I think the labs could be shortened without any detrimental effect on learning. A couple office hours/week would be helpful. More coordination between the professors and TF could also improve the course, as I'd sometimes get conflicting instructions from the profs, TFs, and the lab handouts.",
                "Strengths: well-taught, lots of support, interesting labs that were all doable, the workload was manageable\r\nWeaknesses: all the labs except maybe one went over the 3 hours of the lab"

Otherwise, no, don't waste your time on a class that won't really enhance your education and understanding of physics. That being said, it is a pretty easy class to be successful in as compared to other labs I have taken, so that is a plus.",
                "Only if it's required. The grading is fine and it's not all that much work, but the 3-hour sessions and the long labs are a pain. I think it'd be hard to take at the same time as 180 unless you have a good physics background already.",
