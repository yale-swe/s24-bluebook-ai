I placed myself into this class as a heritage speaker and Professor Quang offers packets for heritage speakers who didn't take L1 and L2 to do so they can catch up and work on their writing skills. There is plenty of practice to speak and I definitely became a lot more comfortable with my reading and speaking skills with this class.",

At times, the workload definitely felt very hard though, but since he is so flexible with deadlines, I did not see this as a huge issue.",

The best way to describe this class is chaotic good. At times, it may feel a little messy in terms of structure, but I believe Prof Quang is doing his best to help students learn. All he wants is for your success, and as long as you make an effort to turn in your assignments , you will do fine and improve your Vietnamese.",

                "Yes. The course helps strengthen heritage Vietnamese speakers' grasp on the language, especially with writing. As a student without any background in Vietnamese, the course was more challenging than non-accelerated L3 language courses at Yale, but I nonetheless felt very accommodated and learned a lot.",
                "Yes. If you are a Vietnamese person who has lost touch with your mother language, this is the class to take. I am feeling more confident about my VIetnamese and I know after finishing L4 next semester, I will be able to talk to relatives without embarrassing myself."
