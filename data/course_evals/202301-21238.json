I also learned about the specifics of the developmental processes in certain organisms. More generally, I learned about the processes that occur during development and how each step leads to the next, from fertilization to creating a fully-developed organism.

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: you do go through a lot of content, which is useful. Professor O'Donnell is also a really good lecturer and really tries to make things clear for you.\r\nWeaknesses: we go through content really fast and it's hard to pay attention for the whole lecture, I also wish there was more content on the slides since I am a visual learner and won't always catch what the professor says.",
                "The powerpoints were not great -- I wish there was more text on the slides and fewer images. Also, the lectures jumped around a bit making it hard to keep track of the information. I never really felt prepared for the quizzes and had to go over the material multiple times because it wasn't clear in class. Also in regards to quizzes, our TAs would simply mark questions wrong but would not really write what the correct answer would be or why our answer was wrong. Additionally grading for the quizzes was rather varied with multiple people putting the same answer and receiving different scores.",
                "In all honesty, I walked into BIOL 103 with the idea that I would come out of the class having mastered the concepts, but in reality I didnt. The material was extremely dense, the class moved by fast, the quizzes were too short, we received feedback on some of our stuff too late, and we wouldve gone the entire course without lecture recordings had we not asked for it.\r\n\r\nI never did crosses before or knew half of the terminology used in the class, but it was assumed that I did, so it was tough.",
                "This course gives a very detailed introduction to genetics and development. If you are seriously interested in biology, it is a great course to learn lots of valuable information. There was a lot of information given in each lecture, with zero breaks during lecture time. This made it difficult to stay focused and sharp during the entire time, but it was a good challenge.",
                "Strengths: The professor was pretty engaging during lecture. I also felt like the pacing was pretty okay.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like the class is trying to do too much. Theres the lectures/quizzes on development, discussion papers, and the research proposal assignments each week, and it feels a bit overwhelming. Also sometimes the topics feel like they change very abruptly.",
                "The slides used for this class were not the most organized. Some were repetitive with minimal changes from one slide to another (which was good for presentation during lecture), but it made notetaking a hassle. Maybe deleting all of the repetitive slides could be an administrative task that would improve post-lecture review of the material.",
                "Strengths: The individual project that acts as homework for this class was incredibly time consuming (and not super well explained), but was ultimately very rewarding, and interesting to create. I liked that I could center my research proposal around a topic of interest.\r\nWeaknesses: One of the main weaknesses of this course are the quizzes. Even if you memorized every single note you took during lecture, it was nearly impossible to get a score above an 80%. The quizzes were incredibly difficult, and at times unfair. Additionally, the grading was completely unfair, and not consistent across quizzes or students. Given that we took quizzes every week of the course, you would think that we got the hang of them - we didn't. The averages were extremely low, and they were just not reflective of the content we looked at in class.",
                "The course is structured very well although a couple times I felt they were just throwing names of genes at us and expecting us to remember all of them. Sometimes it was hard to distinguish which were important or not.",
                "We did not receive feedback in a timely manner, which made it very difficult to improve for the quizzes.",
                "Strengths: Professor is fun and patient with his students\r\nweaknesses: a lot of content, advertised as a class for people that have not taken biology but in reality very very challenging for those who have no bio experience, many topics/skills just glossed over. Also, the quizzes are very applicant based towards the content but there are no psets to prepare for the types of questions. The homework research project was unhelpful for me in my learning and overall only added to my stress or took time away from studying for quizzes",
                "Why are peer tutors only on weekends? Very inconvenient to reach consistent help other than through EdDiscussion",
                "The Professor was very good and the content interesting, however the jump between topics every week was a bit random and we hopped back and forth between genetics and neurology a bit",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures, supportive materials and TAs\r\nWeaknesses: Difficult quizzes, challenging to prepare",
                "overall good class, recommend going to enrichment sessions",
                "Weaknesses: Lecture does not prepare you for the quizzes, the quizzes are heinous and 15 minutes is just not enough time to test out abilities when the final gave us like three time the amount of time, and if you zone out for even a second you will be lost in the lecture. Orgo was easier than this class in my opinion, and that is really saying something. The other bio classes rewarded hard work. This class reward good testing, which really frustrated me. This class just generally made me feel so defeated. Grading was also never consistent. One TA will grade nicely, another TA will take off all points for a question where I should have gained at least partial credit. There are also almost no studying materials other than an outline that is unhelpful because we never knew what kinds of questions to expect on the quizzes or final. How hard is it to make a pset? Get rid of the stupid assigned papers for section and give us actual problems to work on. We are all pre med or science majors; we will join a lab at some point. We can learn to read a paper then. This is intro bio. I want to know what is going to be on the exam and nothing more. Stop trying to make intro science classes relatable to our lives! We are in this class because we have to be. And the proposal was so frustrating. My TF would constantly mark off points because they expected me to use a certain experimental technique but we never learned about those techniques in class! \r\n\r\nStrengths: the material actually is pretty cool, but I often was so frustrated with the class that I didn't actually get to enjoy it.",
                "I think the weekly quizzes were hard, which is fair enough, however, students didn't have a lot of practice as we didn't do PSETs with question styles similar to these quizzes (unlike in BIOL 102 and 101). I think releasing an occasional PSET or weekly practice exams would help a lot.",
                "Strengths: the material is pretty interesting, the final project is pretty fun to do, there are a lot of avenues for support in the course (enrichment, peer tutors, TFs, etc) \r\nWeaknesses: there are no PSETs so you don't get a ton of practice with the material before the final, we have quizzes that are supposed to help with this but it would be nice to have assignments built in that help us review the material in a form other than a quiz/test",
                "I think the description of the gene project could have been better explained. Many of my friends and I struggled to understand the project.",
                "The quizzes were very hard and there was little opportunity for preparation. More preparation for how to go about these quizzes and the final exam would be useful.",
                "Strengths are Prof O'Donnell, who is engaging and seemed like a kind person, and the course content, which is interesting; sections and Ed Discussion were also helpful. We were also able to formulate a research proposal. Weaknesses are the difficulty of the quizzes compared to the content of the class (and quiz keys not being posted until the very end of the course), though a strength is that we can drop our lowest two scores; and that the homeworks were not related to the course content that was being tested.",
                "The strengths of this course improve the research proposal. Even though my ideas didn't necessarily relate to the concepts we were learning in class, I still gained a lot of skills relating to crafting a proposal and researching topics without any guidelines. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course are how developmental topics are taught. We went very in-depth with specific examples of organisms, but it felt like those ideas did not have general applications. This made it hard to remember all the individual processes and the specific features/genes associated with each. I am not sure how this could be improved because I feel like my understanding of the study of development is very weak."

And the proposal was so frustrating. My TF would constantly mark off points because they expected me to use a certain experimental technique but we never learned about those techniques in class! The proposal was not helpful at all, either. I'm not a bio major. I've already written proposals for summer grants (many second year students have done this) and have received funding before, and given that I am not a bio major, this was a massive waste of my time. Once again, get rid of the proposal and GIVE US PSETS AND STUDY MATERIALS! We are not PhD students--this is INTRO. BIO. It's a prereq, and we need to do well in the course because this content is not going away. Please learn to restructure the class to make sure we remember the content (Prof Timothy Newhouse did phenomenal job with this, because a year later I still remember everything from organic chemistry. I remember almost nothing from this classes and its been like two weeks).",
                "I think the course is hard but can be interesting. I think most people who take the course take it for prereqs or major requirements; I think it can be an enjoyable course but I don't think I would recommend it to people who don't need to take it for one of those reasons.",
