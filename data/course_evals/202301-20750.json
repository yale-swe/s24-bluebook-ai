                "The strengths are definitely the linear progression of projects as they never felt too rushed or enforced in terms of prompt/artistic response. At first glance, a weakness would probably be how long the class itself is, but Mike packs so much content and skill-learning into every class that I've never felt like time was dragging.",
                "The course is incredibly well organized and I loved that we got to focus on a longer project for most of the semester while still learning new things each week. In addition, Mike brought in really great guest speakers who changed the way I thought about animation as a type of art and as a field.",
                "Overall, I think the course is very well planned. Students have reasonable time to develop their main projects, and are exposed during class to new techniques and to existing work by other artists, which serves as aesthetic inspiration. The only point I would mention is that the in-person classes are very long (however, I recognize the duration is necessary for this class, since we always had material to cover during the time of our meetings)."

                "Yes! It was a great course that was very engaging and exposed me to a lot of concepts I never would have come across. You do have to be willing to put in the work, but the results are so worth it.",
                "Yes! I think this class is amazing, but it is a big time commitment.",
                "Yes! Wonderful intro course to animation, I learned so much!!",
                "Yes, I would. The class is an excellent way to delve into Digital Animation, and it is helpful either if you're a beginner or if you've worked with animation previously. It is very engaging and prompts students to take part in discussions, learn to give/receive feedback on animation pieces and develop individual projects."
