                "A deep understanding of Deaf culture, a more complete understanding of ASL and its different elements, and an immersion into the language not offered by any other language course at Yale. Truly an incredible class.",
                "We continued to learn more about the basics of ASL and continued practicing conversational skills for ASL",
                "I learned how to ask for requests, give directions and build skills for longer conversations. I think the storytelling units are very helpful for giving more context about why facial expressions and body shifting are important for creating more engaging stories.",
                "I loved this class!! I was able to expand on my ASL knowledge and engage more with students at Yale and the wider Deaf community. I am now more confident in my signing abilities and can't wait for ASL130!",
                "I think I really improved my ASL knowledge - receptive and especially receptive. I also learned about ASL poetry and story-telling.",

You not only get the opportunity to learn ASL but get to immerse yourself in the community through several events over the course of the semester (even some that you get to spearhead yourself). I think every school should have an ASL program, especially one as engaging and collaborative as this one!",
                "The strengths are that it was very engaging, and the small class size was beneficial.",
                "This course is fantastic. Its strengths are the depth of learning and the amazing engagement within the Deaf community. The gem of the class is service\/research projects which force students to step outside of their usual bubbles and produce something that is beneficial to the Deaf community and makes the campus better for its Deaf participants. Andrew is the best.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fisher !!",
                "Strength is the professor and the way the class emphasizes in-class interactions. Makes the class very engaging and fun. No weaknesses!",
                "Depending on the professor youll get a different experience, but Fisher was really great and he really encourages the class to practice and try emulating stories and scenes. He aligns his class content with the homework more which is helpful when completing the homeworks.",
                "I really thought this class was conducive to learning, and I appreciated the effort put into every lecture powerpoint. There were lots of repeated practices for certain groups of signs, and I feel as though this really helped me remember and apply signs.",
                "The course was taught very well. The perfect mix of watching and then practicing -- I liked that we practiced more than we did in ASL I. Sometimes I was a little confused on assignments (organization), but I always was given clarification when I followed up.",
                "There was a lot on the quizzes and final about types\/classifications of classifiers, and we didn't really go over those very much during class.",
                "The biggest strength of the class is that I always looked forward to meeting and it became a part of my daily routine that I looked forward to. A weakness of the class is that there were sometimes issues in communication from the professor, however, these were rare and always fixed from an email.",
                "it's very engaging and fun to go to class, but sometimes the course is a little unorganized and it's hard to follow due dates."

                "Yes, I would recommend continuing with ASL 2! Maybe you dont learn as much vocab as in ASL 1, but you get to learn more skills to engage in more detailed conversation.",
                "YES!! Taking ASL was by far the best decision I made coming to Yale. I never knew how much I could love and appreciate a class and a community. I am so grateful for all I've learned so far and am looking forward to more ASL in the fall.",
                "Yes! ASL at Yale is so great. The professors are kind and want you to succeed. You will learn a lot!!",
