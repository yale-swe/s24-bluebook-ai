    "This course taught me all the fundamental materials for approaching Shakespeare's text as an actor. It not only gave me valuable skills in approaching and deconstructing the text on the page, but also how to get this meaning across on stage. Through constant workshopping, I learnt how to build the reality of the worlds of Shakespeare's characters rather than just the poetry of the text itself. The structure of the course required me to do a lot of individual and creative work as an actor to shape Shakespeare's work to my own visions as an artist.",
    "Bundy, the legend himself, teaches you how to act like only the legend himself can. You learn the basics of Shakespeare acting, how to scan, add intention to your words, and even tackle some of your personal barriers. The class is structured to ensure that every student grows at their own pace and there is certainly always growth.",
    "Through this course I gained so many tools for approaching Shakespeare through close text-analysis, collaboration, and honing in on the actor's own interpreatation of the text."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was amazing in making Shakespeare accessible and to helping develop actor confidence. The professor had a huge amount of knowledge that he offered to students in only the most helpful ways, leaving plenty of room for personal development and interpretation. The only way the course might have been improved would be through longer work with some of the exercises, for example the scenes, or more one on one time with the Professor with more detailed and personal feedback on the final project, which was meant to be the summation of all the skills we had built up during the semester. The workshop style is definitely something all actors should experience, but occasionally meant that a lot of the class was disengaged at any one time.",
    "The class makes you spend 5 hours on a friday. However, that, among other aspects, demand your respect. The class as a whole demands your respect and if you do not do the work, it will feel like a ton of bricks have fallen on your ego. However, if you do the work, which the class will eventually convince\/force you to do, you will come away as a much better actor. I do wish that Dean Bundy took more time in making the final assessment fruitful, but also believe that this is his way of making sure that you as a student recognize the most important part about being an actor, self-criticism and self-validation. He does not lift you into the air and show you that you deserve to inherit everything the light touches, you finish your final character workshop and he expects you to know what needs to be done. It is impressive if not a little frustrating.",
    "Strengths: gaining clear feedback and the huge opportunity to work with James Bundy & your peers. Well organized & well taught.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's the nature of a studio acting course, but it can get  a bit tedious having to sit through a 4 hour class to only get to work for around 20 minutes. For some it was easy to stay engaged the whole time, and others not. I wonder if their could be room for peers to also give feedback so those not working in the moment are also engaged while their peers are working."

    "Take this course!! It is an incredible experience to get to work with James Bundy and to see him work. I learned a lot as an actor, but also as a director, from observing his workshop, and the course is challenging but also very fun and rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student serious about working on their acting skills in a sustained and challenging fashion.",
    "If you hope to act, you are foolish to not learn from such an amazing teacher as James Bundy.",
    "Would recommend this course. Bundy is excellent, and so was our TA. Sometimes they gave conflicting feedback, but having to be flexible helped. The classes were achingly long though, lots of sitting through other people's performances.",
    "I would 110% recommend this course to another student!! Regardless of your background in Shakespeare, this course will teach you so much if you're willing to put in the work. I came in with absolutely no experience with Shakespeare (outside of high school literature classes) and now not only feel comfortable tackling it but also welcome the opportunity. It's A LOT of work, but SO worth it."
