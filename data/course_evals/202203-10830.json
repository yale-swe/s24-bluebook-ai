                "I developed knowledge about the politics of the early American period. The course is also a lens into the lives of Jefferson and Hamilton, and a reevaluation of both based on primary evidence. This class has a super interesting focus on primary sources (Jefferson and Hamiltons correspondence) which makes it incredibly interesting, and unique from other courses. Also, I learned how to structure and write a 20+ page pape grounded in primary evidence.",

                "I learned how to write a long research paper and do research in the archives. I also learned how to read founding letters\/diaries and analyze them thoroughly.",

                "Strengths: Prof. Freeman. If you have any interest at all in the period, consider taking a class with her. She line-edits all of the rough drafts (for a 20+ page paper, this is very generous!) and is engaged throughout the course, meeting with you about the prospectus and rough draft. Honestly, if youre on the fence about this course, consider taking it just to learn from her.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think it would help to have a mini-lecture in the first or second class, to cement a background of the period. There were lots of historical clarification questions during the semester, so it would help to dispel some of those questions earlier on. We usually did not get through all of the readings, but thats a minor complaint  the letters are all really interesting.",
                "Professor Freeman is so impressive. She LINE EDITS every single sentence of your rough draft for your 20 page papers. This is truly remarkable!",
                "Professor Freeman is the course's strength for sure. I loved all of her stories about the founders that she's picked up from her education, research, and love of the work she does. It was really cool to spend a semester reading primary source documents and to learn for the sake of learning!",
                "An incredible course!",
                "everything is rooted in primary sources and prof freeman is so knowledgable"

                "If interested in American history, absolutely! It has a primary source focus on Jefferson and Hamilton, so it might not be as interesting for non-U.S. history\/American Studies majors. Nevertheless, the skills gained appeal to a broad range of majors and interests.",
                "Yes!!! Professor Freeman is a gem. The week-to-week workload for this course is low, but the writing of the paper is a big commitment. Regardless, I really feel like I learned how to write a research paper which is a skill I will take with me forever. Professor Freeman also really teaches you how to write a paper like this, she doesn't expect you to know. Plus, the content is super interesting. Take this class!",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the time period and Professor Freeman is super impressive. That being said, I am not the biggest fan of the homework assignments and didn't feel like I learned a lot from them because I was focused on my final paper.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This course will really teach you how to write and will get you in the minds of Hamilton and Jefferson.",
                "Yes! Absolutely take it if you get in!",
                "yeah, it was cool to learn about the personality of the founding fathers, what they were worried about in the formation of the nation, what parallels we can see today even, etc."
