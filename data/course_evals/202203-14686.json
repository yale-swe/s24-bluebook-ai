                "I developed critical reading, annotation, and writing skills. From reading texts written in Ancient Greece and Rome, I gained insight into the beauty of language, translation, and composition.",
                "In a course dedicated to the development of reading and writing, I am happy and very satisfied to report that I believe I developed in both of these categories. For reading, I feel that my approach to the skill was entirely shifted, and I am now able to not pain over every word but rather read quicker and see the larger picture of the text. I feel I have a closer understanding of the intent and style of the author than I ever have had. For writing, I believe my writing style became much more nuanced, and I now have a better feel for perhaps what is the style of academia: closely analyzing and drawing conclusions from limited text as opposed to entire books. \r\n\r\nMore than anything, I feel that DS Literature  and DS as a program  have rewired the way I approach learning. I feel that I am on the way to understanding the discipline as a concept, to drawing connections between larger academic patterns  a kind of metathought, or metareading that I never saw before. For that I am extremely grateful and eager to see what comes next.",
                "In addition to learning and reading many books very important to literary history, I also was able to greatly develop my writing schools and see how different texts relate and connect to each other.",

I also learned to exercise my literary analysis on both specific and more generally structural levels in a deeper way than I ever had before. You get a real sense of the development of the Western literary tradition even though we do not really go into great depth in any one specific text."

            "comments": [
                "Prof. Lindskog did an amazing job guiding us through the seminar. I left class feeling like I understood the text at a depth I certainly would not have been able to reach on my own. The essay feedback we received was incredible as well. I definitely feel like I have become a more intentional writer. To improve, I wish we were given a little more autonomy during the seminars; there were times where it felt like the seminars were being dominated too much by the professor.",
                "Weakness: I realize that this obviously a point of the program, but there are SO MANY books. Sometimes I felt like I had not gotten enough out of a book because I had so little time to read it and we spent so little time talking about it in seminar. But if perhaps we just had a few less books to read (three or four maybe) it might enable just enough more time to be devoted to each. \r\n\r\nStrengths: I just love being able to discuss a text with a small group of students and a teacher. And Directed Studies is exactly that. I think that the dedication from the professor was excellent and the lectures were engaging and informative.",
                "This course was amazing in its breadth of readings and the quality of discussions. It has been a joy to be a part of, and I can't think of something to improve it.",
                "I am sure the strengths and weaknesses of the program have become trite at this point; the invaluable strength of DS Lit is to show broad patterns in the discipline of literature and develop the way students approach the text I believe this course epitomized this strength. For weaknesses, the course naturally does not allow for very deep analysis of any particular text, which also is already known by the instructors.\r\n\r\nFor our particular class, I found that a real strength was the ability to draw connections between texts and cultures  say, how the Homeric poems reflected one cultural era as opposed to Dante's \"Inferno\". This ability to connect was particularly gratifying; I feel that I am starting to understand the broader literary discipline. Additionally, the course was conducted in a sense that brought out the best possible remarks in discussion; I felt that I was always supposed to articulate a deeper point and was given the platform to, which was certainly a strength. At the same time, I do feel that the weight attributed to each point in discussion did not always allow for actual \"discussion\" in the Socratic sense, but rather very articulate students taking their turn at the lectern. There are strengths and weaknesses to this, and, while we each individually were able to find deeper meaning of the text in discussion, I did not always feel that we were able to do so as interlocutors, challenging and poking at each other's remarks. I think the perfect discussion has both of these virtues  deep individual thought within a group conversation. Perhaps the mechanism of calling on individual students felt too formal for Socratic banter. Either way, the discussions were very good, and I hope my critique only serves to improve them.",
                "The strength was the amount and breadth of books we read and became familiar with, but that also leads to the major drawback that we dont spend enough time with each text.",
                "More time for reading the texts/less texts and more time to analyze.",
                "I think we spent too little time on certain texts, but that might just be the nature of Directed Studies.",
                "DS is a fast-paced course, and this not only makes it difficult but also can leave you feeling like youre moving onto another material before youre able to engage with a text or author in depth. Since all this process of reading and discussing texts is accompanied by paper assignments, it might also feel overwhelming. On the flip side, this fast-paced structure and the demanding reading load compels one to become a faster reader and writer, as well as making it possible to see patterns and draw connections between a broad body of work since one goes over so many texts and different authors.",
                "The main strengths I noticed in this class are the thoroughness of the feedback on papers as well as the context or additional materials provided for each text. I think something very useful that happens in other DS sections is that the professor will point out specific parts of the assigned reading that are particularly important ahead of the discussion which help guide our reading. Of course, this would make it easier for students not to read all of the material, but in DS it is also important to be realistic, and part of that is making sure that everyone knows what is being talked about at least on the more significant aspects of the material at hand."

I have truly enjoyed the readings and the discussions. Even if the essays at times feel like a burden, the feedback and the payoff at the end of the semester in my writing ability have made it worth every second.",
                "Of course; there is no better introduction to literature  in my experience than this course. The ability to read such formative texts with such incredible peers, under Prof. Lindskog's brilliantly nuanced direction invaluable and a must-take.",
                "Yes very much so, it is invaluable to at least gain a basic understanding of many different texts, and Professor Lindskog did a great job handling it.",

                "I would recommend DS Lit if you want to become well-versed in the history of literature and the Western intellectual tradition and are prepared to make the best out of a program that requires a lot of compromises between the amount of reading you do, the quality of essays you write, and aspects of your personal well-being such as sleep and social life. It is possible to do it all successfully, but sometimes one of these aspects has to be sacrificed to an extent and that's OK. The important thing is to learn to recognize when it is worth it to sacrifice which."
