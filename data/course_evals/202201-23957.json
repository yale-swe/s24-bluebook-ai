In my smaller ensemble group,  I learned a great deal about quartertone scale systems and Syrian musical traditions. In my larger group I gained skills arranged open instrumentation piece for a larger ensembles. The class afforded me a great deal of freedom in this endeavor which was helpful but also daunting. I also gained a better tool kit for tackling certain difficult rhymical passages. Also  through working on the student composition works I gained skills and confidence playing with electronic modification, and collaborating with composers."

                "The strength of this class is the repertoire we play and the high level of study. That being said the choice of repertoire with a limited group of students may mean that certain students play more than others, leading to an uneven workload. I believe this could be fixed by increasing student interest and following the chamber music classes model of bi-weekly studio class along with 2 hours of intendent rehearsal arranged weekly by non-overlapping groups.",

Despite the occasional lack of organization and the occasional overabundance of supervision, this class is an incredible opportunity to make really cool music with really good musicians. It's also a super fun time working with student composers.",
                "I would recommend this course to students serious about studying new music and who are willing to dedicate a lot of time to support student composers. If you are looking for a less intensive experience with early music I would recommend extra-curricular groups such as YUCO.",
                "This course is so so good for the department, but it needs a lot of tweaking before I could wholeheartedly recommend it to another student. Expectations were unclear and the workload was much higher than expected.",
                "If there is not a significant change to the structure of the course, then no. Some students in the class have a huge load of pieces to learn and perform and others have almost none. Maiani, the professor, is on tour a lot  which is awesome  but in her absence, I really felt a lack of instruction or guidance without a faculty member present for class time."
