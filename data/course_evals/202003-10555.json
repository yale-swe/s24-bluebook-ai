                "This class gave me a voice. I've taken Spanish class in some form for 13 years of my life, but this class, its professor, the environment of fun, and its assignments taught me how to portray my personality in words. Besides that, I became more confident in my speaking and improved my grammar. This class was amazing and such a wonderful introduction to the language program at Yale.",
                "I stepped outside of my comfort zone and wrote short stories, fables, and poems. I feel much more confident doing my own creative writing in new styles (and in new languages). It was helpful receiving [sympathetic] feedback from both my peers and Maria.",
                "I discovered my voice in another language (a beautiful journey), challenged myself artistically, and read amazing texts from Nadia Villafuerte to Nicanor Parra!",
                "I developed my understanding of the Spanish language by reading, writing, and speaking in the language. I learned how to use the Spanish language not just for purely functional reasons (ie communication) but also to express myself creatively. I also learned about different styles of writing, from fables to microstories. The class greatly expanded my appreciation for creative writing.",
                "I strengthened my Spanish writing and speaking skills, including a greater vocabulary and the fluent use of more tenses (e.g. preterite, subjunctive). By the end of the course, I was able to develop more complex story plots, introduce unexpected endings, and write in a more philosophical, contemplative manner.",
                "I improved my speaking and writing skills in Spanish and developed my voice as a Spanish writer. I also developed a new appreciation for certain forms of poetry.",

                "The atmosphere that Professor Maria Jordan creates is outstanding. She is so jovial and forgiving and encouraging. The only thing I think this class could use is slightly clearer instruction in terms of weekly assignments. There were numerous times when people in the class were confused about what was required for the coming class, but I think a lot of that had to do with the switch to online. Maria had to change her syllabus, and she was making on-the-fly decisions sometimes. The work was still, by all means, doable and enjoyable, but I did second-guess a few times whether I was supposed to email her something, present something in class the next day, or write a new piece. I think it will work itself out as we get more comfortable with online schooling.",
                "We had to write reading responses (\"blogs\") which felt like busywork. But in every other way this course was fantastic, and all our other assignments felt fair.",
                "ONLY STRENGTHS!! Fascinating texts, great discussions, an incredibly supportive class environment, and a wonderful professor!",
                "This course was phenomenal. The small class size allowed each student to interact meaningfully with one another and with Professor Jordan as well. The readings that our professor selected for us were thoughtfully chosen, and we had interesting discussions during every single class. I also really enjoyed the workshop aspect of the class, in which students would work on their own writing and then collaborate with Professor Jordan - and, on several occasions, other students - to polish and finish the piece. \r\nIn terms of improvements, I have two suggestions. Firstly, I think a little bit more peer collaboration both inside and out of class would be great; I recognize that the pandemic setting made this a little difficult, but I think maybe putting students in pairs or small groups so that they can all edit writings would serve to develop their skills as writers and also strengthen class bonds. I also think that it would be helpful if there was a check-in with the professor at some point in the class - whether in person or through email - where students could ask about their current grades in the class. Or, perhaps, the professor could try to use the Grades function in Canvas to provide students with an understanding of where they are in the class. \r\nOverall, though, the class was amazing!",
                "Maria is the number one strength of this course. The feedback she provides and the discussion she facilitates make this a course very worth taking.\r\n\r\nOne very minor suggestion would be for the stories\/poems that do not make the portfolio to count for some points, so students have more incentive to make every piece very polished throughout the semester.",
                "The strengths are how engaging the class is, especially with the professor. Professor Jordan made every class interesting and I was always excited to come to class. Also, she was very understanding and helpful when editing our work. A weakness was the fact that it was virtual, as it obviously would have been more fun in person, but given the state of the pandemic it was the best that it could be.",
                "The class was very close-knit despite the circumstances. Mara is an amazing professor and facilitates really engaging discussions about literature. (I'd love to see a second Spanish creative writing seminar offered as a class!)\r\n\r\nIt would have been nice to have a few more grades along the way.",
                "Professor Jordn is one of the best professors I have had and this course was just as good. I have never been in such an engaging, welcoming class environment!",
                "Strengths of the course were the variety of pieces that we read, the instructor (everyone in the class would agree that Maria rocks), the level of creativity that was encouraged on a daily basis, and the freedom given with regards to interpreting assignments. Weaknesses were that sometimes the readings were a bit over my head, and the assignments\/ syllabus were not always clear."

                "The only thing I can think of is just practice with Zoom. The struggle of making break-out rooms and giving people co-host abilities to present became a running joke in the class near the end, but everything got done in not too long a time. I think presenting students' work with screen sharing is a definite keeper in the class. Seeing other people's work was the most amazing part of the class, and it also made people more confident in sharing their work over time.",
                "I think the Zoom format of the class helped a lot when we focused on individual critiques. Screensharing allowed us all to stay on the same page and become closer as a group. More breakout rooms would've been fun, but I very much enjoyed spending class time as a collective.",
                "Professor Jordan struggled with zoom breakout rooms, but other than that, the course was full of warmth and creativity.",
                "The course was adapted very well to the virtual format. As I mentioned, the small class size really allowed the class to connect. I also liked the blogs, which allowed me to process all of the wonderful class readings and also see what my peers thought about the readings as well. \r\nI think, in the future, perhaps Zoom Breakout Rooms could be utilized a bit more. I recognize that, especially in language classes, when students are no longer supervised they tend to go back to their most familiar language (usually English), which can ruin the dynamic a bit, but I think it's worth it for students to be able to share their own thoughts and develop their own relationships in a more intimate setting. \r\nAlso, if the professor has time, it might be helpful if she set up office hours each week where students could go and actually talk with her about their writings. I think it would be very helpful for the students to develop their writing, as they can ask questions and have a discussion rather than just receiving comments on a page, and I think it would also allow them to get to know their professor better, which is something a lot of students struggle with in the virtual learning setting.",
                "The Zoom format and classroom-wide discussions were very successful and Maria did an amazing job facilitating discussion and giving time for everyone to give input. The breakout rooms were not as effective since students might become distracted without supervision. The built-in Raise Hand function in Zoom could be utilized more since some times people with their physical hands up were missed.",
                "The Zoom seminars allowed for virtual engagement the most. Although there were some technical difficulties at times, I enjoyed the breakout rooms a lot. I wish that the discussion posts weren't locked so early however.",
                "I thought the class worked very well virtually. Sharing my work with the class during live seminars made me feel engaged during an otherwise very isolated semester.",

                "Screen sharing presentations\/power points went really smoothly and were engaging. Maria struggled a bit with figuring out breakout rooms, so I think that could've been utilized better."

You will improve so much. You will be surprised by the wonderful work your classmates do and the work you do. You also get to read a wonderful selection of literature from a wide range of themes, eras, and styles. It's a low-stress class, and, even in Zoom University, a joy to attend. I looked forward to it every Tuesday and Thursday!",

If everyone was tired from midterms, Maria let us have a slower class. If everyone was energetic, we'd do more engaging activities.",

She facilitates a very enjoyable learning environment and genuinely cares about each and every student. She is extremely accessible and her feedback is very helpful.

                "I definitely would recommend this course to anybody who wants to improve their Spanish skills and their writing. It does have a fair amount of work, but it is definitely worth it if it's a class that you're interested in.",
