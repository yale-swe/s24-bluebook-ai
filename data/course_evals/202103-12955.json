                "Too basic and very slow. No readings were posted after the 6th week of class so it was hard to engage with any of the course material at a deeper level.",
                "I felt class time was not too engaging, but I enjoyed the special activities and assignments throughout the course.",
                "No weaknesses. \r\nStrengths: recorded format (very COVID-19 friendly.) Accessibility of course and its workload. Professor Schilling. Broad syllabus that allows everyone to find something that resonates with them. Project-format of assignments (much more interesting and personalized than exams). Field trips and activities.",
                "This class was the ideal science credit for a more humanities-minded person. The emphasis on delving into parts of the art world that you're most interested in was super cool, and Professor Schilling is so helpful, knowledgeable, and passionate.",
                "strength: very eye-opening and fun, especially the field trips. \r\nweakness: unorganized",
                "The course is great in that it is very approachable. It is designed to be approachable to students who are less STEM-inclined while still being informative and interesting.",
                "Not much course work which was nice, fostered an environment that you get out what you put in.",
                "Maybe others wouldnt consider this a weakness, but if you didnt attend the lectures you could still easily leave this class with an A. All the graded work was based on your own research, not really anything you learn in the class. I wish the lectures mattered more because I feel like I never got to know any of my classmates that well and a lot of people just didnt come. The trip to the furniture study and guest speakers were a highlight. I also really liked how Professor Schilling tied in a lot of interesting subjects like discussing how the Rothko paintings were restored, the building of the octopus in the new Peabody Museum, optical illusions, etc. The class was not science heavy and I think thats why I liked it so much. I didnt have to memorize anything, just understand larger scientific concepts and explain them semi-intelligently. The projects were a fun way to show what weve learned.",
                "A lot of the actual work of this course is just the effort that goes into figuring out how to use panopto, create a lecture in the form of an ignite talk, and learn how to use storymaps. That said, the lectures were very straightforward and the professor lectured clearly.",
                "The science didn't feel like it was in a vacuum; we could see the real-world implications of it through the art. Plus we didn't just get lectures about the science, we got to interact with it through art museum visits and guest speakers.  I also like how we were able to work toward our final project throughout the semester.  Dr. Schilling is a great teacher who truly cares about students' well-being and success and that is very encouraging. \r\nIt could be improved with more opportunities for students to share their work on their individual projects with each other or workshop ideas with each other in class (maybe in small groups).",
                "Very flexible assignments that let you focus on the science of concepts that actually interest you.",
                "Weaknesses - I think that there should be some demonstration of mastery of the material, like a quiz or something. It was hard to solidify the material that wed learned in class because there was nothing to really tie it together. \r\nStrengths- you could really make the class what you wanted it to be, there was a lot of freedom to explore. The field trips were good too!",
                "Strengths: the professor is accomendating of the students in regards to COVID-19. The special activities (ex. the field trip to the furniture museum) was fun and exciting. There was very little homework.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: highly disorganized class. Oftentimes there would be no where to find what the homework assigned would be and we had no idea what the professor would lecture about. This made it difficult to learn anything outside our final and video projects. There was a lack of communication from professor to student as well.",
                "The course lacked some structure and organization. It was often unclear how assignments should be performed/ expectations. More examples would have been helpful. It was also unclear when the class was online versus in person. I often felt a bit lost.",
                "This class benefitted from its being structured around a final independent project, and using the rest of the curriculum to support the aims of that project. The class would be better if feedback on the interim assignments for that project were given more frequently and thoroughly. As it stands, not much individual feedback was given, so there was often little to gain from the interim assignments other than time allocation.",
                "The course is a really cool concept, but I feel like we didnt learn as much technical content as I would have liked.",
                "This class had the most amazing guest speakers and our trip to the furniture study was pretty fun. I wished the homework materials were bit more engaging and the lectures didn't always feel worth my time.",
                "A bit disorganized but very interesting",
                "Even if the material was pretty interesting, the professor was far too accommodating for there to be any real enforcement of the class workwhich was nice because there wasnt much workbut made it far too easy to skip class and not do any of the readings and not really learn that much at all.",
                "Strengths: prof Schilling was great at giving lectures while keeping discussion open, the assignments were pretty interesting and the final project was particularly cool. Prof Schilling was also very understanding towards students\r\nWeaknesses: the class often felt unstructured in terms of lectures and assignments/ due dates. Additionally, prof Schilling sometimes skimmed quickly over concepts without explaining them in depth (unless prompted by questions)"

                "This is a GUT! Would not recommend for STEM majors, it is way too slow and surface level for what you are used to, but this can also be a good thing if you are looking for a stem-y class that lets you take a break from soul crushing psets. All the assignments can be done in a weekend if you are really in a pinch, so it would make a good 5th class too. The subject matter is really interesting and there are really cool guest speakers and class visits to West Campus. For non-STEM majors, Prof Schilling really genuinely cares that everyone understands the material, and she does a great job of explaining science concepts using familiar experiences, and she takes the time to meet you where you are and talk through whatever you get stuck on until you understand, even if it slows the class down a bit. STEM concepts are hard, and she makes sure no one gets left behind.",
                "Yes, at the end of the day, I enjoyed the class. The workload was not bad, but classes were not too engaging.",
                "Yes. This is the best and most accessible class I have taken at Yale. Professor Schilling made me feel as though I belong in the science world, even though I am a humanities major, and it was a healing experience for me, someone who has had trouble fitting in STEM places in the past. The course is also so interesting; there is something for everyone in the syllabus, which tackles so many different topics and relates them to real world artists and their work. The projects were also personalized, allowing us to tailor our talks/presentations to our own interests. Professor Schilling was also very accommodating of me when I was sick or struggling; the recorded format of the course was truly a lifesaver. The activities were so engaging and helped us prepare for the final exam, connecting us to top professionals in exhibition design and the material sciences/arts. It was so cool!!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class- it's not a total gut, but the workload is very manageable (particularly because you get to work on projects on the aspects of the material that you are the most engaged by).",

                "This is a great class for humanities majors to get a science credit. Its interesting and mostly just fun with little effort required.",
                "I would highly recommend this course because you are able to explore art topics you are interested in through science which is really cool.  The activities allowed for non-traditional classroom learning which is a nice change of pace from other classes. If you're a creative person trying to get a science credit, this class is for you!",

                "Yes! A really fun, low stakes way to learn more about art and the science behind it.",
                "I took this class for my required science credit because I really enjoy art and thought this would be a great way to get the credit out of the way. Though the material and syllabus showed a lot of potential for this course, the disorganization and confusion created by it made it difficult to learn.",
                "Yes. The class gives you lots of opportunities to study topics you want as long as they relate to art in some way. The projects are fun if you allow yourself to enjoy them. Very manageable workload. Perfect science credit for non-stem students.",
                "Great professor",
                "I think in a perfect world I would recommend this class. It is interesting in theory and the assignments can be fun. However, the issues when it came to organization, communication, and assignment expectations made the class much less enjoyable.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who enjoy independent work and exploration, and would rather get their science credit through a project of their own devising than a more structured and assessed curriculum.",
                "I would if you are looking for a science course that teaches you a lot about communicating scientific information.",
                "This is truly the guttiest of all science guts and if you are looking for a doable science credit ding ding ding you've found the one. However, this class is so gutty that it often veers on being unengaging and I think what made the course work was the fact that most of the class had a strong personal interest in art that kept things moving. If you don't like art, this could be a real snooze-fest.",
                "Yes",
                "Its good if you want to take a gut for a science credit and youre an art student its a perfect course. If you actually want to learn about the material sciences of art, you can, but most of it will be up to you to hold yourself accountable.",
                "Yes! Great, fun science credit for non stem majors. Amazing professor. Great course with interesting topics, especially for senior year. Nice that you get to apply your interests to the midterm and final projects."
