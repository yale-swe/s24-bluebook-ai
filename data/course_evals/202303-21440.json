                "This course changed the way I think about sound and the way I approach cinema. I learned particle knowledge of how to manipulate sound and sound design as well as some sound theory.",
                "I learned about how to critically analyze and approach sound, as well as the basics of video/audio shooting and editing.",
                "An exceptionally effective and enjoyable introduction to the amazing field of sound design.\r\nThis course completely revolutionized my approach to using sound as a tool for films. It really made me aware of everything I see and hear at the cinema. The deepest insight was that 99% of sound in film is intentional (and often artificial) and its important to break down the sound designers intentions when thinking of how a film is made. The other major skill this course teaches you is the ability to bring this thoughtfulness in crafting sound to your own work.  Pierce provides a great framework for analyzing and implementing sound art in film - youll feel very cool breaking down sound effects and soundscapes in movies.\r\nI also appreciate that this course encourages feedback between you and your classmates on your projects - communication of my ideas, my openness to new ones, and my ability to implement notes significantly improved.",
                "I learned how to construct and develop my creative ideas, expressing them through the design of sound and images. Meanwhile, I've been greatly inspired by excellent movie examples and my classmates' film creations, which have significantly expanded my imagination and sparked my inspiration."

                "The strength of the course is Leighton. He is dedicated and invested in each student. The weakness of this course is that it is 4 hours long.",
                "Being one of the few production classes at Yale is inherently a strength to this course. Leighton is also a wonderful professor he was incredibly open with all of us. However, I don't think the course should have been four hours. I think consolidating into a 2-3 hour seminar would have made for a more efficient and engaging class.",
                "It's kind of random, but I enjoyed the varying challenges, especially the specific assignments. Working on crafting creative soundscapes, making videos for those creative soundscapes, how to foley, and how to conceive of film sound beyond narrative dialogue was incredibly helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor is a MEGA talented and experienced sound design professional, and successfully teaches you how to think outside of the box of all the various ways sound can be used. Hes super nice, incredibly chill, and understanding about extensions and absences, while still inspiring you to do good, consistent work.\r\nAnother major strength of the course is the practical focus - you will go on sound walks, design and share soundscapes, match visuals to sound, and develop a significant project that you can feel proud of by the end (you have a lot of creative liberty with this). You bring your weekly progress to class and share what youve done with your peers - a great way to get ideas for your work and to support the less experienced filmmakers in the class.\r\nAlso, the reading load always felt light, but necessary. We were never asked to read a ridiculous amount just to tick a box for discussion - instead, there was a focus on foundational ideas which then informed the discussion. The Prof also had a great working knowledge of the texts and could guide us through any concepts which were trickier.\r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\nOnly one major logistical weakness that could EASILY be resolved for the coming years. Since its the only software thats free for Yale students, the course was taught using DaVinci Resolve, which is a terrible and stupid program for dummies. The Professor doesnt usually use it, so he didnt really know how to teach us. We would spend hours in class staring at a screen as he navigated it. The course should instead request the licensing of an actually good DAW like Pro Tools, Logic, etc. for its students. Another alternative is having a dedicated part of class time just teach DaVinci resolve for those who arent familiar That way, he can effectively teach, and the students get that important practical skill out of it."

                "Yes! Leighton is such a great teacher and resource.",
                "If you want to be creative with film/video sound, or get new prompts to motivate you to try new things with it, this is totally for you! As it was last semester, if you're only interested in getting into the nitty-gritty of being a boom op or recording dialogue for narrative film, you might not get as much out of this.",
                "Absolutely, any class with this prof is must take. I would say its essential if youre doing a film or documentary for your thesis- it will give you so many skills that you never knew were so important. Being sensitive to sound will make a world of difference."
