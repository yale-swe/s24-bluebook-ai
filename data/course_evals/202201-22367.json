This course was essentially L5 without the option to choose a topic you like.",

I don't think anyone should have to be subjected to L4 Spanish if they are only taking it to fulfill the requirement. If someone wants to become fluent in Spanish and is willing to go through a semester devoid of learning and full of topics they did not sign up to discuss, then maybe, just maybe I'd tell them to take it, but I truly don't think anyone should have to feel the way I felt after each and every section of this class.",
