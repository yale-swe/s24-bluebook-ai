                "I learned about the history of organizing and the most effective ways to improve organizing going forward. I did think this was going to focus on campus activism but it didnt and Im glad that this was the case. Community organizing is truly so different and more complex than we give it credit.",
                "I learned about the practical elements of community organizing. I also began to understand the different approaches to community change and activism. I began to critique the non-profit industrial complex and moved away from the blaming systemic issues on individuals.",
                "I was able to gain deeper insights into community organizing directly from people in the field. I enjoyed and appreciated the course materials (readings, videos, podcasts).",
                "We learned both the theoretical and applicable skills of community organizing. Our readings were almost always authored by community organizing, granting us an insight from people engaged in this work. Through our accompaniment projects, we applied the very skills we learned in the virtual classroom. Some examples of this work include phone banking and community outreach.",

I also learned about the different theories and practices behind community organizing. This course provided me with direct, applicable skills to use to help bring about social change. I learned about some of the nuts and bolts of organizing, including power analysis and how to make a strategy chart. I also learned about what differentiates direct action community organizing from other approaches to social and political change. Finally, I learned about the importance of intersectionality and how different factors like race, class, gender, and sexuality shape organizing practices. I also learned about the value of writing and how it can be properly utilized in organizing and the importance of sharing knowledge with others.\r\n\r\nI gained direct experience working for a community-based organization and these skills will help translate to and can be applied to other aspects of my life. \r\n\r\nFinally, I learned about different community organizations, their missions, and the everyday work they are involved in. I especially enjoyed learning about the lived experiences and personal journeys into community organizing that each guest speaker shared with us. The guest organizers provided me with incredible and invaluable insight into community organizing."

                "Strengths: Professor HoSang is so well-spoken and well-informed on the class topic and it's obvious that he has a lot of experience in community organizing; he also used a lot of his connections to bring in many different guest community to speak to our class and who have actual experience in community organizing!! LOVED hearing from Libero Della Piana, LeAnn Hall, Jane McAlevey, and Judith LeBlanc in particular. Also loved how Prof. HoSang started every class off with a song. The public-facing website was also a great idea. Learned a lot from the Jonathan Matthew Smucker reading, Steven Osuna, Jane McAlevey's writings, Tiffany Willoughby-Herard (and many more, but just to name a few). Weakness: not sure how to implement this but given the significant number of assignments where we had to do group work it made it really difficult when the other members of my group didn't do the work and I often ended up doing assignments lone. perhaps there can be weekly group check-ins, or Prof. HoSang can appoint one individual to take the lead on a certain week...",
                "I wouldve really liked if the accompaniment project placements had been local rather than some being national and some being in New Haven.",
                "I loved my accompaniment, I just wish we had more time to work with them.",
                "More communication between placements and the class - I felt like the workload between the two were fairly uneven. Strengths were the format (I wasnt disengaged like I was in my other classes) and of course Professor HoSang and Isabel. Also the guest speakers were amazing. Course website\/pages were very helpful.",
                "Strengths: Internship program, guest speakers, balance of readings with other work, structure \r\nWeaknesses: Not many beyond those that are inherent to a virtual a course. The format, while engaging, did get repetitive at times too.",
                "There were little to no criteria for grading in the class, which made it difficult to do assignments. Moreover, there were very few guidelines regarding the accompaniment aspect of the course and no clear way to grade groups work within different organizations, given the vast disparities  among the accompaniments. I wish we had more time to work with the external organizations and better feedback\/ rubric for what we were to accomplish. Last, the work in the group tasks part of the class often was unequally distributed, and I felt like I was doing most of the work within my group.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was the guest speaker series, which gave us the chance to ask questions of and interact with a ton of experienced organizers. Their words stuck with me even more than some of the readings did, though many of those were also helpful and robust. A weakness that could be remedied in future iterations of the course was the way that the accompaniment project was conducted and the structure of the seminar--at times, class felt like more of a performance than anything else and our weekly rotating assignments were hard to keep up with. Though the accompaniment project was a great idea in theory, I think that the practice element of the course could be expanded upon in the future through more focused trainings on tactics through power mapping and direct action-planning workshops.",
                "Strengths --> Professor HoSang is an incredible instructor and he designed the course really really well.\r\nOnly weakness was that at times the class time was so packed that we barely managed to get to all aspects of the outline for the day and often did not have enough time to reflect on in class activities and online readings.",
                "A lot of material is covered throughout the course, and even then it was organized and taught in a really efficient, effective, and consumable manner. I think one area of improvement could have been distributing the material on practical skill and strategy throughout the semester as opposed to placing them at the beginning and end.",
                "more small group discussions and general check-ins with all the work we were doing, classes always seemed to rush by",
                "The strengths of this course were the guest speakers (a wide range of organizers from different organizations and backgrounds that all eloquently spoke about their own political biography and the work of their organization), the accompaniment project placements (allowed us to pursue our interests and gain skills working for a community organization), the wide range of organizations we discussed and the different perspectives we were introduced to, and the small group discussions in breakout rooms during class. Finally, a strength is that this course taught practical and applicable skills as opposed to just theory. I appreciate that the course didn't have typical papers and exams but instead gave us real-world experience working for a community organization that we reflected on in an end of term paper. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were that it sometimes felt rushed or that we were trying to cover too much in a short amount of time. But I can also appreciate the value of being introduced to so many different organizations and organizers to learn from them. Some of the readings were also dense and long and felt more theoretical than practical. The accompaniment projects, while a huge strength, were also varied and because of that, the workload each student had was different. Based on one's accompaniment project placement and how established or active the organization was, some students had significantly more work or were more involved than others in addition to the weekly classwork and readings."

Though the class was virtual, I think the weekly tasks gave us all something to focus on and helped us to engage with and understand the material better."

                "Yes. Cool opportunities await!",

                "Yes! Any class you can take with Professor HoSang will definitely be unforgettable. This is a course that will teach you real life skills which is rare for Yale",
                "Yes. It is one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale and I would recommend anyone looking to develop a skill set for community organizing to take it.",
                "Yes! Its a needed switch of content and form from other yale classes. Prof HoSang is amazing and clearly really cares about teaching and turning more people towards organizing.",
                "Yes, it is a great opportunity to deeply engage with actual community organizing. However, be prepared for very vague instructions on accompaniment projects and grading criteria.",
                "Yes, if you do not already have experience with community organizing. It provides some really wonderful readings and speaker engagement opportunities that will give you a glimpse into many different methods of organizing across and between issues. However, I'd only recommend this for people with a bit of experience already if it's reorganized to better support student learning in class, as outside-of-class tasks became really tedious and burdensome at times.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about community organizing as a tool for social change. Although it was completely virtual, a lot of the deep engagement we had with guest speakers and community organizations wouldn't have been possible for an in person only seminar.",
                "Yes! One of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. The speakers were all amazing and Professor HoSang is fantastic. Great to learn in a format that's a little different from a traditional seminar.",
                "Yes. If you are interested in organizing take this course. It is fantastic, creative, fun, and incredibly designed. You get to meet incredible experienced organizers, analyze critical readings, and most importantly listen to beautiful music at the start of each class.",
                "Definitely! If you're interested in doing community-based work after graduation, this class will definitely prepare you for such. It is also a great way to get connected with internships.",
                "Yes! Great course especially if you actually want to get involved with the actual work of community organizing.",
                "Yes! If you at all are interested in community organizing, social movements, political and social change, and understanding what and who it takes to happen, then definitely take this course. Whether you want to pursue a career in organizing or nonprofit work or are invested in a specific issue and want to better understand its origins and development, then I would recommend this course. This course provides an excellent overview of the theory and practice of community organizing as well as giving you a more specialized, individual way to engage with the course through the accompaniment project placement. The accompaniment project allows you to do actual work with an organization that you care about and are invested in seeing succeed."
