                "I learned a lot about how to conquer texts and books that otherwise intimidated me. I learned how to dissect these works and gain a ton of valuable insight from them. I also learned how to navigate the archives, which will be very helpful in the future."

                "A huge strength is Professor Richards. They are warm, kind, and super knowledgable, always offering great historical contexts or cultural framing for the wide range of texts we read. I think they did a great job tying together what could seem like disparate texts (from all different regions and time periods) into a streamlined, flowing curriculum. A weakness would maybe just be pacing -- I wished we could've had a little more time with a few of the texts (particularly Nervous Conditions), but I understand we have to get through a fair amount of content by the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: Texts were interesting and class discussions were engaging! Professor Richards is great, very organized, and provided very clear guidance/instruction/feedback on written work. \r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "I loved this course! I thought that the readings were so interesting and Professor Richards conducted every class and arranged the syllabus with intention. I enjoyed the group work but did sometimes feel like there was too much of it and might have enjoyed more time discussing with the class as a whole.",
                "I absolutely loved taking ENGL 128 with Professor Richards. They were wonderful in helping guide discussion but always made it a point to step back and allow for the students to develop and discuss their own interactions with the text. If you ever have the chance, ai absolutely recommend taking 128 with Prof Richards",
                "No weaknesses. This class was amazing with Professor Richards. I not only leave the class interested in literature, but interested in colonial history. I thought the the emphasis on writing about form was very helpful and is something most classes and teachers assume we can do.",
                "Strengths: Professor Richards does such an amazing job of keeping the class engaged the entire seminar. We alternate between whole class discussions, groups work, and looking at stuff on the board. Also, Professor richards is incredibly accepting and welcome to all responses, making it so that everyone feels comfortable participating. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes we moved through the texts a bit quickly, but that is to be expected in a survey course",
                "I liked most of the readings and Professor Richards was a pleasure to have as a teacher!! They were thorough and clear about what they expected from each assignment and lead great discussions with interesting discussion questions. They were really understanding as well, which is an important trait for every professor to have! I was able to coast quite easily in this course, which I found superbly helpful most days, but now that the course is over, I wish there was more for me to take away."

                "Yes! Especially if taught by Professor Richards. I think it's super important for people to broaden their reading horizons, especially English majors, so I'd urge people majoring in English to not just take the Western canon courses (125, 126, 127) and to explore excellent work from non-Western authors (with this class being a great place to start!).",
                "Yes! If you are an English major, take this course to fulfill the foundational requirements. It offers a really valuable, interesting perspective and the texts are really engaging!",
                "I would- I enjoyed it both because of the instruction and because of the readings- I've been wanting to read some of them for awhile so greatly enjoyed the ability to finally do so.",
                "Yes, absolutely! I think taking 128 with Professor Richards has been so formative, and it was such a joy walking into their class each day. Theyre so kind and understanding and so knowledgeable about the texts, yet at the same time a wonderful teacher and completely understands the discussion between student and teacher and students.",
                "Yes, absolutely!!! Please take this class with Professor Richards. It was my favorite class of the week.",
                "Yes!! Take this course with Professor Richards, it is an amazing way to familiarize yourself with these novels and I learned so much!",
                "Yes! Especially with Professor Richards. I chose this class to fulfill my major requirements because I genuinely wanted to get more breadth in my reading, and that goal was accomplished in full."
