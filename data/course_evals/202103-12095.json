It's a helpful class in terms of directing your thesis and I feel like I got what I needed out of it. The multitude of opportunities for studio visits from guest critics was nice. The only annoying parts were administrative things, like getting swipe access, figuring out studio spaces, etc.",

We asked questions and made suggestions. Because each presentation was 30 min (15 minutes of presenting and 15 minutes for questions/discussion) we did an average of 3 people per class. We had about 27(!) people in the class, so this took us most of the semester. Then, in the last three weeks of the semester, we met in the gallery during this period and had final crits with visiting artists.",
