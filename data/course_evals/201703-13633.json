    "How to tell a story, writing effective screenplays, learned about the business aspect of screenwriting.",
    "I learned so much about film on this course, it is difficult to describe in just one statement. However, I would say that this course offers a very detailed overview of the script-writing process for films from start to finish. Professor Price gives students a very comprehensive description of how to write a good, exciting, successful and dynamic screenplay that is based upon his expert knowledge of said process. However, the class also offers more in its references to classical storytelling in the form of Aristotle's poetics and Professor Price's adaptation of the storytelling lessons in the aforementioned text to screenwriting. We watched and analyzed many excerpts from films in this class and learned what are some of the best screenplays ever written. Indeed, due to Professor Price's vast knowledge of screenwriting, we learned a lot about the history of screenplays and film as well. I learned so much new information on this course, it is such a great opportunity to learn if you love film, which, if you don't, you will by the end of the course.",
    "The art of screenwriting, the use Aristotle's poetics and how that extends into modern screenwriting.",
    "An understanding of the structure of a screenplay, and the legitimate ability to write one.",
    "I learned a ton about the screenwriting process, what makes a good screenwriter, what makes a good screenplay, etc.",
    "My writing is now much stronger, and I have a much better idea of how to pace and structure a story.",
    "There was some insight into classical storytelling ideas but it was mainly a class in crafting a good story for screenwriting. I learned how to build a plot that maintained tension",
    "I learned the importance of taking creative risks and trying something new. I had no background in screenwriting, yet this was an incredibly safe space where I was able to test new ideas and receive feedback in the process. I also put my time management skills to the test. I needed to pace myself throughout the course so that I could put my best foot forward when submitting drafts of my script and its many iterations.",
    "I learnt a lot about how to formulate, revise, and identify a complex gripping movie plot. I also learnt how to write screenplay pages, think analytically about character, setting, and action, as well as gaining awareness of a lot of good movies.",
    "I learned about the craft and art of screenwriting, from coming up with an idea, to developing the structure of the story, to finally turning it into a screenplay-in-progress."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There are so many strengths of this course, but I would say that the one that stands out in my mind the most is the seminar aspect of the course, and the fact that students are able to have direct contact with Professor Price. These discussions and conversations helped me so much in learning how to write a screenplay, which probably would have been less likely to happen had it not been a smaller seminar. Equally, another huge strength of the course is Professor Price's teaching style and enthusiasm. He is a great teacher and he is always there to give you feedback or answer questions. He encourages his students to ask difficult questions, give other students feedback and to improve their writing. He even makes some of the few more technical aspects of screen-writing fantastically interesting.",
    "Lots of opportunity\/ time to develop a well-structured screenplay with in acts, beats, etc.",
    "Strengths: the chance to work with Prof. Price, who's great; the chance and directive to develop a story before beginning to write the script\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: seminar participants weren't all stellar; wish I'd had more time to decide what story I actually wanted to work onbulk of time is spent on developing the story",
    "Beautifully laid out and fun course. Classes are a blast and super informative. Assignments are manageable and make it fun.",
    "This is an excellent class, one of the best I've taken at Yale -- Professor P is a funny, dedicated, caring, incredibly talented instructor and my writing has improved immeasurably by taking this class.",
    "Honestly, this class was very fun! I learned a lot while crafting my own mildly ridiculous screenplay, and class discussion was usually rather engaging.",
    "The biggest strength is the seminar style of the course. The more intimate setting encouraged me to get to know my peers, provide and receive feedback constantly and ask detailed and personalized questions. I also loved having the opportunity to learn from the other people in the course. The best way to improve this course is to provide more content! I loved having the opportunity to watch movies in class because it provided context for what we were discussing for the day so the more material the better. I would have liked to have the opportunity to look at foreign films as well.",
    "I really loved this course, but I wish that it met more often. I really wanted to be engaged with it and was when I was in the class or working on assignments for it, but it was hard to keep up the level of engagement given that it only met once a week. (I know it is part of the res college program so this might not be possible, but I think it would really benefit it).",
    "Strengths: used insights from Aristotle to teach both about storytelling in general and screenwriting in particular; very thorough, engaging, and well-taught; included feedback both from the professor and from other students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I wished the class was longer so we would have more time to workshop our screenplays!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend if you enjoy creative writing\/film.",
    "Yes! Definitely take it if you have any interest in screenwriting or even general storytelling. Price is a great professor and it's a very interesting class.",
    "You know that Lady Gaga gif where she uses a bunch of adjectives to describe how great something is? That is how I feel about this course. If you have interest in screenwriting or creative writing and storytelling in general, this course is a must!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who loves film and screenwriting and possibly wants to be a screenwriter. A large portion of the advice Professor Price gives could be applicable to other mediums and very helpful for other forms of writing, such as TV script writing, and his analysis and teaching of the Poetics would be relevant to all forms of story-telling, but to truly get the most out of this course the students enrolled in it should have a vested interest in film or screen-writing. If you are one of those people, you will absolutely love this course.",
    "Yes, if they're interested in writing.",
    "Yes, if you're actually looking to learn about writing screenplays. It's all you do. Prof. Price is great, and going to class was a pleasure. It would also behoove you to pick a story you're excited about to begin turning into a script; the vast majority of the time is spent on developing it rather than choosing it.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. It's terrific.",
    "I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Absolutely! It's relatively low workload but I felt like I learned a lot anyway--there's a lot of advice you wouldn't normally get in a creative writing class, especially focusing on and revising plot.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I was able to foster and develop my love of film and screenwriting as I moved through this course. I had no background in writing movies, yet I now know that I can take the tools from this course and keep up with an interest of mine. This course has certainly changed the way in which I watch and appreciate movies because I understand on a more technical level why movies are so powerful and profound. Deciding to take this course is one of the best decisions that I've ever made.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course especially to someone who just wants to try screenwriting out (which is how i felt). Professor Price is so kind and diligent and you learn a lot about the business from his insider knowledge, and interesting lectures. Lots of my fellow students were semi-serious about screenwriting and also got a lot out of getting their work read by a working screenwriter--Prof Price knows his stuff.",
    "I would highly recommend it; the class is a must for anyone interested in screenwriting, or even in film in general.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because I learned so much about screenwriting, had a chance to work on a screenplay of my own, and really enjoyed the class!"
