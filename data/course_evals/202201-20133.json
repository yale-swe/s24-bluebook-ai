                "I learned about the canon of French Literature and the history of French thought around these pieces.",
                "We explored the history of French literature, learned how to discuss texts in French, and also received feedback on how to write French papers.",
                "I improved my french reading and speaking skills. I also gained a much deeper knowledge of french literature and its themes over several centuries.",
                "This course is basically a survey of French literature, so obviously you will improve your written and oral skills in French. That's said, what you put in is what you get out, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend taking it solely for the language credit. I found most of the readings very insightful and well connected with one anotherespecially enjoyed Baudelaire, Emilie du Chatelet, Voltaire, Proust, Annie Ernaux."

                "Strengths - Mme. Sanjabi is one of the best professors I've ever had. Weaknesses- time contraints made it such that we didn't get to talk in depth abt certain readings. also does not pull from a diverse set of francophone authors",
                "Can't think of much that needs to be improved. Was an overall very engaging and informative course",

                "This course covers many different movements and periods of french literature, but I felt that some of the earlier movements were not as interesting and I also would have liked to read from a more diverse cast of authors."

I learned a lot about French literature and gained a better appreciation appreciation for it in general. Madame Sanjabi is amazing!",
                "Yes! I loved this course.  The readings were super interesting, and I enjoyed the class discussions.  Mme Sanjabi does an excellent job of facilitating the conversation without pressuring students too much to talk.",
                "Yes but with the caveat that students really need to be strong in their French skills and willing to participate in class.",
                "Yes! Prof. Sanjabi is great and very engaging. Take it if you have the chance, it is a great L5 credit.",
                "I would recommend this course to students very interested in french literature, but if they were looking primarily to improve their language skills, I would recommend a different course.",
                "Yes! Mme Sanjabi is very sweet and clearly enjoys the works she is teaching. The class is very much discussion based, and although my section was kind of dead, I still found her opinions valuable and agreeable and appreciated the material she gave us to guide the readings. Take this class if you're interested in French Literature. The workload was also very reasonable (besides somewhat heavy readings), 2 short papers, a presentation and an oral exam."
