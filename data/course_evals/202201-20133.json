That's said, what you put in is what you get out, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend taking it solely for the language credit. I found most of the readings very insightful and well connected with one anotherespecially enjoyed Baudelaire, Emilie du Chatelet, Voltaire, Proust, Annie Ernaux."

                "This course covers many different movements and periods of french literature, but I felt that some of the earlier movements were not as interesting and I also would have liked to read from a more diverse cast of authors."

I learned a lot about French literature and gained a better appreciation appreciation for it in general. Madame Sanjabi is amazing!",
                "Yes! I loved this course.  The readings were super interesting, and I enjoyed the class discussions.  Mme Sanjabi does an excellent job of facilitating the conversation without pressuring students too much to talk.",
                "Yes but with the caveat that students really need to be strong in their French skills and willing to participate in class.",
                "Yes! Prof. Sanjabi is great and very engaging. Take it if you have the chance, it is a great L5 credit.",
                "I would recommend this course to students very interested in french literature, but if they were looking primarily to improve their language skills, I would recommend a different course.",
                "Yes! Mme Sanjabi is very sweet and clearly enjoys the works she is teaching. The class is very much discussion based, and although my section was kind of dead, I still found her opinions valuable and agreeable and appreciated the material she gave us to guide the readings. Take this class if you're interested in French Literature. The workload was also very reasonable (besides somewhat heavy readings), 2 short papers, a presentation and an oral exam."
