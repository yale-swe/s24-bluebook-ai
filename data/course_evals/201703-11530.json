   "comments": [
    "I very much enjoyed this course. It managed to pull together a number of diverse fields into a relatively coherent whole. I liked the balance between history, memory studies and of course, filmic analysis. As someone who was relatively unfamiliar with filmic analysis before this course, I think I would have preferred a brief overview or introduction of the basic terms and concepts. That being said, Professor Hagens did highlight certain resources that we should look at in our spare time.",
    "The course material is brilliantly interdisciplinary, to a degree I've rarely encountered at Yale. It's film, history, philosophy, sociology, and memory studies all at once. I know have a solid grasp of the sociocultural history of postwar Germany and the evolution of German cinema, the artistic styles of various German film directors, the philosophical complexities and moral conundrums inherent to representing historic atrocities in fiction, the dynamics of collective memory, and a host of cinematic techniques. The course does triple duty (and more) as an introduction to film studies, a survey of postwar German sociocultural history, and a philosophy course on memory.",
    "How Germany has been coming to terms with the Nazi past through films, how films create several kinds of memories, and how cinematography affects the audience's cinematic experience.",
    "I leanred a little bit about German post-war history. I further developed my analytical skills for watching films and critical reading skills. In addition, I had a chance to undertake presentation leading."

   "comments": [
    "As mentioned above, I think one of the strengths of this course is its interdisciplinary nature, and its ability to merge the studies of history, memory and film. However, in a sense, this also tended to be one of the course's weaknesses. In particular with memory studies, readings and discussion on this topic tended to be thrown in midway through the course, after which there was a more consistent emphasis on including such an analysis in our discussion. I think the course would benefit from a more uniform incorporation of memory studies throughout the semester. For example, the review of the most important concepts in the field (e.g. collective memory, cultural memory etc...) came midway through the course. I think it would help to have a review\/introduction of all three disciplines -- German history, memory studies and film -- in the first week or two of class. \r\n\r\nAbove all, the two main strengths of this course is the lovely Professor Hagens and the excellent film selection. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I think sometimes it was somewhat difficult to know what it was that Professor Hagens was actually looking for, or what he hoped to get out of a particular assignment. In addition, I think it would be better to eliminate the recaps at the beginning of each class and just dive right into the discussion of that week's film. I think the recaps often took up too much time and were a mere repetition of everything that had been said in the previous week. Lastly, in terms of grading, it seemed somewhat arbitrary at times. For example, I never quite understood the difference between a 94.5 and a 95.",
    "Pretty much everything is great. I might put more emphasis on memory studies earlier, but we covered it in such detail in the course's second half that I'm not sure even that's necessary. Professor Hagens asks for feedback as he teaches the course, so any initial problems\/complaints can be addressed within the semester itself, with the same students. The class is pretty much perfectly designed to achieve what it sets out to do.",
    "This class depended largely on the students, since they were the one who led each discussion. I enjoyed this style very much as I had never taken any film class or German class before. It was very interesting to hear opinions of the students from various majors and backgrounds.",
    "I thought the variety of films was a highlight of the course. I thiught the assignments for the course didnt feel like burdens so much as a chnace to reflect on what we watched. I think the discussion-based nature of the course worked well and allowed for meaningful interactions with peers."

    "TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Yes, definitely!! Overall a tremendously interesting and enjoyable course. Accessible to everyone, even without any background in either German history or film studies.",
    "What an wonderful, satisfying seminar. Excellent class discussion, fascinating films, intriguing readings, and a fantastic professor that really cares about his course and his students. Professor Hagens is not just an awesome professor, but an awesome human being. He's extremely well-versed in the subject matter and is a great facilitator of class discussion. He also makes a real effort to get to personally know his students, which really creates a hospitable and friendly class environment. I really can't imagine a better professor to teach this course. \r\n\r\nThe course material itself is brilliantly interdisciplinary, to a degree I've rarely encountered at Yale. It's film, history, philosophy, sociology, and memory studies all at once, blended to produce a class experience that is unexpectedly rewarding. The course material is brilliantly interdisciplinary, to a degree I've rarely encountered at Yale. It's film, history, philosophy, sociology, and memory studies all at once.

The course does triple duty (and more) as an introduction to film studies, a survey of postwar German sociocultural history, and a philosophy course on memory.  The topical breadth of the syllabus results in an intellectually diverse class (we only had three film majors this semester, I think) and as such richer class discussion. \r\n\r\nWorkload is totally reasonable and actually quite fun. One film and one film response per week, leading class discussion and presenting on a reading once in the semester, and a midterm and final essay. Even if you're new to film studies, Professor Hagens does a great job of easing the transition and providing guidance as needed (do go to office hours!). You'll love some of the films and dislike others (a few are pretty disturbing), but you'll always be fascinated and intellectually stimulated. \r\n\r\nSo, although the topic might seem somewhat esoteric for a non-film major,  it's actually highly relevant with surprisingly far-reaching implications and abundant food for thought that you'll be chewing on long after you've submitted your final paper.  Highly recommend!",
    "Definitely take it if you get a chance. Prof. Hagens is wonderful and puts so much time and effort into providing clear feedback for every weekly response, paper, and presentation. He's a great person to learn from. The majority of the films are great, and I definitely feel like studying the Third Reich through the lens of film allowed me to better understand its history and its peoples.",
    "I would highly reccommend this course to another student. While there are assignments everyweek it takes the stress off from having one or two big assignments. I thought the films were all interesting choices and readily accessible."
