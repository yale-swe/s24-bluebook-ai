                "Weaknesses-- a little more clarification on when quizzes are, when homework is due, and what exactly is homework is, would be beneficial (i.e. having it on canvas would be really helpful). strengths-- seonsaengnim lee is honestly the best korean prof ive had at yale. super enthusiastic, is super super understanding, and genuinely just wants to see you succeed. the class is very chill (compared to previous korean classes ive had)",
                "I know this sounds crazy, but more assessment. We had small quizzes and projects but I think maybe one or two tests on grammar could help me retain the material. Strengths are that we learned conversatoinal Korean and how it would be to actually be to speak with Korean speakers.",
                "Strengths: Lee  is a great, warm, and understanding teacher!! Great class to take to grow your conversational skills because there's an emphasis on talking with partners and to the class. Great use of projects to practice longer conversations and monologues. Weaknesses: Not very much homework (mostly example sentences with new vocabulary. could be your preference!) but I found it hard to formally practice grammar structures or vocabulary.",
                "Lee SSN makes it such a fun and interesting class! I have no complaints. And I feel like my Korean has improved so much.",
                "Strengths: Super engaging classes, fun activities, very enthusiastic teacher, consistent homework for classes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This might be an unpopular opinion but I wouldnt mind having a few more vocabulary tests because those force me to really study learn the vocabulary",
                "This was an amazing course! A lot of material is covered, but in a way where each student is able to spend as much time as they want with it. One can go really in depth if one wants to, or spend the minimum amount to learn it on it. Grammar is practiced extensively in class through a focus on conversation and integrating it into real life situations. The assignments were always manageable and useful; none of them felt like busy work. Overall this was a great course, very well rounded in the areas covered, and presented in a fun and engaging way.",
                "No weaknesses! I loved all aspects of this course! The homework and projects were great practice, and the worksheets handed out in class were very helpful and well organized. The in-class activities and exercises were also very helpful in developing my language skills, and class was just so wonderful and fun. I looked forward to class every day!"
