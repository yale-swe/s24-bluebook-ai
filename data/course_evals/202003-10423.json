                "I acquired knowledge of the extraordinary course that Germany had to endure to achieve democracy and unification.",
                "Professor Allen approached Germany from an incredible array of historical angles: cultural, economic, political, military, artistic, architectural, musical. In doing so, she helped me gain insight not only into Germany, but also into 'Germanness'  that is, something larger and more abstract than just the contemporary state itself. This gave me a new understanding of how history can be written and conceptualized. Over the course of the semester, I also gained much stronger writing skills, as a major focus of the class was learning how to convey one's ideas carefully and concisely, putting thought into each word and punctuation mark.",
                "I decided to take German history because, in my view, it told a story that I had long encountered (World War I, World War II, etc.) but had only ever seen from the American point of view. I learned so much throughout this course about German history, philosophy, and culture. Events such as Western German terrorism, the realities of the GDR, and even the historiographical discourse surrounding the Holocaust were completely new to me as an American student, and I found each lecture completely engaging. This course also greatly helped with my writing skills. Professor Allen and her Teaching Fellow, Alec, provide detailed and helpful feedback after each writing assignment. I learned so much about concision, historical writing, and overall critical analysis from them."

                "Strengths: great professor and TA, a lot of guidance for writing assignments (and all the papers are a manageable length), fascinating subject material, I really liked the primary sources\r\nWeaknesses: it's a lot of dense readings but Alec breaks them down really well in section, maybe a little too much focus on WW2",
                "The lectures were incredibly engaging. Professor Allen is a natural storyteller and it made every single lecture enjoyable. The TF, Alec, was also very motivated and made us think, which made every section super helpful. His feedback on essays was excellent and appreciated. Every reading was chosen carefully and intentionally, and I loved the balance between primary and secondary sources. I loved our assignments too, because they each made us think in a different way (i.e.: primary source analysis vs. guided research vs. independent research). This class did an excellent job in not only teaching German history, but also the project of history in general (i.e.: how historians think and what they do). In the future, more discussions or student input during lectures would make this class even more perfect.",
                "Too much emphasis on reading rather than actual knowledge of the subject. The TA was very resistant to new ideas that were often framed as questions in the discussion section. Overall very rigid grading rubrics for writing tasks that limited my creative process and learning experience. I found myself delighted by my studies for this course but continually frustrated by how the professor and TA sought to restrict critical thought in favor of their own conventions.",
                "The strengths are that it was one of the most stimulating history courses I have taken at Yale, bringing us into contact with such a wide array of ideas and challenges, ideologies and characters. I would say that one weakness was that because it was a lecture course, it was hard to engage with Professor Allen directly. It would have been helpful, for example, if Professor Allen clearly designated five minutes at the end of lecture or after lecture to field questions from students.",
                "The strengths of this course are, without a doubt, Professor Allen and Alec. Professor Allen is the best lecturer I have ever encountered, and I looked forward to her classes each week. The syllabus is so carefully curated and riveting. In a class with so much subject material, every reading, lecture, and discussion had something unique and moving to add to the story Allen was telling. Alec also led great discussion sections that really encouraged us to think deeply about the material. From organization, to the riveting subject material, to Allen and Alec's help throughout the entire semester, this course is all strength."

                "Everything that Prof. Allen and Alec did worked great for the COVID-19 situation. The change I'd like to see does not need to come from the instructors, but from the university. The only way to make this course better is to offer it in person again.",
                "I agreed with the enablement of students having their cameras off for lecture if they did not feel comfortable as I did. However, just because I do not log off with everyone else does not mean that I am not engaged with the class or unstimulated by the material. Some students have work obligations that require them to have multiple online meetings going on their laptops during this hectic time (just to pay rent). Having the professor comment on this in my case was incredibly angering and honestly inconsiderate, especially because the class is designed to have the flexibility for asynchronous viewing opportunities.",
                "Virtual feedback from Alec, our TA, worked really well, as did the fact that all of our readings could be found online.",
                "I understand it was a small course, but if the vast majority of lectures are going to be recorded anyway, it did not make sense to me to have mandatory synchronous attendance at lecture, even with a few excused absences. In addition, there were a lot of frequent assignments, which caused quite a bit of stress, even though they were short, and some of the language surrounding asking for extensions and extra help was very strict (e.g. we needed a \"very good reason\" to ask for an extension - which sounds simultaneously intimidating and vague). That said, Professor Allen was largely understanding in the end and Alec was very helpful and flexible as well. Weekly reading loads were usually reasonable and section was engaging and adaptable to student interest and levels of energy. However, the final reflections in lieu of a final exam (in addition to a final essay!) was also a questionable choice from my perspective, as any detailed instructions were not posted and we weren't given a very clear idea of what the assignment actually would be on - clarification that it would be on something like \"how modern trends in German politics have been formed by historical events\" instead of an actual *reflection* on the course itself might've been helpful. Personally, the reflections being at the very end of finals period and the final essay being due before Thanksgiving break just left me with a lot of time to put the course content out of my mind as I focused on my other classes, all of which had a lot of work due between these dates.",
                "I think Professor Allen transitioned incredibly well to an online learning environment. What I appreciated most about her pandemic teaching practices was how aware she was  of how difficult a semester this fall was for everyone at the university. She was always cognizant of our other schoolwork and provided us our materials well ahead of time to allow us to the opportunity to space our assignments out. Our reading load was also very reasonable, and at the beginning of each class, Professor Allen reminded us that she was available to talk if we needed to chat about school or the pandemic in general. I cannot thank her and Alec enough for that.\r\n\r\nThe only downfall of this course during the pandemic was that the class wasn't able to meet and discuss with one another in person! With classmates all over the country, it was sad not to be able to share a physical classroom space together each week."

                "Absolutely  one of the best academic experiences I've had at Yale",
                "Absolutely. 1000%. You will learn about Germany which has a super interesting and turbulent modern history, and you will learn how that history is remembered, and why it matters for today. Germany is an EU powerhouse, so it's super important that you learn its history! I can't think of many other courses at Yale in which I've been more engaged. That's saying a lot given the fact that I took this class entirely online. All of the following were excellent: the professor, the TF, the lecture content, the readings, the variety of assignments, the balance between primary and secondary sources. If you want to learn to think like a historian, this is your best option.",
                "Yes, but I would warn them of the professor and the TA. Having a discussion section was honestly unnecessary too as it aided in my learning very little.",
                "YES! Professor Allen is an outstanding teacher, and one of the best I have had at Yale so far. Each lecture is carefully crafted and simultaneously stands on its own while also fitting into the larger arc of the course. By the closing lectures, I was able to understand contemporary Germany so much more than I ever thought I would have been able to. This was thanks to Professor Allen's incredible teaching style and collection of sources.",
                "I really cannot recommend this course enough. Professor Allen is a world-class scholar whose lectures are the most riveting I have ever encountered. My classmates and I often remarked on how impossibly eloquent she is. (What's more, she wrote a book while teaching this course this fall.) The course tackles difficult subject material in a deeply empathetic and thought-provoking way. Thanks to Allen and her Teaching Fellow, Alec, the class is incredibly organized and helpful throughout the entire semester. Alec gave detailed feedback on each of our writing assignments, and he was always available to chat through paper prompts or discuss ways to improve our historical writing. I looked forward to his discussion seminars for the fascinating conversations (and fun chats) we had as a class. They were a nice and engaging hour-long break during an otherwise long online semester. From fascinating subject material, to Professor Allen's lectures, to her and Alec's kindness, this course is a must-take at Yale. You will not regret it."
