I also learned how to engage in discourse in a more pre-professional setting than a traditional academic setting expected from a classroom, which I found creative and liberating.",

                "Strengths: interesting speakers, topics, and readings. Getting to speak with some of the speakers was an amazing experience. Weaknesses: I did not find Professor Lipman to be a fair professor. Whether this was an implicit bias, she seemed to favor YDN students, and the feedback received sometimes made almost no sense. The first assignment was an awful experience. The class also felt like an echo chamber and elitist at times.",
                "The course could use more explicit journalism instruction. It was really wonderful to learn from Professor Lipman and all of our brilliant guest speakers.",
                "The strengths of the course are the number of renowned guest speakers who spoke to the class, the deep level of engagement each student was expected to come in with every week (for participation points/projects) and the sheer \"fun-ness\" of the class assignments and the insightfulness of the feedback I received on each assignment. The weakness of this class was the lack of academic-founded debate, largely due to its pre-professional nature. I think more emphasis on academic research might be good to avoid simple debates or repeated claims, but overall I believed it was a great class.",
                "Professor Lipman really cares about her students and brings in the best guest speakers!",
                "I love the guests, as well as the in-class discussions and the coverage comparisons. I think we could perhaps have spent more time on history.",
                "Strengths -- guest speakers!!!, good class discussion on interesting topics, fairly well balanced assignments\r\nWeakness -- this is a bit intangible, but it felt like the class kind of had a competitive, or at least just non-collaborative, vibe, in part fostered by Prof Lipman often sharing the \"best\" work with the class. This is a small thing -- the class overall was great -- but I just felt perhaps worth noting.",
                "Strengths: Prof Lipman is an industry expert which adds significant value to class discussions, readings were fascinating, guest speakers were a major highlight. Received good feedback on my writing.\r\nWeaknesses: class discussion, especially news analysis, often became repetitive/circular. Assignments were graded fairly but workload was high. More political bias than any other class I've taken at Yale.",
                "The course is interesting, but we discuss a variety of things quite lightly instead of getting into one thing in depth. Professor Lipman provides good feedback when you reach out and ask for it, which is helpful.",
                "Strength: all the guest speakers are amazing! If you are someone who's truly passionate about journalism, this course will further convince you that journalism is the best career one could ask for in the world. Professor Lipman is extremely kind, empathetic, professional and insightful!!!",
                "One of the biggest strengths of this course was the expertise that was on display throughout the semester. Not only is Professor Lipman incredibly accomplished and well-regarded in journalism, but every other week we got visited by an influential journalist to speak about their work. I think that our discussions and the general organization of the course was also a strength, as I always felt comfortable speaking but never pressured. Lastly, there was always very clear feedback that you got on assignments both before and after you submitted them.",
                "The lectures were very informative and the guest speakers were phenomenal! Professor Lipman is a great professor and truly cares about everyone's success in the class. Grading was a little harsh, but not unreasonable. The content was moreso of and about corporate, elite, liberal journalism. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but just something to keep in mind when going into the class. Be prepared to be in a class with a lot of YDN writers."

                "I would not recommend this course. I'm disappointed since close friends recommended this course to me, but I'm unsure what happened between this year and last year. The space felt elitist and, in many ways, embodied why people distrust the media. The feedback left me feeling as if Professor Lipman has not even read my assignments, and I was unclear about her grading rubric. She also made several comments that I found insensitive. It's sad because the class was genuinely exciting content and speaker-wise,  but these elements made me not enjoy the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student looking to learn more about contemporary issues in the media and how they intersect with political polarization and government operations.",
                "Yes! It's an amazingly interactive course that introduces a student to the world of media & the newsroom, and brought in diverse perspectives to teach us about how the biggest problems in political science and the newsroom interact. It's also heavily engaging and full of once in a lifetime experiences - if I could take this class again, I would.",
                "yes absolutely! Professor Lipman has a wealth of experience to share and brings in incredible guest speakers!! It's a great course and the writing assignments aren't overwhelming and are pretty fun.",
                "Absolutely. I think that the challenges facing journalism are some of the most important facing the country today, and this class is a great opportunity to explore them. Plus, meeting the guest journalists who come in is super cool.",
                "Yes, especially those unfamiliar with the journalism world but wanting to learn more. If you are a journalist / have had experience in professional journalism, a lot of the material might feel redundant. But take it anyway for the amazing guest speakers!",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in journalism careers. The guest speakers and Prof Lipman's own expertise were major highlights. I did find news analysis presentations and class discussions often repetitive.",
                "YES if you are interested in journalism!!!",
                "Yes, definitely. The course is good for anyone, regardless of journalism/media experience. I feel like my writing and ability to analyze the news has gotten much better.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, because there are many extraordinary opportunities to connect with journalists at the top of their fields. Obviously, it's always great to get a glimpse into the \"real world\" and be in a space where you can put yourself out there and ask a lot of questions. If you don't want to be a journalist or have little to no interest in journalism and just want to take this class for fun, then you might want to find something else to take. The class is great, but there is a very clear audience."
