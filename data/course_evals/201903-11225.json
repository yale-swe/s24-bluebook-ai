   "comments": [
    "Close reading of most chapters of Heidegger's Being and Time and survey of important themes, including authenticity, falling, temporality, etc.",
    "This course allowed me to meaningfully engage with an often difficult philosophical text.",
    "A cursory understanding of Heidegger's Being and Time, which amounts to a life-changing amount of new knowledge.",
    "A thorough understanding (if one truly exists) of the ins and outs of B&T, and the philosophical context necessary to truly appreciate it",
    "I've become familiar with Heideggerian terminology, and a key milestone in the movements of philosophy in the twentieth century. Being and Time is a monumental work, especially in existential philosophy, and Professor Hagglund did a very good job breaking down the almost impenetrable text! Writing a philosophy paper on a thinker like Heidegger is itself a challenging learning experience: almost every single piece of his philosophical system is bound up in each other  with each component being inseparable from each other, writing clear, inclusive analytical essays (3 5-page papers) has definitely sharpened my writing, especially writing for philosophy papers.",
    "By dealing with the difficulty of reading Heidegger, I have gained reading-interpretive skills at a faster rate in this class than  any other course I've taken at Yale. Through thorough lectures and a small section sizes, the course walks you through all of the arguments in one of the hardest philosophical texts I've had to read, and supports you in learning how to write about and analytically evaluate them.",
    "- argumentative writing\r\n- close reading of difficult intellectual material\r\n- understanding of an intellectual argument by a leading thinker",
    "Heidegger's Being and Time was a wonderful close-read of one of the most influential works in modern philosophical history (or perhaps, the most important philosophical work). The class took a very layered approach to understanding Heidegger's ideas and followed closely with the structure of the book. Martin Hagglund did an intense lecture once a week, followed by seminar discussions with our teaching fellows. The course allowed me to deeply understand Heidegger's argument for Being and temporality. Overall, the class has influenced my personal life in a remarkable way thanks to professor Hagglund's teachings, my own reading, and discussions with my seminar peers.",
    "I gained a comprehensive overview of Heidegger's seminal work Being and Time. The three papers that were required as part of the course allowed me to refine my argumentative skills in the context of philosophy papers, and further familiarize myself with Heideggerian terminology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One weakness might be Professor Hagglund's lecture doesn't usually follow our readings very closely.",
    "The information delivered in lectures was always presented clearly and in a way that made it easy to engage with. Instruction regarding papers was always clear and feedback was excellent.",
    "Strengths- Professor Hagglund is an expert in the field of philosophy, and did well in providing fitting examples and synthesizing a lot of convoluted  philosophical concepts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- lecture format; course had potential as a seminar",
    "Strengths  Hagglund = incredible, TFs all = incredible, class is mind-blowing and truly original because a lot of what is taught is Hagglunds own extraordinarily advanced personal interpretation of Heidegger, which cant be found summarized in a textbook  the class felt incredibly valuable for that reason\r\n\r\nWeaknesses  2 hours of straight Heidegger = mental exhaustion at the end",
    "The strengths of the course is the Professor Hagglund's amazing lectures, being able to break down complex ideas into intimate, understandable pieces. His passion for the text is inspiring. The TFs in this course were also brilliant and very dedicated, giving helpful feedback on our essays. One point which might actually be both a strength and weakness, is that although this class is a close reading of the text, we don't really touch the text proper during class  instead, Professor Hagglund's lecture follows the weekly reading assignments in a thematic fashion. Frankly, I've enjoyed this style as it helps clarifies ideas even on weeks that you're too swamped to do the readings proper (reading this text takes far more effort than any I've read). At times, however, it may seem that the lectures are repeating itself, and the new ground covered isn't very apparent  this may not really be the fault of the syllabus, since Being and Time itself references terms and explanations backward and forward throughout the text.",
    "The course had high quality lectures and very helpful sections considering the difficulty of the text. The paper topics were engaging.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- knowledgeable instructor and TF\r\n- well structured course\r\n- adequate workload\r\n- summary of course content at the end of the semester\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- 3-hour lecture was too long, although I acknowledge that this problem was probably not caused by the instructor but rather due to scheduling conflicts within the registrars office",
    "Strengths: Prof. Hagglund's lectures. You can tell that for him, the text has not yet been settled. In his mind, it is still very much alive and bristling with tensions. This is what makes the class so exciting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Is a series of five-page papers really the only way to dive into the text?",
    "I really enjoyed the structure of an intense lecture, followed by a discussion section. I felt like it was necessary given the density of the work and the section allowed the students to clarify any misunderstandings.",
    "The course was easy to follow and I greatly appreciated the chapter-by-chapter structure. It was, however, a lot of reading, and the course expected us to read well before the lectures, when I found it easier to comprehend the subject matter in the book after listening to the lectures. The lectures themselves varied in quality. While professor Hagglund is an amazing lecturer and clearly knows the subject matter in depth, the lectures more so serve as an elucidation of HIS own interpretation of the book, as opposed to a more objective explanation of each chapter. This meant that I rarely was able to use the lectures when writing papers, for example. Moreover, the syllabus had some mistakes in its structuring, and those should be tended to.",
    "Professor Hagglund's commitment to the material is very admirable, as well as his efforts to impress us with its importance. This is an ethical reading of Being and Time, and it takes straight aim at the lives of the students themselves. Professors in the philosophy department would do well to take note. \r\n\r\nThe hour and 50 minute lecture format is novel, but I'm not sure the professor has found a way to manage it yet. Even introducing a simple 5 minute break at the midpoint would help a great deal; generally the lecture began to lag about half-way through. \r\n\r\nThe 'analytic' approach of the lecture is also novel (and Heideggerian in its own way); but it too could be made more radical, purer. In the syllabus, for instance: why must the order of the 'analytical' exposition follow the order of the book?"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. Heidegger's concepts are very important to modern philosophy and this course familiarizes you with all the key concepts.",
    "Yes! This is easily one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Heidegger is certainly intimidating at first, but Prof. Hagglund presents it clearly and makes Being and Time relevant to anyone engaging with it.",
    "Yes. Heidegger is amazing and must be taken in a course. Hagglund is a genius. Anyone who does not take advantage of the opportunity to learn from him is an idiot.",
    "Yes, because I think it is excruciatingly difficult to grasp Being and Time without Hagglund's lectures, which are really helpful. And Being and Time is worth getting to know. Hagglund's take on the text (meaning what he chooses to emphasize) is also phenomenal and one to engage with. I hope next time class is broken into two class meetings, because the 2.5 hour lecture was just too long to pay attention and stay focused.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student with a philosophy background, since Heidegger's work draws upon Hegel, Kant, etc.",
    "if youre interested in philosophy (and familiar to a relatively advanced level), this is a must-take.",
    "Certainly! Being and Time is an important work that should be studied, especially for those interested in contemporary philosophy. As the bedrock of most existential philosophy, Heidegger's thought prompts one's own reflection about what being means, and what being well means. A must-take course at Yale, especially with Professor Hagglund's excellent lecturing.",
    "I would recommend this course to any students who are interested in exploring the question of Being and human nature, entailing how humans interact with the world, with their own deaths, with time, and with freedom. Being and Time is an exceptionally rewarding text, but it does require a lot of work put in to get the most out of it, and the 40-50 pages a week require extra attention to make this course work. If one is willing to put in that reading and analysis of these questions, this course will force them to think about life and the world from a completely different perspective.",
    "Yes. It is an amazing opportunity to closely examine one of the most important intellectual works of the 20th century.",
    "Yes! Come listen to Hagglund lecture. It's fantastic.",
    "The course material is very difficult to understand, and requires a lot of time to fully get into.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is willing to engage and grapple with a very difficult philosophical text or any student who would like to understand themselves better in light of the reading. Otherwise, the course can feel quite overwhelming and grasping Heidegger's argument can be frustrating at times. However, the outcome - if the intention is right - is highly rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who is genuinely interested in gaining a better grasp of Heideggerian philosophy."
