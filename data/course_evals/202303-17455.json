                "analyzing animation, learned about its history",
                "Through this course I learned about identifying many different animation techniques, the historical development of animation, the role of race and gender in animated film, the distinctions between Western animation and Japanese anime, etc.",
                "When asked about what class I enjoyed most this term, I immediately responded with this one. I came in as simply a huge Disney fan but left with a deeper understanding of animation as a storytelling method. I understand how animation differs from traditional live action cinema and have a deep appreciation for the grueling process in which it is made. This was my first ever film class I have taken and I learned so much regarding analyzing film.",
                "I learned all the basics of animation and what it is and how it has developed over time. I was able to learn theory, history, and more about animation. It was an impressive survey of what is an extremely rich and important history.",
                "History and theory of animation practice",
                "the history of animation was extremely interesting and it made me broaden my understanding of what 'animation' is",
                "This course provides an overview of the field of animation, and it helps students discover what they deem \"animation\" to mean. You learn about the history of both studios and techniques, and you see just how deep and rich the field is.",
                "I learned how to analyze and study animated film (and other films forms) and watch through a critical lens.",
                "I learned a lot about animation history from its origins to now. The definition of animation has since been turned on its head for me after having gone through this class. From Japan to US history, it was interesting to see the development of animation in both countries especially during important events such as WWII.",
                "Learnt about the history of animation and different animation styles. How to analyze animation and about different film theories.",
                "I learned so much about the history of animation along with the history and classification of the term itself. This course taught me a lot of different view points in animation history and helped me craft thesis papers about film(s) that argue opinions effectively.",
                "I learned a lot about the principles of animation and even more about how to go about analyzing animation in an academic setting.  I learned a lot about the long history of animation, including its entanglement with racism and issues with labor.  The course also looked at differences between animation across cultures (as well as interrogating that premise) as well as limited animation versus bigger studio animation."

                "The course is all strength, but the only weakness is the monotony that comes with a repetitive lecture format.",
                "Strength:\r\n\r\nCourse Content: The information that we learn throughout the course is very interesting and engaging! Professor Gerow is also an extremely fun and energetic lecturer, which made the lectures much more enjoyable! We also got to watch a wide variety of animated films and shorts from a variety of different genres (i.e., Disney, animated documentaries, experimental animation, etc.).\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n\r\nTime Requirement: Though the workload of the course was light, it did mean that your time would be invested differently. Each week we had two fifty minute lectures, one three hour screening - though most of them ended after two hours, and a 50-minute section. This on top of the high volume of readings meant that a lot of my time was invested into the class - though I did not mind!",
                "Strengths - HOW AMAZINGLY FUN THE CLASS IS!! You get so much niche knowledge that is genuinely the most fun to talk to people about, whether that be in section or at parties. I watched a Disney movie after taking the class and I was like- yep, my appreciation for this is so much bigger now! When signing up for classes, I was initially deterred by how many \"sections\" I had to go to (i.e. 2 lectures, a film screening on Tuesday nights, section) BUT DON'T WORRY!!! It's actually so much fun that it doesn't feel like a huge time commitment! \r\nWeakness - Every week is a new \"animation genre,\" and I wasn't the biggest fan of the experimental genre... some people loved it, but this is more of a personal thing",
                "I think that this course's professor, Professor Aaron Gerow, is its greatest strength. I feel that because of the passion that he has for animation he is the perfect professor for the job.",
                "The role of the section felt a little ambiguous. Otherwise structured nicely.",
                "really great lectures. i really enjoyed the screenings, double features are difficult to attend the entire way through however",
                "There is a LOT of class time expected out of this class. The two lectures, 2-4 hour screening, and one section per week was a little much. Also, section was very difficult to engage with and I felt like it was not a great use of time at all. There seem to be large discrepancies between the organization and skill level of the teaching fellows leading sections.",
                "Strengths: A well organized class and the discussion, analysis, and questions asked by our Professor and TF were very insightful\r\nWeaknesses: Time consuming (2 classes, a max 3-hour screen filming, and a discussion section every week) and a LOT is talked about.",
                "I wouldve liked to have the option of watching the screenings in my own time as most of them ran pretty late. I think the course covers some pretty interesting topics but some of the claims made in lecture seem a bit like theyre grasping at straws. I also think there were too many readings, to the point that most people probably didnt do the readings. I would either decrease the readings or the movies we watched every week.",
                "I loved the format of this class. It was challenging in a way that asked you to look at things from new perspectives. The format of the lectures and lecture plans was also a strength. Each test directly related to what we covered in lecture, and each lecture had descriptive and grounding slides so that you were never lost and always knew what was going to be talked about. It was also extremely helpful to have clear and detailed lecture slides when it came to taking notes for studying. This was one of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale. I feel some of my proudest work was done here, and it was a class where I learned the most with very little stress due to the great format. I dont think there are any weaknesses.",
                "I find the strengths of this class to be when it was focusing on something specific, such as Japanese anime, limited animation, and racism in animation.  Those specific topics tended to be fascinating and really well taught.  The more general content, while interesting, often chose to interrogate animation from a very specific academic lens that did not always seem the most productive.  Likewise, some of the readings were difficult to get through and not always engaging, while others were really interesting interrogations of the differences of animation styles or issues regarding animation.  But overall, lecture was usually pretty enjoyable and had some interesting content, with the readings being interesting."

                "if you are interested in film it is good to take, but be aware that the first 1\/3-1\/2 of the class focuses on the early-early history of animation",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student in a heartbeat! Though the course is not initially what I expected - I expected it to be much more focused on Disney given the name - I thoroughly enjoyed it. This was the first film class I have taken at Yale and I feel that it was the type of course that regardless of previous film experience, any student could enjoy it. It was also fun to discuss some of my all-time favorite movies!",
                "Best class I've ever taken  literally changed the way I reflect on animation and practices in film industry. Extremely thought-provoking and interesting in terms of content, touches on issues of gender, race, sexuality.",
                "YESSS!!! TAKE THIS COURSE!!! MY FAVORITE COURSE I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE!! It is so much fun- you literally watch animated movies and shorts and then talk about how they're made, why those choices were made, the cultural implications... If you're interested in Disney, in anime, or just have ever been curious about animation, TAKE THIS COURSE!!! I'm a first year and I became best friends with a sophomore through section and attending the screenings together. We'd bring snacks to the screenings, so they simply felt like a movie night with these films I would've never seen on my own! Professor Gerow is also a really good lecture speaker because he has a lot of enthusiasm in his voice a.k.a you will NOT be falling asleep because you're thoroughly entertained. The class readings aren't bad, you can probably actually skim them, but they're more to enhance your knowledge and you can decide how much you're dedicated\/interested.",
                "Yes! It is not an easy course, but it is interesting and fun.",
                "Yes, Professor Gerow is really fun and sweet. He makes the lectures exciting. It's a simple class but you can engage deeply if you so please.",
                "yes. it's different from other film classes because it's animation studies, so it was extremely interesting to me. I also think that the lectures themselves were incredibly informative and raised lots of great questions",
                "I would recommend it to non-film majors as a 5th class for the experience. It was such a fun and interesting course and I felt like a learned a lot for it being a class I took out of pure interest.",
                "Yes I would if they have the time for their schedules!",
                "If youre interested in different animation styles and the history of animation, yes!",
                "Absolutely. Lectures, screenings, and section were so always so interesting and fun. I was actually excited to write papers for this course as well.",
                "I would! I would probably mostly recommend to film majors or people already interested in the topic, because otherwise it might not be the most captivating thing in the world.  The workload is not too much, though, if you're looking to fulfill a specific credit."
