                "Very abundant knowledge and broad horizons. More guest lectures with different views would be preferable.",
                "This course is far too theoretical. It assumes a fairly robust knowledge of architectural theory and terminology never listed as a prerequisite. The Professor is clearly brilliant but devotes the lecture to too many disparate strands, few of which obviously relate to the basics of what a given civilization or style engaged with or contributed to architecture. As a result, the nuances in which he revels are fairly inaccessible.\r\nIn addition, there was no clear expectations of what form the papers should take. Despite several TA meetings, I learned only in feedback on my first paper what the expected components were.",
                "Strengths: provided a critical approach to the subject matter, tying historical subjects into contemporary problems; allowed students to gain a high-level understanding of the subject matter while providing opportunities to investigate deeper; challenged students to develop their own points of view through research and discussion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: curriculum followed the conventional timeline (as seen in the textbook) which was at times in tension with the intent of the class to question the validity of this very timeline (though the efforts of the professor to begin challenging what content is taught and how content is structured over the course of the semester are appreciated)",
                "This course is exceptional. I believe that there was a high level of engagement required from each student, especially in discussion section, but from start to finish the readings, lectures, and discussions were truly fascinating. There were no real weaknesses.",
                "This course had terrific readings, and Professor Dugdale was clearly very intellectual and engaged in the topic. I, personally, was expecting a little more of an introductory course in terms of learning about techniques, terms, styles, etc. That said, what we got instead was still very intriguing!",
                "Strengths were that it was a very welcoming class for those who were more familiar with architecture and those who weren't."

                "The virtual office hours were a good way to make communication with the professor more accessible to students, though perhaps there could have been some more flexibility with the times. The virtual nature of lectures and discussion sections were successful as a whole, though in-person interaction would have still been preferred (given different circumstances, of course). Perhaps lectures and discussion sections could have leaned more heavily on being creative with the virtual platform (instead of just moving lectures\/discussions into an online space). Guest lectures were very much appreciated though, and suggest that other guests from even further away could be brought in for future lectures.",
                "Professor Dugdale did an exceptional job cultivating an engaging, thoughtful classroom even within a virtual space. Discussion sections were highly effective due to the fact that each reading was presented by students every week, so each student's discussion and responsibility to the material was inherent to success on a weekly basis. Though this meant a more serious workload and constant participation, it paid off immensely in the online format.",

There is nothing about this course that feels antiquated or lofty, despite the daunting title, and I firmly believe that even a student with no background or explicit interest in architecture would find this class to truly change the way you think on a regular basis. I found myself constantly gushing about these lectures to my family and friends -- it was the highlight of my semester.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student ONLY IF they understand that this is a very intellectual and idea-driven course. I signed up for the course thinking that it would be an introduction to architecture through history: exploring the practices, techniques, styles, etc. over time. Instead, it's very much a course about the IDEA of architectural history. Lectures are generally a case study which revolve around a single building from a given historical period and discuss how that building--and other related structures--change our conception of the meaning of architecture vis-a-vis its historical context. This is VERY interesting, but it was not what I was expecting, and as a student with no experience I felt like I couldn't get everything out of the course, because I didn't understand the basic principles.",
