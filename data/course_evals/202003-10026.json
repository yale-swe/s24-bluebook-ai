They were also incredibly accessible and very willing to help. I felt like the live discussions were a waste of my time because they just felt disorganized and disconnected from the class somehow. I felt like I didn't really gain anything from the live discussion. I also felt like sometimes the lectures were not explained in a way that was helpful for the problem set, so I really relied on the TFs to fill the gaps in my knowledge.",

                "I think the content material is interesting and presented with just enough specificity  however, I think the format of having pre-recorded lectures and then only doing practice problems in class often left me a bit confused about the course material. I think that offering a quick review in class of the presented lecture concepts would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: The professor was very engaged and there were a lot of resources available to use\r\nWeaknesses: The in-class discussions felt rushed, and sometimes when no one in the class knew the answer to a discussion question the professor would not provide the answer",

                "Math skills and knowledge of space",
                "The class material is very interesting and I would say easy to follow if you really take in everything - going to lecture, office hours, discussion sections, and readings. I did sometimes find myself stuck on the PSETs without going to office hours and I wish the answers to the practice problems In the class were posted somewhere cause It would've been another resource to make the class easier.",

                "Strengths: the design of the curriculum. In planning PSETs and class discussions, Prof. Faison did an excellent job thinking up interesting questions that drew on the lecture material but additionally (1) required creative thinking and (2) were relevant to current and\/or historical astronomical discoveries. This helped make the material feel alive. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: time management. I found that class discussions often focused heavily on relatively rudimentary material and shortchanged the more challenging questions. In the future, I'd recommend that Prof. Faison limit the time devoted to introductory matters -- star of the day, announcements, etc -- and instead concentrate on reviewing the trickier questions included in the discussion document.",

However, I definitely found myself confused at certain points in the semester with the content, and wished that there could have been a deeper dive into certain concepts beyond basic summary that would have made them make more sense.",

Manageable workload, good grading, and great survey of astronomy topics. If you've ever looked up in the sky and wondered about the Moon, planets, or distant stars, you'll really enjoy this class.",

Even though it's an intro-level astronomy course, you learn a LOT about stars and our solar system. The material covered is absolutely fascinating.",
                "Yes great course",
                "I would indeed recommend, although ASTR 120 \"Galaxies and the Universe\" was a more interesting class. The information is helpful but not overly complex, and the mathematics required is just challenging enough to brush up on some helpful basics but not too difficult. PSets took me between four and eight hours, but they're graded leniently and with an eye toward understanding concepts, not flawless computation.",
