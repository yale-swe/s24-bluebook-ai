    "I learned how to close read. And also how to close read and to close read and close read. Sometimes in class we would close read. I also learned to ask not what the author's intention was in writing a work, but rather to examine its effect on the audience--by close reading.",
    "Important works of \"western\" literature from ancient Greece to medieval Italy, and how to pick them apart.",
    "A much better understanding of the mythos, themes, and key characters\/motifs of classical literature; close reading and analytical skills.",
    "-how to read, think about, write, and speak about literature in a more critical way \r\n-how literature has developed and how it connects throughout the start of the Western tradition",
    "I became a more generous and careful analyst of literature, learned about a large swath of the Western canon from Homer to Dante, and spent time with an excellent professor for a semester. What more could I ask for?",
    "This course was a great introduction to writing at the college level. I am leaving this class with a stronger skills in style, structure, analysis, and close-reading.",
    "I learned a completely different way to think about and analyze classic literary texts.",
    "I learned how to perform a close reading and how to refine my analytical work on cryptic literary texts.",
    "I feel that my approach to reading literature has changed tremendously. I'm a much closer reader, and I strive to analyze all meanings that the work may be conveying."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Slanski is incredible, the material is beautiful and thought-provoking. Loved every second of class and so much of the reading.",
    "The course was a good opportunity to read excellent literature and to practice writing. While the assignments were occasionally vague, that generally spoke to their flexibility rather than missing instructions.",
    "I overall enjoyed the course. I think that the coverage of different topics and interesting readings was generally good, and section meetings were generally helpful in covering the key moments in each author's writing (although sometimes this coverage is a bit spotty due to time constraints). \r\n\r\nI would suggest two areas professors could consider for improvement in the future. First, it would have been helpful at the beginning of the course to share some strategies for reading and note-taking that have worked for students in the past. This would have helped students who have not handled similar reading-loads or such content-heavy courses in high school. Second, the lectures are often quite difficult to follow, even for a student who is fully attentive and trying to take notes. This could be improved by setting out clearer structures and 'signposts' in lectures (e.g. noting the key claims and ideas in the lecture at the beginning of the lecture, and noting as we go through each one), or using presentation slides or more clear\/detailed handouts which correspond more closely to the content of the lecture. Handouts right now are often just collections of quotes, which can be confusing for someone who isn't incredibly clear on what is happening in the lecture at the time. The most useful handouts, I have found, delineate the structure and claims of the lecture as well as the sources\/evidence used. These are more useful for reference and understanding in lecture, and are much easier to study with. I believe addressing that this final problem that I have described in particular would help with the lecture attendance problem DS seems to face.",
    "-very interesting and engaging material \r\n-great lectures \r\n-really awesome seminar discussions\r\n-sometimes so much material that I felt like I couldn't go as deep into it as I would have wanted",
    "I love Professor Slanski. I love what we read. Seminar was awesome. Lectures were generally very informative and helpful. I don't really have any negative feedback for the course, and I'm not afraid of providing constructive criticism.",
    "In the end, I came away with a lot of incredible knowledge. This course change the way I think about literature. However, at times I felt like individual classes didnt have a clear sense of direction.",
    "It was truly a great way to improve a students writing and analytical skills. Also, every student was encouraged to speak up in class.",
    "This course has a great reading lineup, but we go through books WAY TOO FAST. I often felt like we barely scratched the surface of a work."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to another student. It is an excellent opportunity to write and read a lot. It also forces you to rethink your writing and craft more interesting claims.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, dependent on their interests. If someone seems like they would enjoy learning about classical literature at a thematic\/broad level, I would definitely recommend this course as an effective way to do so. If they show less interest in these topics, or wish to take a deeper dive into texts, I would think that they would gain much less from the course.",
    "Yes!! It allows you to engage meaningfully with a wide range of literary styles and texts that have been very influential in the Western tradition, and I feel like it has greatly deepened my ways of thinking\/reading and also strengthened my writing.",
    "I absolutely would. Directed Studies has been amazing so far, and Literature was one of the highlights of my experience in the program. We read wonderful books, and our section was engaging. Working through some of the best books in the Western tradition has made me a more thoughtful human being. I would especially recommend Professor Slanski, who is very demanding and detail-oriented but also fiercely kind, supportive, and available.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The syllabus is interesting and Professor Slanski is really great.",
    "Yes I would. This course is incredibly helpful in learning how to think about literature.",
    "I would, as it is a great way to start for someone who needs to take their approach to literature to the next level."
