To give an example of what that means, he personally knows most of the authors that you read in the course. \r\n\r\nIts main weakness is that you dont get much of an opportunity to practice your spoken Chinese unless you go to non-mandatory Chinese tables. Su laoshi mostly just talks to you, which is often useful, but theres hardly ever any real class discussion.",
