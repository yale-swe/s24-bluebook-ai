                "I definitely improved my reading skills in reading ancient Greek and Roman texts. I've never read any of these texts before, but I'm grateful for this program for letting me to engage with them intellectually. I do think of them quite often now. It pushed me out of my\r\ncomfort zone and definitely improved my analysis of these texts when reading them as a whole. My appreciation of classics and this time period has greatly improved. These really are foundational texts that I'm glad I read. The learning curve is very real and very intense (for me, coming from a magnet, STEM-oriented, public high school education) in terms of reading workload and essay writing and preparation, but there's a lot of support. The design of the program overall helped me with time management and reading/writing skills, all of which I am grateful for.",

                "We had a very large class, but Professor Harte managed it extremely well and made sure everyone felt comfortable contributing to discussions.",
                "Strengths: Good syllabus, engaging and kind professor\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes discussion would veer all over the place. Often no straight up lecture time where concepts were explained, we would just dive into discussion right away, as if everyone already understood everything",
                "I had never taken a philosophy course prior to this class and was quite happy with it. That being said, it was more difficult than the other DS classes I took and sometimes I felt like there were too many ideas we were responsible to know but which we never talked about in class, thus meaning I didnt understand several of them. The volume of ideas was difficult to manage. I truly did enjoy this class though.",
                "This course has diverse breadth and left me feeling like I understood the major traditions of thought at the time. I did feel like some sections were too dense for adequate in-class attention/explanation (particularly Aristotle)",
                "Compared to other Directed Studies classes, the volume of reading is relatively more manageable, so it allows for greater close reading and, in turn, more specific seminar discussions. The reading can, at times, be complex, but it helps develop your reading comprehension skills.",
                "The strengths were that the large course load challenged me to really be on top of my readings and papers. There was not a time where I didn't have things to work on or improve. The weakness may be a lack of step by step writing guidance (or even reading guidance). Especially in the beginning, it might have been more helpful if there was higher quality workshops on reading and writing philosophical texts on the section level (with the professor). It would have helped put everyone on more equal playing fields."

I had extremely limited experience with these\r\ntexts coming it, but I wanted to try it out and overall I would recommend it. It is intense and\r\ndifficult but really rewarding: you get out of it as much as you put into it, and by design, this\r\ncourse asks you to put a lot into it. It's a beautifully design liberal arts education, and I\r\nguaranteed it's hard to regret doing it, even if it feels too difficult at times.",

                "Yes, it is a great introduction to ancient philosophy.",
                "Yes, but only if you want a really in depth, rigorous introduction to ancient philosophy. Taking a seminar course with a very experienced professor is rewarding, but it is challenging and goes into the depths and nuances of the more general concepts/takeaways."
