At the end of the course, our instructor asked us to read the first paragraph of the first draft of our essay. The improvement that the class facilitated for my writing skills shocked me.",
                "One of the main things I enjoyed about this course was the depth and variety of content we were exposed to. With each unit, we had the opportunity to learn about and practice applying a different type of writing style. And with each unit, we received feedback on our writing, which enabled us to understand our weak points so we could improve in the next unit.",
                "In English 120, I was able to perfect my writing skills. I learned how to effectively write narratives that were able to build tension throughout a piece that would draw in the reader's attention. I was also able to gain critical reading skills from reading various pieces of texts. While reading, the class taught me how authors were crafting their piece, and I attempted to use their techniques in my own writing.",

                "Amazing course, only complaint is the artificial restrictions on who can get an A make the whole thing less enjoyable than it could be.",
                "The course's small environment encouraged everyone to contribute to the discussions that we had in class. I feel like I really had a chance to understand others' viewpoints, and I appreciated learning about the many ways that people interpret writing. Essay workshops--both of my own essays and others' essays--were also very helpful: I learned strategies to improve my own writing by listening to feedback that others' gave to me and to my peers. The essays that we read for the class were also all relevant and enjoyable. It was a fun class.\r\n\r\nIt was very hard for me to think of a potential weakness in the class. The class was phenomenal. With that said, a small modification that I think might be able to improve the class might be if students communicated more directly with each other rather than the current model of contributing to a class discussion. For example, I really enjoyed an activity that we did with interviewing our peers since I was able to learn more about my classmates. At the end of the course, I felt like I still didn't know too much about my classmates.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that we always had to turn in polished drafts instead of rough ones. Having to always turn in a fully written and edited version for 1st draft not only allowed us to receive in depth feedback, but also helped us not procrastinate or feel like we had to rush to write it before the deadline. I dont think there were any weaknesses in the course.",
                "A strength of the course was how engaging the whole class was. We went through texts together, and there was never a point where I was lost and on my own. The class worked together as a team to analyze writing as well as analyzing our own writing. When I first came into class and heard about revisions, I was really nervous and worried because I am not the best writer, but this class taught me that good writing doesn't need fancy words and etc. The techniques you put into it mean a lot more and give the piece value. A weakness of the class is how fast paced the class is. There are lots of readings due every class and most times we don't get to every single one in class. I wish we had less readings, so that we could talk about them more in depth and really focus in on certain ones.",
                "Strengths :\r\nLoved that we read a lot of shorter works\r\nWeakness:\r\nFelt like there was unclear expectations for grading",
                "ENGL 120 was amazing. No weaknesses. The syllabus was engaging and interesting (really different from most english classes) and the writing prompts were so fun."

This class became one of my favorite courses that I've taken at Yale, and it was a class that I thoroughly looked forward to attending every week. I've never been in an English class that was so engaging and genuinely interesting. ENGL 120 is a class that I'd recommend to everyone regardless of major. It improves your writing while also being a fascinating class to participate in.",
                "Yes I would! The teacher, content, and class environment are all wonderful and I definitely feel like Ive learned so much about writing and reading at a college level.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because even if you aren't an English major or into writing (like me), the class still offers you the writing and reading skills that would be useful in any other class. We focus a lot on reading others writing and how to draw out the important parts of the craft that adds to the purpose. These skills will be useful when even reading all types of texts which is crucial in all classes.",
                "Yes I overall loved the material  and Professor Robbins taught the course in a very engaging way",
                "Highly recommend. You submit your first draft for peer review and receive comments from the professor and then submit a final draft. This was really helpful to improve my writing.",
                "Yes!"
