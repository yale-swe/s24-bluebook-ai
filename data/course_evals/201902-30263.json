    "Critical thinking.",
    "the awareness of the ever-existing inequality, however the policy changes, and the impulse to make a comparison among different cities to see the conflicts and dilemmas that the policymakers are faced with.",
    "This class blends urban history with educational and housing policy to explore how spatial relationships have shaped opportunity since the groundbreaking supreme court decision, Brown V. Board of Education. It investigated a range of historical, legal, and contemporary issues relevant to both the segregation and desegregation of American cities and their public schools in the twentieth and early twenty-first century.",
    "Knowledge into housing and education policies and the situations faced by different ethnic groups as well as cities.\r\nSkills in analyzing texts and leading discussions.\r\nInsights into the field of anthropology and the mission of anthropologists.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of education and housing policy in this course, the history of these topics in the U.S., and gained insights into ongoing debates in public policy. At the end of the course, I had grown in my ability to read and analyze texts in the social sciences and ethnographic studies. The discussion-based nature of the course allowed me to develop my capacity to formulate opinions based on readings and clearly communicate these.",
    "I learned about the education system in America and the role politics take in shaping the education in America."

   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course is that it gave students a chance to read many relevant readings, share opinions on class (both with classmates, professors, and speakers), and conduct research on topic based on personal interests; but sometimes the time schedule was not always go along with the plan, letting shorter times to discuss some of the readings.",
    "Maybe a field trip would make it more interesting.",
    "leading discussion part can be improved. Sometimes it is just a little bit awkward, which may discourage students.",
    "strengths - structure . very well structured",
    "I think the biggest strength of this course is the advents of guest speakers. From them students could really know what is happening in reality and how the theoretical frameworks they learn are practised.",
    "I liked that the students were responsible for doing the reading and coming prepared to discuss so that the most could be made of time in the classroom. One of the strongest features of the course were the guest speakers who brought unique and compelling perspectives to the classes and deepened my understanding of the material and the topic.",
    "The strengths were all the guest speakers that the professor brought in, a few whom I had the privilege to meet for the first time and a few whom I've known from working around New Haven. That was very educational and fun. The professor was very well connected. \r\n\r\nA weakness would be how short the course is. Although I do feel like I've learned a whole semester's worth of material, I still wish I spent 3 more months on it."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. For students interested in education, racial inequality, and city planning, this course is a brilliant opportunity to take. It provides thoughts from previous researchers and also allows every individual students to think of his or her own ideas. This kind of subject combination is fascinated.",
    "yes. those interested in housing, urban education policy, race, and inequality.",
    "Yes. I think the topic of this course is intriguing. The readings incorporated in this course offer the students with a holistic view of this field and the issues.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is crucial to understanding the communities and nation in which we live. I think it is incumbent on Yale students to understand the city of New Haven and other cities like it around the country while they reside there. It has also developed my critical thinking and communicative abilities and I think the same would be true for others.",
    "Yes. If it's taught during the school year, I know it would be PACKED.",
    "Yes, absolutely!"
