I gained a clearer idea of what community itself means and the aspects of it that can be assessed. I learned more about ideas surrounding crime and the legal system, and what may provoke crime.",
                "I learned the differnt parts of community vitality, the philosophy behind non violent and violent protest, how communities build networks, how the police state increases its visual power of its citizenry",
                "This course encouraged us to engage with the topic of community vitality, and consider how the systems and history of the United States have limited vitality, as well as steps that can be taken to better address community needs and flourishing.",
                "I strengthened skills in research, writing, and critical thinking. This class expanded my perspective on so many societal and legal processes. I learned so much from this course!!",

                "Literally so much! The syllabus is so good. Justice and Society is my favorite class this semester and one of the top classes I have taken at Yale. Discussing sociological studies, policy recommendations, primary historical sources, and philosophical arguments with guest lecturers who bring their activist, legal, or academic experience to the table has helped me develop a critical, intersectional approach to studying the criminal-legal system.",
                "I learned a lot about the criminal justice system and various different communities.  Most of the readings were really interesting, which I enjoyed. I think leaving this class, I have a different perspective when it comes to crime, the police, and even some laws and how they truly affect people in the community.",
                "This class gave me a wealth of knowledge on the history and current state of policing, restorative justice, the impact of racial inequality on health, prison abolition, and political rhetoric surrounding the aforementioned topics. Professors Hinton and Greene did an amazing job curating readings and guest lecturers from sociology, psychology, political science, literature, and personal narratives to create a holistic picture on what is justice, collective efficacy, and community vitality and how do we move towards achieving it. I also learned so much from my classmates' final presentations on justice and community vitality in their own hometowns.",
                "I learned so much in this class, and I also feel like I grew as a person. The books we read in this class were amazing. I have recommended them to my friends and family. The readings and guest lectures taught me so much about the law as both a tool for and a barrier to liberation. I learned new concepts and insights from many incredible scholars, including my classmates.",
                "skills: interdisciplinary knowlege of the various elements of justice, how to interpret and approach historical sources, how to read various types of literature and put them together to create robust approaches towards justice.\r\ni learnt how to tackle justice through the concepts of community vitality and community efficacy.",
                "I learned about the potential of justice. This class gave me hope for justice in the future, which I didn't have previously. I learned how to use my creative juices to discuss injustices, as well."

                "Strengths: The instructors created a great environment for discussions, the guest lectures were incredibly valuable, and the readings were engaging and interesting every week!\r\nWeaknesses: The class was a bit large to allow for the most productive conversations. I understand it is difficult to engage as many students as possible in the short class period, and the instructors did their best, but I think class discussion is just something you sacrifice in order to allow more students to be able to take the class.",
                "Weakness: a little more \"teaching\" about certain concepts and events would have been helpful\r\n\r\nStrength: lively discussions made class really rewarding and interesting.",
                "Some strengths of the course are that it is discussion based and has many guest lecturers that bring so much information and experience to the course and discussions. The professors are very engaging and knowledgeable about the topics. A weakness of the course is that there is a lot of reading that, most times, are impossible to fully engage with.",
                "More frequent breakout groups, putting a limit on how long a student talks, making sure a variety of students feel comfortable pitching in (its easy for a few to dominate the convo)",
                "I loved the large seminar size of this class which Professors Hinton and Greene used to facilitate lots of discussions. The frequent guest speakers were also a highlight but my favorite thing was the high level of engagement in class conversations and the sharing of ideas. There was a real sense of community in the classroom, particularly when everyone was sharing their final projects.",
                "This course has so many strengths!! To start off, the course created a perfect environment for empathy, thought, knowledge, and learning to thrive. The circle/rectangle formation we had every class allowed for everyone to be seen and heard. Additionally, the readings for each week were always so good!! They were a perfect balance of foundational yet inspiring texts. I gained so many new perspectives from class discussion, the readings, and the class format. Additionally, I loved the author/speaker class periods!! This course was so cool!!",
                "Very accommodating instructors, lots of room for discussion, amazing guest lecturers, final exam was very fun and allowed so much room for students to be creative\r\n\r\nI think if this class was capped at 30 people, there would have been more room for engaging discussion",
                "strengths: discussion based, guest lectures, not grade oriented\r\nweaknesses: seemed mostly issue-focused; provided some potential solutions but many of these seemed to only be feasible in small subsections of communities (struggled to see how these could be applied on broader scale)",
                "Strengths: everything. Very engaging and rigorous discussion.",
                "Strengths: all the professors and speakers are very passionate and knowledgeable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: many of the weeks felt repetitive. Since the class is very theory based as opposed to concrete, it felt like people were having the same discussions.",
                "The strengths of this class were the guest lecturers and the reading selections. The weaknesses were that it was too big for a class of this style and group discussion often went around in circles.",
                "The class was a little too bug so speaking was more so a listen in on idead instead of a build because people were trying to satisfy their participation requirements",
                "Strengths: Professors Hinton and Greene created a space grounded in empathy where students can confidently enter conversations from their personal experiences. Wonderful discussions, 10/10 guest lectures. \r\n\r\nWeakness: there were more than thirty students enrolled. This should be a fifteen to eighteen person seminar, so it should only have fifteen to eighteen students. Really hope that this changes for future semesters. Every single discussion ended with long lists of folks having to squeeze in their final points because there were too many thoughts and too many brilliant minds (something you dont want to say but is so true).",
                "I think a strength of this class was the seminar style where we mostly had discussions everyday. Also, the guest speakers were wonderful and it was so great to hear from them and their perspective. I think that I got to know people in the class pretty well. I do feel that we had repeated discussions over the same material sometimes. The class was mostly talking, and especially talking about doing things. I wish we were able to do something to help the community, rather than just talk about doing.",
                "Strengths: Professors Hinton and Greene are absolutely fabulous. They are both so knowledgeable in the field and have the ability to invite many different experts from the Justice Collaboratory to speak with us. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings are on the denser and longer side, and I often found myself struggling not to skim after the second hour of doing readings for the class. However, engagement with the readings is high during the seminar.",
                "This course was awesome. I wouldn't change anything, even the slightly larger class size.",
                "strengths: excellent readings, loved the guest lecturers very much- they were all so insightful\r\nweakness: some students took up took much space at the expense of others (speaking for the sake of it, perhaps thinking it could enhance their class part grade), and this could have unintentionally hindered other less outspoken students from wanting to share their insights. I really liked the use of class discussion questions, but perhaps this could be extended such that the students who write the questions for that day facilitate/run the entire class? \r\nand I think removing grading from class participation (speaking in class) could create a more balanced class environment where people do not speak for the sake of speaking, such that a democratic learning environment can be maintained. I think overall the professors did a great job at facilitating discussions and sharing insights, that a lot of this was already naturally navigated, but these are just merely extra suggestions!",
                "The one and only obvious weakness was time! I don't know how to solve it. Meeting twice a week is necessary, and I'd rather be cut off than only meet once weekly. Strengths was everything. It was the perfect class."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professors Hinton and Greene are amazing and the class is set up to encourage highly engaged conversations.

                "Absolutely, this class is gold",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it really opens your eyes to so many things in the legal and criminal justice world. I loved this class and I think a lot of people would benefit from it. Also, it's pretty chill while having important discussions.",
                "Yes, I would recommend. Buckle up to do a deep dive into the state of criminal justice, police violence, and racial inequity in America. What you can get out of this course is truly what you put in. Professors Hinton and Greene are some of the best people I've ever met, they are invested in making sure you succeed.",
                "Yes! A million times yes. You should have some knowledge of race and racism going in, but otherwise, the course is welcoming to various points of entry. The course will make you think and rethink America's extended criminal legal system and your role in resisting or facilitating it. Also, do not leave Yale without taking a class by Professor Hinton. She is easily the best all-around professor at this school.",
                "Yes, I absolutely would! This is a great class to understand how to approach issues of justice with a focus on multiple interdisciplinary tools, and to learn from the wisdom of many different professors who are pioneers in their field.",
