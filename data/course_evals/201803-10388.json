   "comments": [
    "This is a very niche class with a specific ROTC rubric, so strengths are clarity of instruction and relevance for future Air Force work, but the weakness is that we have to cover a lot of required material that at times doesn't seem useful.",
    "Appreciated relating class discussions to real-life situations. Diverging from curriculum script when class engaged in productive conversation about leadership issues was much more impactful that sticking to the slides.",
    "I felt that I learned a lot during lecture that was easily applicable to other leadership roles. However, I felt that a lot of the time, when we divided into groups to fill out worksheets, it was busy work from which I didn't learn much other than how to quickly search google. I felt that the point of that was to learn how to work together and delegate the work, which did occur, but I did not retain much from these activities.",
    "The strength of the course is a built-in reliance on anecdotes from combat, live leadership crises (cadre & cadet), and current strategic debates to augment the drudgery of the prescribed nationwide curricula (all of which Col McCarthy took great care to build into the course, from daily current-challenge briefings to bias papers) . The weakness of the course is its occasional failure to do so, leaving 40 quite sharp cadets to the insult of memorizing 'the 7 types of critical thinking'  a self-apparent joke in irony.",
    "The instructor is a strength. His stories and insights adds a lot to the base curriculum.",
    "The slides in the AF lessons can be monotonous but the instructors make them more engaging by adding their own perspectives and experiences.",
    "Taught well and engaging."

   "comments": [
    "This class is designed for ROTC students so I would not recommend this to another student unless they are very interested in joining the Air Force.",
    "It's an insightful class especially with Colonel McCarthy teaching it, but because it cannot be taken for credit, it probably isn't for someone who doesn't have the time or cannot wake up for a 7:30 lecture.",
    "For sure, everyone in the United State should join the Air Force.",
    "The day \"you win some, you lose some\"  becomes less a theme of this class, is the day that same truism will stop characterizing its reviews. The course's strength and weakness are one: the course has a built-in reliance on anecdotes from combat, live leadership crises (cadre & cadet), and current strategic debates to augment the drudgery of the prescribed nationwide curricula (all of which Col McCarthy took great care to build into the course, from daily current-challenge briefings to bias papers) . The weakness of the course is its occasional failure to do this, leaving 40 quite sharp cadets to the insult of memorizing 'the 7 types of critical thinking'  a self-apparent joke in irony.\r\nWould say, \"Take it with Col McCarthy!\" but of course, you have no choice.
