We learned how to think about the mindset of the polity and political leadership during historical time periods."

                "Professor Fotos was fantastic at curating readings, offering support, and facilitating discussion. At times, it could become only the same students contributing.",
                "Professor Fotos is clearly the greatest strength of this course. He is deeply committed to his students and extremely knowledgeable about all of the readings. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness was the amount of time spent reflecting on our discussion responses. I would have preferred to use this time to delve into the details of the readings, because it sometimes felt like we were only scratching the surface of our authors.",
                "Strengths: Prof Fotos is a very kind person who clearly loves his subject matter.\r\nWeaknesses: class is very meta; only take if youre interested in learning exclusively about the civil rights movement",
                "The number one strength of this course is that there is no kinder professor than Professor Fotos. He is humble, easygoing, fair-minded, and gives out his cellphone number for paper emergencies (and probably just to chat, tbh). The class meetings sometimes dragged on because of the small class size, but Professor Fotos was a trooper, carrying the class with great insights and varied formats, such as debates on the reading responses, throughout. The mixture of Professor Fotos' personal politics and personal history inform the special atmosphere of dialogue on contemporary topics; because of his awareness about politics and real people, he invites the most respectful and thoughtful discourse about politics that I have encountered in the classroom at Yale. I felt like I was learning about people, for the first time, and not just hearing a bunch of voices shouting into the ol' echo chamber. You get to speak pretty intimately with classmates in regular breakout rooms, which was really nice. There are fair and undemanding expectations of work and participation for each class.  \r\n\r\nThough the reading material started relatively dense and became progressively more enjoyable as the weeks went on, it was all interesting stuff and very well-curated. I loved the focus on the civil rights period and the introduction Professor Fotos gives us to some lesser-known political scientists (maybe they're well-known? I'm a novice). It is important to revisit the syllabus and the professor's weekly memos once you experience a few classes to kind of figure out the bottom line to class discussions by remembering what is at the heart of the course in the professor's eyes. What I mean by this is that I thoroughly enjoyed each class but did not always know on what plane we were theorizing, as the professor often spent a lot of time asking us seemingly simple questions about the texts we read and was seriously looking for answers. Then I remembered that one of the foundational points to the class was learning how to state things that we take for granted. Much of this seemingly basic stuff ended up filling out my paper and helping me make grounded connections between the material that most interested me. \r\n\r\nOne frustration that I had, though, to be fair, I encounter this in so many Yale classes, was feeling like the paper did not really have a prompt. Instead, there were a series of expectations of what the paper would accomplish. I found this very difficult to approach, and the first paper was kind of a rough draft for me. There was a disconnect between how much I liked the class and what a burden this ambiguous paper felt like that really made the middle weeks of the semester drag for me. With the professor's feedback, I was able to be more successful on the second paper, which was an extension of the first, which was a good experience, but I was overall still a little annoyed about the first paper. PS, he gives \"real\" (not inflated) grades for the first paper but assures the class that it is a learning experience and that if you show progress for the second paper, you don't have to worry about your course grade. I obviously don't know how things turned out yet, but I thought that on the face of it that was a really great way to help students learn without suffering.\r\n\r\nProfessor Fotos seems like a good cheerleader to have in your corner. He is in touch with students' strengths and abilities and is a champion of the youth."

Also, sort of annoying prompt but nothing worse than what you probably get in every other class.",
