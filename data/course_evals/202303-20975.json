                "I developed a nuanced understanding about the histories of the U.S.-M.X. borderlands from the Spanish colonial-era up to current day. This included content on state formation, racialization, labor, racial capitalism, political movements, migration, and intellectual history. My biggest takeaway is breaking away from a Latin Americanist perspective about U.S. imperialism to see how countries like Mexico have been complicit oppressive projects.",
                "This class was an amazing historical class about the creation of the U.S.-Mexico empire. Specifically, it was insightful to learn about how Mexico played a significant role in the creation of the U.S. Mexico borderlands, especially since courses tend to focus on the U.S. alone. I learned about how to be critical of archives and historical interpretations. Additionally, I learned how to write succinct, concise historical papers.",

                "The greatest strength is Professor Lopez Carrillo, she is very engaged and invested in her student's learning of the material. The content itself was very well selected and included things that I have not learned about that anyone interested in Mexican or Mexican-American history may be interested in including the Massacre of Chinese Mexicans in Torren, the development of maquiladoras on the border, as well as histories of colonial era individuals expressing their agency against the Spanish Inquisition. Lopez Carillo's lectures are captivating and discussions are extremely productive as they typically include trying to get a comprehensive historical understanding of a mechanism and its legacies.",
                "Although the class was early, students were always engaged because of the diverse ways Professor Lopez Carrillo facilitated discussion. For example, one day, we would analyze primary sources while another, we were creating mindmaps on the chalkboards. These different teaching mechanisms allowed students to learn in more ways than one. Additionally, the fact that the syllabus and classes were organized around specific case studies allowed students to learn about broad theories and in-depth circumstances. \r\n\r\nHowever, a weakness of this course was the fact that historiography was centered throughout the course despite it being an ER&M class. It would have been amazing also to learn how to write an \"ethnic studies\" paper about the history!",
                "I think the content of the class was very interesting, but I felt like the readings were oftentimes very dense. Moreover, when we discussed the readings in class, I felt like we didn't know what the main takeaway was, or at least we didn't quite grasp the exact takeaway that the professor expected."

                "Yes! This is a must-take class if you are interested in Chicano, M.X.-U.S. History, or Mexican-American history.",
                "If you are interested in the history of the construction of U.S.-Mexico relations, I could not recommend this class more! This class is a fantastic way to engage with that history while learning about broad theories such as racial capitalism, empire, and neoliberalism.",
                "Yes! I've been waiting for a course like this my entire undergraduate experience and it definitely met expectations! If you are interested in Mexican and Mexican-American history, it's a must! Professor Lopez Carrillo is an incredible professor and I would suggest any of her courses!"
