I'd definitely recommend taking this over the self-study if you need some structure to keep you on track and not procrastinating. Overall, I recommend taking the capstone instead of going with the certificate if you can. It was an incredibly tough experience, especially with having to balance it with a thesis for my major (note: this is literally a thesis equivalent) but the ed studies program, and the capstone sequence in particular, is one of the best structured programs to provide you the mentorship, feedback, and training you need to complete a thesis well."
