    "I learned a lot more about hydrogenation reactions and organic chemistry of that nature that wasn't really covered in orgo lecture. I also learned to be a bit more independent after being entrusted to take on a project for the entire second half of the semester. You learn how to handle stuff on your own in a research-ish setting."

    "Its strength and weakness lies in the amount of freedom given to the student for the latter half of the semester, as at times it's unclear as to what exactly the expectations are.",
    "The strength in this was definitely the format - learning how to conduct an experiment given to us and then the planning and executing our own!",
    "The only weakness I feel applied to this course is that Canvas is glitchy but that can't be helped. The professors and TA were great and always available to help. I feel like the small class size was a major benefit, as the number of professors\/TAs\/lab personnel made the student\/teacher ratio almost 1:1. I also appreciate being encouraged to take on a project that was outside the realm of organic chemistry. I feel like everyone got the chance to do something unique and really enjoyed the final outcome. Also the professors *actually edit* your drafts\/papers instead of looking at your draft and saying \"yeah looks fine\" then wrecking whatever your final thing is."
