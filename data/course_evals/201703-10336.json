    "The course gave me a better understanding of the way the Inca loved their lives and how their empire functioned. It also made me realize that successful nations can exist in a variety of ways outside of the capitalist system we live under today.",
    "I learned a lot about the Inca government, economy, and society through taking this class.  I also learned how to identify the biases in the work of certain scholars.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of the Inca Empire, including who some of the most important Inca rulers were and what their main accomplishments were, some of the history of the empire's conquest of the Andes, and chronology of the empire. I learned about aspects of Inca culture, such as the Inca religion, the importance of Inca textiles, and what Inca settlements were like. We also talked about Inca storage facilities, their system of roads, agriculture, and how the Inca governed their vast empire. \r\n\r\nI also learned a lot about archaeology and how people go about studying the Incas. It was really interesting to hear Professor Burger talk about excavations and the merits and drawbacks of ethnography and chronicles from the Spanish who encountered the Incas. \r\n\r\nThe course emphasized writings from a few prominent scholars who have studied the Incas, so we learned who some of the most important figures in Andean studies have been and how their interpretations of the Inca Empire differed.",
    "I gained a basic knowledge of how the Inca civilization affected the development and culture of modern day Peru, and I also learned how to differentiate between different types of architecture and ceramics of the empire."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength in this course was that it encouraged us to think critically and not take anything for granted. Most of what we did was to compare different historical perspectives on the Inca, and that focus forced us to second-guess (in a good way) our readings and add our own ideas on top. The one weakness with this course was that we only had a few grades the entire semester, so it was very hard to gauge how we were doing until late in the course.",
    "The course was interesting and the topic was great, but it could do a better job engaging students in the conversation.",
    "Strengths: amount of material, fair assessments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: daily lectures became repetitive and rarely included any classroom discussion (despite being a seminar course); syllabus was disorganized and hard to keep up with vast amounts of reading material"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course, even though it's a very specific topic and we cover a daunting amount of material the way it is set up means there is never too much work, and the small class size made it a very fun and rewarding experience.",
    "I would.  The course material was very interesting, and Professor Burger delivered it in a way that was engaging.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the Incas at all! I knew very little about the Incas before taking this course, so I thought that spending a whole semester talking about them was really interesting. This class also offered a different perspective on Latin American history than what you may get if you never take a class that's focused on Latin American history specifically. I also really enjoyed learning more about archaeology and how people go about studying cultures without written language. Overall, this was my favorite class this semester, and I always looked forward to going to it. \r\n\r\nThe only other thing I would add is that this course is very specific. If you're looking for a broad history or archaeology course, then this may not be what you want to take.",
    "I think that I personally would not take this course again if given the choice, although for students deeply invested in archaeology or Inca culture I think it could be a worthwhile class.  Unless you have a burning desire to take this class, I would not recommend it.",
    "I would not recommend this course because of the repetitiveness of the lectures and the amount of reading assigned. I came away from the course a little frustrated because I felt like there was some main point or revelation lacking: why anthropology and the study of the Incas matter."
