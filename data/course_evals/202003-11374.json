                "A brilliant, tactical approach to defining the Tragedy. Everything reading was worthwhile. During class, our close reading of passages was the most important feature of the course: every comment and thread could be traced back to our prior discussions of Tragedy. I found it deeply satisfying to study such a manifold artform  always reflecting on what it even means to be a tragic drama  while also getting to experience the inner workings of so many great plays from a diverse background of authors.",
                "I am now a capable reader and appreciator of Greek tragedy. The course has also improved my ability to identify small yet important details about a work, particularly in dialogue. Finally, I am more capable at analyzing the political context of a literary work after taking this course.",

                "I gained skills in analytical reading and the literary analysis as a way of writing. I also gained a better understanding of the tragic tradition."

                "Even though the discussions were very fruitful, I would have preferred it if they were more structured. I also would have liked breakout rooms (~3 people) to have more natural, in-depth discussions.",
                "The readings were excellent. Class discussion was enjoyable and productive. The workload was manageable (the readings were usually pretty short) and there were only a few major assignments.\r\n\r\nThat said, the grading was unclear. Besides two major papers, we wrote three responses to assigned films on Canvas discussion boards (as well as replies to other discussions). We never received grades or individual feedback on these responses. As for the first major paper (since the second one was our final), we received grades for our first submission but not our second, revised submission. I respect that our work for the class shouldn't purely be motivated by grades, but perhaps some grades being assigned during the semester could ease the uncertainty about my final grade which I feel now.",
                "Strengths included the texts themselves and the lecturer, as well as the feedback we received on essays.\r\nWeaknesses were that we had very limited time with each text, so we only studied it in bits and pieces, that often did not feel cohesive.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it covers such a broad period to look at a relevant literary genre and in the interesting readings. One big weakness was that it's supposed to be at least sort of introductory as an English course, but there seems to be no emphasis on explicitly teaching essential English skills. I think this could best be fixed by creating a drafting process."

                "Definitely. As someone majoring in a STEM field but still desiring to perform literary analysis (with a love for the Greeks), English 129 was my best option. The reading is super manageable, the discussions aren't daunting, and the writing process is an important teaching moment. What more could one ask for!",
                "I would recommend this course, especially if you have a background in mythology\/classics or another of the topics covered.",
                "Yes! First of all, the assigned literature is excellent. Also one of the hallmarks of tragedy as a genre is an economy of language - this adds to the merit of the work, yes, but it also decreases the workload of the student reader. \r\n\r\nIt's generally understood that ENGL 129 is a great choice for students who are interested in DS but can't commit to the full slate of classes. As for me, I wasn't interested in DS when signing up for ENGL 129, but thought that the questions posed in the syllabus were interesting and had no clue how to answer them. I took this class to be introduced to a form of literature I had essentially no experience in - ancient Greek tragedy. Anyone else similarly looking for an introduction to new literature ought to take this course, it's quite manageable, but really worthwhile.",
                "Yes, especially if you are English, Humanities or Comparative Literature Major.",
                "I found the content of the course interesting. So if you want to get an introduction to the wide history of a form that has been very relevant across literature and theater, I'd consider taking this class. I wouldn't recommend this course with Prof. Ellermann. He seemed nice and is obviously very insightful, but he wasn't very clear with his expectations, gave very mediocre feedback, and was bad at facilitating discussions. The course seems like it could be really fascinating and engaging with a different professor though."
