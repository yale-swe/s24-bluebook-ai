                "Honestly, this course operated pretty much as I expected and as I wanted it to. I did think that the global warming segment was occasionally repetitive, but this wasn't a major issue. Overall, it's a good science course for students who want to learn about pressing social and biological issues but aren't STEM majors.",
                "Strengths: super approachable and easy to understand for a non-science person, extremely interesting topics, amazing professors and TAs. Great science class overall and I am so glad I took it! The 2 term papers--got to explore topics that I was interested in, and really enjoyed writing them! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "The Practice Sets were often pretty unclear as to what information was wanted.",
                "Great course problem sets were a little specific at some points but really enjoyed lecture.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it felt discussions didnt perfectly correspond to lectures, maybe more of a roadmap for the course would also be helpful",
                "I liked the weekly problem sets in lieu of a final exam, but I feel very strongly like they were graded too hard. I put in multiple hours working on them and I took detailed notes on the lectures, but I still was unable to get good grades on them. I felt that the essays, too, were graded harder than they should have been for an introductory\/basic course on biology.",
                "Strengths: Having two shorter papers instead of one long final paper was really helpful. Regular problem sets were also much more useful for learning than quizzes. Section was also really interactive; I appreciated the use of breakout rooms. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Having three instructors meant that the course wasn't exactly consistent all the way through. The last instructor's unit, while fascinating, was significantly more difficult in terms of scientific material than the first two. The grading of the problem sets also tended to assume more scientific knowledge than was actually taught in the lectures at times.",

                "The strengths were the wide variety of topics covered and the ability to discuss very relevant topics to ourselves and to the world we live in. Grounding the topics and concepts being discussed in an environment that we can relate to helped with active engagement and pursing further knowledge and research outside of the zoom lecture\/section setting. The course could be improved by making its expectations of the different sub-units more clear -- some of the sub-units (like the neurotransmission one) were FAR more difficult than the others and the intricacy of the details that we were expected to know for the problem sets at times seemed unknown and unfair. Further, making the expectations for the problem sets more clear and facilitating a space to get more robust feedback on the problem sets would foster an environment where we are able to learn from our mistakes and develop more substantial and refined writing.",

                "Overall, this course was quite strong. I think that the first two sections (diseases and climate change) were really well aimed to the non-STEM student, but that the third section (pain and drugs) could be adjusted a bit to focus more on the social aspects of drug use, while still providing concrete scientific information.",

The TAs are also great, and went the extra mile to give us a comprehensive view of different biological concepts. I think the problem sets could be improved by setting word limits on the questions (some questions were really open-ended, and you could write entire essays in answers), and the climate change portion of the class could be cut short. Those classes felt very repetitive.",
                "Strengths: a great introduction to biology-related science for those who don't have background. Love the discussion sections.\r\nWeaknesses: Psets are really difficult to get full scores as you never know how detailed an answer they need. Course is taught by three instructors and there are no good transition\/ connections between the three instructors. I would love to know why these three topics are picked to be taught in this class so more context is appreciated.",
                "-",
                "Strengths of this course are its content, which is very relevant to today. Furthermore, the professors in this course are all really engaging and interesting, so I really enjoyed attending class. Weaknesses are the lack of clarity on PSETs (sometimes I got a point docked off because I hadn't realized that the question was asking for a specific answer). I ended up writing a lot per each question to ensure I would get everything right, which would be pretty time consuming.",
                "The professors were definitely the biggest strength of the class. They were all incredibly sweet and knowledgeable about the different topics covered. This class is perfect for a non-sc major without a strong science background who needs a science credit because the actual science covered is not intense at all and easy to follow. Most of the course is understanding the impacts of different scientific concepts and connecting them to the broader social world which was really interesting. If you are someone with a pretty strong science background this class may not be enough science for you but it is still a great course.",
                "Strengths: well-organized and interesting lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problem set grading was too nitpicky sometimes and it seemed like it really depended on the week.",
                "Strengths: rotating professors, keeping the material accessible, picking relevant material\r\nWeaknesses: no integration of the material or review once a professor is gone, psets were not well set up with no clear rubrics or feedback until they had been graded",

                "The strengths of the course are that lectures are recorded so it accommodates people of different abilities and earning types\/styles. Having p-sets once a week helps us stay on track with our learning. Furthermore, although the papers might seem daunting they were definitely preferable to exams and quizzes, etc. I would say the course could be improved by having clearer expectations on what they expect out of us on the p-sets. Overall, this was a well organized course and the best science credit I have taken at Yale.",
                "I absolutely adore the idea of this class, as often STEM and social issues are viewed to be separate. It definitely accomplished the goal of expanding scientific literacy in areas that normally don't feel like they need it. I also thought the topics were a major strength of this class. They were all very well picked and interesting and allowed for thrilling discussions. John Carlson was also the highlight of this this class for me, as he was exceedingly hilarious and fun to watch but also a wonderful professor.",
                "The lectures and sections were very interesting. I also enjoyed that we were able to choose our own topics for the essay.",
                "Strengths: Definitely the course content. Everything taught is relevant and approachable. I can see myself discussing a lot of topics we covered with friends. The Professors are also great (shoutout to Professor Carlson!). There were also no exams so I didn't feel pressurized to memorise anything and could learn for the sake of it. Problem sets were entirely from the lecture slides. The research papers were also a great way to expand knowledge beyond the course content on a topic of our choice. Sections were also interesting and Was put in an effort to make them as engaging as possible virtually. \r\nWeaknesses: Grading on the problem sets was a little rough and details mattered more than they should. I often found myself stressing about getting the details right so as not to lose a point\/half a point in random places. I also wish the grading rubric for the papers had been made available before the first paper's deadline to have some more transparency about what the graders are looking for.",

                "Pset grading is too harsh - 50% credit for small inaccuracies.",
                "In my opinion, this course had many weaknesses. I perceived the grading to be unfair, and many of the assignments were confusing and pointless. The problem sets were extremely time-consuming and then marked very harshly. The same thing applies to the two papers. My discussion section was also not a great experience.",
                "For remote learning, this course was conducted well and was really enjoyable. The professors for the first two units were especially engaging to watch lecturing. The only weaknesses were that the third unit became much more difficult than the other two very quickly, and that our section material felt like it was on a different schedule from the lecture material, so we had to prepare for completely different topics.",
                "The flexibility of the course and the general knowledge gained are strengths of the course",
                "The course had weekly problem sets that were impossible to get full credit on although they weren't that difficult. The course itself did not have many assignments, but when there were assignments points would be taken off for a lot of petty things.",
                "i loved the first unit and the second two were also nice",
                "More guidance on written work",
                "I really liked the structure of this course. I thought the topics were really interesting and the collaboration between different lecturers worked really well. I also really enjoyed section and felt that we were given many opportunities to explore the material. I felt that the grading was somewhat inconsistent. Although the PSETs were reasonably difficult, the expected answers were sometimes too detailed relative to the expectations given in the question. I wish that the questions in the PSET were a bit more clear when the answers were supposed to include specific details, like a specific statistic. Similarly, I wish there were more detailed instructions for the papers.",
                "Strength of this course was the engaging material and the easy to follow syllabus. The work was consistent and it related closely to the classroom material. I think the class could be improved by having problem sets with more varied question lengths - more shorter questions rather than just long responses.",
                "Great course for a science credit, and a fun course overall.",
                "I felt like the problem sets were not exactly clear. Sometimes I would get points off for leaving out information. I believe the problem sets could be made better to not feel like a puzzle. \r\n\r\nI believe the biggest strength of the course was the accessibility to biology. I have not taken a science course in a long time, but they made the information easy enough to understand and truly learn.",
                "Strengths: Easily understandable material. You know you're learning science based material, but a lot of it was extremely timely and applicable to the real world.\r\nWeaknesses: Three lecturers broke the course up into three different sections, and thus made the course vary in teaching style over the semester. Your level of engagement will also vary depending on the TF you get.",
                "I liked that essays were very open ended. Gave us a chance to explore topics that we were interested in",
                "I really enjoyed how applicable the content of the course was in real life.",
                "The psets took a very very long time to complete, and were graded pretty harshly.But for strengths, TFs and professors are very helpful if you reach out, in terms of helping you work through psets and write papers.",
                "Strengths: the recorded lecture format and the lack of exams\r\nWeakness: the problem sets are so tedious. They take several hours each and basically require you to regurgitate the lectures. I learned very little from doing them.",
                "I really enjoyed professor Carlsons section",
                "strengths: interesting lectures sometimes\r\nweaknesses: boring lectures sometimes",
                "I really enjoyed the first two sections of this course with Professor Carlson and Professor Marlon. Professor Carlson did a great job relating all the biology topics back to \"Us\" (as seen in the course title) while including socially relevant experiments and anecdotes. Also, I thought this courses's dive into explaining climate change was very informative. I already believed in climate change, but this the depth and details covered in this course will help me better explain it to family and friends who are still skeptical. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, though the latter quarter of the course that covered neuroscience was a little dry and contained little connection back to modern social issues. Although I enjoyed learning about the intricacies of action potentials, it just felt like a high school biology refresher at times.",
                "i loved teaching styles of the first two lecturers; the third lecturer went a bit too in-depth and fast for an intro course. overall, very skilled lecturers, i liked them a lot.",
                "PSET grading far too scrutinized. Expectations for students not made clear.",
                "The first and last section where really great; however, the middle section lacked much biology so it would be cool to have more biology and perhaps ecology included into that section, rather than just geophysics\/climate science (to further wrap things in context like stated above)\r\nThe homework assignments were graded kinda arbitrarily, with some comments making sense and others being fairly arbitrary or about a difference of opinion rather than understanding of content. (As an example, I lost points because I thought that the best way to tackle climate disinformation was different than that of the graders)",
                "The strengths were the times the course listen to the students whether through lectures where they answered our questions or during discussion sections. We get to choose our own topic for our paper. The weakness was the lack of diving into any topic.",
                "Strengths: Interesting presentations and teachers\r\nWeaknesses: Would have been better in person.",
                "I think the course was very well organized and the instructors were very good. The only thing I would leave a comment on would be that the problem sets relied on simply finding what was exactly said in the lectures and writing it out in the answers of the questions whereas I think it would be more educational to maybe have more reflective questions on the topics seen in class.",
                "This course had extremely harsh grading. Would not recommend as a science credit.",
                "Covers the basics of how science makes the world tick. The whole neuroscience component was a little jumbly, however. Didn't really apply to the rest of the course too much.",
                "A strength of the course is how many facets of macadamia it covers! I learned about the economy, politicians, biology, environmentalism, addiction, neurology, and probably more that I'd remember if I had my notebook with me. A weakness of the course includes the odd ratios of the three topics. It seemed like the biology heavy section got an incredible amount of screentime, while the latter two were rushed and incredibly dense.",
                "Strengths: good course for non-science majors, in-depth lectures and discussion sections on interesting topics, content material was accessible, problem sets were straightforward.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: wish they talked more about social issues regarding scientific research and in medical sciences, including implicit bias, the biologization of race in epidemiological studies, and scientific skepticism (e.g. anti-vaccine movements, mistrust of scientific research, etc.)",
                "The main strength is that each lecture tackles a new and interesting topic. The course aims to give (usually non-STEM) students a foundation in the sciences that will be important for everyone going forward, regardless of their field. For example, I really enjoyed the part of the course that taught us about the science behind climate change. I also appreciate the focus on breadth rather than depth, as we were able to cover a lot of ground without getting bogged down in one topic or detail. The only part of the course I did not really care for was weekly section. It was discussion based, but most students are non-STEM, so they tended not to be too invested in it. It wasn't the TA's fault he seemed like a really nice guy but I think it was just tough for students to get really engaged. Being virtual probably did not help that aspect.",
                "Being able to learn about a range of interesting topics was great because it meant that we learned lots of practical and interesting information, and if something wasn't as exciting we would be moving on from it in about a week. However, the problemsets were graded incredibly harshly in my opinion, with very little feedback and it was always hard to know what they were looking for in the questions.",
                "Love the recorded lecture format and the weekly psets as a substitute for live exams. Was a wonderful, tangible, accessible, and impactful way introduction and survey of many biology related issues that truly impact us - I love love loved the climate change unit. Very eye opening and everyone should to watch it.",
                "Strengths: both live and recorded lectures, two research papers for individual exploration, engaging lecturers (especially Carlson and Marlon)\r\nWeaknesses: harsh grading on problem sets when I completed them to the best of my ability and directly from knowledge from the lectures",
                "Section sucked. Each section felt like an intense MUN conference. TA made us present while other sections didn't even have to present. It sucked.",
                "Strengths: Range of topics covered, excellent TAs and really effective\/interesting sections, TA mini-lectures, music to start each class, clear expectations.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: (1) The climate change portion took way too long. All of the concepts could have been summed up in one, maybe two lectures. I get that the topic is important, but it really felt like Professor Marlon was beating a dead horse by lecture 3\/4. I'd have preferred to spend more time learning about the sections of biology that Professor Carlson and Professor Paulsen taught. (2) Some of the feedback on the psets wasn't released. I can see the score, but not what I got wrong (at least the last time that I checked). (3) Some of the pset questions felt too open-ended, especially in the first and second sections. I was writing legit essays to make sure that I got all of the points and practically quoting from the lectures. I was frustrated writing everything out and I'm pretty sure that Clara didn't appreciate reading all of it. Maybe some more narrowly worded questions would cut down on all of the writing and encourage us to just concentrate on the most essential bits of the lecture."

                "PSets bad not clear instructions poorly graded\r\nSection was good to do the live interaction \r\nRecorded lectures were well done and it was great that they were accessible\r\nMake the zoom link available on the page",
                "Recorded lectures were super helpful. A well-run discussion section was also helpful for finding essay topics.",
                "I liked the recorded lecture component and how the sections were still relevant to ethical dilemnas.",
                "Worked well",
                "The virtual aspects all succeeded. Seminars and lectures were very interactive despite being virtual.",
                "Glad exams were changed to papers + grateful lectures were recorded",
                "Pretty solid course but the PSets were unnecessarily lengthy and graded on just odd pieces of information shared in the lecture.",
                "Replacing exams with papers was definitely a success. The papers gave us an opportunity to demonstrate our learning by allowing us to choose a topic we are interested in and examine how it interacts with the science discipline and a social-science, socio-political, and \"real-world\" one.",
                "As an international student, I wish a section was offered at an earlier time. The earliest sections available were at 2:30 pm, which means I ended up in class in the middle of the night every week.",
                "Section discussions were surprisingly upbeat and lively. Very productive modes of debate. Fantastic work by TF Kenneth zhou.",
                "I loved the live seminars + being recorded at the same time so I can go back and see things I didn't clearly understand.",
                "overall good adaption considering the pandemic",
                "The depth of homework seemed unnecessary at times and taking up more time.",
                "This course was very successful virtually, I have no recommendations. I think I would have had a harder time if it was in person because I wouldnt be able to rewatch lecturws",
                "I think the discussion sections should be improved, as the TA did not structure them well and often allowed everyone to just talk over each other (which on Zoom can be quite confusing). Also, this only nurtured\/benefited the very extroverted students, while the others did not have a voice.",
                "The virtual format of the course was done well.",
                "Live discussion sections were key to ensuring learning",

                "it did well!",
                "None! They were all terrific",
                "I liked how the course, despite the virtual format, still found ways to invite speakers to the course to explain their careers in science. I also enjoyed how Professor Carlson grounded his lectures about infectious diseases in events current to us.  I do feel that the Professors and TAs could have been more understanding about zoom fatigue and the constraints of online learning; however, they clearly were making an effort, which I appreciate.",
                "The recorded lectures were helpful, the online sections didnt suffer because of the pandemic. Office hours availability was good. I cant think of many necessary improvements.",
                "I appreciated that the live lectures were recorded, so that I could revisit them when doing the assignments. They also replaced major exams with manageable problem sets and papers. Overall, this was the class best adjusted to the pandemic this semester.",
                "The discussion sections provided a good environment to discuss some of the concepts we learned in lecture.",
                "I wish there was more active consideration of the time we are living in, the weekly workload of psets became really overwhelming, especially during such an unpredictable semester.",
                "Virtual format worked well overall!",
                "asynchronous lectures were useful",
                "I thought the live sections with different topics made this course exciting. Since most of the topics were interesting, it was really easy to engage with the topic and participate during section.",
                "I think that the course worked well with the online setting",
                "I believe problem sets were used this year instead of tests, and I think that was a great choice.",
                "I think the discussion sections were incredibly successful. They constantly had us in breakout rooms or debating so that we were all able to talk. The lectures sometimes included interaction but pretty rarely which would have been nice.",
                "Succeeded: Good teaching fellows and recorded lectures.\r\nCould be improved: Not sure.",
                "The practises toward learning in the context of the current pandemic were well organized so the breakout rooms in discussion sections and the way we split into groups allowed everyone to have a voice.",

                "I thought the homeworks were helpful, but were graded poorly.",
                "It was good!",
                "Super hard to get involved with the class, given the remote nature of it. I felt like I was really missing out on actually engaging with the material as a result. Felt like a pain to watch the lectures too.",
                "The weekly online quizzes were really helpful. They forced me to engage with the material over and over again, which I think was much more effective than what I was told was the normal procedure, where students simply waited until their midterm and final. The system of office hours could be improved - I'd find out about the dates and times of the office hours occasionally on the day they occur because the times shifted from week to week. A constant time and date would be helpful, allowing me to make my weekly schedules around it.",
                "I'm so glad that the lectures were recorded and could be done asynchronously, as it allowed me to take another course I really wanted to take that took place at the same time.",
                "The problemsets instead of exams sounded like a good idea, but the way they were graded made it impossible to consistently do well on them, even if I worked through my notes and the lectures for every single answer, I would never get more than an 85 at best.",
                "Loved the flexibility of the recorded lectures.",
                "Recordings of all of the live sessions gave greater flexibility and encouraged me to keep up with and go back to the lectures even when I couldn't attend a few of them live."

                "Yes if you need a science credit or really enjoy biology. Wouldn't take the class just for fun.",
                "Yes! This is a great science credit that covers a broad variety of topics!",
                "Yes. Professor Carlson was incredible and made the class worth it.",
                "I would recommend this class to any student. I took this class knowing a lot about biology, but I still found the discussion of political implications very engaging and interesting. Many of my classmates with no biology experience also found this class enjoyable.",
                "1000%. If you need an Sc credit as I did, this is the perfect class to take. You learn elementary biology but it's applied to current events and social issues, which makes the lectures interesting. This year, there were 10 problem sets, which were actually graded very tough, and then 2 6-page papers. Though this class was not as easy as some people were expecting, I don't think you can get much easier with an Sc credit while still not feeling like you're completely wasting your time, as you'll walk away from this class with more than just a stamp on your transcript.",
                "Yes, I would. I would especially recommend this to students who are interested in biology but aren't STEM majors.",
                "Yes, absolutely! It is such a great, stress-free science credit to take for anyone who is not really a sciency person. I don't mean that it is a gut or that you will get a good grade by not doing anything. It is stress-free in the way that if you watch the lectures, do your Psets, and do all your assignments on time, it shouldn't be hard to do well! I was really happy that there were term papers instead of exams, because exams would have caused unnecessary stress. I think PSETs really helped me learn the material and remember the important stuff, and the papers allowed me to explore my own interests. All the topics in the course are also very important and relevant right now, from learning about global infectious diseases to pandemics to drug addiction.",
                "Great class for students looking to complete their science requirement! The contents of the lectures were very interesting and I learned a lot.",
                "Yes definitely. If you need a pretty easy science credit this is definitely the way to go.",
                "Yes it is a good into to these concepts for a non STEM major",
                "Definitely an interesting class while also being a science credit.",
                "For people who struggle with science, especially the more technical stuff, yes, this is a good course",
                "No, I would not recommend this course. I feel as if this course was meant for people not majoring in science or biology and that the grading expectations were too high and unfairly leveraged towards those students who had previous knowledge on the topics.",
                "I would recommend it if you're a humanities\/social science student looking for an approachable science credit that is actually interesting! It's a really manageable class, and I actually felt like I came out of it with knowledge that is applicable to my field.",
                "ABSOLUTELY NOT. The problem sets were supposed to be straight forward, but no matter how much detail you included, they took off points for the tiniest, most insignificant issues. The TAs also have a huge impact on your experience, and mine was terrible (hard grader, boring sections, etc). This class is supposed to be \"scientific,\" but most of what was spewed out (especially by my TA) was liberal propaganda that belittled the few conservative thinkers at Yale. If you are interested in following the typical liberal Yale sheep mentality (free needles for drug addicts, Green New Deal, etc), you'll probably love this class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The professors and material were very fun, engaging, and applicable to our everyday lives.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student looking to get their SC credit and wanting a good class for it. This was very engaging subject-matter, and if you do it with a friend, it would be a good thing to work together on.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student -- it is a great way to ground the broad topic of biology in a wide variety of concepts that we experience and think about every day. Understanding the biological mechanisms that govern our world is particularly important to cultivating action that slows the acceleration of climate change, better understands the workings of viruses, diseases, and bacteria, and the implications of technological changes that may be being used to combat diseases or a growing population.",
                "Yea - great class! Ratio of learning \/ pain was elite compared to other classes at yale",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any non-STEM student looking for a science credit that will be interesting and relevant to their life and studies. This course doesn't pretend that science is different or scary for non-STEM people, but integrates it well into some of the social issues that I was already thinking about in my major classes.",
                "science cred",
                "For a science credit, maybe",
                "not sure; here's the deal. No exams. 10 PSETS. Each pset was graded as if it were an exam. Average pset scores were around 17\/20. With 40% of your grade roughly an 85%, getting an A meant getting really high scores on the two papers. It's a relatively easy A-\/B+. To get an A, you need high pset scores, which were not easy to come by.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! As a non-STEM major, you get an amazing overview of a ton of different biological concepts. Especially taking it during COVID, it was great to learn about how viruses and vaccines work, since it was so relevant. Beyond that, we also cover how biological and social issues interact, and I think that's incredibly important to know. I walked away with a much better basic knowledge of how our world works.",
                "For those who need a science credit and WILLING to put the time in to study, yes. You still need to put in a lot of time to prep for discussion section, psets, and the two papers. The topics are generally very interesting and instructors are great at explaining the science in simple terms.",
                "Yes, if you want to understand the simple science behind relevant current events (COVID, global warming, opioid epidemic, etc.), take this class! It's not too much work and the content is really interesting.",
                "Yes this is a perfect sc credit for someone without a strong science background. The scientific concepts are not intense at all and easy to understand but the topics covered were really interesting and informative. There are also just weekly psets and 2, 6 page essays so the workload is really manageable.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if they wanted to get a decent understanding of the fundamental concepts of biology, were not looking for too much work,  and needed a science credit. The course goes through a lot of material, so it's not no work but studying makes the content accessible and there are a lot of google resources. The sections are pretty good (could be TF dependent), and the papers are a decent assignment. Expect the Psets to be graded kind of randomly and to receive no clear feedback on them or no sense of what the rubric looks like. Just make sure to say as much as you can.",
                "Yeah, it is a good science credit.",
                "sure. its a good science credit",
                "Yes. One of my favorite courses at Yale.",
                "For non-STEM majors",
                "I would 100% recommend this course in its format with 2 essays instead of a few exams. You learn a ton, the topics are relevant to you. I dropped 3 other science credits, and I wish I could have taken this twice.",
                "Yes- super fun class and you learn a lot with a very manageable workload",
                "I would recommend this course to another student not interested in any STEM majors. Professors do a great job of boiling things down and making it understandable for all. Grading of problem sets can be very inconsistent though.",
                "Ya. It's a good science credit, fairly gutty. Definitely better than other science \"guts\" i've had to take.",
                "Yes; good gut science",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, I would! It is a great science credit for non-stem majors, the material is very interesting, the instructors and teaching fellows are engaging, and it was overall a really strong course.",
                "Absolutely! I do think it accomplishes its goal and is interesting. Carlson's lectures are also incredibly fun and a delight to watch, so the first half of the semester is very enjoyable.",
                "Yes! It's great if you want a chill class where the class material is interesting.",
                "Yes, I think that its very engaging and I liked that we had real world links.",
                "Yes! You'll learn a lot. The topics are relevant and approachable. The course isn't very scientific and everything is taught from a social science perspective, which means you'll be able to discuss a lot of what you learn with other people as well.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes because this course is very clear, workload is relatively high but manageable, and overall a fun course to be in!",
                "yes!",
                "Yes, its crucial to learn how the world works",
                "This is the best science credit available at Yale. I recommend it to anyone",
                "Course used to be easier but they made it harder during COVID with weekly PSETS",
                "NO - absolutely not. It was probably one of the worst classes I've taken during my years at Yale. It was neither a good nor an easy science credit, and it lacked structure and organization. The workload was high - almost every week, I spent an entire day doing the problem set. The grading was harsh and sometimes unfair, both for the papers and the problem sets. I put the most work into the class out of all my classes this semester and still did not do particularly well (despite normally being a good student). This is definitely not a \"gut\", and I would not recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend this course, especially if your science background is not complete. It's a fun and genuinely interesting way to learn about the science behind real-life phenomena, instead of just the theory.",
                "Yes if you are looking for a science credit as a non STEM major",
                "If you need a lighter class because you already have hard classes on your schedule, I would definitely recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend this class to a non-stem major.",
                "yes for sure!",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to a student looking to fill their science requirement. The workload was manageable and the content was really interesting. Although I am not particularly interested in science, the topics felt really relevant and engaging.",
                "Yes, as a non-STEM major this class was a good science credit option. The material is interesting and it is not difficult if you do the weekly work.",
                "Yes. Great science credit and a fun course. You'll learn a lot.",
                "I would recommend the course to other students. The class is great for those without a strong science background, and it teaches you a lot. Now, I just want to go and apply what I learned!",
                "YES, a thousand times over.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course, especially to a student needing a science credit but not looking for something extremely challenging.",
                "Yes! Good science credit that covers interesting material",
                "No",
                "Yes",
                "If you are in desperate need of a science credit, but it's definitely not a gut. Though not impossible, you definitely need to put a lot of time and energy into psets and papers for a good grade.",
                "Yes, but only if you're looking for a doable science credit.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed it a lot.",
                "Yes! This is a great science class if you need the credit. The lectures, for the most part, are really engaging and socially relevant. You will get to learn about pressing scientific topics that are very relevant to current social issues (for example, climate change, CRSPR gene editing, pandemics, etc.).",
                "a great sci credit. a prior understanding of some bio concepts is advantageous, but def not necessary. i enjoyed writing the essays as opposed to the prior format of multiple-choice exams.",
                "Yes! A great science credit that is actually pretty interesting. Definitely take the experience science section if offered, we had so many cool people speak to us!",
                "Yes! I think it is very interesting so that you get to learn about a lot of biology especially topics that are relevant today. I wouldn't take it if you wanted to major in Bio but it is definitely made for someone who is just interested.",
                "Yes this course is intellectually stimulating and a good basic understand of biology for none science majors.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student since it is a very interesting scientific course provided for non-scientific majors. If you want to fulfil your science credits, you should take this class. You should only make sure to be VERY specific in the problem set questions as they take off points very easily if you don't include everything that was being said in class (in the case the class is not in person as in a normal year I don't they had these weekly problem sets).",
                "Yes! It is a perfect combination of STEM\r\nand humanities. The information was relevant and easily understood which made the class extremely engaging.",
                "No. Poor grading system. Students who are fantastic writers will get terrible grades on essays in this class.",
                "Yes, as a non STEM major it was an incredibly fun class that was accessible yet challenging.",
                "In person, yes. For a gut, yes. Remote, maybe not.",
                "I definitely would and have recommended this course to another student. The course begins the foundation of many different topics, also providing wiggle room for one to explore their own interests through the two papers through the semester.",
                "This is a solid Science credit for non-Science majors. The climate change unit was the most engaging. The course was well designed and informative. I do not regret taking it but it was not the best use of my time. (I wish Yale would reconsider the premise of distributional requirements.)",
                "Yes, this course is accessible for non-science majors and provides a lot of insight into the scientific processes that shape phenomena in our daily lives that require our understanding.",
                "Yes! This course offers non-STEM students a rare combination of 1) not being difficult, but giving you a science credit 2) actually teaching you useful things in the field of science, regardless of your major\/background",
                "If you need a science credit but don't want anything too strenuous (yet still want to learn something actually useful) this course is pretty solid.",
                "Yes - great way to get you interested and thinking about scientific topics!",
                "I enjoyed the readings and the research papers.",
                "Yes, it is a good overview of vital knowledge pertinent to current issues in science and presented in an accessible and engaging way.",
                "Maybe. The papers destroyed my grade. Otherwise, it's an okay class. Not really a hard science. Very easy to understand. I did credit\/d this class though.",
                "Yes! It's a good gutty science that doesn't dumb things down too much. Section is great and there are some concrete nuggets of science that you can take away (like a better understanding of how an electrical charge propagates down an axon). It's not a ton of work and the papers that you do have to write come with clear expectations. Would definitely recommend.",
                "Yes, the course was very engaging, and you learn a lot."
