                "organization into modules and grade just based on three exams is awesome in my opinion. Low stress.",
                "Truly not a single strength in this course.\r\nThis class was very poorly organized. I felt it was very unfair that the exams were held on the weekends (for example our first midterm occurred on the Saturday morning of the family weekend). The class offered no organized review sessions held for the purpose of the exam and I felt the two professors were very out of touch and out of reach to the students for help. \r\nThe course material was not taught fluidly or cohesively and when I would attend the weekly sessions with the TAs they would often make comments about the haphazard teaching style \"as just how it's always been.\" I was warned from the beginning I would fail the first exam and had incredible anxiety in the days leading up to it with the stigma around the class. \r\nFor the first third of the class, the teacher made the material very difficult to understand and would always run over. I think the materials was incredible unattainable. \r\nFor the other two-thirds, although taught better, this class was incredibly challenging, and despite being one of the few students to attend the review sessions every week, I still left feeling like I knew nothing.",
                "Strengths: very interesting material. discussion sections are great, TAs were super helpful in synthesizing the material.\r\nWeaknesses: some lectures, especially those towards the beginning of the semester, were a bit unorganized and confusing. Exams are also on Saturday mornings (or evenings), which was definitely frustrating, especially because one exam fell right in the middle of Parents' Weekend. My family didn't come specifically because I was taking the exam that weekend. I would have liked exams to be during class time, while I did appreciate the longer time on the weekend.",
                "Good comprehensive syllabus / course plans. Haig's written handouts were great but sometimes lacking in visuals. In particular, we would have graphs / figures that were projected on the screen that were then not available online. Since so many parts of the course were clearly meticulously planned it was unfortunate that the online materials didn't deliver.\r\n\r\nGrading scheme was fair, but it seems like Saturday exams were not the best use of class time etc.",
                "This course moved very fast and the material was quite challenging. I wished that they would offer more times for the review sessions because I was never able to make the one offered time and think they would've been very helpful for the tests. I also wish that there were some checkpoints throughout the course to check how much of the material/ what material I knew at various points, as a way to help prepare for the tests.",
                "The strengths of this course were in the use of two different professors to teach the different modules in the course - Professors Forscher and Keshishian! I enjoyed the discussion sections from TAs as well!\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course was in the use of only 3 tests to evaluate your grade. I believe the lack of problem sets made it difficult to know what was important to understand, but I appreciated the PSETs in the first section that were uploaded for practice!",
                "The professors did a great job of explaining different concepts and making sure to review them at the beginning of the following class. The biggest weakness of this course was the lack of resources available from the lectures. The class is not recorded, nor are there lecture slides. Although we did get whiteboards for half of the class, there is little to no context for them; understanding of the notes comes from watching as the professor writes them. TLDR; the class is great for in person learning, but there is little support on days that you have to miss class.",
                "Strengths: lots of material & passionate professors \r\nweaknesses: it can be difficult to parse through all the material on your own and concepts can feel disparately linked together if you do not put in the work to understand it outside of class. Also, using one format for lecturers would be helpful -- we switched around from powerpoints, to chalkboard, to projecting paper which made it a bit difficult to maintain consistent notes between sections.",
                "Strengths - open note exams as the material was a lot and glad the professors acknowledged that \r\nWeakness - the online notes and powerpoints were very hard to follow, especially in part 2 and 3",
                "The lecturers were excellent in that they explained complex course content in simple and precise terms which was great for student learning. However, like many biology courses, the evaluation consisted of three exams that tested on application of material rather than material itself (application concepts that were untaught during lecture and not on the textbook). While this is an excellent way to teach students in a homework setting, it seems unfair in a testing setting.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures for the most part. During the last couple of weeks of the course, the professor stopped using visual aid or note taking during his lectures which made it very difficult to take down any notes. So, I would say I didn't get much from those few lectures and instead mostly relied on the handouts. The handouts were a very helpful resource that I was very thankful for.",
                "This is a terrible course. It's a lot of information taught very poorly. Lectures are generally unclear and confusing. The first unit was a disaster, the class median was around 45% for the first midterm and that's okay because it's as expected, but we dont get this curved unless we have our final exam grade replace our midterm grades? It puts an extreme amount of pressure on the Final Exam, and it just is clear how the class is not taught in a way that is conducive to learning. \r\n\r\nThe class's lecture material is all we really get, there is no other homework or assignments so we don't learn how to solve the problems that we get on these very difficult tests. Our grade is also 25% midterm 1, 25% midterm 2, 50% final exam, OR essentially 100% for the final exam. \r\n\r\nThe midterms are on saturdays, and the only way they get away with that is by calling them Quizzes. But since when is a quiz a 2 hour exam on saturday morning?",
                "I loved this course! Neuroscience fascinates me, and this course does an excellent job of approaching neurobiology from various angles. The exams were well-written, though the final exam was quite long and difficult to finish on time. I also would have appreciated a greater availability of practice questions. We had practice PSETs for part I, but not for parts II and III. Adding optional PSETS for the last two modules would be helpful.",
                "The strengths of this course were that the material presented was comprehensive in that we covered a broad range of neuroscience from channel conductances to broader neural systems. However, because we covered such a large amount of material so quickly, it was difficult to know what was most important to focus on when studying. I also found the switch at the beginning of the course from whiteboard note-taking to PowerPoint presentations very jarring from a student perspective. Lectures were suddenly more jam-packed with information and the slides would not always be posted before class or be completely congruent with what we were being shown.",
                "The course provided a very detailed look into the the brain and its many structures and functions. There are, however, a few areas of improvement. Firstly, I think it would be very helpful if there were weekly psets, even if not graded, for each unit of the class that students could submit and receive feedback on. This would make it much easier to assess the kind of material that is on exams in the class as well as the grading style of the professors. I found it difficult to prepare for the exams because there was just such little material for us to practice with. I think it would also be helpful if the readings in the textbook better aligned with what we were learning in the class  it was a little hard to use the readings as a guide for what we were learning in the class. Most importantly, I would say that there should be more opportunities to receive grades in the class than just the midterms and the final. I think that the way students perform on one or two exams is not necessarily representative of their command of the entire course's subject matter, and structuring grades based solely off of exams places a huge amount of pressure on test-taking and not enough emphasis on actually learning and understanding the content. It would be really great if students have the opportunity to showcase their knowledge and understanding more regularly throughout the semester, which would also buffer their grades."

                "Yes, if you're interested in the material (if you aren't required to take it). I took it as an optional course for my major and learned a LOT about neurobiology. It synthesized a lot of the different sciences I had taken (physics, biology, biochem, etc.). There are drawbacks but if you know that going in you should be good. Be forewarned, the first section on electrophysiology involves a lot of physics on charge/capacitance/resistance that you should brush over before starting the class.",
                "Yes, both professors were great and course content was interesting. Don't take unless you are a Neuro / MCDB / Psych major -- lots of technical details that will be very hard to understand if you don't plan to use it later.",
                "Only if it was required for their major, or if they were interested in learning about neurobiology. I wouldn't recommend this class to students who were not very interested in the subject.",

                "I'd highly recommend this course to anybody who thinks that neuroscience is even remotely interesting.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to put in a lot of work studying on your own time to reinforce the material.",
                "Yes, if interested in studying biological processes at a very detailed level and better understanding the different functions of the brain",
                "I would definitely recommend as long as the student is fairly serious about neuroscience. It is a hard course and would be alot to take without being serious about this field.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. If you take this course it's because you need it for the Neuro major, otherwise, find a different class to fulfill whatever requirement.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in neuroscience (though I would recommend taking introductory physics and other neuroscience courses first)! We cover a lot of ground throughout the semester, and it is rewarding to zoom out conceptually from electrophysiology to sensory transduction to higher-order processing across various structures.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they need it for their major. The information is too dense and while there is support from the teaching staff if you would like more clarification on what was discussed in lecture, there is no guarantee that it will help you do better on the exams. This is a tough class to do well in.  You MUST go to lecture and read Haig's handouts. The textbooks are less important for the second two thirds of the semester. Even though the quizzes don't have to count towards your final grade, study hard for them and treat them like normal midterms. The most important thing you can do is understand the style of question they like to ask and how to quickly come up with a detailed solution. The final will be long. Use past quizzes as guides but don't expect similar questions. Pace yourself. Good luck.",
                "The course is certainly an in-depth dive into neurobiology, but I would be wary of taking the course when only when you're sure you have the time and resources to study and succeed. Otherwise, it can get really easy to fall behind."
