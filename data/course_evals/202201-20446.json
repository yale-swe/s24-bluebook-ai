I am able to understand elementary Spanish and learn how to communicate simple phrases in a conversation. I learned how to present projects in Spanish as well as write essays in Spanish given a specific prompt. One thing that developed in this course significantly was my Spanish speaking. I was able to practice how to speak Spanish.",

The weaknesses of the course are that it can be very difficult to find assignments at times or know if something was assigned without constantly checking the syllabus. It is also difficult to have a project assigned on a Monday and have it due that same week. Sometimes a weekend can be very helpful when completing a big project.",

                "The strengths of this course would be that the professor is very engaging and encourages every student to speak Spanish whenever given the chance. The professor also allowed room for improvement and gave relevant feedback for the assignments submitted as well as Spanish presentations and oral assignments to help us improve our speaking. A weakness of this course is that the professor spoke and taught in Spanish too often and it was sometimes difficult to understand/learn new topics because I was taught in a language that I'm not that familiar with. An improvement would be to speak more English or a mix of Spanish and English especially when giving instructions.",
                "The course's strengths and weaknesses are the same. In moving very fast, an amazing amount of course material is covered, however this knowledge struggles to cement itself as we practiced each topic for only one day before moving on. If we didn't come back to it later on, the skills from that day would be lost, however words and phrases common to the course were solidified."
