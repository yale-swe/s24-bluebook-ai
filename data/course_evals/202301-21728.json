Seriously underestimated how much I would learn about the energy landscape, future of energy, and science of energy generation. The interactive component of the course, where we have the opportunity to visit renewable energy installations, is a particular highlight that should be taken advantage of whenever possible. The course gives you a really strong grasp in particular of hydro, wind, and solar, and I especially enjoyed the lectures that dealt with how energy technologies interacts with the market. It was also helpful to have a basic understanding of the physical laws behind energy generation technologies, which I feel like are often glossed over in popular discussions of these technologies.",
                "Learned quite a lot about the electricity grid, how electricity is generated and distributed, and about all the technologies involved with not only renewable energy generation but all energies. We focused particularly on solar, hydro, and wind, but it surprised me how many different types of renewable energies there are out there (there are 5 types of solar energy, and many different installation/size methods, there are multiple types of geothermal energy, there have been attempts to make biofuel energies and most haven't been successful. The content of this class was much more interesting than I expected.",

                "I strongly enjoyed this course and thought the blend of material was fantastic. I thought the problem sets were representative of the material covered in lecture. One comment was the midterm was a time crunch and everyone was struggling to finish it, I would have preferred more time and even not getting open notes as I felt I understood all of the material but didn't have time to demonstrate all of my knowledge. Overall it was a great course and was taught very well!",
                "Strengths: well taught and coordinated \r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "The course was super well organized, lectures were engaging and covered the required content, and plenty of office hours were available. Exams were really stressful due to the time pressure even if you knew the content, but other than that I really enjoyed the course.",
                "I think the low workload and the open everything exams are a major strength. It helped me focus on the important things about the course and, more particularly, on the things I personally found interesting. Prof. Oristaglio is always extremely helpful.",
                "The grade distribution of this class is awesome. So many stem classes at Yale are SO exam heavy, so it is nice to have a class where that is deemphasized.  Also psets being bi-weekly is a big plus in my opinion. The time constraint of the midterm felt like a weakness, but it is understandable given exams are open book, open note without some cap you could brute-force your way towards anything.",
                "I really liked the optional asynchronous format and I think it was done better than most other classes were during covid. I think the material struck a good balance of breadth and depth, and even the random technical sidebars felt pretty relevant to understanding the topics at hand.",
                "Strengths: Course materials (including slides) are amazing, with clear thought and care put into them (formatting, content, clarity, visuals, etc.). Topics covered are comprehensive of renewable energy, and both qualitative/quantitative aspects mesh well together (not exceedingly difficult and easily grasped by anyone with some math and basic physics background). All logistics aspects of the course are extremely generous (maybe too generous, but cant complain): incentive-based attendance policy, grace period on all problem sets, and flexible/online exam times w/ open notes. Professor Oristaglio is an amazing educator, and he makes great effort to structure the course in a way thats conducive to student learning and success, better than just about any other course at Yale.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some lectures are jam-packed with information. Both the midterm and final exam are not too rigorous in content but difficult to complete in the allotted time. Flexibility can lead to need for students to put in extra effort to stay on top of things (easy to fall behind).",
                "The workload is very low (1 pset every 2 weeks), but the exams are challenging. Oristaglio does not teach the quantitative content that is examined and instead expects students to look over example quantitative problems in the slides in their own time. He could do a better job of teaching the content that will be examined instead if rushing through slideshows that contain way too much content for one lecture.",
                "The workload of this class is really light, but I think there are easier science classes to take (if youre not interested in renewable energy). Especially if you dont have a good background in physics, I could see this class being pretty challenging conceptually.",
                "Strengths: pset every two weeks\r\nWeaknesses: prof is a really nice person and super available to help students, however he tends to be quite boring. he explains too many physics concepts all in one lecture without delving deep into any of them. Id rather have learned fewer concepts but understanding them better. There was not much practice material for the exams and OH were rare and at unconvenient times",
                "interesting but very science heavy. connecting it back to the real world consequences would be helpful perhaps with engagement!",
                "More interactive lectures but super informative and great course overall",
                "The presentations arent great, and the assessments are extremely difficult",
                "Strengths: Professor Oristaglio is an amazing lecturer! He offers frequent office hours and field trips, which are definitely the highlights of this course! The exams are very low-stress since they are all open book and internet. \r\n\r\nWeakness: the first unit can be especially daunting for students who havent taken a proper physics class before (the first problem set scared away many of my friends who were enrolled in this class), but the material definitely became more digestible from then on.",
                "Tons of information packed into lectures; I think it could be helpful to make the information more cumulative and less scattered.",
                "Strength: lots of information; Oristaglio is super knowledgeable, very nice, and genuinely interested in making sure people learn about energy; has provisions for online learning; lecture slides are well-organized\r\nWeaknesses: there is a lot of information to learn and the midterm can overestimate how much you know and how much time it takes you to answer questions about it",
                "I took this class as a semi-gut, and was surprised to find the content very interesting. There's about a 50-50 split between theoretical and statistical information (what countries are trying to break new ground in solar energy, why does india use so much biofuel, what are the sources of greenhouse gas emissions in detail, etc), and the rest is on calculations. The physics part of the class was very boring and poorly taught, but the intuition side was very interesting.",
                "Strengths: content very well organized, there are always slides and handouts to help you with material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there are sometimes inconsistencies / lack of clarity with the grading system.",
                "This course is very interesting lecture wise, but there's a lot that I miss in class that the slides don't cover. The material of this course has a wide breadth but also covers a wide depth, which makes it hard to fully grasp everything. Additionally, for problem sets or exams, sometimes they'll take off points because you didn't mention something that they wanted to see, even if they didn't ask for the detail correctly.",
                "This class is a smattering of a ton of different topics in energy - economics, science, engineering, etc. sometimes its quite unsatisfying to be just scratching the surface of each of them, but its also cool to get to discuss so many things.",
                "Strengths: Professor Oristaglio was extremely engaged in the class--field trips, lots of office hours, etc. Interesting lectures. Slides were very helpful to study. Problem sets very helpful to study. Very clear presentation of material. Quick grading of problem sets.\r\nWeaknesses: We did spend a lot of time reading of of slides--I think lecturing without the slides, and posting the slides after as study material, would be cool",
                "strengths: professor oristaglio was super kind, patient and accommodating. he explained his concepts clearly \r\nweaknesses: guest lecturer could have explained concepts more clearly.",
                "Well structured, you have a clear idea of what the course is doing, where it's going etc, generally clear about what it wants you to learn (sometimes a little less clear about what will be assessed though this very well good be a pedagogical choice I suspect). Isn't too ambitious but I think is also beginner friendly enough. I think you'll quite quickly realise what you will get out of taking this course within the first few lessons. Psets prepared you reasonably well for the midterms and finals, thought they were well set in terms of difficulty, nice mix of easy, doable and challenging. Do wonder about the grade distribution. Understand there's a conditional curve that's applied to the class. Would be interesting to see what the final distribution for the whole class will be like.",
                "Flexibility of lectures and exams are strengths, as well as material covered in lectures. No weaknesses",
                "Strengths: organized, engaging lecturers, well-supported with lots of office hours, field trips offered but not mandatory\r\nWeaknesses: nothing major! some lecturers were rushed and a lot of concepts were thrown at students quickly, but overall not bad",
                "Strengths: Lectures were pretty interesting. They were also all recorded and Zoom attendance was not penalized. Office hours were very helpful. P-sets were relevant and doable; exams were more challenging but not insanely so.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the survey of existing energy projects for every energy type felt a little too exhaustive/not particularly helpful for student understanding.",
                "The lectures for the course were quite good, although they sometimes felt a little bit long. One definite strength was the field trips, which were a lot of fun and very informative.",
                "Very thorough course covering both the equations and policies of renewables.",
                "The midterm and final were unnecessarily time crunched in such a way that the exams felt like they were testing how fast you could do math rather than your acknowledge if the content. The PSETS were very fair though and with office hours help can boost your grade",

                "Don't get me wrong this class was great, but his other class Fossil Fuels and World Energy is even better in my opinion. I think this class is harder than Fossil Fuels if you don't have some stem background, but still doable. I think either classes are a wonderful way to not waste your science credit on a gut that you do not engage with at all. These classes have honestly made me really optimistic about the future of the world and the energy crisis.",

                "Yes; if you are interested in renewable energy, this is a great class that goes into a lot of detail about the science and economics of renewables. Professor Oristaglio is great and his study sessions are very helpful. There are also field trips to energy sites that are good to go on. The TFs tend to grade p-sets unnecessarily strict, but Professor Oristaglio will fix the grade if points were taken away for no reason.",

                "It's rare to find good science classes for non-science majors. Renewable energy is good but not great. You will learn much more than you think you will, and if you're interested in international relations, as I am, then you might find it surprisingly interesting. The class does not have a very high workload, but it doesn't have a very small workload either. There are 6 psets that take about 4 hours, and two exams, which take maybe 6-9 hours to study for.",

                "Yes",
                "I would recommend it if they were interested in the subject, if students aren't passionate, then this course may seem more like a chore.",

                "yes but note this course might be more challenging if you don't have a science or math background",

I personally think an understanding of this, and how world energy works more broadly is an important thing so think for that this course is well worth considering though others may disagree or weight the importance of learning about that to be less. Workload is not too high, prof is chill, field trips are cool. If you have an interest in energy and aren't doing STEM would highly recommend. For others, depends on your interest in energy. You won't be blown away by the pedagogy but I think the material is interesting and well worth considering as something to learn about",

                "Yes! This class made me pay more attention to infrastructure. I enjoy being able to look at a wind turbine or solar panel and understand how it operates. It's a very manageable science credit -- not too many p-sets, no crazy math involved. The midterm is a real time crunch, which is not mentioned before the test, and the final is definitely harder than the p-sets.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course. I am a Math and Physics major, so this course was a relatively easy and also very interesting science class.",
                "A valuable course to understand the changing energy environment especially with the current rate of change in the field during the 21st century.",
                "Yes! But only if youre actually interested in the content. Otherwise there are definitely science classes out there that are easier to do well in",
                "Yes. Science gut."
