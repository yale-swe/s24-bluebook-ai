                "This class excelled at providing resources for you to use to improve your writing. The instructors give so many author examples and much needed feedback on your writing to help you develop as a writer.",
                "The strengths of this course are largely in the essay assignments themselvesby writing in five styles, you get a handle on many types of writing, and receive feedback on every draft. The readings and discussions are also generally good, though some of the discussions can tend to ramble. Overall, a very strong course.",
                "Professor Gellman is an incredible resource in this course - she is able to lead interesting insights from class discussion by guiding us to think more deeply about decisions made by authors.",
                "I loved how this course was tailored to improve writing and I really saw my writing improved especially with personalized feedback and interesting readings. I do however feel that it would be helpful to understand how grading exactly works as grading can be very daunting to people who had not really written prior to Yale.",
                "Strengths: I improved a lot in writing and understanding essays and language overall\r\nWeaknesses: I heard that different teachers had different schemes (ex: some teachers allow students to skip an essay entirely)",
                "Strengths: Professor Gellman was super invested in the course, the readings were fun and not too long, essay feedback was super useful.\r\nWeaknesses: the discussion expectations were sometimes unclear. For example, it was sometimes unclear if we were supposed to raise our hands or just jump in. Beyond that, I think the discussions should have been less based on calling on people and more organic. However, I also recognize that the virtual format can make that difficult."

                "I think the essay writing process (office hours, workshop, feedback) worked very well with the current system. Zoom discussions are just naturally difficult and awkward, but generally I think this class did a pretty good job of mitigating that. One thing I would suggest is that the first week or so of class muscle through the awkwardness and lack of productivity of an organic discussion instead of starting more structured and phasing out. It was hard for our class to let go of the structure and I think that made some of our discussions feel a little artificial. Another thing would be to do more breakout rooms, which made the discussion a lot less awkward and gave each student more opportunities to speak and listen closely."

Though the regular essay assignments will help you to sharpen your skills regardless, the content of the class is a bit more basic that you might expect. Great for non-English majors and first-years of any major.",

                "yes!! i loved this class",

Writing skills are essential to any profession and being able to persuasively and engagingly write about your thoughts\/ideas\/experiences is a very powerful tool. You also read some really fun essays by old and new authors. I definitely discovered some new authors that I really like and am going to read more of."
