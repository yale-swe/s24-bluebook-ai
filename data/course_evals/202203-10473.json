Types of wood, techniques used to make furniture, ways to analyze furniture styles, historical context of furniture, the role that culture and economics played in furniture styles and vice versa, and historical analytical writing.",

Also learned about the furniture-making process and a lot of technical terms related to furniture style and joinery. This class has made me MUCH MUCH more insightful and appreciative about the furniture around me.",

                "Strengths: class consists of a weekly trip to the Furniture Study Center on West Campus, which is a great chance to get away from the routines of campus life for an afternoon. Professor Cooke is fantastic, friendly, accessible, and extremely passionate and knowledgeable about his field: American Decorative Arts. Weaknesses: though this is a writing credit, writing was barely discussed during class and the writing assignments seemed to have little to do with what we studied in class. Readings were long and often did not seem to bring much value to understanding what was discussed in class unless you were presenting.",
                "Professor Cooke is the best professor I've had in my first semester at Yale. His passion for the topic is so clearly visible every class, and he is extremely supportive in class and outside of class. If not for the content, take the class for Professor Cooke as all first-years Yalies could use a mentor figure like him.\r\n\r\nThe weekly meet ups were very effective because they allowed students to learn from one another and from actually looking at the objects. This course allows Yale students to examine, touch, and even SIT in important furniture pieces across the various periods. The readings were also generally really interesting. This class forces you to think deeper about the environment around you, and how significant furniture is in everyone's lives.",
                "Strengths: first-hand interactions with furniture pieces, linearity and cohesiveness in curriculum, open ended class structure geared towards discussion and interaction.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The course meets only once a week; it is a bit tough to remain engaged when you meet so infrequently. But the location of this class (the Hume Furniture Study) is ridiculously unique and awesome. And Professor Cooke is wonderfula true expert in his field.",
                "i like how it is once a week but the class is very long and repetitive",
                "This is a very strong course. It combines small class size, well thought out instruction and assignments, unusual subject matter, and a unique, hands on learning experience.",
                "Strengths: You get to visit the Yale Furniture Gallery every week which is super cool (like a vintage Ikea). Readings are not too taxing, but are very interesting. And you take a shuttle to the gallery (to discuss the readings) and from the gallery (to chill and chat).",
                "This course's main strength is that it allows students to learn in the furniture study, which is a unique opportunity. The course's material is also unlike any other course. However, since the class is three hours long, it is somewhat hard to maintain focus for such an extended period of time.",
                "I believe some strengths of this course are the small size allowing the students to have deep discussions with one another and the professor. I also enjoyed the various readings and writing assignments as they varied in style, structure, and topic throughout the semester. The class was well-paced, never feeling too fast or too slow, and I enjoyed the schedule of meeting once a week for a large block of time as it allowed for deep discussion for longer rather than having to break it apart throughout the week. I think one weakness could be feeling a bit overwhelmed at the beginning of the course, especially as someone with no prior experience with furniture. The lack of vocabulary and experience in reading and thinking about furniture can contribute to feeling behind. However, I think Professor Cooke does an amazing job of making sure people of all backgrounds can learn at their own pace and have an amazing class experience, so I don't have many suggestions for improvement (maybe just reassurance that students don't need to understand everything at the beginning)."

                "Yes, I would highly recommend this first-year seminar. It is a very unique course that consists entirely of a weekly 3-hour trip to the Furniture Study Center on West Campus where students are immersed in historical furniture. It provides a completely new perspective to students and attracts a great, diverse group. Other than the readings, which simply help to inform the student presentations of each week, there is very little work assigned (three short papers, three oral presentations, and a final project). Professor Cooke creates a great class culture, and the shuttle rides to the Furniture Study are often relaxing. If you have any interest in furniture, art history, or woodworking, I highly recommend this course. (Also, it is a very easy writing credit, but don't expect to get the same amount of writing experience or instruction as you would in ENGL 114).",

                "Yes! Professor Cooke is super friendly and finds a way to involve everyone in the course - definitely a class you will not regret taking",
                "Yes, I would. I would recommend any First Year seminar but would single out this class in that it would likely be a new experience for most students and allow them to learn about stuff they would not be able to otherwise.",
                "Yes!! I absolutely loved learning with Professor Cooke! If for no reason other than the professor, I would recommend this course to any first-years who are able to fit it into their schedules. As someone who came into the class with no experience other than using the furniture her mother chose at home, I have truly learned so much and grown so much in this class. I found it amazing how much I was able to understand in the readings at the end of the semester compared to the beginning and it was really encouraging and exciting to be able to see my growth so clearly. It was also really fun to be able to think about furniture in a way I never would have otherwise and see all my classmates' thoughts and feelings on the pieces we discussed. The final projects were also unbelievable-I would have bought some of them if I had the money to!"
