                "I learned how to write a term paper, engage in archive-based research, and analyze historical trends comparatively across two countries. I am a far better writer, thinker, and historian because of the course! I also really enjoyed learning more about Canada and hence more about the United States by comparison. Much of the content also focused on political rights, especially related to citizenship and different legal relationships to the state, which I found fascinating.",
                "Writing a term paper, identifying primary sources, primary and secondary source analysis",
                "I learned a ton about Canadian history, which I knew nothing about before this course, but I also learned a lot of new information about the United States that really enriched my understanding of US history. I developed the skill of comparing two countries and extracting insights from those comparisons. I think the process of comparing these countries did provide me with insights into the forces that have shaped each country today.",
                "I learned SO MUCH about Canadian and US political history, from 17th century interactions between Indigenous nations and white settlers to modern voting rights struggles. I learned how to think about history both in terms of big-picture continuities and changes and from a comparative lens. Professor Shanahan also taught me so much about how to structure and write a long research paper, which is a skill that I know I will take with me throughout my time at time."

            "comments": [
                "Professor Shanahan crafted a perfect introduction to historical research at Yale. I really appreciated the workshops he organized as opportunities for us to work with librarians at Sterling and become more familiar with the research process. He always left time at the end of class to work through challenges in our research, and the in-progress assignments (e.g., an annotated bibliography, outline, etc.) kept me on track throughout the semester so that I was able to turn in a draft by early December, for which Professor Shanahan then gave detailed, informative line edits.",
                "Really enjoyed the course and am confident that I improved as a writer from the helpful and detailed feedback of Dr. Shanahan. I felt that on some weeks where we had additional assignments, there was too much reading",
                "Overall, I thought the readings and discussions were great. Professor Shanahan is so knowledgeable, kind, and clearly invested in the students' success. I also really appreciated how the course was structured to guide us along the process of creating a final paper. However, I felt like we were asked to pick a topic a bit too early in the semester-- at that point, we had covered maybe one third of the class material, so I did not yet have a good idea of what I was most interested in writing a research paper on. If we had picked topics later in the semester, I would have had a better sense of what I was most interested in, and so I would have picked a different topic that I probably would have enjoyed more.",
                "The course's biggest strength is Professor Shanahan, who is one of the most supportive professors I've ever had. He truly cares about students' wellbeing and mental health and is great at helping students to follow their interests and develop their own original research papers. He also leaves space for students to spend time examining the parts of the readings that they found most interesting in class while also ensuring that key information is still covered. Most of the seminars end in small group discussions about how each student is doing with their research project, which I found helpful. My only area of improvement would be cutting some of the readings as some weeks it felt like they were too much. I would potentially suggest cutting the ones on political intrigue as I found them difficult to follow and a lot of pages to read for a short takeaway."

                "Yes! Absolutely! Every history major should start with a course with Professor Shanahan. He is so attentive and creates every possible opportunity for us to engage with the research process and with the course material. If you'd like to write a history thesis eventually or are just curious about what it's like to write as a historian, this is a fantastic foundation. Also, if you're curious about American citizenship laws and comparative U.S.-Canadian history, Professor Shanahan has a very strong grasp of the field, so he can point you toward any source that you might want to learn from.",
                "Yes if you are interested in the topic or want to improve your writing.",
                "Yes! Professor Shanahan is great, the readings and discussions are really interesting, and the comparative structure really enriched my understanding of both countries.",
                "Yes! Take any course with Professor Shanahan that you can as he is an amazing and supportive teacher! I really enjoyed this course and I think the title may make it sound less interesting than it is so definitely shop the class if you can. The readings cover a diverse range of events and perspectives so I felt like a got a much more multicultural understanding of American and Canadian history than I was expecting. The comparative lens is also really interesting and helpful in trying to place both America and Canada in a wider historical context.",
                "Yes! Professor Shanahan is such a kind and understanding professor, and he really takes time to provide detailed feedback on your assignments. The course is also structured in a way that allows you to develop important primary and secondary source analysis skills that are valuable for writing the final paper. I learned a lot from this course, not just content-wise but also in how to engage with historical sources and write a polished, lengthy history paper."
