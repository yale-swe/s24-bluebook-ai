                "In retrospect, I definitely learned how the body operates as a system. One of the major facts that will stick with me is that the kidneys need 25% of cardiac output? This fact is amazing to me, and is something I did not know before the course; basically how connected all the organs are. The course definitely builds on itself; you learn general processes like action potentials and by the end are able to describe in a clinical case study what is happening with cardiac output, the kidneys, and even the respiratory system, all at the same time. This is an aspect of the knowledge I learned. This course also sharpens the skills of time management, navigation of the material, and productivity: you need to pick out what is the most important (ends up being basically everything) and must be able to describe those processes in an efficient and accurate manner; i.e., you need to know how the system works. While not ecstatic about my midterm exam grades, I was very invested in this course, and hope to use both the knowledge and skills from this course.",
                "I learned about the cardiovascular system, endocrine system, respiratory system, renal system, and many more! I learned about the anatomy and function and mechanisms of each of the systems and got to tie together how the systems work together.",
                "a lot of physiological knowledge",
                "I learned so much about the human body, including basic electrochemistry, organization of the nervous system, the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, the renal system, the endocrine and digestive systems, and sensory systems. I also learned how to effectively study for an extremely content-heavy class, and make connections between different modules\/systems to better appreciate the physiology of the human body.",
                "I gained substantial knowledge about the most important systems that make up the human body: cardiovascular, renal, GI, endocrine, nervous, musculoskeletal.",
                "This course was wild. I loved going to class and found that I really enjoyed the process of exploring the human body. You cover each body system: cardiovascular, nervous, digestive, respiratory, endocrine, exocrine, reproductive(1 class) and go through the various organs associated with each. That being said, this class didn't teach much else...I tried multiple times to overhaul my study habits for this class each time to little success. My personal TA was not responsive to me having problems.",
                "I learned about the intricate systems at play within the human body and how to apply this knowledge in real life examples.",

                "I learned a great deal about the body's systems and how the body works in general.",
                "A broad understanding of human physiology. This course emphasizes breadth over depth, but many systems are still covered in significant detail.",
                "Learned about membrane physiology, kidney, pulmonary, cardiac, GI, endocrine and a little bit about reproductive physiology. I gained an conceptual understanding about the major mechanisms within these systems, and how things that go wrong can lead to disease states. Overall, a lot of a mix of basic physics, chemistry and cell biology.",
                "On a surface level, I learned about (nearly) every organ system in the human body and in surprising detail, considering the 50-minute length of lectures. At the same time, this course taught me how to better synthesize information as well as distill many details to some of the more important ones when necessary. At the same time, the course demanded a lot of information recall, and as a result, I was forced to develop new ways to memorize and\/or learn information such that I would better remember it.",

I also learned a lot about the inner workings of the human body, and find myself thinking about the course material often as I go about my day (what's going on in my liver now that I ate that apple?).",
                "I learned the basics of the systems within the body.",

            "comments": [
                "More organized lectures, so I know what information is important.",
                "great class, just an insane amount of information, so lectures are rushed, but I don't know how this can be avoided if everything needs to be taught",
                "Strengths were the sections and the more personal times, weakness was the scope of the course. Aimed for too much to be memorized. I am not going to use it all in whatever field I go into. Caused me to do more memorization and regurgitation instead of learning",
                "The strengths of this course include basically teaching all of the material in 36 lectures, effectively demonstrating that the nature of this class is to be able to incorporate the information that builds upon itself to be able to describe what is going on in the body as a 'system.' Strengths include catering this course to biomedical engineering students, biological & biomedical science students, etc. There was more than one subject that would peak the interest of students from different backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways in which I think the course could be improved. 1) If you could please separate phrases or bold specific points in questions on the quizzes. Some quiz questions were a small paragraph long and maybe could be deciphered more easily with maybe parts a, b, c, etc. in bullet points. 2) If you could please double-check spelling before launching quiz-I am all about detail and put a lot of effort into the quizzes, but sometimes I had to reread a quiz question because a word or two was not spelled properly and I had to determine what the question was asking because it was a long question. 3) If you could please schedule send emails something along the lines of 7:30am-9pm from Canvas so that they are not sent on a Sunday into Monday at 12am, this would be so helpful. 4) I think Ed discussion is good, could still be kept, but maybe I didn't look at it the last month or so of the course.",
                "Course was great! I learned the material with enough depth to understand the mechanisms of various systems but also not too much detail to confuse me, as this was the first physiology class I've taken.",
                "Strengths: This is the best course I have taken at Yale. Not only is it great preparation for the MCAT, but it also reaffirmed my passion for biology and medicine. I think this class does a great job of teaching students how to intuitively think about physiology rather than just memorizing molecules, transporters, etc. (though there is a fair amount of that). I also think the course does a great job of helping students to remember high-level themes (specifically with the triangle of knowledge shown in the first lecture), and the learning objectives at the end of every lecture do a great job of emphasizing this. Professor Campbell's and Saltzman's OHs were also a tremendous resource. Not only were they willing to answer our questions, but they also traced down the answer to any questions they did not know the answer to, which I admired and respected deeply. The exams are also challenging, but fair, and truly test someone's knowledge of the content in more ways than rote memorization.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A few of the learning objectives near the end of the course were needlessly wordy and could be condensed to better help students understand the biggest takeaways (especially the endocrine lectures). I also think that the course would greatly benefit from practice exams. Because of the weighting in the course, students need to do fairly well on the first midterm to do well in the course, but I think there is a bit of an adjustment to taking these tests under the 50 minute time pressure. To recognize students' adjustment to these questions, I think the course could benefit from weighting one midterm lighter than another, or releasing practice midterms.",
                "strengths: amazing course material especially for pre-meds, TA's very helpful\r\nweaknesses: an overwhelming amount of content, and sometimes we're tested more on minute details than we are on the overarching picture. this course is NOT for the faint of heart.",
                "Strengths: There was a lot of interesting information to gather. Thanks to Professor Aronson I've gained a new-found appreciation for the kidneys. The TFs were also generous with their time and put in a lot of effort to help us prepare for the exams.\r\nWeaknesses: We were told at the beginning of the semester that this course involves a lot of \"critical thinking.\" That's not really true. Most of it is just straight-up memorization, and if you've got a bad working memory like I do, you'll be at a disadvantage. The professors were also a little too ambitious in their lectures, meaning they often rushed through the slides and left little time for questions or effective note-taking. Looking through the slides after class didn't help either, because most of the important information was often not on the slides, but mentioned in passing by the professor. In light of this I really think they should record every lecture -- that would take a lot of pressure off of us to record every single word they say, freeing up headspace to ask questions. I also don't think that in-class midterms are the right format -- 50 minutes is too tight, and the instructors are limited in the material they can test you on. Given how much we have to memorize, it would be a win-win if we sat a 2-hour evening exam instead -- that way we wouldn't feel so rushed, and we can be tested on a wider range of topics. I wish there were practice exams to help us prepare, but there weren't any... plus you can't take your midterms home after they've been graded, which is a little bizarre -- it's not as though they use the exact same questions for the exams each year!",
                "This class has some really clear upsides: (1) lectures are amazing. Each and every lecture was intense, short and super engaging. I got a little lost during the exocrine section with the guest lecturer but otherwise it was perfect in this regard. (2) the application of the content felt clear and meaningful. I really enjoyed going to class and chatting with people about it's content. My girlfriend couldn't stand my random anatomy tirades by the end...but I think thats still saying something. \r\n\r\nSome downsides of this course: (1) Group work was lackluster. This class was almost entirely individual. I know some people like that impersonal, results based course and if so, this course is for you. For me, our TA couldn't wait to finish discussion sections and always tried to send us home early as though we learned everything by the end. Also, little was done to integrate grad students with undergrads. (2) This course does not account for bad TAs. If you get stuck with a certain TA...im sorry Saiti... but you perform way worse than classmates. This is partially because each TA makes their own materials and some could care less. By the end of this course, my friend had almost 3x the notes and diagrams I did from his TA. I didn't realize how much of a problem this was until the final. If Carissa and Ilhan and Anna have discussion sections for you, go to their sections pls....the class is wayy harder otherwise. (3) Quizzes in this course were supposed to indicate how well you were doing with content and help you identify where to study. Everyone gets 100% no joke....so this is literally useless. Plus, the questions given for the quizzes were either minor points of the lectures or led you down unrelated rabbit holes.",
                "Its an intense amount of information to absorb in one semester. I really enjoyed the content though, I just think it was too much too fast.",
                "I feel like a strength of the course is for most of the topics, the course went into the appropriate amount of detail, rather than getting caught up in going into too much detail on just one of the body systems. One weakness I think that exists is that the way that the lectures were structured made it so that the body systems were treated rather separately, even though in reality they all end up influencing each other. I think it would be useful if these connections could be pointed out during lecture a bit more. \r\nAdditionally, although there is already so much content for this course to cover, I would have liked to have seen at least one lecture about the blood or the immune system, because it is often very involved in disease states.",
                "I enjoyed the content, but I feel like the exams felt so far from what was given. It definitely makes you think outside of the box in a very short  amount of time. I also wish that we got our exams back to review on our own.",
                "The TAs are AMAZING and absolutely wonderful!!! They are the main reason you succeed in this class! SO kind and helpful and explain things in a way that makes sense. They really truly want to see you succeed in this class and it shows from hosting multiple additional review sessions\/office hours to connecting topics across lectures, to making up practice problems and scenarios to help us practice!!\r\n\r\nI really like the lecture slides when they are fully annotated before class, so I can focus on listening to the lecture and take notes on what is being said instead of being rushed into copying the entire diagram while important things are being said. However, this is not always the case especially during the cardiac unit when a whole diagram was missing from the slides and we were rushing to copy everything down while trying to listen and take notes simultaneously. I also really appreciate the learning objectives after each lecture which help focus and organize my studying. \r\n\r\nThere are also moments where pace of the class during some lectures is quite fast and it does not allow enough time for me to process and write down the necessary information that is crucial to succeeding in this class. It is very frustrating when we rush through over half the lectures in 10 minutes as everything moves so quickly that information is not being communicated well. Both of these issues could be easily rectified and mitigated by releasing the already recorded lecture slides since this would allow me to go back and review certain parts that were confusing and clarify things enough for me to formulate questions to fully understand the topic.  \r\n\r\nIt would really help to linger over some of the more confusing\/complicated aspects and providing practice questions\/practice tests to help prepare for the exams would be extremely beneficial. I'm not sure why they never released lecture recordings for review even though the class was recorded. \r\n\r\nTo focus my textbook readings on the lecture content since the textbook is really dense and I find that it oftentimes covers a lot of material that is not talked about in class.",
                "strengths: very interesting\/applicable topics, instructors are super knowledgeable, powerpoints are pretty comprehensive, quiz questions are helpful for focusing on the important topics. weaknesses: some topics are hard to grasp if you have no experience learning physiology, the material is so dense and they go through it so quickly, it would be really helpful if we got our exams back!",
                "There was simply too much material in the class to absorb anything. The exams were very specific and required lots of memorization.",
                "The lectures went so fast that I felt like I didn't retain much from them but the content is very interesting and office hours\/discussion section helped A LOT",
                "There is so much content for the course that Professors Saltzman and Campbell are great but each lecture contains a bit too much information. The lectures by Dr. Aronson were interesting but it also took some time to adjust to the differing lecturing styles. I feel like it would be more helpful for reviewing if slides contained more key information in the form of words.",
                "Strengths: Professors Saltzman, Campbell, and Aronson. Each were wonderful at explaining the material and always happy to answer questions. The TA team was also amazing and really dedicated to helping you succeed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many, though the quiz structure was a little bit weird (we would have quizzes the week before an exam, but not the week after  switching this wouldve been helpful) and there were some scheduled over October and Thanksgiving break.",
                "Strengths: Lecturers were very great, TAs were on top of grading, and the material itself was very interesting. Dr. Aronson did a really good job explaining the kidney, and I think there were a lot of chances to participate in discussion sections and such.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The review sessions with all of the TAs were not as useful since it was mainly a lightning-fast overview of all the material, although the individual TA-led Q\/A style review sessions were a lot more enriching. In the future, there should be more smaller TA-led review sessions with prepared questions\/situations for discussion.",
                "The strengths would definitely be in the content of the course and the passion of the instructions \/ teaching staff. Perhaps I am a bit biased, but the course was fascinating and engaging in its approach to understanding the mechanisms that allow for the bodily function of human beings. I also enjoyed every interaction I had with professors and teaching staff during this course. All of them were so knowledgeable, and it was an honor to be taught by individuals who demonstrated great care for the content about which they were lecturing. \r\n\r\nIt was clear that all of the teaching staff wanted to best facilitate learning, in spite of the very ambitious scope and depth of the course content. While this is not as greatly appreciated on exams, I also greatly enjoyed the depth of the content taught. At times it would feel like there was an overwhelming amount of content, but between the efforts of instructors and those of the TFs, it often seemed much more manageable than one would expect from reading the textbook. I enjoyed most of the painstaking details. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course was the pacing (at times). In some cases, topics would be glossed over for the sake of finishing a lecture within the 50-minute class period, to the detriment of student learning (i.e., one would need to go back and study a given pathway \/ system more closely on their spare time in order to actually understand what had been cursorily discussed in class  or at times not discussed at all).  Even though the TF-led discussion sections remedied this to some extent, it seemed like a great level of detail was still expected on exams for topics that received less attention during the actual class. (And this did not always fix the problem, as the discussion sections were also 50 minutes to an hour long...)\r\n\r\nOn a separate note, I think that this course also had a tendency to write overly long exams (given the constraint that they were expected to be completed within the 50-minute class period). I believe that my performance was at times impacted by the fact that I felt rushed and concerned about not finishing the exam, as well as the fact that I was unable to check through my answers and correct any silly mistakes.",
                "The learning objectives model is very helpful. The learning objectives for the endocrine lectures need to be updated or made more clear. There was a marked difference in the readability\/understandability of these objectives vs. for the other sections.",
                "I thought the course was very well run and organized. I liked the set up and do not have any notes for improvement.",
                "Strengths: Lots of content and generally good lectures. The TAs are also amazing at their jobs.\r\nWeaknesses: There's a lot of content, but your grade can really come down to how well you remember very specific things on tests. It's definitely fair, but it can be scary when you just happen to forget two or three details and lose 2\/3 of a letter grade from it on a midterm worth 25% of the total grade.",
                "This was my favorite class at Yale. One of the hardest but also the one I learned the most in and it was definitely overwhelming at times but super interesting and for the record I opened the textbook maybe twice so everything was just taught well in lectures and the TAs were so helpful.  I think my only complaint is that quiz questions were often pretty unclear in what they expected and it led to me spending too much time on them and writing really detailed answers when it wasnt necessary based on the feedback.",
                "Strengths: I learned a lot about physiological systems. The TFs were very nice. Class was well-organized and feedback was always very prompt. Weaknesses: Some parts of the lecture could be explained with more detail.",
                "This course has phenomenal instructors who are passionate about what they teach and have a great team of TA's who clearly are knowledgable and care about your learning process. The course covers so much material, however. Often times reviewing for exams felt like a monstrous task, given the amount of information I had to know off the cuff to perform well.",
                "The structure of classes seemed to work for the learning environment.",
                "The midterms had far too many questions for a 50 minute in class midterm. The quizzes were a helpful and low stakes way to check knowledge of concepts",
                "I really appreciated the level of detail that this class engaged in. I felt like I had to consolidate information I learned in all of the classes I've taken before, especially PHYSICS and chemistry. In fact, this class was a lot more physics than I had expected. I also appreciated how much the teaching staff is willing to go through the material with you during office hours. However, the biggest criticism I had is how fast the lectures were, especially during the more difficult portions of the class. By the time I figured out the concepts they were explaining, they were already 2-3 slides past that point. It also wasn't helpful to have recordings of the lecture and yet refuse to give them out to students. If you couldn't keep up with what they were saying in lecture, there was no way to review the lecture at your own pace later on, which only made you struggle more. I also wish there was an easier way to review the material for exams, either by practice exams or just being able to review how you did on previous exams. They were very secretive with the midterms, which made studying more inconvenient.",
                "Well organised and well taught, the professors were very knowledgable and enthusiastic. The TAs were great and I think we were well prepared for all of the tests and exams. The quizzes each week were great in familiarising ourselves with questions that would be presented on exams. The readings were far more in depth than the course material but they were great in giving more background information and more in depth knowledge of the course material. The lecture notes were easy to access and helped a lot with the exams.",
                "The lectures were not nicely organized, always rushed and the slides have zero information. I wish the slides have more info on it and help us focus more on what we should know",
                "The professors are all amazing- normally when a class is taught by multiple professors it can feel really disorganized but this was not the case at all.",
                "It is a very difficult course, but a well taught one. I believe more review sessions per week and access to different study methods might have helped my understanding. I am a sophomore, and there were a lot of graduate students and seniors in the course. I feel as though I was at a disadvantage taking this course compared to my peers.",
                "The lectures in class were very good for learning the material. I do wish that the lectures were recorded and shared with us because I think it would make it easier to study over the course again at the end of the semester to really drill in the information that we learned.",
                "Sometimes the content went through too fast, but there's many opportunities outside the class for students to learn",
                "This course was very in-depth, the professors were very knowledgeable, and I liked the emphasis on processes rather than pure anatomy. However, the amount of information we needed to know seemed impossible sometimes as each lecture covered such a large amount of information.",
                "This course was great maybe more in lecture engagement",
                "Strength:\r\n1. The scope of this course is comprehensive\r\n2. Resources are there if I need help\r\n3. The instructors have made the course worthwhile to attend in person instead of just studying the PowerPoint\r\n4. My TF is extremely helpful\r\n5. Module 1 of the course is exceptionally well designed\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n1. I understand the specific games are there to help us study, but many of them are out of date\r\n2. Starting from module 2, more material was thrown onto the slides and was not explained. It was not clear what we were responsible for.\r\n3. Module 3 inherited many slides from different instructors. Less effort was made to ensure students were engaged and understood the materials; instead, rushing to finish the slides became the priority.\r\n4. Too many slides were spent on the kidney and the lung (six lectures each), while olfaction, touch, etc., got 10 minutes of lecturing. \r\n5. Quiz questions, at times, fail to reflect the topics covered.",
                "I thought the course was delivered well and organized well. The graduate labs were effective for graduate student learning.",
                "I thought it was a great course, lectures were presented in a very understandable way, and did not move too fast. Exams and grading in general were very fair. Peer tutor sessions were extremely helpful because the quizzes would often ask pretty open ended questions but had very specific answers in mind, so it was helpful to have help determining what aspects of the quiz questions we needed to focus on and which parts we didn't need to go into extreme detail on.",
                "Strength of the course was the level of detail the lectures went into and how it was broken down. Weakness was the amount of information required to know for each test, the amount was too much. Would prefer more tests to break up the amount and allow for better understanding of each system.",
                "The class is great. The lectures are very information heavy, but the lecture objectives help distill what is most important. All of the lecturers were very knowledgable and engaged in the subject, making it easy to pay attention. Outside of class the office hours and discussion sections were very helpful in refreshing material. The graduate lab was helpful in learning concepts, interacting with other grad students int he class and applying information learned in lecture. I enjoyed it and felt that it didn't significantly add to the workload."

                "Absolutely, without question. This was an extremely well-taught and well-structured course that both gave a comprehensive overview of medical physiology and also explained the intuition behind the body's mechanisms of control. The course also touches on the experiments that gave rise to the discoveries behind the facts taught in the course; this approach fostered intellectual curiosity and a mentality of never taking any observation or fact for granted.",
                "Yes. Anyone who is pre-med would greatly benefit from taking this course credit\/D\/fail.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the human body. Youll learn lots of critical information about how it functions and how things can go wrong.",
                "Yes, especially if you are Pre-Med or a BME major",
                "Absolutely! So much content is covered, but it is taught clearly and efficiently. This class has completely changed how I view simple day-to-day activities since I have a much deeper understanding of the organ systems at play.",
                "No, only take for your major requirement",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. I would preface that you need to put in the work and emphasize that attending all lectures and discussion sections is helpful for your success in the class. You have to reframe your thinking in order to process and navigate the material. It is better to put in the work especially at the beginning of the course because the material builds on itself and you don't want to be playing catch-up at the end. Basically, you need to be consistent and exert a considerable amount of effort for this course during the entire semester, but the upside is that you will learn a lot.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It is a great way to apply knowledge learned from other bio classes like cell biology, intro bio sequence, reproduction, etc. In addition, this course was extremely helpful in studying for the MCAT.",
                "yes  but it's a lot of work, a lot of memorization",
                "Absolutely. This course is required for BME majors, but aside from that, anyone with an interest in medicine should take this course. The systems are taught by some of the best professors in the world, frankly, which makes studying for the MCAT significantly easier. Additionally, the content is enjoyable and well-delivered, and the TFs for this course are an amazing support system. Professors Campbell and Saltzman are also tremendous resources, and are reason enough to take this course. I would caution students that this will be a very time-consuming class. I took it along with physics and biochemistry on a 5 credit schedule, and it was overwhelming at times. Be prepared to put in a lot of work, but you truly do get out what you put in. Following the final exam, I was genuinely impressed with how much physiology I had learned in this course. For pre-meds, I would also recommend taking this with biochemistry if possible--there is a little overlap between the two courses which makes learning a little easier and more rewarding when going a layer beyond the material during OHs.",
                "Yes if you like physiology, want to pursue medicine, or are a bme major and this is required. Just be aware it will be a lot of work.",
                "Not really, but most people who take this course need it for their major, so it's a waste of time for me to convince you not to. To borrow an expression from Saltzman's alma mater, taking this class is like drinking out of a fire hose. Every class you'll be bombarded with way too much information that you'll find really interesting but never have time to think about and fully appreciate. Intellectual rigor is of course important, but I'm not convinced that the fire hose method is particularly effective -- I doubt most people in the class will still be able to remember concepts like the Frank-Starling mechanism a year from now. Another helpful analogy to make is that this is like a boot camp course for BME majors: a brief but arduous training course that will set you up for more advanced topics later on. While the class is fairly well-taught and the material endlessly fascinating, it caused me needless anxiety, and my GPA took a hit. Yes, the weekly quizzes bump up to 100%, but the midterms\/final are pretty harshly graded. The curve, if there is one, is also quite punishing given that most of your peers are hyper-competitive pre-meds. I don't recommend anyone take this during their sophomore year; if you're a BME major in particular I advise waiting until junior year because there are a lot of prereqs needed for this course (Gen Chem + Physics + Bio sequence), and it's a little unreasonable to expect students to finish all of them during freshman year. Even though the SEAS website lists Physio as a class you should take during sophomore fall, don't -- finish the prereqs first (and then some). Trust me, you'll have an easier time. Overall, I didn't enjoy this class as much as I had hoped, which is a shame because it's still one of the better BME courses out there.",
                "This is a premed class, you've been warned. It was a great course overall, but you will most likely be unhappy with your grade. If you are a superstar studier who works well alone, this is your class. Although I felt like I walked away with so much great information, my grades did not reflect my time investment and effort. I definitely have a bittersweet relationship with this course. Cool profs and content; it really wrecked my confidence and made me feel stupid and ineffective in my studying.",
                "I would recommend this course for a student entering the medical field to get a preview of how a medical school class can be.",
                "I would only recommend this course to students who know that they are going to use this information and integrate it with the other courses\/major classes.",
                "I would recommend this to premeds. Otherwise, if it isnt a major requirement or useful in the future I would avoid it.",
                "Yes!! I really enjoyed this class. One of my favorites I have ever taken! It reminded me of why I found medicine and the human body so interesting in the first place. It is a fair amount of work but if you study the lectures and attend section, you will be just fine!",
                "Probably one of the hardest classes I've taken at Yale! Even though the workload is pretty low, I had to spend SO much time studying outside of class. The amount of material they expect you to know is crazy, and just knowing general ideas isn't good enough -- exam questions are very specific. If you need it for the major, I'd recommend taking it when the rest of your classes are pretty light so you can really focus on this class and put in the work.",
                "Unless it is a prerequisite or you are studying for the MCAT, I would not take this course. Or credit D\/fail the course because the content was interesting but it is difficult to do well grade-wise.",
                "If you're thinking about med school 100% take this course. It won't be easy but it's necessary",
                "Yes, however not unless they were extremely interested in the physiological systems of the body and have some prior knowledge of chemistry and physics.",
                "I would, but not to someone who it isn't required for. It is an interesting class but would require too much time dedication for someone not looking to major in BME.",
                "Absolutely. This course is a ton of work but it is not unreasonable and the entire teaching team is very supportive. You come away with a great understanding of human physiology and the skills to think through the complex interactions between body systems. As an added bonus, the material is super good prep for the MCAT!",
                "Yes, definitely. It was helpful for the MCAT, and genuinely interesting as a whole.",
                "I think that there is some inherent interest required for this course to appeal to other students. I would definitely recommend it to most students, albeit with the caveat that it is a lot of work and a lot of information is covered in a seemingly short period of time. I would universally recommend this course for its content and the wonderful experience with the teaching staff, but I think that if this course were not required for a students major, it might be less stressful and by extension, more enjoyable to take this course Credit\/D\/Fail to put greater emphasis on simply learning the content and revelling in its abundance and intrigue.",
                "Yes, very rewarding. Very challenging\/demanding on exams.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class, because it is so applicable to day-to-day life for everyone",
                "Its a good class if youre interested in getting an overview of the body systems. It is quite a lot of information, so wouldnt recommend taking it with a heavy course load. But, the professors\/TAs were great!",
                "Yes! It's a great course for learning about the human body",
                "Yes if youre interested in physiology and have a reasonably light semester.",
                "Yes! It was my favorite STEM course at Yale. I think theyve really tried to make the amount of material manageable; I honestly didnt study too much except for a few days in advance of the exams, and I felt like I did pretty well. Definitely take it if youre interested in the body or if it fulfills a major requirement!",
                "Yes, as you will learn a lot and have a great experience. Be prepared for a lot of memorization, however.",
                "Yes, the professors are very good. It is a difficult class that covers a lot of material but it is also interesting and you learn a lot",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone thinking of entering medical school, but not until you've at least taken a physics course. I think it's good to struggle with this material now so that it's easier to comprehend when you're seeing it again in medical school. However, the class is so inter-disciplinary that, if you haven't taken physics or chemistry, it makes understanding the material that much harder.",
                "Yes, a great course for any student interested in medicine",

                "Yes, if you are interested in learning the basics of physiology.",
                "Yes. It's very informative.",
