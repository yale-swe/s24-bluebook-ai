                "The strength of the course was the reading material that was selected as well as the professor, Dr. Hodgkin. Dr. Hodgkin is an engaging speaker whose passion for the material was evident and infectious. While I respect Dr. Hodgkin's attempt to run the class as a seminar, encouraging students to lead discussions and break-off into smaller group discussions, I would have appreciated hearing more from Dr. Hodgkin. I realize that due to time constraints, Dr. Hodgkin chose to allocate as much class time as possible to reading the texts; however, as an introductory course, the class would have benefitted from more context provided for the reading material.  The information that Dr. Hodgkin offered was always fascinating--often from his first-hand experience and personal travels in the Middle East. His knowledge of the material, supplemented by his personal anecdotes was the highlight of the course. While he encouraged multiple interpretations of texts, it was clear from Dr. Hodgkin's comments that he often had an alternative point-of-view which I wish he would have shared. \r\n\r\nI would also recommend eliminating the Film component from the class syllabus and re-allocating the time to the texts all of which were deserving of more time.",
                "Strengths: I really liked the texts that were selected for reading. I appreciated how we were not confined to one particular area or time period of the Middle East. I also really liked how Sam led seminars, encouraging us to speak in class and to be unafraid to make mistakes. Lastly, I appreciated how Sam took us to professional talks at the MacMillan Center.\r\nWeakness: Sometimes it was not entirely clear what our readings were until a day or two before class. I wish we had more notice for some of these readings, but I understand this was Sam's first time teaching the course and thus the syllabus was bound to be a bit loose."
