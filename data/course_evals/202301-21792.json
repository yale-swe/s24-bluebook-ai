                "One of the main issues I had with the course was a lack of accessibility; almost all of the assigned readings and viewings required subscriptions to magazines or streaming services, most of which I did not have. Some were available through Yale, but not all, and no usually no instructions for access was given. There also is a ridiculous amount of reading, watching, and often writing required before every class, which I often found unrealistic and unnecessary.",
                "she needs to use canvas and tell people what their grades were. there were so many assignments that counted toward the grade, but absolutely no actual grades given. there literally wasn't a single grade given on the near 30 assignments that were factored into the grade this semester.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe most thorough feedback on writing i've received at yale. i got to meet so many pulitzer prize winners in this class. opened my eyes to new art. intensive writing that felt different from all of my other yale classes, great classroom dynamic, wonderful professor (probably the only professor this school has that could make this class work)",
                "Strengths: Opportunity to see arts live, consistent and detailed feedback from the instructor, engaging guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses: Financially inaccessible. It was assumed that students could pay for many magazine subscriptions, streaming services, food for when we went to events that took place during dining hours, a notebook for daily thoughts, etc. Although some course have textbooks that you must purchase, I have never been asked to spend so much in a single course.",
                "The course is very organized. Sometimes the material explored can feel a little dated or uninteresting. Neither a pro nor con, but make sure to factor in time for several visits to live performances throughout the semester.",
                "The primary strength of this class is the extensive feedback that Professor Spillane gives for every piece of writing that we hand in. Having the opportunity to use her comments to revise and improve work was the best part of this class.\r\n\r\nThe primary weakness of the class was the amount of work we were expected to do outside of class. We had an assignment due every Saturday afternoon, as well as numerous readings and things to watch during the week, in addition to a weekly blog post and response. I often found myself overwhelmed and unable to complete all of the work for the class just because there was so much of it. We would often not get to everything we had been asked to read or do outside of class which was frustrating given how much time it took. I think the class would be improved by cutting down the amount of work we had outside of class, so students could put more quality into the work they do have to do."

                "Yes! It definitely helped my writing improved, and Professor Spillane is wonderful (if a little crazy). She is a captivating teacher and has incredibly interesting stories to tell. The courseload and Professor Spillane's intense feedback at first seems very intimidating, but she is very kind and supportive, even while tearing your writing apart.",
                "Yes.\r\n\r\nThe art is absolutely insane, and writing about it makes you challenge yourself in the way that you were probably imagining when you begged to get into this school on the Common App. \r\n\r\nThe professor is also one of the most lovely people I've ever met at Yale, and is an incredible instructor when it comes to feedback for writing. She also has an incredible network of former students who have taken this class and gone on to have impressive careers in writing about performing arts. She's awesome.",
                "I would recommend this course, with the caveat that it is an unconventional amount of work. If you don't feel you have the time to write weekly reviews on top of blog posts and readings, then you will not get much out of the course. \r\nIf you are willing to put in the work, the course will reward you by teaching you a new style of observation and writing.",
                "Yes, Prof Spillane is an awesome, expressive professor that cares deeply about the class and her students. Its a lot of writing however.",
                "This is a great class for learning how to write reviews, and I would highly recommend the class to any student interested in that skill. You will become a better writer from taking this class, as Professor Spillane's insightful comments really help with the revision process. \r\n\r\nYou should be prepared to do a lot of work for this class, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't interested in having a writing assignment due every Saturday afternoon."
