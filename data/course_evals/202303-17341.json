                "The course provided a thorough insight into Lincoln's life from the beginning of his political career to the end of the Civil War, analyzing, especially his own speeches and writings, but also some other authors of the time. The course gave me a great insight into American history during that period, but also stemmed back to some discussions about the revolution and actions in the early 19th century.",
                "I gained a deep understanding of Lincoln and the Civil War. As the course went on, I developed an immense appreciation for the thinker, leader, and politician Lincoln was. Lincoln was not only a thoughtful leader, but an honest and humble man. It is incredible to watch how he maintained that personality through the toughest years of our nation. I walk away from this course with a much greater respect for President Lincoln and how he handled the Civil War crisis. Being able to understand his thinking and writing has been a transformative experience. Also, this course will grow your reading and writing skills. It requires lots of reading and very precise, law-school-like writing. These skills are hard, but also important.",
                "I learned valuable writing skills (improved the quality of my essay-writing a lot), I learned good strategies for getting through large reading assignments, and, most importantly, I learned a ton about Abraham LincolnI am very grateful that I will now be extremely educated about him and his political career. I grew to understand the importance of viewing historical figures with nuance, and I learned to be intentional in the words I use in my speech and writing.",
                "I learned how to manage a large reading workload and improved my writing. This class made me more comfortable participating in discussion.",
                "Learned very much about the life of Lincoln and how his life changed the course of his era. Also learned much about how to write papers and much about history as a whole.",
                "I developed the skills for highly analytical reading and writing. This includes being able to write entire papers on a small speech, and to analyze words very closely for their rhetorical function. I also developed a highly specialized knowledge about the life of Abraham Lincoln and the history of the period in which he lived, and developed many insight about modern America in the process.",
                "I learned a lot from this class. I gained deep knowledge of Abraham Lincoln's thought, policy, and actions from 1837 until his death. I learned about the political movements, ideas, events, and writers which surrounded him and influenced his thought and action. Apart from the course material, I developed abilities in reading and comprehending large amounts of text and participating in seminar discussion. I also continued working on my writing style, and improved my skills analyzing and interpreting a text.",
                "I developed a close and intricate understanding of Abraham Lincoln as a tactical politician, statesman, writer, orator, and political thinker. Moreover, this course moved well beyond Lincoln and to the history of the United States in the middle of the 19th century, with fascinating discussions on the politics, debates, and problems of Lincolns times. Beyond material, the course also allowed me to grow as a writer, to push my thinking, and to develop complex arguments."

                "The course is very well structured and does not have any confusing aspects that hinder learning.",
                "Strenghts - small class, amazing teacher, really cool topic, in-depth expertise about one specific figure (Lincoln), opportunity to improve writing skills.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - not much at all, at times there was minimal discussion despite being a small seminar, but it was okay because the professor was amazing.",
                "Strengths- Amazing professor: knows Lincoln like the back of his hand. He does well to facilitate discussion and also is a great lecturer. When you say something wrong, he will help guide you to the right answer without being harsh.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- LOTS of reading: very extensive; be prepared to read for a couple of hours before class to understand all the material discussed.",
                "Strengths: very good discussion and a good class size for everyone to be engaged at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- a high amount of reading assigned, but honestly was manageable and it is ok to read what you can given your schedule. Sometimes the hour and 15 classes felt long An hour might be more appropriate, but this could just be me.",
                "The strengths were definitely that the content was very engaging and the speeches of Lincoln were all very fun to read. The class itself was a great mix of lecturing and discussion. The analysis of the speeches was always very insightful and helped greatly in thinking about the history. It could be improved I think with less readings. Many of them felt unnecessary, especially the ones that we barely read in class and the history books.",
                "This course provides really expansive knowledge of Lincoln and his history. Seminar discussions are great and Professor Bromwich is an amazing and incredibly knowledgeable teacher. Office hours were really interesting and helped me with crafting theses for papers. I sometimes felt that the amount of reading made it hard to really dig into the text before seminar, but on the other hand, we did a lot of that thinking during seminar and were able to read a wide variety of texts.",
                "The course does a fantastic job in diving into the life of Lincoln and the political context of his time. All the readings were fascinating, and the paper prompts were rich and interesting to deal with. Perhaps the only weakness of this course was that reading assignments would shift due to delays in the schedule in a way that would not match the syllabus or schedule on Canvas. Otherwise, it is fantastic overall."

                "I definitely would. The course is very interesting and dives deep into the historical context of the time, but focuses on Lincoln's decision-making based on his speeches. His thought process and understanding of the world can be thoroughly analyzed and perceived through this course.",
                "If you enjoy learning about politicians and the Civil War, yes!! This course helped me gain an immense appreciation of Lincoln, and I felt it was such a privilege to learn about Lincoln in this manner. As someone who enjoys history, it has been a great experience seeing the tensions of the Civil War through Lincoln's eyes. Some may find this course too specific to Lincoln, but for those who are interested in how the Civil War was directed, it is wonderful to learn more about the man who lead the nation.",
                "Absolutely! It's an incredible opportunity to take a class with Professor David Bromwich as a first-year. He is such an articulate professor and every word he says is so intentional and packed with meaning. Not to mention, the actually course content is fascinatinglearning in such depth about an incredibly important political figure of our nation.",
                "If you are very interested in History of the civil war or Lincoln in general, then there is no other class you should be taking. This course goes well in depth on Lincoln in a way you will not find anywhere else. Beware, be prepared to do the readings.",
                "Yes I would. It is very insightful and if interested in history or politics I would highly recommend it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any first-year student interested in challenging themself or improving their analytical writing. The skills developed in this class required to effectively write essays are incredibly valuable to all fields, and the prospect of being able to read any text incredibly close and for its rhetorical purpose should excite any student, so I recommend this course to all.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class!! If you are interested in history, political thought, and improving your writing, and aren't scared off by the large amount of reading, then this is a perfect class. Professor Bromwich is amazing, seminar is great, and I came out of the class having learned much more about Lincoln and the Civil War.",
                "As someone who is fascinated by American history, this course did not meet my expectations  it exceeded them. This course is an absolute must for any student interested in Lincoln, American history, and politics. It is also a fantastic opportunity of learning how to write for first-years as they come into Yale. Moreover, it is such an honor to learn from Professor Bromwich; he provides clear and constructive feedback, encourages you to stretch your thinking in class, and offers a great wealth of wisdom. While the reading load can be challenging, it is absolutely worth it."
