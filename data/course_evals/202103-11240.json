                "The course is extremely detailed and I learned a lot from it. Professor Piango is extremely passionate and knowledgeable, and this shows in her teaching. She is accessible and eager to answer questions. I left the course with a new perspective on language and a desire to take more courses about language and mind in the future. I genuinely enjoyed this course so much, and I felt like I learned an extensive amount about the topics covered, in a very detailed way. I feel like I will retain my learning long after this course.\r\n\r\nBecause Professor Piango is extremely passionate and knowledgeable, there is a ton to learn in this class! It is definitely not a gut and requires a lot from the student, including a very high level of attention in the classroom. This was a very hard class, but it was one I found rewarding because I was passionate about the course content and found it presented in an interesting and engaging way. If you are not truly interested in the topics covered, you may feel overwhelmed by all of the content you need to learn. Additionally, the research project runs on a pretty short timeline because it is at the end of the course. I found this a bit stressful.",
                "We developed a good class community and there was clear communication from the professor on expectations. There was a lot of cold-calling but it wasnt bad-spirited so I dont think thats really a weakness. Workload is on the higher side so be prepared",
                "Strengths: discussion heavy\r\nWeaknesses: Heavy workload, fast pace",
                "Strengths: critical thinking, good community (definitely create a group chat and fight your way through the class together or else it will be so hard)\r\nWeakness: a little disorganized\/ hard to follow from time to time",
                "Strengths: You learn an incredible amount of linguistics in such a short period of time. MMP cares so much about the class and her students and it shows.\r\nWeaknesses: -The class is a bit winding and MMP takes a good amount of time to answer individuals questions which is frustrating if youre used to very structured classes. The free form nature of this class can be incredibly frustrating when some subjects are hard to place in the broader context of the class. There is a fair amount of information you really have to study on your own - but not an unreasonable amount and it's clear what that is\r\nHowever if youre willing to try a more freeform class, i definitely recommend it.",
                "Strengths: lots of material covered and learned; passionate, knowledgeable, and kind instructor; no assignment is weighted too heavily in final grade; small course which motivates participation\r\nWeaknesses: moves very quickly at times (seeming to jump from intro Linguistics readings to research papers in a moment); Professor's interrogation can feel alienating; long & dense lectures",
                "this class would be better served by lecture slides\r\nprofessor very knowledgeable however the pedagogical practice of interrogating a student until they cannot answer anymore is not constructive"

I learned so much from this course.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend this course to someone who doesn't want to put time and effort into understanding these topics.",
                "100%. Great class to take if youre interested in linguistics, psychology, or how children learn languages. Or just fun if youre looking for something different in your schedule! MMP is an excellent prof and you can tell she cares.",
                "Yes, if you are planning to become a linguistics major.",
                "Well... Yes, if you are interested in language and mind but be ready to get a long linguistics intro... I think there should be a pre req to this class instead covering phonology and syntax the way we did so that the actual questions about language acquisition, heritage speakers, bilingualism etc are not packed in the last 2-3 weeks and discussed more extensively.",
                "Absolutely. However, make sure you dont get behind in the class. All the information builds upon itself and attendance might not be taken but it is truly mandatory.That being said it is really a large stepping stone of a class as you get into so much detail so early on\r\nSome familiarity with Cogsci i found quite helpful though just as an additional perspective on the mind and a little linguistic knowledge, but is definitely not necessary. I recommend for anyone who is into mind, language, etc",
                "Absolutely.\r\nBut I'd clarify: this is a harder class than you'd might expect. There will be times in the middle of a long lecture \/ reading when it will not be fun. But you will learn a lot about linguistics (probably including a topic within linguistics that you are passionate about), and emerge with a broad knowledge of lexicalized language structures and how they are acquired.\r\nThe greatest value of this course, in my opinion, is that (it feels like) you are set up to make better sense of any other future linguistics class. Though not marketed as an intense intro to linguistics, that's what it felt like. (And almost certainly the course will be taught be a great professor in Dr. Pinango.)\r\n\r\nMake sure to stay on top of readings. They can be long and pile up.\r\n\r\nAlso, I should add: don't worry if in the middle of the semester, this isn't your favorite course. If I had written this course evaluation then, my evaluation would have been much less glowing.",
