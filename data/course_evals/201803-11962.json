    "This was a great, engaging class. It definitely helped me develop my knowledge of Spanish, as well as helping me become more comfortable speaking it.",
    "Spanish grammar and more tenses than the present. More coco about professions etc",
    "I feel that I became a much better Spanish speaker and listener. By the end of the course I could, with some assistance in English, talk to my Dominican Uber driver in Spanish.\r\n\r\nI also got better to a lesser extent at reading and writing. My knowledge of Latin-American and Iberian culture improved.",

   "comments": [
    "I think it was a great course, and do not have any ideas for improvement.",
    "Very organized and fun.  More speaking exercises are needed not necessarily in class but assignments like audios that we could send in for feedback",
    "I really like that the course is taught in Spanish. This improved my listening abilities greatly. I believe that the listening exercises (audio files) could have been emphasized more, since they required precise listening rather than just getting the gist like one can in class.\r\n\r\nI liked having the option to correct written assignments. This gave me be better knowledge of the kinds of mistakes I make in my writing. However, I feel that I continued to make similar mistakes throughout the year, so more work on writing could improve this course.\r\n\r\nDespite seeing large gains in my speaking ability, I still believe that more opportunities for students to talk could be beneficial.",
    "Well-organized course, good mix of speaking, writing, and writing activities. I liked how there were more cultural aspects taught in 120 compared to 110  the oral presentations for different countries and the smaller activities in the course packet were fun and informative. Really can't think of any weaknesses!"

    "Absolutely. More specifically, I would recommend to everyone that they should try to get Juliana as their professor. She is great.",

    "I would recommend this course to another student. I truly saw improvement in my language abilities, and felt that I made some friends in my classmates.",
    "Would definitely recommend, if you're hoping to improve your Spanish skills! The variety of activities and everyday exposure is really great for that. And if she's teaching a section, would highly recommend it with Juliana she's a wonderful professor."
