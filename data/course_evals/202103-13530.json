                "As a beginner to the Arabic language. I was able to learn the whole Arabic alphabet, write it, compose basic sentences, learn colloquial speech from different Arabic-speaking countries, and immerse myself in Middle Eastern culture. As a Muslim, I feel much more comfortable with my identity and more connected with the Quran by learning Arabic. It was amazing how I started with zero experience in practical Arabic language, but now I feel so empowered and an easily able to start and carry a basic Arabic conversation with a native speaker, Alhumduillah. I learned a lot of cross understandings between the Quran and Arabic language because I was very grounded in principles of religion, but not in Arabic. The course book Al-Kitaab was very comprehensive and finding video explanations of the topics complemented the readings well. Also, listening to different Arabic dialects and pronunciations expanded my worldview and motivated me to study Arabic over summer."

                "I have no background or tie to Arabic at all so I was coming into this class blind. For me, I think the course was fine; a bit chaotic at times and it seemed like we were jumping around from subject to subject (for example, family and then majors and then weather and then random bits of grammar) but I think that's just how the textbook was set up. I think I would have liked the pacing in the second half of class to have been more oriented towards review; I felt that I was constantly learning a new thing that wasn't being followed up the next day or week and then a couple of weeks or months later I'd have to recall this concept that I didn't really remember because I didn't have the time to process it and we weren't actively building upon it in class. I also wish we drilled grammar more; that helps me and we didn't really do that beyond learning one concept for like two days and moving on. Also, I found the feedback sessions super unhelpful. Overall, I feel like I definitely can speak, read, and write Arabic, but I'm going to have to do some review because I feel like I have a lot of gaps.",
                "The instructor had a hard time explaining concepts and understanding questions.",
                "The strength in this course was the other students. Everyone seemed eager to learn about the language and the culture. It was one of the more diverse classes I took this semester. One con was the Friday assignments, which give the illusion of being asynchronous but often require meeting up with another classmate. I would have preferred asynchronous speaking assignments and worksheets.",
                "This course was great in covering basic Arabic principles and vocabulary so that we are able to develop short conversations however, I hoped we spent more time on certain topics.",
                "Strengths: great instructor, lots of repetition and practice so you dont need to completely understand something the first time, small class size, little homework (15-20 mins/day)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "More hands on feedback would be nice.",
                "Strengths: Learning Arabic was made easier than other courses because the book went step by step with teaching the basics of grammar, verbs/ etc; the course made good use of the whiteboard and slide so i could write down helpful notes; the course made use of videos that were engaging because they were seen in the daily life of the Arab world; the course offered ample opportunities to improve my grade through homework, quizzes, and presentations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was at times a little difficult because it was moving too fast",
                "The strengths were the good homework load to keep your Arabic skills, the emphasis on writing and reading, weekly quizzes to keep us grounded in the skills, and good interaction and collaboration with other peers in the class. One weakness was the lack of emphasis on speaking in the class. I feel strong in the rules, grammar, and writing, but my speaking is still weaker relatively to the other skills in Arabic. I wish there were more speaking activities other than the Friday assignments. But, the Friday assignments were truly so helpful in speaking. Without those, I think my speaking would be virtually nonexistent. A weakness was that there was not a clear explanation of the syllabus and how grading would work. Next time, the teacher should go over deadlines and how he or she want specific things done to be crystal clear for the students."

                "Yup! If you want to learn Arabic, you have to start somewhere, and this class is pretty comprehensive but the grading isn't too tough.",
                "I recommend this class because the professor is great and learning the Arabic language is both and interesting.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, because it covers the basics of Arabic in a fun but academically challenging way",
                "For anyone interested in Arabic, yes. I believe Arabic at Yale is holistic in the sense that it hits upon different disciplines of the Arabic language used in the home, politics, daily life, restaurants, universities, etc. It is not just a brute memorization curriculum to make you understand a language. It is much more fun than any high school language I have taken as well. And the future prospects of Arabic at Yale include a classical, colloquial, or political track that can help further various academic goals. HIGHLY recommend the class."
