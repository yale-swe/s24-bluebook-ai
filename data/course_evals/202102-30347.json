                "English 412 w Colleen Kinder was one of the best writing courses I've taken at Yale. No, scratch that-- it was the absolute best. I would recommend this class to any level of undergraduate writer who is willing to write, write, write, and read critically and copiously. Prof Kinder is gifted at encouraging and lifting all voices; she was fully and enthusiastically engaged w the material at all times, and her devotion was contagious.  She managed our zoom mtgs w conviviality and assurance; the seriousness of attention to writing was supported by goodwill and exquisitely apt, challenging instruction.  Our readings reflected a diversity of identities, chronological eras,  stylistic methods, and ethical concerns. Our writing assignments were likewise varied and rigorous. Assignments were short, long, and in-between; we had to write spontaneously in class as well as to craft and edit longer pieces for submission. The peer editor aspect was helpful and stimulating. My writing improved in gratifying, noticeable increments because of her insightful editing and personalized challenges. In class, I appreciated her seminar-directed \"card system\" which kept the zoom mtg lively, respectful, intellectually stimulating. The course neatly balanced teacher-directed expertise w opportunities for student exploration. I can't think of enough great things to say about this demanding and deeply profitable experience.",
                "Through our readings, we were exposed to a broad swathe of texts, ranging in content from travel writing to decolonial texts to vignettes of simple moments and across a wide range of forms  essay, fictionalized memoir, letters, a satirical set of questions, etc. The texts, coupled with rich class discussion, pushed my ability to interpret writers artistic choices and learn how to diversify my own writing. I also appreciated the last week where we were split into pairs to lead the class discussion on texts of our choice. Additionally, we had meetings with both the instructor and our writing partners, where we got (and gave) personalized feedback.",
                "In this course, I really developed a voice in writing creative nonfiction! I developed the tendency to notice my surroundings and use them in my writing to make it much more rich. Additionally, I learned that being just as critical of well-known writers as you are with lesser-known writers will allow you to get so much more out of their work. At a place like Yale where names are of the upmost importance, it was so important to look at pieces of writing for they are (pieces that can always be edited), and I'm so glad I learned that before beginning the meat of my English major program.",
                "Ive learned that Im capable of writing despite how daunting it may seem without having had much practice. Ive definitely become more confident as a writer with every micro essay, but Ive learned that consistency is really important because it takes having written something to have something to work with. Ive also been able to write creatively while letting my voice carry the writing. \r\n\r\nPlace writing makes us better writers because it teaches us to be observant and mindful of our everyday lives. \r\nThere is something powerful about reading from a writers point of view, learning their secrets and emotions. \r\nDetails that we notice and wish to incorporate in our writing dont have to be written in elaborate language to be effective if they are true and evocative.\r\nForm matters and helps with pacing. \r\nWriting focused on one topic still works better embedded in a narrative. \r\nWhat is your reason for writing? can transform a piece.",
                "Key skills from this course included critical analysis of short essays, in regards to tone, word choice, and structure/style. This analysis was incorporated into my own work created for this course."

                "See above. Seems honed to perfection!",
                "The course was one of my favorites in that it pushed me both as a writer and a reader. Highlights include the three 30 minute sessions we had one-on-one with Colleen where we talked about our writing and the class as a whole, the texts she selected (satire was both engaging and difficult to understand the workings of), the group of people taking the seminar (many very interesting and fun to get to know through their contributions and writing). I also really enjoyed the micro-essay prompts, which required creative response and guided our writing. There werent downsides per se, but the class was a lot of work. With three micro-essays and a macro-essay due per week, on top of the 6h30 of class, reviewing your writing partners essays, reading all the texts, and possibly a meeting with Colleen, the class consumed a lot of time. You get what you put in in most classes and here its similar  you put in a lot of time but develop your writing unlike in any class Ive taken so far.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I will note that could possibly be refined was the requirement to submit a piece to a publication. I appreciate the requirement (as we either get a piece published or learn to deal with rejection), but I think it was left as somewhat of a side-note till the end. A little more guidance from Colleen on what she felt was publishable and perhaps to what publication would have been helpful. The micro-essays felt a bit short to be published and I would have put more thought into the topic of my macro-essays had I known more about how publication worked earlier on.",
                "This course was the best course I've taken at Yale and I think will be the best course I will ever take! It felt more like a writer's workshop than a class, and I developed so much as a writer over five weeks. Colleen Kinder is an amazing professor, and I'm so sad she doesn't teach at Yale during the academic year! I think taking it in-person will make it so much better, and I think it could be a really interesting course to take on Yale's campus instead of in France. Yale is a place we know really well, and I think a lot of interesting pieces could come out of the class when students focus on writing about the campus instead of a place they've never been. That's the only suggestion I would have!",
                "The strengths are the extraordinary feedback from conferences and writing partners, consistency in writing, and encouraging results in your writing portfolio. I think some discipline and guidance can be useful in writing, and this course offers that. \r\n\r\nI'm used to revising my writing more often, and some of my essays felt incomplete, or not quite right, even to me. I found myself wanting to return to some of my essays, but it was already time to write my next. I really found reading and improving the sentences we wrote in our essays useful. Not only could we learn from each other's writing styles, but it gave us practice revising. It was then that I began focusing my own writing suggestions and giving better feedback to my writing partner. I learned and adjusted along the way, but it would be helpful to discuss how to revise and give feedback earlier because we do rely on each other for feedback.",
                "STRENGTH: Professor Kinder's open communication and response to feedback. Use of \"cards\" in lecture to encourage student participation and develop classroom shorthand lingo to facilitate discussion. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESS: Syllabus often unclear about dates/details of assignments."

                "Yes, the intensity of this course lends itself to a significant increase in writing skills within a short period of time. I think this course is helpful for students interested in improving/sharpening their writing prior to a major project, thesis, etc.",
                "Yes! See above.",
                "Yes! I would strongly recommend the course to anyone interested in reading great texts, vastly improving their writing, and having engaging class discussions. Through the massive amount of writing we did, I think each one of us developed new ways to write and write high-quality work quickly. I now approach writing with less intimidation since we all had to learn to produce 11 micro-essays and 3 macro-essays in just 4 weeks. That said, make sure you have the time for the class. With all the writing (up to about 3000 words in a week), the readings, the editing of both your and your writing partners work, the detailed discussion in class, etc. the course requires quite a commitment.",
                "Absolutely! It's a LOT of writing, but a constant focus on production and revision is what is necessary to become a better writer. If you want to become a better creative writer, definitely take this class!",
                "Yes, the readings are interesting and introduced me to many creative writing styles. The writing prompts are unique and exciting, allowing me to experiment with new writing styles. I recommend this course because you will see improvement in your creative writing in a short time, which is rewarding. You will share your work and learn your strengths and weaknesses. Finally, you will be inspired and encouraged as a writer.",
                "Yes! Even as a student who had not done non-academic writing in a classroom setting before, this course was enormously helpful in forming habits based around daily writing (and noticing of surroundings) as well as fruitful classroom discourse on a variety of short essays."
