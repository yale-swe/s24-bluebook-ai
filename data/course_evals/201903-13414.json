    "writing and information on climate change including history and societal\/economic implications.",
    "I think I developed my writing skills and learned how to better debate or discuss a contentious topic. I also gained a greater understanding of how climate change is linked to the economy and other parts of society.",
    "I learned how to write better.",
    "Learned a lot about climate change and developed my essay writing skills",
    "I learnt a lot about climate change and really enjoyed looking into the complexities associated with climate change. My essay writing also improved.",
    "How to write an academic paper, and different theories about todays capitalistic society and its relationship to global warming, specifically in relation to the concepts of fossil economy, carbon democracy, the logistics revolution, among others.",
    "I improved my writing in this class because of the peer reviews, office hours, and because I went to a residential college writing tutor for help on my essays. And I learned a lot about some of the scary aspects of the causes of climate change which was interesting because it wasn't just about the polar bears dying as their ice melts away. I also learned fundamental expectations for an essay at Yale."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "it was excellent overall, very informative and thought provoking. I think the only thing that could be improved is if the class discussions were made more dynamic (less summarizing of readings and personal anecdotes, and more deep analysis and bringing in more insight that isn't included in the readings themselves).",
    "I really enjoyed the class because it allowed for a lot of class discussion about the different readings, but was also very flexible in what we were able to talk about. I cant think of any concrete way to improve the class except maybe to create more opportunities to receive feedback on writing or create clearer prompts for the papers since I found myself a little confused upon receiving them; I thought it was really good and well organized.",
    "It is good how it is.",
    "Sometimes too much reading\r\nAssessments well spaced out\r\nInteresting readings",
    "The individual feedback sessions were very helpful. I liked how the final essay was due before thanksgiving so that the main part of the course was finished early. This made my workload much easier to manage. The course was very engaging and the class became quite close, so discussions became more interesting. I also enjoyed the presentations from each student at the end of the course. It was fascinating to hear about everybody's own research.",
    "Debates during class were fantastic and really brought in lots of discussion and ideas, but this is a double-edged sword as wed sometimes spend too much time on certain discussions and have to rush through everything else. Peer review on papers was very helpful. I also appreciated the course material  climate change has become a very political issue, and although the course primarily features contemporary\/progressive views on climate change, we also got to debate other viewpoints.",
    "The class was very well organized and it was really nice that the hard part ended by Thanksgiving!! That was amazing. Also, Prof K was really warm and funny and you could tell he cared about us. Sometimes discussions were long and I was not very engaged. But that was probably because I didn't do the reading. But reading was long at times."

   "comments": [
    "yes i would. i think it's an important topic and a fantastic way to learn academic writing",
    "I would, I think its a good way to gain a greater understanding of the problems of climate change, but also a great place to foster discussion and debate on the relevant topics. It was also provided a valuable opportunity to write academically and learn how to do research using Yale resources.",
    "Yes it helped me improve.",
    "Yes it is important for learning how to write a yale standard essay\r\n\r\nThis topic is particularly important and interesting at the minute so I definitely recommend it",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in the actual logistics of how climate change came about and how we will solve it. It is a very engaging course and it is a good introduction to essay writing at Yale.",
    "If youre at all interested in climate change or anything surrounding it, yes. If youre not at all interested in climate change and couldnt care less, YES! By the end of the course not only will you have a much stronger foundation for debating the issue, but also obviously your writing will have noticeably improved.",
    "Yes if you want to work on your writing and care about the environment. It is really interesting because of the lens through which it approaches climate change. It is a smart way of looking at it we often don't see."
