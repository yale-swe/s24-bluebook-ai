                "I learned SO much about Thoreau and related history/philosophy/enviornmentalism/literature.",
                "This class prompted me to understand Thoreau in a completely different light than how he is commonly portrayed. It was eye-opening to explore how his scientific background and queer identity influenced his writings, albeit in an often nuanced way. Additionally, to be able to view society through Thoreaus eyes was profoundly intriguing and gives one rare insight into the fundamental drivers of society.",
                "I have gained a deep understanding of the life, the philosophy and the writing of Henry Thoreau by taking this course. It provided me with a great understanding of American literature in general.",
                "First of all, my close reading skills (and my confidence in those skills) improved significantly. I obviously learned a lot about Thoreau and our conceptions and misconceptions of him, but more importantly, I learned a lot about how to think about and organize my life through Thoreau's writing.",
                "I got better at note-taking and text comprehension in this course. I learned that literary works can be interpreted in a variety of different ways, especially when it comes to Thoreau's works. Additionally, I learned a lot about Thoreau himself and the history of Concord, all context which I wouldn't have gotten in another literature class."

                "Strengths: engaging material, excellent professor, field trip! Weaknesses: At times the reading load was a bit heavy, but the material was always usually pretty engaging!",
                "Super strong course. Love the amount of secondary material we covered.",
                "This class was extremely engaging! I loved how Prof. Warner gave everyone the space to have their thoughts on the material heard and often discussed by the class as a whole. I dont believe this class had any weaknesses.",
                "The wide range of required reading means that this course is very comprehensive. We read Thoreau's proses, poems, biographies, journals, and articles written by other scholars about him. All these served to give me all the necessary information to truly understand, or at least begin to understand, the significance of Henry Thoreau. The weakness of this course might be that we sometimes cannot possibly cover all the materials listed in the syllabus because we didn't have enough time. This is a shame for if all the readings were properly discussed and evaluated in the seminar, my experience would be much better. One great thing about this course is that we needed to post comments on Canvas every Monday in preparation for our in-class discussions on Tuesday. This helped us exchange thoughts and opinions on usually elusive writings of Thoreau and without it, I would find it difficult to analyse these readings. I hope this measure could be extended to seminars on Thursday as well.",
                "Strengths: Professor Warner leads the course with the perfect balance between his own expertise and student contribution. The balance between breadth and depth was also amazing -- we were able to read so much Thoreau so closely, which felt like a very unique experience.\r\nHonestly, no weaknesses come to mind!!",
                "Strengths: discussion prompts were provided by students. Everyone had a unique perspective on the texts we read, and had something new to contribute. Field trip!\r\nWeaknesses: I wish Professor Warner had been a little clearer in advance about what we would discuss on any given day. I had trouble narrowing down what I wanted to write my reading responses on."

                "Yes! Its a fantastic dive into the works of Thoreau, and just a thought-provoking class! Nice introduction to a FYS too!",
                "Yes.  Professor Warner is excellent, and our classes had a great balance between discussion and Professor Warner talking.  The readings were all so interesting, too; Thoreau has such a wide range of fascinating work.  If you've read Thoreau before, you'll get so much more out of him through this course than you had previously.  I also really enjoyed sticking with one author for a whole semester.",
                "Yes definitely, regardless of major or interest.",
                "Yes! This course was extremely intellectually engaging!",
                "Absolutely!!! This was  singularly  the most impactful class Ive taken so far at Yale. This is class is intellectually stimulating, is taught by an outstanding professor, and doesnt have too heavy a workload aside from the readings. Do take this class if youre in any way interested in Thoreau, Transcendentalism, Environmental studies, or Queer Theory. You will LOVE it!!",
                "Absolutely. Henry Thoreau is often misinterpreted by the public and taking this course will give us a true understanding of this literary giant that has fundamentally shaped many spheres of American society.",
                "Absolutely. This class convinced me to be an English major, but even if you never read another book after this class, you'd learn so much about life, attention, and intentionality from both Thoreau and Professor Warner. I would not have gotten a third of what I got out of Thoreau if I had just been reading the texts on my own.",
                "No, as the layout of the course was unorganized and unpredictable. Grades were not returned until 3 weeks after the assignment was submitted; no feedback was given on discussion posts. The professor has favorites.",
                "Yes, though only if you're interested in Thoreau or the topics he writes about. It would be difficult to enjoy the class if you didn't enjoy Thoreau's writing."
