   "comments": [
    "loved this course! Irina is phenomenal and improved my Russia so much. Some of the readings were far too difficult which made the course a little unmanageable at times but once that was adjusted to fit the level of the class things were great.",
    "I think this was a very well organized and well taught class.",
    "This course improved a lot over the course of the semester. The professor was very open and adaptive to our wants and suggestions, and changed the course to conform to our interests and abilities. I think perhaps more simplified structure of assignments would have made it feel somewhat less chaotic, but they became more linear and connected over the course of the semester.",
    "Strengths: The course material was structured to fit our needs.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Because the syllabus changed a lot, we weren't always sure when assignments were due or what we should prepare for on certain days."

   "comments": [
    "yes! Irina is one of my favorite professors at Yale and she is incredibly committed to making sure students have what they need to make significant progress in just one semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student taking L5 Russian before jumping in to the more text or film based classes. There is a lot of good grammar, vocabulary, and writing skill work that isn't covered in previous classes.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a student considering L5 Russian classes but not comfortable enough in their skills to dive into a literature class. Its a great intermediary step.",
    "Yes!"
