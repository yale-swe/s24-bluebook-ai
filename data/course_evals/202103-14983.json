I learned a lot about working with composers as a performer, including about how to bring up suggestions for note changes and for notation. I also learned about the life of a musician specializing in contemporary music through two guest artists at the end of the semester.",

            "comments": [
                "-strengths are actual experience in classtime, very engaging and fun\r\n-Maiani gives excellent coaching and overall advice\r\n-weakness are organizing the collaborations with composers, could have emphasized co-creating a piece rather than lots of \"is this possible?\" once a sketch has been written\r\n-another weakness was lack of clearly enumerated assignment components as part of a longer arc... for example Konrad classes often organizes his assignments into \"phase A,\" \"phase B,\"etc; this would have helped make the beglarian arranging assignment more targeted-- for example, \"Phase B: based on what we talked about in class this week prepare 32 bars to try out in class next week\"",
                "I think that this course is great for fostering student artistic independence and a great practical introduction to rehearsal and performance of contemporary chamber music.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great to have more lessons on important concepts, approaches, techniques with applications to contemporary music, as well as readings, history, and analysis of the music we play. People will come with varying levels of familiarity with the repertoire, and I think 10-20 minutes at the beginning of each class or a longer segment in the semester to bring everyone up to speed on the music played in the class (especially performance-relevant elements like style and form).",
                "This class left a lot of room for the performers to have a voice in the music that we played and in shaping what was written for us. Maiani did a great job in guiding us through programming and ensemble decisions. Another great thing is that we spent a lot of time on the music-making itself. Lots of playing, yay. One thing that this class could have had more of is space for the student performers to give each other feedback; we got to give feedback to the student composers and got solid feedback from our professor, but it would have been nice to practice the collaborative, creative exercise of giving constructive feedback to each other as performers as well.",
                "This course is very collaborative and Prof da Silva empowered everyone in the class to contribute to our final concert. The timeline with the student compositions could have been a little better with perhaps earlier deadlines for pieces or earlier meetings with composers. I think it wouldve made for a less stressful rehearsal process and more fruitful and rewarding collaborations."

            "comments": [
                "Yes! I think that most of the other curricular music classes are much less personal. In other music performance classes, students are assigned music or are guided towards a narrow slice of the repertoire. Even in jazz combos, the coach always directs the students to play within established genres. In this class, we got to decide how our music should sound and in doing that we got to ask a lot of questions such as, \"why are we selecting these works to perform?\" \"what is my personal stake in this music?\" \"what do we expect the audience to take away from this?\" etc. This made me feel more like I was represented in the music I play.",
                "I would recommend this course to a proficient instrumentalist with a passion for or interest in contemporary music.",
                "Obviously, this class is kind of niche. But if you like playing music and you're confident in your technical ability, especially with winging it, you should take this class. It fills what has been a gap in the musical community in Yale College: an institutional space in which students can play music written by our peers and collaborate to create new, cool sounds! The class is well-led by Maiani, who is very supportive of exploration and helpful in giving fresh ideas and perspective, and it's a lot of fun reading new drafts and watching pieces grow. The class is little enough work that it's not stressful, but it was enough work that it was doable and rewarding to put on a concert near the end of the semester. I hope this class has a long life in the music department because we need more music like this at Yale.",
                "Yes, if youre interested in performing contemporary music, absolutely! This class provides the opportunity to premiere new compositions with Prof da Silva as a coach. Its really a wonderful opportunity that you cannot find anywhere else in Yale College."
