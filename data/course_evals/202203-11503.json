                "By taking this course, I learned how to articulate my thoughts in a clearer and more concise way, and I was also able to improve my overall writing structure.",
                "I had never thought about all the different aspects that compose home before, so this course really helped me learn so much more about such a fundamental part of our lives. It also helped me reflect on my perception of home, and how that has impacted me. I also greatly improved my academic writing abilities, particularly in how to write a well-structured and flowing essay.",
                "As this was my first-ever writing college class, I developed a myriad of skills and insights that will stay with me for the rest of my academic writing career. I learned how to academically craft a paper with a specific tension and elaborating that tension into a bigger conversation. My time prior to this class, I had never close-read an essay or movie to craft a paper. By doing such exercise, I was able to develop critical thinking by analyzing a close-read paragraph and using that to make my own conclusions. Also, the research assignment allowed me to analyze primary sources, make conclusions, and also join the sources in conversation. \r\n              Besides technical skills I learned about writing, this class prompted me to expand what home means to me. Before this class, I always connected home to a physical space or family. However, with the essays we read, the papers I crafted, and discussions we had, I am now able to place a special meaning of home to a hair clip sitting on my desk.",
                "This class taught me the fundamentals of writing academic arguments, which included how to evaluate what pieces of evidence to include in your writing, how to write a clear thesis statement, how to create smooth transitions between ideas in your writing, and how to analyze your evidence in a way to not only support your claim but to also dive deeper into how your evidence illustrates bigger ideas.",
                "This course makes you think very critically when reading pieces and very intently when writing them. It will certainly push you as both a reader and a writer, but by the end proves very beneficial for finding your voice and style when developing an argument. It's also very helpful to practice this writing in a seminar because it allows you to engage with other students who are developing their arguments and gain insight into the ways they approach evaluating a piece of writing, whether reading or writing.",
                "I took this class during my first semester at Yale and having limited experience in academic writing, this was really impactful. I learnt close reading skills and intentional writing.",
                "my writing improved so much in this class in terms of clarity and structure. I also learned how to analyze complicated stories and other pieces of literature. I specifically belive that reading Heidegger was very challenging for me but re-reading and re-reading as well as some feedback from the instructor truly helped me understand the text."

                "Strengths:\r\nWonderful professor, readings aren't too much and are relevant to the class, engaging discussions, there are many opportunities to get feedback on your writing\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nnone",
                "I found the course very engaging, and the texts we were assigned were always related to the course topic in some way. I also appreciated how Professor Baynes-Ross gave every student an opportunity to speak since the course was in a seminar format. I have no complaints regarding the course.",
                "Strengths: Although the essays can seem daunting at first, they are spread out well and we have ample opportunities to get feedback from peers and the instructor before turning it in. I also really liked the small class seminar environment and the discussions we had about the readings. While some of the readings may have been challenging, being able to discuss them with my classmates and Prof. Baynes-Ross made them much more digestible and allowed me to understand nuances I hadn't noticed in my initial reading. It was also nice how there was a great diversity in the style of our readings, and how we even watched films.",
                "One strength was the organization of this course. We learned new skills after writing each paper, which was fundamental to our success in our next paper/project. Another strength was this course's small size. I was able to have deep conversations with my professor and peers on the texts that we read, which helped me to cultivate a better understanding of what home is and how home is created. One weakness is not being able to see full example essays from previous students in the course. Looking at these essays may have been helpful when I was writing my papers in order to better understand what was expected of me.",
                "This course is very strong in the way that it progresses, as each paper you will write is more complex than the last. You can use your feedback from previous writing assignments to navigate the process of writing your subsequent papers. The final project is also very nice because it allows the student to take a break from the argumentative writing style and create a project that they best feel explores home.",
                "Honestly, during the middle of the year, I really didn't like this course because I wasn't that interested in the material but in hindsight, Im very grateful for everything we did in the class and I wouldn't change any part of it. I feel like I learned a lot in this class."

                "Yes. The topic of this course is so interesting to me and it's something I've always wanted to learn more about, and taking this class was a great way for me to engage more with themes of home and identity.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course material itself is very interesting, and Professor Baynes-Ross is a very approachable and engaging instructor.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. I was initially scared of taking an English class because I never considered myself to be a good writer, but this class helped me to improve so much, and it ultimately become one of the classes I looked forward to the most. Besides getting to improve my English abilities, this class also enabled me to have a interesting conversations about home and learn a lot about both our readings and my classmates' unique experiences and perspectives.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course to another student because of the meaning and skills one develops with it. As I previously stated in question #1, I learned so many skills about my writing but also allowed me to grow as a person by expanding my meaning of home. Additionally, I feel like this class is the perfect demonstration of what a \"Yale education\" consists of. If a student is looking for a creative class while simultaneously wanting a concrete writing class that will help them with their writing, English 114 03 is the perfect class for this student.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because it provides you with not only knowledge about how to write an academic argument, but with a better understanding of what college-level writing is. You will see that your writing will change dramatically after taking this course, and it will provide you with the foundations to write more effectively in your future classes (especially those in the humanities and social sciences). Lastly, the topic of this course is very broad, and home is an idea that affects most (if not all) of our daily lives.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student with the precautionary note that you must have time to really explore your own writing process to get the most from it.",
                "Yes. It's a fun, engaging class with well-selected readings. Prof. Felisa is very kind and helpful throughout the writing process.",
                "I would one hundred percent recommend this course to any student who wants to improve their reading and writing, it can be challenging at times but was totally rewarding in the end."
