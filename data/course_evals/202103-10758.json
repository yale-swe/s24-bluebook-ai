                "I learned so much about how to study the Bible, the history of Judaism and Christianity, and details about early literature.",
                "I was able to view the Bible in an entirely new light, one that made me sensitive to its complication, literary genius and sheer beauty.",
                "A better understanding of the origin and composition process of the Hebrew Bible over time. Some experience with biblical interpretation and understanding of how different groups of people have done so. Some knowledge of each part of the Hebrew Bible, although learning Bible stories was not the focus of the class.",
                "I learned how to study literary passages and parse them for perspective, theme, and tone.",
                "Course provided me with a wonderful introduction to the Hebrew Bible as well as a number of critical and literary approaches to the text.",
                "I learned so much (everything I know, perhaps), about the Bible from this course. I really enjoyed the historical and historiographical elements of the course, and thought it was a fantastic course for someone taking something outside of their main field of interest.",
                "I learned how to interpret Biblical passages in a literary and historical context.",
                "I felt that I learned very valuable, highly-applicable studying practices and a variety of efficient techniques for interpreting and understanding literary texts.",
                "I learned how to read the Bible and the theory behind how it was created.",
                "I learned so much. The documentary hypothesis is the biggest and most important thing I learned about, and it has informed my religious study of the Bible positively. I learned how to approach a religious text without bringing along certain assumptions (as demonstrated by reading midrashic and Christian interpretations of passages) and I learned a lot in general about reading narratives in the Bible as I might read a story. \r\n\r\nOverall, the hebrew Bible, which I grew up reading as a Christian, became all the more approachable through this class. I very much appreciated Professor Hayes's challenges and perspectives that helped me to think through difficult parts of the text.",
                "A comprehensive survey and understanding of the Hebrew Bible in terms of historical, cultural, and literary significance",
                "This course was extraordinary. Perhaps the best I have taken in my time at Yale College. I have no background in this topic and found myself riveted by every lecture. You do not have to be religious to take this course; if you are even considering enrolling I encourage you to watch a lecture on Yale Open Courses to see how fantastic this course is. This course was deeply enriching and I gained interpretive tools that are cross-disciplinary. One note for future students - make sure to make the Biblical IDs on the midterm detailed, I was surprised by how exactingly those were graded.",
                "Knowledge of the Hebrew Bible, the historical circumstances it responded to, and various means of interpreting the text.",
                "This class provided guidelines on how to read something completely objectively. We learned many different ways to read a historical document that enabled the most fruitful reading in addition to giving us the tools to do it independently."

                "Strengths: Great professor and engaging teaching, very interesting course content and well designed\/organized. Felt like I got a lot out of the course even though I am quite familiar with the Bible.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes what we did in class was one lesson behind the lecture we were supposed to watch that day, which was a tiny bit confusing. Also, I didn't really enjoy when we had group work because I would have rather listened to Professor Hayes lecture (but I did like when we did section).",
                "As I mentioned, the class was very interesting in how it approached the text from many angles. It also incorporated a number of classroom strategies for engaging with the text, including lecture, group discussion, and even acting\/staging to better understand certain stories. Overall this variety made the class very interesting, in addition to the fascinating content which made me think of the Bible in ways I never had before. There were a couple of things that were slightly different than what I had expected, but I wouldn't consider these to be \"weaknesses,\" per se; this included the fact that sometimes there was overlap between the lectures in class and the readings (which to me really reinforced the content more than feeling redundant), and the discussion elements sometimes involved more back-and-forth with Professor Hayes than classic seminar style (although the class also took this format about half of the time), although this also didn't feel like a weakness since I also gained a lot from the back-and-forth style.",
                "I loved this class. It was one of my favorites I have ever taken at Yale. I can't think of any improvements, but it's strengths are:\r\n\r\n-a clear course structure that doesn't vary week to week\r\n-transparent expectations for participation, and varied options to participate\r\n-clearly communicated expectations for assignments\r\n-differentiated options to learn the content (the book or lectures)\r\n-consistent engagement from the professor and TA",
                "Strengths: everything. Its an excellent class through and through \r\nWeaknesses: I felt like I was missing out when I wasnt in professor Hayes section in class.",
                "I think that the amount of reading assigned for this course is far too high, and could be significantly reduced without affecting the lectures or sections. This class is great because it doesn't cover each Bible story and every detail of the prophetic, but rather chooses a few examples to make a larger demonstration about the purpose, composition, etc. of the Bible. If the reading was more targeted (e.g., a chapter from the lecture book and a short passage to be discussed during class\/section), I would've been more likely to do it. Much of the other reading could be shifted to \"recommended\" to let people know what to prioritize. The weekly study guides hinted at such a structure, which I think could be made more explicit. The flipped classroom style works very well and should be kept. The final exam\/paper combo was a lot to do in a few weeks, but I really enjoyed the opportunity to try biblical exegesis in a more formal (written) manner. I didn't particularly enjoy the in-class discussion sections and would've preferred to keep those discussions within the full lecture.",
                "The emphasis on class participation helped to reinforce the core material of each class.",
                "This course is very well curated and taught, and I don't think it could be improved much! The flipped classroom model was a great was to learn and engage with the material.",
                "This class is highly engaging and a wonderful introduction to studying biblical texts and themes. It balances readings, discussions, and time for analyzing different lines of interpretations in a rich and fascinating way!",
                "To be honest, this course is impenetrable. I wouldn't change a thing.",
                "Professor Hayes is amazing! No weaknesses.",
                "The only weakness of the class was the classroom itself because it was awkward for a lecture but that is it. This class was so well organized and planned and there was always a very dense and clear message after every class that when you kept up with all the work, made for an amazing and fulfilling experience."

                "I would recommend the course to anyone who wants to have some familiarity with the Hebrew Bible. The workload is reasonable and you will learn a lot. It is especially interesting that the course considers the Bible from a literary point of view, which is a new and refreshing way to look at a text that most people have interacted with before but from a different angle.",
                "YES, I would HIGHLY recommend! I come from a Christian background so I am very familiar with the Old Testament\/Hebrew Bible, but I feel like I see a lot of it in a new light because of this course. I didn't fully realize how many prior assumptions I was making when reading the Bible. Also, class is just so interesting and Professor Hayes tries to make it interactive. Please please take!!",
                "I would highly recommend this class. It was the most engaging course I took this semester, both due to its content and Professor Hayes' excellent lecturing style and implementation of a variety of ways to engage with the material (seminar, other forms of discussion, acting, etc). The class required a variety of types of thinking in a way that was challenging and engaging. It made me think about the Bible in incredibly new ways, which I think is universally valuable, considering the profound impact that the text has had on Western culture. And Professor Hayes was incredibly approachable and always willing to indulge students' curiosity both in class and in office hours. I was excited to come to this class every day and it is making me seriously consider a major in Religious Studies, which never would have occurred to me prior.",
                "I actively recommend this class to everyone. It is so interesting, so well taught, and just generally enjoyable to participate in. You learn so much and learn it easily, so that you're able to research more about what you're interested in on your own. It gives you a whole vocabulary to further engage in studying the Bible and I am SO glad I took it.",
                "Entirely. This will be the best course of your semester if you take it.",
                "Prof. Hayes is great and you will learn a lot. I recommend it for Credit\/D especially - as long as you read the book chapters, go to lecture, and take notes, the considerable Bible reading can be done to the extent that you want to\/have time.",
                "I would recommend it, as it delves into aspects of the Old Testament not usually looked at by traditional Bible classes.",
                "Yes! This course is a must take course at Yale. I learned so much about the Old Testament in this course--things I can't believe I did not know before. If you are interested in  Judaism, civilization, literature, or what it means to be a human, then you should take this course.",
                "Yes! This is a fantastic course, and I really enjoyed it as a student with no background\/strong interest in Religious Studies or the Bible. It's well taught and fun, and you get to build and experiment with new skills.",
                "Yes, the professor was very engaging and I enjoyed the class a lot. I would only recommend this course to students with an interest in religious studies, but I do not think a student should or should not personally be religious to enjoy this class.",
                "Absolutely would recommend! Professor Hayes is so knowledgeable of the subject matter and I learned a lot more than I expected. As a computer science major, this is out of my element, but I still had a great time in class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I believe it works perfectly for a student of any major because it is a unique, inspiring course that would be beneficial to experience at any year.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in religion or is a Christian.",
                "Enthusiastically.",
                "Yes! Prof. Hayes is a phenomenal instructor! I learned so much more in this class than I initially expected, and Prof. Hayes is very knowledgeable in the subject and cares a lot about her students. I would take this class again if Yale permitted it!",
                "YES! The content is super interesting and unlike any other class I have taken at Yale. I came in with very little prior experience with religious studies at all, let alone anything related to the Bible but was still able to absorb and engage with the material. I feel that that this class gave me a solid understanding of the Hebrew Bible and I feel better equipped to recognize allusions to it in other subjects.  My favorite class this semester, I highly recommend.",
