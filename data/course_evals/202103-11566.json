                "defintely should do more grammar lessons in class instead of leaving them all up to vhl then assessing them on the test but other than that it was a good course and the seminar class size made it a lot better than expected",
                "The strength of this course was its curriculum. It was well planned and covered a wide range of topics. The weakness was the shortness of each class meeting. It was difficult to accomplish the entirety of our lessons in such a brief period of time.",
                "My teacher did a great job engaging students through lectures, activities, and presentations. The lessons were relatively easy to understand, and I felt that there was a emphasis on cultural learning, which made the language much more interesting for me. Sometimes there was a lot of work, but it was manageable.",
                "Strengths would be how chill the class would be. It was fun to talk with your classmates in Spanish and the activities done were interactive, allowing all of us to talk to everyone in the class. The presentations and the lingua meetings were also great ways to practice speaking Spanish as well. Announcements for assignments were given by the professor too, making it easier to remember. Weaknesses were little other than the professor may have been a little bit difficult to understand at times when teaching a concept."

                "I absolutely would! This class is great, and I learned a lot more than I expected. The size of the classes is also really conducive to learning, and my teacher was helpful and excited to teach. It might be more difficult, depending on your knowledge, but overall I think the class is structured well.",
                "I would recommend this class to another course because it is a class where you are learning Spanish in a fun way. This class will not be a bad one in my opinion and the resources are there to help if anything."
