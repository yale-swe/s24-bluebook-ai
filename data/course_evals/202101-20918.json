                "I came into the course after having taken a year-long break from my Japanese studies. I think the biggest benefit of the course was having daily practice speaking Japanese. We did a fair amount of readings that centered on various cultural aspects of Japan. Despite having taken many years of Japanese at this point, I learned so much about Japanese culture that I didn't know before. As expected, I also expanded my vocabulary, grammar, and Kanji knowledge tremendously. Because of the amount of reading and writing compositions we did, I also believe I developed more natural-sounding speaking and writing. I also improved my pronunciation immensely due to the focus on accent pitch (which none of my classes prior to JAPN 130 and JAPN 140 ever even mentioned). Another thing I improved was my ability to make arguments in Japanese and back them up with concrete evidence (through both writing compositions and in-class debates that we did throughout the semester).",

                "Increased proficiency in the Japanese language.",

            "comments": [
                "The main strength of the course in my opinion was the overall focus on getting skilled at making arguments and expressing ourselves in both written and spoken Japanese. I think another strength of the course is that it balanced a good mixture of both formal and casual Japanese practice. The course focused on teaching us both formal expression techniques (e.g. like when giving a presentation on a set of data) and casual expression techniques (e.g. going over specific contractions or particles that get dropped in casual speech). Another BIG strength of the course is the amount of detailed feedback opportunities you get. Nishimura is great about giving feedback quickly, and her comments show she really cares.\r\n\r\nAny of the weakness I can think of are primarily a result of the online format. I think there were times where we had too much time in the breakout rooms. I also think it would have been useful at times to spend a little more time after a breakout room session to go over the grammar we just practice once more (so having a format of grammar overview --> breakout room practice --> more extensive grammar overview. Or even just doing more grammar review together as a class where sensei could correct us right there on the spot. Of course, this would limit speaking practice, so it might not be ideal.",
                "This course was super fun for me! It was super engaging and I really feel like learning Japanese at Yale has taught me so much not only about the language and how to speak it, but also about Japanese culture itself.",
                "In class exercises are very helpful",
                "The strength is definitely Nishimura sensei - she gave such good feedback and led a language class with high engagement despite the fact that everything was done virtually. I think the workload was ideal - not too much busy work and just enough rigor to consistently improve my Japanese skills. If there is a weakness, I would say that the lessons at times felt like simply reviewing the homework that was due, etc. - this class is for self-motivated people and if you are looking for a class that spoon-feeds your lessons (which has its own merits!) this course may not be great for you.",
                "I would appreciate a little more \"free exercise\" as in debates and discussions instead of the grammar drills everyday. But I am generally very satisfied with the course",
                "I think this course could be accomplished better with a lighter homework load. The homework load was quite time consuming, which tends to cause students to rush it rather than take their time to do it carefully and study it more thoroughly.",
                "The class is definitely fast-paced, but it is very well taught and is fun if you enjoy Japanese. You get to cover a lot of material and you also get lots of practice with it because it is every day.",
                "This class is very engaging and there are plenty of opportunities to practice and learn. There are speech practice, movies, and readings. You can even incorporate your other interests into many of the projects and presentations. The daily work and practice is definitely a large time commitment, but in the end, I think that it is worth it."

                "Absolutely. If you're interested in continuing Japanese (even if you're just casually interested in the language and have no academic endeavors related to it), I think this course is worth taking with Nishimura. She has a lot of experience teaching, and every assignment feels intentional. She's a friendly instructor and her classes have a positive vibe. My Japanese was greatly improved by taking this course (much more than an intensive Japanese summer program I did in the past), and I feel ready to take advanced Japanese.",
                "Yes! I think anyone who is interested in Japanese should definitely go to at least L4 in their study, since it is at the intermediate level classes that one really begins understanding the intricacies of the language and becomes more invested in the cultural aspect, rather than just the language aspect.",
                "Yes",

                "If a student is interested in learning Japanese through the second-year\/fourth-semester level, this course is the only option other than summer programs.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend if you are interested in Japanese. It is great with Professor Nishimura and definitely teaches you a lot. It is definitely a good amount of work since there is class and a decent amount of homework everyday, but it is good if you want to improve at the language.",
                "I think that practicing speaking with classmates, presenting, and learning about another language and culture is very interesting. This class has all of those things, so I would recommend it."
