It felt very difficult at the start, but exposure to the material in class and lecture helps you continue to build up on your skills and how you grow to understand each philosopher and their principles. It is really a lot of practice when it comes to the more structural aspects of philosophical analysis (i.e. premises and conclusions), but you really come to understand them as the course goes along.",
                "I learned how to read and understand (or at least try to understand) philosophy and philosophical concepts. I also learned how to write a philosophy paper and reconstruct an argument. At the beginning of the semester I had no idea how to approach these kinds of texts, let alone form my own opinions about them, but by the end of the class I was comfortable reading and discussing philosophy in class.",
                "I learned how to analyze philosophy for the first time.",
                "Ill discuss my professor (John Hare) later, but I want to use this space to talk about DS Phil more generally. Philosophy can be the most intimidating of the DS courses initially, especially because of the formal philosophical vocabulary that some students possess when entering DS. I, for one, didnt know what teleological meant until this year, and I would still wholeheartedly recommend both Directed Studies and DS: Phil! No matter if youre a philosophical professional or a total beginner, DS Phil is a wonderful course that introduces you to new authors, new ideas, and new perspectives. If you want to think about the world, there is simply no better way to do so, at least in your first semester at Yale, than by taking DS. You learn about so many different ancient schools of philosophy, including some wonderful ones not often taught as part of the classical tradition (shoutout Farabi), and the concepts are explained clearly and in an engaging manner. You really learn how to think like a philosopher over the course of the semester, which is a really useful skill, and you are challenged to think about how you live. Oh, and you learn how write a philosophy paper, which is sick!",

                "Strengths: Professor Hare is an incredible professor to have guide you through the world of philosophy. His breadth of knowledge, poignant examples and constant support is what made this class such a great experience. It was always about learning and growing our understanding of philosophy, and he helped us do that through his anecdotes and clear explanations in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is common to most of DS, but the pace is incredibly fast. There were so many works that we would get to the end of a class session for and there'd still be things we wanted to discuss further. Particularly for the Arabic Philosophers we encountered this particular semester, there were so many things to explore and I think you are able to get into those areas of personal interest through your essays. One thing I do wish we would have done is read the Timaeus! So many lectures mentioned it and I wish we could've had the chance to encounter it in class.",
                "Looking back this class does do a good job of introducing you to philosophical concepts in a simple way, but in the moment at the beginning of the semester I spent a lot of time just confused especially when it came to writing papers. Some of that is an issue of mindsetto be successful in a class like this you really just have to try and failbut if you have no knowledge or experience with philosophy it's scary and kind of jarring to be thrown right in. I think Professor Hare did a good job of encouraging everyone to participate and build confidence by requiring reading responses and presentations from each person in the class, and without this I think philosophy would have been a lot more difficult. And despite his extensive knowledge of philosophy, Professor Hare used lively examples and easily accessible language to communicate principles that seemed complicated; while there were some things it felt like he understood in a way we never would because of his wisdom and experience, he taught the material that was really important for us to know over and over again in a digestible way that helped us grasp them.",
                "I think it would be improved if there were maybe a couple workshops at the beginning of the semester covering basic philosophical concepts (like, for example, what a syllogism is). Specifically for Aristotle I felt like I only got a very good grasp of his thought while I was studying for exams. David Charles' lecture on Aristotle vs. Plato on Forms was one of the best of the semester, but I still only figured out what hylomorphism truly was when it was too late. To understand Aristotle, I think that needs to be hammered in from the beginning.",
                "The biggest weakness of this course, to get it out of the way, is the reading load, but not for the reason you think. Of course, its a lot, but thats what you sign up for and the professors to a great job in making sure it is just manageable. However, the real weakness is the lack of depth. It is inherent in DS, and the ground were able to cover is awesome, but you could really teach a whole class on each of the texts we read, and its a shame were not able to read more (like The Symposium or The Timaeus). \r\n\r\nThe biggest strengths, meanwhile, are the professors, the seminars, and the reading list. You read so much interesting stuff, talk about it in a seminar environment with so many interesting people, and are guided by totally brilliant minds, literal experts in their field.",
                "I think that more time could be granted to the philosophers that came later in the course and maybe less time given to Plato and Aristotle. I did, however, enjoy the ability of the course to demonstrate so many connections between the similarities and differences of all of the philosophers."

                "Yes! I learned about so many ideas and schools of thought I never even knew existed, and I am a better thinker and writer than I could have ever been without this class. I find myself thinking about the material outside of class all the time and applying the skills it teaches to other parts of my life. Especially if you've never had a philosophy class before, philosophy can seem like an alien subject but it's so applicable to so many areas and a great subject to have exposure to.",
                "In this space, Ill take time to explain why you should take DS: Phil specifically with Prof. Hare (though Im not sure if hell teach it again, sadly). John Hare is a total genius, a titan in the philosophical world, a Goliath, the biggest fish in the pond when it comes to philosophy. And yet, he is also incredibly nice, considerate, and funny. He does have a tendency to speak a lot during class, with a lot of participating coming from questions, but he also knows when to step back and let the students battle with their own ideas. This type of teaching actually worked really well philosophy, as I think it led to the class understanding the core topics much better. Furthermore, listening to John Hare speak about philosophy is a treat in and of itself, as hes an engaging speaker and great lecturer (I do hope he continues giving the Augustine and Aquinas lectures). Going to his Office Hours is also a wonderful time, as he invites you to talk about your papers, philosophical ideas, or life in general, and his feedback at those office hours is always incredibly insightful.",
