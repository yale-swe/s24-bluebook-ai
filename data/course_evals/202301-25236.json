                "This course helped develp my understanding of the history behind the modern university system. It also helped me develop my archival research skills.",
                "I learned a lot about how the university operates and the factors that affect it as an institution. I also learned a lot about the historical identity of the university and how it has transformed into its contemporary self.",
                "The final assignment, an intensive research assignment in the university archives, was my first experience conducting archival research. As a non-history major, this was a truly valuable experience that has strengthened my research abilities and given me a newfound appreciation for the historical profession.",
                "This class is a historical and sociological look at the Western research university. We discussed topics like how the first universities were created (a process that was far more bottom-up than I previously realized), the evolution of the university over time (including changing modes of examination, the creation of the land-grant system, and the rise of the sprawling multiversity), degrees, the tenure system, endowments, research, the institutionalization of new departments, etc. \r\n\r\nI gained three primary skills from the class. First, class discussions and Mordechais interjections strengthened my analytical ability, causing me think to more rigorously about why I believed something and whether it was really a sound point. Second, I improved my ability to conduct archival research through the final project, which was quite rewarding. Third, discussing the readings improved my ability to identify key points from long and/or dense texts."

                "I honestly am still a bit foggy as to how exactly the universities of the medieval ages became the modern research universities. I know the differences  super interesting. But the readings discussing the transition were almost impossible to follow. Lots of German theory, not a lot of, well, explanation, haha.\r\n\r\nThats a nitpick though  other than that, class was great! Accomplished exactly what it promised.",
                "Strengths- Reasonable reading load, research assignment clear from beginning, Mordechai is one of the best profs Yale has \r\nWeaknesses- Occasionally felt disorganized, sometimes discussions were fixated on one topic and not brought back to relevancy",
                "I thought the course was strong overall, I enjoyed how discussion-focused it was.",
                "Professor Levy-Eichel's special way of getting students to energetically debate philosophical and sociological questions of consequence made the course extremely entertaining and lively.",
                "A key strength of the class is the discussions. Mordechai is excellent at engaging students and posing difficult or controversial questions that cause hands to go up across the room. I very often found myself continuing conversations with my classmates after class ended. \r\n\r\nAnother strength of the class is Mordechais passion for the subject. Mordechai is clearly extremely well read on the Western research university. His expertise made him a very helpful resource in clarifying complicated concepts and also enabled him to make many connections. \r\n\r\nOne final strength is that at least personally, I found the course material incredibly interesting. Especially for the classs second half (which was more sociological), I really looked forward to doing the readings and discussing them every week.\r\n\r\nMordechai is not a very organized teacher, so its worth knowing that going into the class. Readings were often sent out three or so days before class, which didnt give us that much time to work through them. To his credit, Mordechai warned us about this going into the class. \r\n\r\nAlso, Mordechai has a very distinctive teaching style. I liked it, but its also probably not for everyone. I discuss it a bit more in my comment for whether Id recommend the course."

                "Definitely. Learn how to participate! Learn how pedagogy works! Learn about how Yale became Yale! Take! This! Class!",
                "Yes- Mordechai is a great professor who cares deeply about his topic and his students. The topic is unique and interesting.",
                "Yes, especially if they are interested in conducting archival research. The course gives you an opportunity to write a paper on a topic of your own choosing, which I really appreciated.",
                "Many students would find this course fantastic, to the point where some would consider it one of the best courses theyve taken in college. Others would likely be a bit more tepid. I was more in the first category, but hopefully, I can provide some insight on which you might fall into. Four points seem most important to me: \r\n\r\nFirst, strong interest in the material is a big plus. I went in very interested about the Western research university and how it came to be the way it is, which helped me a lot in making my way through the readings (which were generally very interesting but are also sometimes quite dense). If you enjoy thinking about questions like why admissions are the way they are, why we have tenure for professors and what purpose it serves, and what the life of a typical 17th century college student would have looked like, you will like this class. \r\n\r\nSecond, be ready to be challenged. Many professors take a somewhat passive role in the classroom, posing questions and steering conversations but not inserting themselves too much. Mordechai is not like this: he might challenge the points you make by questioning your premises, pointing out a bizarre implication of your comment, etc. This took me a little while to get used to, but I came to enjoy it. Just be aware that this is his teaching style.\r\n\r\nThird, the conversations are awesome if you dont mind digressions. If a student makes an interesting comment, Mordechai will frequently just run with it, even if that takes the class off course from the assigned readings. I liked that and found the conversations that resulted very engaging. But if you dont like going off on tangents, you might be a bit frustrated by this aspect of the class. \r\n\r\nFourth, prepare yourself for the final project. The only real assignment in the class is a 20ish page final paper involving archival research, which sounds manageable, and definitely is if you plan ahead. If you dont, you will have a hellish week or two before it is due. Mordechai met with us to keep us on track, which I appreciated and definitely helped a lot. Nonetheless, archival research is difficult, so realize that this is a pretty large assignment: it will take a lot longer than other 20-page papers youve written. Im the type of person who tends to go overboard, which caused the project to metastasize a bit for me. Dont let this intimidate you out of the class; overall, the workload is reasonable, and I personally found this project very rewarding. But know what youre getting into and make a plan."
