We had weekly practices on Mindtap and spent class time doing worksheets, watching movies, and participating in class discussions. Ways it could be improved are to have more resources, such as opportunities to speak with other German speakers (outside of the regular Kaffeeklatsch hours since the time can be a conflict sometimes), recommend sites to practice and learn new vocabulary, etc."
