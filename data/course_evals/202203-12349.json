                "I learned more about congressional history and the trajectory of the US political system.",
                "I learned about trends in Congressional history and the roles of messaging vs. legislating. I also learned about differences in the ways Congress operated in the past and present, such as the role of implicit norms.",
                "I learned how to fine tune my reading and analytical skills. I also developed my ability to write without a stricter prompt, as that is mostly what I have done before. I also learned a lot about U.S. political history.",
                "I learned deeply about the continuities and trends of congressional history, gaining a world-class account from the leading congressional scholar in the world.",
                "I really enjoyed the class, and I learned a lot about the intricacies of Congress. I also worked on my writing ability an improved my analysis of political science texts.",
                "Developed a much sharper and more analytical view of the history of the United States Congress.",
                "I learned the ins and outs of how Congress works and the causes/effects of polarization. I also learned a lot more about current events and the historical story behind Congress as an institution, which helped me understand contemporary politics.",
                "I learned about the history of Congress and how it functions on a very deep level. I learned about the gamesmanship that goes on in Congress, but also about its enduring stability and the deep importance of checks and balances in the American system. At the beginning of the course, I felt disillusioned by the politics that seemed to overshadow authentic legislating. However, as the course went on, I realized that the system has many safeguards in place that keep our Congress functioning smoothly and, in fact, very well in a transnational comparison. The readings usually address a specific historical instance or are more scientific and do some data analysis to try to determine a trend or pattern about some aspect of Congress throughout history. Mayhew's book is a consolidation of the readings he assigns, so he has you read his first. Then you read the journal articles that provide more detailed evidence for the points he makes in his book.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mayhew asked us to mention our favorite readings and the readings we would remove:\r\n\r\nFavorites: Insecure Majorities, Imprint of Congress, Meiser \"Power and Restraint,\" Chafetz \"The Phenomenology of Gridlock,\" Cave \"Abuse of Power,\" Farhang, Mayhew \"Incumbency Advantage\"\r\n\r\nRemove: Vogel \"Hare and Tortoise,\" Romer \"Great Depression,\" Rousseau and Sylla \"Emerging Financial Markets\"",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge about the role that Congress plays in politics and public life, with a lot of insight into why members opt to make certain decisions and how Congressional voting patterns + procedures influence the representativeness of the American federal government. I thought these topics were really interesting because they informed me a lot about the nature of American democracy and the relationship between congressional officials and the public. Also, I learned about how Congress has historically been connected to the President and Supreme Court."

                "Strengths: Super engaging/knowledgeable prof, interesting/relevant readings, reasonable workload\r\nWeaknesses: Very few; perhaps some classes could have been a bit better organized but overall I have practically no complaints",
                "Overall, the course was very strong. I appreciated how the different classes were categorized and also the opportunities to be more flexible in what we wrote for our comment papers.",
                "Some of the readings are very long and do not really cover the topic at hand of the week. \r\n\r\nStrengths lie within Professor Mayhews extensive knowledge.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mayhew was a delight and prioritized relationship-building with students. Has a wealth of knowledge on the subject which was particularly insightful during a midterm year! Weaknesses: A little dry at times, some readings were very niche to policies some students enjoyed more than others.",
                "The strengths reside in the engagement with Professor Mayhew.",
                "The discussions were really engaging but sometimes they did not have a specific structure.",
                "Professor Mayhew is a gem!",
                "Strengths: very interesting readings and most of class time is given to fully understanding said readings. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes felt like the discussions could be very one sided.",
                "I don't think there was any weakness with this course. The readings were all well-curated and relevant, and the course was organized in a manner that made sense.",
                "The course is very predictable, which is nice. Once-weekly discussion seminar, five papers throughout the semester during weeks of the student's choosing (two before midterm), and readings. Professor Mayhew is the obvious strength. He is an expert and is very friendly, passionate, and enthusiastic. Professor Mayhew gives intentional and thoughtful feedback on all papers and loves to have meals in the dining hall with students. I also learned a lot from my classmates in this class. It was a mix of undergrads and a few grad students. Mostly political science students, many with working experience in Washington DC. Discussions began with the readings and then took off from there. Never lost sight of the main topic of that class, but the discussion flowed.",
                "strengths: Mayhew knows more about Congressional politics and history than pretty much anyone. To be able to learn from him is really special. also the discussion papers are a strong format -- I really enjoyed writing them (you write 5 short papers over the course of the semester on weeks of your choice) and they taught me a lot. they also taught me how to make the readings apply specifically to my interests in politics.\r\nWeaknesses: class discussion could be better facilitated."

                "Yes! Professor Mayhew is incredibly knowledgeable, caring, and engaging. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about congressional history or engage with how our nation's history impacts the present political fabric.",
                "Absolutelythe opportunity to engage with substantive history with one of the greatest political scientists at Yale was an opportunity Im thoroughly grateful for. Especially during an election year, I was consistently blown away by Professor Mayhews knowledge and passion for the subject.",

                "Yes, if your interests lie in Political Science - especially Congress- you will find it interesting.",
                "A thousand percent yes. I wanted to take this course for years, and I was fortunate enough to get a spot this semester. I truly learned so much about congressional politics and the complex history of it all. It is also incredibly rewarding to learn so much from Professor Mayhew.",
                "I would highly reccomend this class *if you have a medium-to-high interest in Congress*. This is not a US history class or a civics class--it is about Congress. Readings can be dense and sometimes very dry, but overall I found them interesting. I had a weak background in US history and other students in the class will go on to study Congress or be members of Congress. Hence, I learned a lot from them. This class forced me to quickly learn things I should have already known in order to understand the content we were discussing. It is not intro material--it is more advanced and in-depth. I looked forward to attending every week, the papers were not too burdensome, and for the most part I enjoyed the readings. I remained highly engaged throughout, though it is an easy course to let slip because there is very little holding students accountable (only the papers, which you can choose when to write, and a desire to particiapte in the discussion keep people slightly accountable). If you want to learn in this class, you need to choose to keep up and it is absolutely worth it.",
                "yes, if they want an easy course on Congress that will teach them a lot and give them access to a super accomplished professor with a ton of knowledge. The only thing I would caution against is you should only take this class if you're fine with super niche discussions (our conversations got super specific and required a lot of background in American history and politics) and with sometimes-slow moments. it was a very chill class/format and i really enjoyed writing the papers, just sometimes it was easy to not pay attention."
