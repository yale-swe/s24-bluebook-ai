Weaknesses: I would perhaps have liked to learn a bit more about why (not just how) some morphemes / feature bundles end up as a single word, while others end up as separate words, given the DM framework.",

                "Strengths: the biggest strength of this course was the instructor! Suzana is very knowledgeable and gives clear explanations of the material. The lecture materials were also super well prepared and thorough, making it easier to follow lecture in class as well as review what we learned. The assignments were interesting and fair and Suzana gave extensive and useful feedback on each one! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none!"
