Weaknesses: I would perhaps have liked to learn a bit more about why (not just how) some morphemes \/ feature bundles end up as a single word, while others end up as separate words, given the DM framework.",
                "Course is well structured and covers a lot of content. Pace of course was good. Final assignment was fun to do. Lectures could've been a bit more varied.",
                "The materials are very clearly presented: each theoretical point is accompanied with natural language data examples.\r\n\r\nThe pace is great for me as a student new to the subfield of morphology (and to the generative grammar framework as well in general): the instructor made abundant effort making sure all students understand the main point.",
                "Strengths: the biggest strength of this course was the instructor! Suzana is very knowledgeable and gives clear explanations of the material. The lecture materials were also super well prepared and thorough, making it easier to follow lecture in class as well as review what we learned. The assignments were interesting and fair and Suzana gave extensive and useful feedback on each one! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none!"
