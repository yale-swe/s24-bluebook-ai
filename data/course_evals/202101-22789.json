Another strength of the course was the feedback, real-time feedback while speaking in class as well as turning in multiple drafts for large writing assignments and correcting our homework mistakes. I especially enjoyed that we incorporated our mistakes into our quizzes, which made them more useful and less arbitrary. No weaknesses."
