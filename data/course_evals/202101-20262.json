                "The course focused a lot on analyzing primary sources, which is useful preparation for higher level history courses and the senior essay. It also drew connections between meanings of \"citizen\" (e.g., immigrant status; second-class citizen), geographical boundaries created around perceived citizenship status (e.g., redlining, ethnic enclaves), and how public health officials created and enforced public health initiatives that had disparate outcomes along racial and ethnic lines.",
                "The complicated interactions between public health, citizenship, and race (how public health has historically been a tool of oppression, but how it has also been leveraged as a tool of inclusion). Topics included quarantine, health activism, sanitation, colonialism, and more. Super thought-provoking and obviously very relevant given our pandemic, but also broadly relevant in this history of medicine."

                "strengths: Professor Rich is an excellent facilitator of discussion and provides lots of space for students to voice their thoughts while offering very enriching comments of her own to supplement discussion. The readings were generally very interesting and provided for a lot of content to think through and discuss in class. Additionally, the structure of assignments was really helpful as each assignment throughout the semester was designed to build up to a final project, so it helped distribute workload over the semester.\r\n\r\nnot necessarily a weakness but some readings covered themes that were perhaps a bit too similar and sometimes felt repetitive; however, this speaks to the prevalence and robustness of these trends throughout history.",
                "The course was presented very wonderfully. All the topics of each class flowed and really addressed the larger questions of the seminar. I think the structured format of each classicebreakers, presentation, discussion, primary source analysiswas perfect and classes never dragged. The assignments also built up and cumulated in the research project, which made me actually learn things and use them for the next assignment.",
                "I looked forward to this class every week! I think Professor Rich really cultivated a space where we could have dynamic conversations. I felt like I was in community with Professor Rich and my classmates, and that we were all going on a very valuable learning journey together.",
                "This was, by far, the best class I have taken at Yale. I was more engaged with this course than any other, and I felt encouraged to share my perspective during class time.",
                "The current class structure (a mix of student presentations, discussions, and primary source analysis) is a great learning environment",
                "Great course! Prof. Rich is incredible, and the content is interesting",
                "Strengths: Despite the online format, this class was very enjoyable because a variety of formats were used to discuss the material (brainstorming board, student presentation, discussion questions, primary source exploration). Prof. Rich is an incredible professor with a vast amount of knowledge. Workload is very manageable. Weaknesses: Many of our discussions came back to the same points, so it would be interesting to incorporate broader academic perspectives into discussions.",
