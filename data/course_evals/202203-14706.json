                "The discussions in Professor Levy-Eichel's section were the only ones where I had to consistently defend every argument I put out about the texts we read, which made H&P the track where DS most became less of a curriculum and more of way of using classic texts to interrogate one's worldviews and the way we live today. In discussion, both other students and Professor Levy-Eichel would cross examine each other, and we connected the DS curriculum to topics ranging from the role of the university to humans' altruistic potential. The drawback to non-traditional discussions (by DS standards) is that while prepping for finals, you may have to rely heavily on study guides and lecture notes to grasp the summarized points of each text (in my opinion, a minor tradeoff). Writing support was an area for improvement: we often did not receive feedback on previous essays in time to use it to make our next essays better, and while Professor Levy-Eichel takes this into consideration when grading, the delayed feedback cycle makes writing improvement tricky.",
                "More time for each book",
                "Again, I think I would get more out of it if there were just slightly fewer readings. But I understand that that may not be possible!"

                "If students who are already sure they are interested in DS, yes: Professor Levy-Eichel takes care to provide the cultural and historical context around the texts you read, which feels like seeing a full map when previously, you only wandered within a landscape; this was useful in giving direction to the DS curriculum. Furthermore, Professor Levy-Eichel's discussion sections do not shy away from interrogating the DS curriculum itself in a way that is unique and is worth having in at least one of your three sections. For students who are on the fence about the Historical and Political Thought track: H&P is not a chronological history curriculum, rather, we take texts from prominent historians and political philosophers in the Western Canon and analyze the way that they record history, their perspectives on how governments should function, and their assessment of their respective countries/historical moments. I would recommend the track if the texts on the syllabus interest you, and H&P covers thought on everything from justice's role in grand strategy to the arguments for a constitution to where a general interest in history and politics would probably translate well to this course.",
                "Yes, but I found it to be quite overwhelming. The readings were interesting, but they were so plot-heavy and I didn't find that I was always informed about which parts were truly important, and there were so many of them that I didn't get to dive as deeply as I felt I needed to into each of them."
