Additionally, I find the rubrics for assignments to be unclear, which makes it difficult for me to meet the expectations.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I have noticed that during the lectures, there is an excessive amount of irrelevant information being presented, and some of the content feels repetitive. This can be confusing and hinders my ability to fully grasp the key concepts of the course.\r\n\r\nI understand that teaching a course can be challenging, and I appreciate your effort and dedication. However, I wanted to bring these concerns to your attention in the hope that they can be addressed to enhance the learning experience for all students."
