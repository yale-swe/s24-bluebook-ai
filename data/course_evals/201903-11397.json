   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength of this class is its community. It is a relaxed atmosphere where we all feel comfortable to be ourselves and learn casually. That being said, there were almost a bit too many students in the class for there to be only one section. A student only got the chance to conduct about once a week because there were so many people in the class. I think opening more sections would improve the quality a lot. Also, having an ensemble for conductors to practice directing would be very beneficial.",
    "Very low-stress class, you just have to follow the music and you will be fine. Could have more emphasis on score-reading.",
    "If a paid ensemble played the pieces we were studying it would have been much more productive. Since this wasnt provided by the school, Students taking the class had to take turns to play parts that were not necessarily written for their instrument.",
    "It would be very helpful if there were a lab orchestra so students could actually get practice conducting in front of musicians that were not so familiar with the pieces. I also wish Prof. Boughton would have been more specific in his feedback, perhaps even shortening the group class time and having 10 minute one-on-one sessions with the students.",
    "It would've been helpful to have a lab orchestra, if only for the final exam. We did our best with the musicians present in the class, but at times absences strained their ability to play the music with all instruments. It would have been helpful to receive more formal feedback from Professor Boughton, in addition to informal comments in class. For example, he could've sent an email after each student conducted, or even given each of us an index card with notes and things to work on. I found that when I was in front of the class it was difficult to fully internalize his comments, and then I forgot some of them by the time that I was done. I also wish that Professor Boughton had provided us with a true syllabus, rather than just a few bullet points in an email. Throughout the course, we had no idea of the grade distribution or specific expectations for each class. Professor Boughton was sometimes vague about what movements to prepare for the next class, and it was thus difficult to know how to prioritize my time."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's not a gut, but its very very easy if you are into music. And Prof Boughton is very very nice to the students, and very helpful about conducting technique.",
    "If you are looking for an introduction to conducting technique, this is a good class, but there will be a steep learning curve at the beginning. It can be difficult at times, but you will get a lot out of it.",
    "For sure! Maestro Boughton is so fun to work with and gives really inspiring life lessons, and of course demonstrates conducting technique",
    "Yes, but know that what you get out of the course is only what you put in.",
    "Yes - take the class! In addition to learning the basics of conducting, I found it a very valuable experience to go in front of my peers, try to lead them musically, accept feedback, and try again."
