                "General physics knowledge, with an emphasis on how it relates biologically. This emphasis was especially true for the last three modules of the semester. The first four were more applicable to general physics knowledge found in any general physics course (kinematics, work, energy, probability) .",

            "comments": [
                "i really liked how the teacher was always open to questions and opinions from the students. i wish they were more responsive on ED puzzle or email",
                "The strength is Sarah Demers, SHE IS AWESOME! The midterms and quizzes are extremely easy if you attend lectures every day. She is super clear on what she is going to test you on, and there are no surprises. However, I felt like I was self learning many concepts for the p-sets... and sometimes they required math that many people in the class did not know about, which would be pretty stressful. I think the one area of improvement for this class is just making the p-sets more accessible, either by changing the questions or by going a little bit deeper in class, so that they are not so challenging.",
                "Strengths: \r\n1. Easy midterms compared to how hard the problem sets are (also you can get 40% back with corrections) \r\n2. The class is not graded on a curve, meaning that you can collaborate with other people on the problem sets since you aren't competing with each other. I thought this reduced the stress associated with grades a lot and made people more relaxed and not as cut throat \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1. Half of the course is simply not physics. Yes, the first few modules deal with forces, friction, energy, etc. However, after that we did probability, diffusion, membrane permeability, mutation rates, etc. which had no obvious relation to physics from my perspective \r\n2. Yes you saw that right, there is an entire module dedicated to probability. We spent more time doing probability than we did doing energy, which is just ridiculous  \r\n3. The problem sets are pretty hard and take a long time to do (I would say 10+ hours). The professor said at the beginning of the class that she wanted to make them so that we have to attend office hours and collaborate (and this is definitely true) \r\n4. A lot of the lectures, especially in the second half of the course, were super confusing. The professor always made a lot of errors on the board, which confused everyone, but then wouldn't correct them. I have an entire days worth of notes that is just entirely wrong because she made an error about probability and then never corrected herself in subsequent lectures",
                "I loved this course. I think the PSETs could be improved. I did not like them or the modules we used. They were very hard and unable to do without a TA. The modules were very confusing and not helpful in learning. Made me more confused.",
                "This class lecture was not really too conducive of learning the material, for unless someone already has taken high level physics it was hard to follow. I don't think the lectures were organized enough or explained in depth of what was happening.",
                "Strengths: the support system of the course. Between the TAs, study halls, and other students, there were many opportunities to engage with the material and get help. Weaknesses: I wish the class was recorded so we could watch the lectures again, since the material goes by pretty fast.",
                "It was very disorganized, but fun. We covered way too much material, but it was pretty interesting. Prof Demers has a good sense of humor.",
                "the psets are hard and dont really prepare for exams or help my understanding except for the exam review psets those are great! having study hall is great and having test corrections really helped me learn the material",
                "Strengths: good teacher and generally helpful TAs. Weaknesses: psets are very difficult and frequently require time spent in weekly study halls where TAs are overwhelmed by the number of students and unable to answer everyone's questions.",
                "this course was awesome, loved the way it was taught and exams were administered. really facilitates deep student learning",
                "The strength of this course is Professor Demers! This is a wonderful introduction to physics and the perfect class that pre-meds need. It could be improved by returning our problem sets in a more timely manner. It would be nice to have those before exams.",
                "Some of the strengths of the course include the organization of the modules and the way in which information was presented during lecture, the support students received during study halls for help on their problem sets, and the fact that the expectations were clearly communicated, for assignments, exams and beyond. A weakness of the course was the slow response times. Ed Discussion was set up to be used for students during the semester to ask questions anonymously, and it was advertised by the professor as a forum which can be used to get answers quicker than through email, but neither the professor nor the TAs responded to the posts in a timely manner, or frequently not at all. Additionally, the course could be improved if additional TAs or peer tutors were available to staff the study halls and help students in their problem sets, which were often challenging.",
                "It's a pretty good class. There is a lot of room for dropping grades you dont like and a lot of support via office hours and study halls offered throughout the week. The class isn't very well organized, however - the professor will say one thing in class and another thing happens (ex. review session timing), or no one will respond to urgent questions on Phys Ed. This can be improved though because the overall class is good and Sarah is a good professor",
                "The course was very well organized and the study halls were a great opportunity to engage with other members of the class and with TAs to better understand the material. Some of the examples we walked through in class were a bit confusing and hard to follow. I also think it would have been helpful for students to be assigned a primary TA as another point of contact.",
                "The study halls, weekly quizzes, formula sheets and problem sets/review problems were very helpful. I felt it was clear the concepts we would be responsible to know, there was help where students were struggling and the testing of concepts and material was fair.",
                "One major source of improvement is course organization. The EdDicsusion for questions was sometimes slow to be updated compared to my other classes and more general announcements on Canvas would have been helpful. \r\nThe lectures were sometimes confusing and surprisingly complex, but the exam would only test you on your core understanding and not obscure examples.\r\nThe ability to drop 3 in-class quizzes and 2 problem sets was a huge strength that eliminated a lot of stress when things got busy during the semester. \r\nAnother strength was the clarity with regard to the final grade you would receive. The class is truly geared toward a learning environment and eliminated stress about grades as much as a STEM class possibly could.",
                "Strengths: PROFESSOR DEMERS!!! It was very well-taught even though the material was very challenging at times. Professor Demers really took the time to break down the subject into understandable terms for us. This was the most engaging STEM lecture I've ever taken. Weaknesses: The psets were a big intellectual jump from the modules and the class examples so they felt impossible to do without an ample amount of help/time in study halls which wasn't always possible schedule wise. There was definitely a shortage (and inconsistencies) in TAs for the amount of questions people had. It didn't seem like the TAs and the professor were always on the same page.",
                "we were given plenty of support and chances to succeed. office hours, study halls, questions answered with ed discussions, exam corrections - all are examples of things that helped us learn the most that we could and do as best as possible. honestly no weaknesses of the course. any challenges that I or other people had I believe were fully due to our own time mismanagement / our own fault. \r\nmaybe a tiny thing was the exam grading which wasn't always super clear, but in the big picture this didn't matter",
                "The strengths of the course were the TAs, especially Runze and Latavia, as they were helpful in guiding us with any questions we had about the PSETs. Further, the study halls were definitely a strength as they gave us the opportunity to work with other students and form study groups. I also was grateful for the exam corrections as they helped us learn from our mistakes. However, I felt that there were several weaknesses in the course. I felt that since we spent the majority of our time working on the PSETs, they should have been worth more in our final grade calculation. I spent over 15 hours a week attending study halls and writing up my PSETs, which was also something that many of my classmates also experience. As such, the percentage of our grade devoted to PSETs should be increased to match the time we spend working on them. Additionally, I felt that the participation quizzes were not really participation quizzes as I had to devote a large chunk of my time studying to do well on them, and I know that other students also did this as well. Further, a lot of us received 95% on these quizzes, without much explanation, which is disheartening for participation quizzes that we put a lot of time in studying for. I also felt that when we were given an explanation for our 95% scores, the reasoning was very nitpicky, which also does not match what a participation quiz should be. Additionally, I felt that sometimes the grading on the exams was harsh in the fact that many points were taken off for a small mistake, despite being told that our work is important at the beginning of the semester. Also, sometimes the exams had trick questions, which I felt were not conducive to our learning and punished us unnecessarily. Further, I felt like the lectures were hard to follow, especially since they were based on the textbook, which was extremely confusing for us to read and often did not make sense for a lot of us. Therefore, it made it difficult to study from the lectures for exams. I also wish we had more review-like PSETs that simulated the types of questions we were expected to answer as these review PSETs facilitated much of our studying. Another concern is that some weeks we would have a PSET, quiz, and exam due almost on the same day, which was incredibly stressful and hindered much of our learning. Sometimes a PSET deadline would be moved earlier, which was frustrating as we have other coursework we have to complete and often the PSETs were published late, making it very difficult and stressful to complete everything on time.",
                "Strengths: I loved Professor Demers. She's brilliant and great to talk to. Office hours were accessible and extremely helpful. The textbook was short, concise, and easy to follow. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was hard to reach the teaching team with questions.",
                "The last modules were hard to understand. However, the TAs were great and always available!"

                "Yes! If you are a bio major and can take 170 to fulfill the physics requirement, take 170 over 180. You will learn useful, relevant stuff without the stress of 180. Also, there is no curve, so no need to compete for good grades with all the physics/engineering kids who have done a tone of physics before. Also, you will get to meet Sarah Demers who is the best ever!",
                "If you are pre-med or have to take this course, then obviously there is no choice. If, for some reason, you want to take this course for fun, DO NOT do it. For any pre-med and bio/life science majors out there, yes you should absolutely take this course over PHYS 180. I was debating whether to do this or the other one, but the exams are so much easier in 170 (the average midterm scores for us were 80-90s; I heard they were in the 60-70s range for 180). This class still sucks and barely has anything to do with physics, but in terms of grading it is definitely possible to do well in.",
                "No, I think that physics 180 may be a safer bet, I really had a hard time learning in this class.",
                "Definitely would recommend to any pre-med or med-inclined students. You get to work with some medical examples and it touches on (some) topics on the MCAT.",
                "If you have to take physics and you are passionate about learning a lot, take 180. If you want a good grade and to learn a little of everything, take 170.",
                "I would recommend to anyone who wants to or has to take physics! take this one not 180!",
                "you're likely required to take this, not a bad introduction to physics",
                "absolutely. especially with this professor, its a great way to be introduced to physics",
                "Yes! If you are a premed, take this class with Professor Demers. I can't speak to how the class is with a different professor, but Sarah Demers is amazing. I shopped both this class and 180, and this was by far the right call for a pre med who is not doing engineering. The problem sets are reasonable, the exams are not bad at all, and the class is so relaxed and fun. It is not even a comparison to the misery of 180. Take this class!!!! You will have a much lighter workload and the concepts we learn are just the right level for the MCAT.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. If you are a student in a life science major or are planning on pursuing medicine after graduation (and PHYS 180 is not required for your major), I would highly recommend this class, because it is very engaging for those interested in the biological sciences and/or medicine, as there are both concepts that we directly learn in class that are applicable to the biological sciences and medicine, or during problem sets, there are opportunities to apply concepts of classical mechanics to biological systems. The class has a manageable workload, and for those that find calculus challenging, the course introduces necessary calculus topics in a very understandable way, and as they are required for the course.",
                "Yes definitely. If you are taking this because you are premed, take 170 if you don't like a lot of math and are willing to put in the time to go to office hours and succeed on your PSET. Physics could have been a lot worse, but 170 was not bad and they become pretty lenient with grading which was nice",
                "Yes, I would recommend it to a pre-med student because it makes physics very approachable and applicable to the field.",
                "Yes! If you are a student taking this course as a premed or a biology student, the application of concepts is relevant and pacing is reasonable for someone more accustomed to taking a different kind of science course",
                "Sure. Good course overall, although psets can be a pain to complete here and there.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to others. If deciding between physics 180 and 170 as a pre-med, I would highly recommend 170 if you're looking for a more relaxed environment. 170 is definitely geared towards those with less math experience, with the math being limited to algebra and basic derivates/integrals. Compared to my peers in 180, I needed to spend much less time in office hours and I did not need to do any memorization for the exams because exams were very straightforward. There is no curve and the grade cutoffs are posted, giving you a clear sense of where you stand in the class - no need for guessing what you're grade will be based on the mean/curve. There are weekly quizzes, but they're just a measure to ensure that you come to class and only boost your grade. Unless you're a math lover or are taking physics for engineering, taking 170 definitely can save you a lot of stress and trouble.",
                "Yes!! Go to every lecture, stay engaged, and really work through the problems with support and this class should be a success!",
                "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS OVER 180. especially if you're interested in bio!! this class is wayyy less work than 180. Psets are still hard (absolutely go to office hours for them) but take less time than 180, and the exams are super reasonable. Not hard to get an A in this class. Plus, the material is more interesting and Prof Demers is INCREDIBLE. She is such a sweetheart and really cares about what she teaches, plus is a legend in her field. there are many opportunities to succeed in this class - exam correction, super easy attendance quizzes, dropping your worst two psets, etc. absolutely take it.",
                "I would not really recommend this course to another student unless it was required for their major since the course has a very high workload and is difficult to navigate. Although the professor is very kind and knowledgeable, I feel like there should be some more changes to the course to help it become more accessible and fair to the students. Since the participation quizzes do require a fair amount of studying, this also adds to the workload and stress that the students may experience.",
                "Depends. If you are pre-med/interested in biology/MB&B and want to understanding physics' role in biology, yes. If you're not crazy about physics and want an easier alternative to 180, yes. If you want a rigorous physics background, no take 180. This course was very interesting and I (as a MB&B major) personally enjoyed it. I've taken the traditional high school physics courses in high school, so I liked the biophysics focus. The topics were niche, so you won't get an all-encompassing physics backbone as you probably would in 180.",
