            "comments": [
                "Weaknesses: the course is extraordinarily slow, partially due to requiring essentially no mathematical background (even linear algebra) and partially due to repetitiveness of lectures.",
                "Strengths - Lectures were very engaging, professor cared about students and modified difficulty down on the fly\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Programming components had few public test cases, problem sets were way too ambitious at first and perhaps too easy\/computation focused by the end",
                "It has no prereq, but the math, mainly linear algebra, that is needed for the course is not trivial, so it started off as kinda confusing. And the concepts of quantum computation feel pretty abstract without a background in physics. But once you get a hang of it, it becomes easier.",
                "It was the first time being taught so I think the teaching staff had to figure out how to calibrate the homeworks to have them take a reasonable amount of time. The workload at the beginning was perhaps a little too much but in the end it was probably a little too low. Sometimes the lectures were also rushed at the end \/ not enough time to really explain things. Though Shor's algorithm is cool, I don't think it should have been covered unless more time can be devoted to the number theory.",
                "The professor was very understanding and listened to the feedback of his students well, as the problem sets were initially far more consuming than what was promised but became far more manageable as the semester moved on. The topics themselves werent the most interesting that I have gotten to learn at Yale but I do feel the effort that was put into assembling and planning this class offered for the first time at Yale, and Im sure it will only get improved as future iterations of the class are offered.",
                "The class is well structured in that later materials build on top of earlier lectures. The problems sets are relatively challenging (the earlier ones and the programming part) but is helpful for understanding the class material. Professor Ding provides very detailed online notes which is incredibly helpful. However, quantum computing is not an easy topic and the lectures are quite fast paced.",
                "Professor Dings lectures are always super clear and easy to follow, and he manages to fit a lot of valuable material into each lecture. Also, the psets were a little cumbersome at the beginning, but they were very rewarding to finish.",
                "The class is quite fast-paced, and at least during the first half of the semester the course assignments were pretty difficulty\/a higher workload than what I think most students were expecting--although this was corrected around midterm, which I'm thankful for.",
                "Strength:\r\nThe course is very well structured. The initial assignments are challenging but they prepared us well to work on the project. \r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nFor the first two assignments - the programming part, although we were expected to write our own tests it would have been helpful to have the few of the tests released in advance (just like how the test setup was done for assignment 4) so that we could verify our code before submission.",
                "The course content was exceedingly well planned; as a curriculum, this is more comprehensive than any elective I've taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nThe problem is in everything but the content\r\n\r\n1. Mismanaged expectations:\r\n\"CPSC 201 and CPSC 202. Basic familiarity with discrete probability and linear algebra is recommended. Prior experience in quantum computing is useful but not required\"\r\n- these prerequisites were wholesale insufficient. The first assignment asks students to implement quantum registers. The word register isn't even mentioned until 323. The assignment is doable without 323, but without first knowing what a register is and instruction set is, a lot of the nuance in the system is lost on students, and it's hard to appreciate what's going on. \r\n- this resulted in many unprepared students taking the course and then getting absolutely screwed.\r\n- the real prerequisites should be CPSC 202, 323, and MATH 222\/5\r\n\r\n2. Inadequate coverage of tensor products.\r\n- basic familiarity with linear algebra does not include tensor arithmetic. \r\n- the bread and butter of quantum computing is tensor arithmetic, yet this was not covered in any formal capacity outside of a 3 minute segment in the 5th lecture, with no documentation in the notes. One could say that it is my responsibility to figure this out on my own, and that other students did as well. But in that case, why do a math review in the first place? \r\n\r\n3. Insufficient homework to support the content.\r\n- There is too much content, and too little homework to help students understand to a sufficient depth for the midterm. On the other hand, the midterm was far too difficult and required far more difficult and required far more preparation than the homework had provided.\r\n\r\nThe complaints about workload are not that students were incapable of putting in the work, it is that students did not expect to need to put in this level of work. The course was advertised (through the prerequisites, name, description, and pleasant manner of the professor) as a lower-workload elective. As such, students structured their schedules around 447 being a low-intermediate workload class, and then got screwed when it ended up being an intensive course. \r\n\r\n4. Difficult to follow lecture notes.\r\n- I really appreciate professor Ding's efforts to recording lecture audio; unfortunately, the lecture notes don't do his recordings justice. Statements and equations seem unmotivated, making them difficult to follow. There is not enough meat on the bones to understand what is going on. \r\n\r\nConclusion: I would recommend restoring the original homework load,  renaming it \"intensive introduction to quantum computing\", and making the exams less difficult.",
                "The course material is interesting but the course itself, particularly the first half, suffered from structural problems. The problem sets were very long and lectures were for a period of time not recorded. Eventually we got audio recordings + lecture notes which were better than nothing but the course really wanted video recordings.",
                "The course was still calibrating its workload for a while the homework and exam difficulty was absurdly high for people without too much quantum intuition coming in. That being said the workload struck a balance between reinforcing the increasingly complex material and being manageable later on in the term. The professor and TAs are also all great instructors, making the otherwise unwieldy material accessible.",
                "The topic of this class suits anyone interested in learning more about quantum mechanics\/computing. As the semester progresses, things become more interesting, as one could see how qubits can be applied in developing more efficient (and simple) algorithms. This class does not require too much prerequisite (some knowledge in linear algebra would be sufficient), but it indeed could be hard to follow the first few lectures. After one gets familiarized with the concepts, the things that puzzled you would become self-explanatory and easy to understand.",
                "This was a really interesting but difficult course. I think it would be better if the amount of math preparation\/background needed was made more clear. It said in the description that I should have a familiarity with linear algebra, but I would say students need to be very comfortable with linear algebra and have taken it recently to take this class.",
                "Overall there's a huge gap in expectations: the amount of understanding that the prof expects from the students is not possible in an intro level course, and the difficulty of the course was not made clear in the syllabus. The course description also said background in linear algebra was \"recommended\", but given the amount of linear algebra, it should have been listed as a required prereq instead. The prof walked through a lot of the math in lectures, but often without fully explaining why we are doing the math or what the math serves to explain. The pset solutions were not posted, so the psets could do very little in helping us understand the materials. I appreciate how the faculty restructured the assignments and modified the workload after receiving student feedback, but the amount of information remained difficult to tackle.",
                "This is the first time this course has been taught, and the first undergraduate-level course the instructor has taught. The instructor failed to effectively convey just how difficult this course is. The duration and challenge of psets was downplayed to the point that most students had to drop out of the class after expecting an easier CS elective, and the professor had to more than halve the size of psets by midterm. The concepts learned are also extremely tricky and unintuitive.\r\n\r\nWith all that said, I struggle to see how it could've actually been taught better. In fact, I believe Yongshan did a phenomenal job of helping students intuitively understand topics. More time spent asking for questions during class would've gone a long way, but the lectures as-is were very interesting and helpful.",
                "Professor was very engaging and the material was great.",
                "Very difficult, spend a lot of time",
                "The course covered a lot of material from basic principles and tackled technical topics thoroughly. The programming assignments did not have a public test suite and written in Python so it was often difficult to determine whether my implementation was correct. The exams tended to require a fair amount of linear algebra calculations in the moment which I don't think is a great way to determine mastery of the material.",
                "It is good",
                "It was graded harshly and was extremely difficult to start but the professors and TA's took feedback from the class. By the end, it was an incredible class with good pacing and strong teaching. There was also an abundance of support from the staff.",
                "I think the professor could motivate the topics in lecture a bit better. A lot of times I felt like I was trying to follow along but had no idea where he was going or why he was talking about a certain concept in terms of the other concepts we had talked about earlier"

                "I really enjoyed this class, although it was way too hard + fast paced at the beginning. After much complaining, Professor Ding adjusted and the psets became much easier. I would expect hell start off easier next time.",
                "Quantum computing is an uncommonly taught class at many undergraduate institutions and I do feel glad to have taken the opportunity to do so. With that said, it was extremely math-heavy requiring a lot of familiarity with linear algebra. The prof does do a brief review of linear algebra concepts in the beginning, but it needs a lot of grit and it is a very time consuming process to understand the concepts that are presented in class afterward when youre rereading your lecture notes. The workload itself is not heavy, especially as the semester progressed and the professor listened to the students feedback, but the level of intellectual demand was very high because quantum computing is definitely not an easy topic to understand. The first two problem sets definitely took me at least 15 hours each just because I was thrown into learning such new and abstract topics for the first time. I would recommend at least shopping it as I do believe the professor is very nice and understanding and attentive of the students feedback and I do feel the class would significantly improve in the long run.",
                "Yes, if the goal is to learn more about quantum computation in general, in a wide variety of topics. The class itself is not easy and some materials can be challenging. The materials are really interesting however, and Professor Ding is really nice and very understanding regarding extensions. Overall you end up learning a lot about the subject and is one of the few classes at Yale that explores quantum computation.",
                "Absolutely",

                "Yes! This is one of the first courses that provide both theory and programming aspects of quantum computing. The course is challenging but the provided resources such as lecture notes, textbooks, and the programming assignments make you ready to pursue research in Quantum Computing.",
                "Yes, but only following massive changes to the syllabus",
                "Absolutely! Best class I took at Yale.",
                "Yes, for anyone has an interest in quantum computing, this is a must-have course at Yale.",
                "There arent many places you can establish a thorough baseline intuition for quantum computing, unlike other kinds of computer science where concepts are already largely accessible on the internet. Yongshan does a great job teaching this material even if the workload and grading can be rough definitely come prepared with some linear algebra.",
                "Definitely. This is an exciting course that you may not find at other undergraduate-level institutions. Anyone with some knowledge of linear algebra can give a try at this class without too much concern. Prof. Ding is a good lecturer and is very helpful, and he is getting better at controlling the workload to a reasonable level",
                "I would recommend this class if you're really good at math and looking for a cool, unique class that you can spend some time on. The problem sets themselves are interesting and challenging, but it takes a bit of time to think through and understand the course material. Quantum computing is a really cool subject and this is a great way to learn A LOT about it.",
