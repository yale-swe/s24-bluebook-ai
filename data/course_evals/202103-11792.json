The essays introduced me to the literature on the subject and encouraged creative thinking. Loved getting other students' perspectives, especially on religious backgrounds and history.",

                "Prof. Brantley manages the room well and contributes in ways that seem both genuine and productive to the current conversation. The course is essentially identical to the other seminars I've taken, except that students led the first part of discussion, which I appreciated as a chance to practice presentation and to gain a wider perspective on the close readings. I suppose for a theatrical course, I would love to have seen more visual examples of how dramaturgy functions on medieval plays, but I understand the resources and time weren't necessarily available.",
                "Strengths: Professor Brantley is truly the strength of the course. She brings passion, knowledge, and kindness to every discussion, and gives clear and thoughtful feedback on papers. She is a great discussion leader as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course's content may be less engaging than literature from other eras.",
                "The course, though wonderful in its selection of material, has no real progression. We start with the York Cycle and kind of just read straight through it, but rarely in a way that builds on any previous conversations or arguments. The interspersion of modern texts was great, as it helped to understand what we were dealing with, but the lack of overall tracking one can do in the course made it a little difficult to stay fully engaged, or know exactly what we were to be engaging with.",
                "no clear structure or trajectory to course\r\ninteraction between modern and medieval sources studied was unclear\r\nno clear trajectory or overall structure to assignments\r\nclassroom discussions unorganised and did not contribute to learning over time",
                "The strengths of this course were definitely our in class discussions, they were engaging and informative about the material.",
                "professor brantley is such a wonderful instructor and her passion for the subject kept me engaged. i will say that as much as i loved the concept of the final project (designing a production of a medieval play fo your choosing) the lack of guidance about theatrical design leading up to that point could probably be remedied, as if you didn't have previous experience in theatre design, it would be very easy to feel as if you were flying blind."

                "Absolutely. This is my favourite Yale course yet. I loved the creative engagement mixed with a seminar format, and all the plays are of reasonable length and great historical interest.",
                "Yes, it is a very good option for fulfilling the medieval requirement. The workload is reasonable, Professor Brantley is excellent, and (at least for me) medieval drama ended up being more interesting than expected. I liked the structure, where every discussion is led by one student who has given the readings more thought/time and has questions prepared for the class. I also liked how Professor Brantley brought in other forms of art (paintings, sculptures, and modern responses to medieval drama) into the class.",
                "Anyone interested at all in the intersection of English and Drama, and especially in its origins, this is a perfect class to take. It's hard for me to think of what it'd be like to approach this class without a need to approach it, medieval credit or otherwise, but I really did enjoy it and hope others could as well.",
                "if they're really interested in the subject matter, then yeah",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone seriously interested in studying the origins of drama. The reading can be difficult, as it is mostly about biblical history and written in middle english.",
                "Yes! I went into this course thinking I really would not enjoy it, but needed a medieval credit. Instead I enjoyed every week! The plays were so interesting, and the analysis we were able to do with them was really fun. The trips to YUAG and Beinecke were also super cool, and Professor Brantley is a really engaging and sweet professor!",
                "yes -- for english majors needing to complete the medieval requirement, this is probably the best course option.",
                "Yes. I think it's probably the coolest of the Medieval credits."
