    "The small class size meant we were able to all get individualized attention and the opportunity to speak. \r\n\r\nI think that the class could be improved by offering more points per quiz or having more guideline for preparing for quizzes.",
    "Professor Chen has tremendous passion about the course material and answered all questions patiently to ensure understanding. She always provided helpful feedback in a timely manner. The course was engaging and informative.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- lots of opportunities to talk, and read real world sources to improve comprehension and speaking\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I would say the minitalk sections went a bit long, and it would be better if more of those classes were devoted to the teacher talking, and discussing things together",
    "This course tried to do a bit too much given the fact that it was a seminar that met twice a week"

    "Yes if you're specifically interested in learning business related language and do not mind a higher workload"
