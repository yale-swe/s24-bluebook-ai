I also learned how to critique arguments not only logically but reasonable because sometimes one can pick apart an argument through low hanging fruit without really saying anything substantive.\r\n\r\nI also became a better reader of philosophy; while some of the texts we read were cleanly expressed schematics of concrete ideas, others were dense and messy. After constantly reading dozens of pages of argument every week, I came to digest and skim this content more efficiently and meaningfully.",

                "I think this was course was strong in that we analyzed texts at a high level. At the same time, because of the volume of things we read, it was often difficult to understand everythin. We would cover only a few pages out of readings that were signficantly longer.",
                "Great course, one of my two favorite DS strands.",
                "The strength of DS philosophy is its syllabus. I feel the works we read are representative of the key aspects of the western philosophical tradition. The reading load is not heavy, especially compared to the other two DS classes in my opinion. The major weakness is that I feel this particular section is sometimes a little bit disorganized. We just talks about whatever comes up and I'd prefer a more systemic and organized way of learning, at least for an introductory class on history of philosophy like this one. In my opinion, the materials don't get into the kind of depth that can support any meaningful conversation without significant guidance from the instructor.",
                "Discussion was very thought provoking and interesting. However, too much time spent on Aristotle. Rushed through some of the later authors.",
                "For this semester, I thought it was the best it could be. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
                "The syllabus is excellent. I like how its thoroughly canonical so we see how each other is in conversation with the last one; at the same time, the inclusion of philosophers like Ibn Tufayl is an example of how canonical doesn't mean homogeneous.\r\n\r\nI also think the format of writing three five page papers is good; it's enough to develop solid skills without being too grueling.\r\n\r\nThe weakness for me was the discussion section. It often felt like the professor really carried the class, asked pointed questions and rarely did the whole section have valuable contributions. I'm not sure what the problem was -- likely a combination of how much reading people do and confidence speaking in a group -- but it didn't quite live up to the socratic, student-led discussions I had imagined.",
                "The strengths of this course are that there were a lot places for feedback from the professor in regards to the essays at any point of the writing process. One of the weaknesses of this course is the huge amount of reading that needed to be done that were sometimes really dense and hard to understand.",
                "Strengths: broad overview of material, substantial feedback given on assignments to improve between them\r\nWeaknesses: lack of diversity of thought, prominence of a few speakers within seminar who dominated discussion, not enough focus or time spent on each work studied",
                "Strengths: close analysis of classical and medieval philosophers, opportunity to substantively engage with their arguments (objecting to and\/or defending them) in papers and seminars, Professor Greco is really good at closely dissecting arguments while keeping an eye on the bigger picture to keep the conversation going."

This course was a great introduction to early philosophic thought, and I do feel that I have a strong foundation with which to proceed in my academic career. However, I would not recommend this course to students like me, who are pursuing a pre-law track, because I found it difficult to fully engage with the material without a strong interest in the content itself.",
                "Yes. Reading philosophers from millennia ago definitely takes time and getting used to (I'm especially thinking of Aristotle), but I have found the experience surprisingly relevant to the questions we continue to ask today. Questions the classical and medieval philosophers treat, like \"what is virtue?\", \"how is the existence evil compatible with an omnipotent and omniscient God?\", or \"how does one achieve happiness?\", are timeless questions that are as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago. Even if the works you read in this class don't give you definitive answers to these questions, they certainly shed light on their complexity and suggest possible leads. I think this experience is invaluable even if you don't intend to rigorously study philosophy. Whether we like it or not, the answers and perspectives these philosophers suggested shaped history and the world today, whether it's the influence of Augustine's formulation of free will on Christian theology, or countless allusions to the Platonic images of Sun and Cave in literature and beyond (e.g. in Dante's Comedia, which you read in DS Lit), so it's important to understand, I think, where these ideas came from and how their authors framed it."
