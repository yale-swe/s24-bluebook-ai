   "comments": [
    "The course gave me greater insight into my role as a reader and a consumer of texts.",
    "My writing skills improved substantially by taking this course, and I got a strong foundation in the literature of the Western canon. I also learned a lot about art based on the works we were reading. My literary analysis got stronger throughout the semester.",
    "I learned how to properly write literature essays, how to do close reading, and how art can supplement reading. Most importantly, I learned about great works of literature from the Iliad to Dante's Paradiso.",
    "Intensive reading and analysis concerning classical texts (Homer, Vergil, Dante, etc)",
    "I think developed the skills to discuss more abstract concepts as well as link visuals with historical context and literary devices.",
    "The course helped me develop close reading and evaluation skills. I was able to improve my writing and my analysis of literary texts significantly.",
    "I gained broad emotional and aesthetic knowledge about a number of texts central to the Western canon. I honed my close-reading skills through writing daily reading responses. Through reading the texts in conversation with one another, I understood ancient epics and stories in a much more human way. Writing three essays over the course of the term gave me the opportunity to consolidate and clarify my own ideas about what we were reading. I leave the course with a much better understanding of tradition, allusion, and human struggles.",
    "I learned - most significantly - how to look very closely at individual passages. Although I had done a little of this beforehand, reading responses and close readings in essays provided opportunities to do this more thoroughly and deeply than I had before.",
    "I learned how to make connections between texts that were written thousands of years apart. Never in my life have I actually been able to recognize obscure references in classical literature, but now I've actually read the books that are being referenced. I also loved the segments on art history.",
    "My ability to go through dense texts and glean both meaning and beauty have completely transformed in Professor Spitzs class. I feel as though the other two classes really focused on the ideas in the text and other Literature classes Ive taken have been very focused on formalism. This class definitely delved into both the ideas and form of the text, but there was an extra emphasis on just appreciating and relishing in the artistic beauty of the text and the art and music they inspirednot just as pieces of literature but also as pieces of culture. My writing also gained clarity.",
    "I gained knowledge in close reading timeless texts",
    "I learned how to better analyze ancient texts and put them into context with one another."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Spitz was great at bringing in engaging questions and material to discuss the works we were reading and I loved the small seminar discussion format for the class. The lectures were great overall. The course could be improved by cutting down the reading even more: we read less in class than what was on the syllabus and even then did not have the time to discuss everything we wanted to discuss. By its nature, the small seminar can easily be dominated by a few students, so I think even more could be done to ensure that there was balance in who got to speak in class.",
    "Strengths: Professor Spitz made the class excellent. She is a skilled teacher and a delight to be around. She made sure every student was heard and valued all opinions. She is incredibly genuine and truly cares for her students. Professor Spitz would frequently show us art inspired by our readings, imbuing the class with her own personal flair.\r\nWeaknesses: The only weaknesses of the course had to do with the syllabus.",
    "There aren't many weaknesses. Professor Spitz's section was my favorite class the semester and she constantly kept the class engaging with interesting discussion, pertinent artwork, and outside material.",
    "I think the strengths and weaknesses are the strengths and weaknesses of any DS coursethat in what you achieve in breadth you sacrifice in depth.",
    "Strengths: focus on characters and human relationships in the text allowed for my better understanding of how to analyze texts in relation to the characters in them. Also, the level of feedback I received for every single piece of work (even the reading responses we turned in every class) were very helpful and greatly helped me improve my writing.\r\nWeakness: I dont think this course had any weaknesses.",
    "I can't identify a weakness of the class, except that we had too little time! In DS, you sacrifice depth for breadth, but perhaps that's appropriate.",
    "The seminars were wonderful and the feedback on my writing was thoughtful. I think at times conversations got bogged down in particulars that are not as important as bigger questions that the texts raise, but this is to a certain degree inevitable.",
    "We covered a lot of books, but that also means that we had to skim over some because we didn't have enough time to dive into it super deeply.",
    "The strengths are just the quality of the texts and the quality and proximity of the amazing professors. One weakness for me for all of DS is that there is a point at which the reading load is so great that it begins to limit itself (sort of a point of limited returns) because the assignments feel impossible. If a teacher is going to focus on 20% of the reading in class, then I feel like that should be communicated to students, so that, even though students have the option to read everything, those specific portions are studied in depth. I think this would improve the level of engagement in seminar discussions.",
    "Strengths are definitely the supplemental artwork and compositions brought in by Professor Spitz. The weakness is that we always run out of time!",
    "There could stand to be more direct instruction in addition to the time allotted for students to discuss the material."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. Professor Spitz is extremely kind, and her appreciation of literary and artistic works is infectious. Her commentary on our biweekly reading responses was some of the most valuable feedback I've received in DS. I felt that in her seminar, more than any other, there was a genuine appreciation for the students and their individual experiences with the texts.",
    "Absolutely. The small seminar format is incredible because you get access to incredible Yale faculty, and the DS Literature lectures were my favorites of the three courses. The works we read are very interesting and I felt that my writing was able to improve over the semester.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. DS Literature is a lot of work, but you won't regret it, especially if it's with Professor Spitz.",
    "Yes, I would. If you are interested in classical literature.",
    "Yes, but only in the context of recommending DS as a whole to a student who seemed to be a good fit.",
    "I had a fantastic time! I loved the balance between lecture and seminar learning and thoroughly enjoyed each of the texts we read. I am excited to return to these books again and again; one of the things I learned in this course was that our perspectives and understandings change.\r\n\r\nIf you love reading, this is an excellent course for you.",
    "Yes! These are some of the most important  (and enjoyable!) texts ever written, and Professor Spitz teaches them wonderfully.",
    "I would recommend directed studies to another student as a whole. Even though it has a very high workload, I find it extremely gratifying and I have learned so much from it.",
    "Yes! With the right professor, you gain an appreciation for works you probably wouldnt otherwise read with proximity to high-level faculty.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. I think students would gain a lot from a course like this, as they would enjoy the chance to learn from a broad syllabus, and make connections between the different texts."
