    "Strengths: lots of flexibility: Weaknesses: shaky advising combined with that flexibility means that it is very easy to get lost or led astray.",
    "Accountability is mainly on the student. More concrete checkpoints might make it feel more rigorous.",
    "There is absolutely no oversight and leveling of standards. The grading process is ridiculous, since it is never communicated what is required and who needs to see what. It was incredibly frustrating.",
    "Strength: Great 1 to 1 work with a knowledgeable professor at Yale.\r\n\r\nWeakness: None?",
    "As an EECS major, I loved developing a CS app for my EE professor. As long as the project is approved by your senior advisor, they trust you to complete it and get it done- I only had a few meetings with my senior advisor and things went smoothly and well. My advisor was busy\/traveling often, so that was the only frustrating part, but that is understandable and we as students just need to work with their very important schedules."

    "Required to graduate as a EECS major. CS majors have to write theses I believe, so take that into consideration.",
    "Well, you have to do this one. As an EECS major, I loved developing a CS app for my EE professor. As long as the project is approved by your senior advisor, they trust you to complete it and get it done- I only had a few meetings with my senior advisor and things went smoothly and well. My advisor was busy\/traveling often, so that was the only frustrating part, but that is understandable and we as students just need to work with their very important schedules (at least to an extent). But either way, the requirements are reasonable and will vary among advisors and projects, but it was really fun developing this app and getting to present at the demo day in the CEID at the end of the year!"
