I became more comfortable speaking Hindi, and using Hindi grammar and structure even if I had to substitute in English vocabulary words.",

                "Strengths: professor is really engaged and she definitely spends time creating interesting assignments and lesson plans, she is also very open to class feedback.  I liked how we got practice talking about important topics, sometimes the class felt more like a seminar than a language class. It was also great how the class bonded, due to the small class size. I also like how she structured the class with reviewing 1-2 grammar concepts per week. Huge strength- receiving feedback on everything!! Weaknesses: none really come to mind, but the assignments seemed unevenly distributed throughout the week with a lot of work done over the weekend and almost none M-F."
