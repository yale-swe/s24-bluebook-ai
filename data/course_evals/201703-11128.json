    "I developed a knowledge of introductory French through speaking, listening, and writing.",
    "I learned the basics of the French language with a focus on conversation and language structure. Vocabulary generally took a back seat to concepts such as verb conjugation\/tenses, phrases, and prepositions.",
    "I felt like, by the end of the semester, I was far more comfortable speaking French than I thought I would be by the end of the year. I feel relatively comfortable writing in French as well. My comprehension still leaves a little to be desired.",
    "I learned so much about French! Amazing",
    "I learned a lot about the French language. Was a tough course but thought me how to use my resources and really attempt to learn every detail",
    "I gained a vast understanding of french vocabulary, grammar, and basic speaking skills. I can read certain things and comprehend them, as well as listening and speaking.",
    "I learned basic grammar skills and vocabulary. I think that Im able to hold a basic conversation and read french."

    "This course facilitates the learning of French in a small, friendly class environment, with kind instructors who truly care. It is a great course for anyone truly devoted to the study of French. We are given a lot of in-class practice activities that facilitate learning. However, it is a very challenging and time consuming course. With weekly Monday night tests, weekly compositions, meeting every morning, and often two chapters of workbook per week, I felt like the class required a disproportionate amount of my time compared to my other classes. The course material sometimes felt disorganized in the way it was presented in the textbook and workbook, which personally made it difficult for me to learn at times. The vocabulary was also presented in a slightly random way, and it was difficult to learn everything through context (everything is presented in French), so I think it would be very helpful to be given a definitive list of vocabulary and English translations each week.",
    "It was too fast",
    "It was really tough being an all French class at the level 1. Professor Ngame was fantastic with students.",
    "Strengths: Good teachers. Fun story line.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly monday night tests. I think the tests should be taken in class.\r\n\r\nI also think the workload is too heavy for introduction to French, and if you miss one night's homework you begin to fall behind and it is stressful because we were constantly learning new, really tricky concepts."

    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has a genuine passion for learning French and is willing to devote a lot of time and discipline to it. It is often hard to keep up with all the material being covered each week. I also felt that the information was presented in a slightly disorganized way, with the textbook only being a transcript of the video script, and the workbook randomly proving new concepts in each lesson. The vocabulary of each lesson seemed random and it was hard to know what to focus on learning (because it is nearly impossible to learn it all). For me, the class required a lot of my own organization, defining of vocabulary (everything is presented in French only), and note-taking outside of class. If you are willing to devote a large amount of time, however, this class can be rewarding as it moves quickly.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who was looking for a challenging language credit instead of a gut class. It is rewarding but can be a lot of work.",
    "Yes, I would. It's a great introductory course and you learn a lot.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. If they want to really learn the language it forces you to really pay attention and go the extra mile",
    "I would recommend this course if you have a lot of time to put into learning French. It is probably the hardest language at Yale, due to the immense workload and weekly tests, but great if you are willing to work. It is a decent class.",
    "Yes! Ngame and the french department are passionate about the language and their students and rally do want to see people succeed. Theyre very good at identifying weaknesses and helping students when they need it. I had a very positive experience learning french, and I previously hated learning language. This course changed that for me.",
    "yes"
