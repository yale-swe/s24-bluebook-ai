In one of our closing lectures, Professor Kryger told us that, going forward, we'd all be advocates for better sleep. I've already found that to be true. Not only have I learned on an intellectual level, but I've also been able to reconsider and improve my sleeping habits. \r\nYou learn interesting material that you can immediately apply to your own life.",

Moreover, I wrote my first scientific research paper here, and engaged with sleep science through creative pursuits like team projects and writing a short story (for the midterm paper). I gained much insight into the way the human body reacts to sleep (and the lack of sleep) and the mechanisms by which those bodily (and mental) reactions occur. This course definitely taught me to value getting more sleep more, and why (and gives the tools for getting better sleep).",

            "comments": [
                "The course material is interesting but often felt disorganised. It felt at times like there were only 3-4 lectures throughout the semester that covered 95% of the material with the other lectures being full of repetition.",
                "I wish there was more guidance for assignments. I loved that they were so open-ended, but it also made it very challenging to know where to start, especially for the science paper. Overall the class was amazing though and definitely the best science credit I could have ever chosen",
                "Strengths: I really liked the sessions where we talked about the basics: the biology of sleep, circadian rhythms, sleep disorders, and insomnia\/its treatments. At its best, this class made me really aware of 1) how much sleep I need, 2) how cool the mechanisms of sleep are, and 3) how much we still dont know about sleep  how it is, truly, a mystery.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wasnt a huge fan of the way that the course was organized. I felt like the topics could have been ordered in a better sequence. In the beginning, felt that we spent too much time on literature\/sleep\/philosophy, the history of sleep medicine, and What is science vs. the humanities. Then, the guest lectures on sleep in animals and sleep in communities with and without electricity were a bit dry to me, but they may actually have been better received at the end of the course, after we had already covered the basics of What is sleep and how does it work in humans? As it stands, the course got better as we approached the second half, when we really got into the biology of sleep, circadian rhythms, sleep disorders, and their treatments. \r\n\r\nOne more small note: while I appreciated the enthusiastic inclusion of humanities majors, I think that the instructors may have leaned a little bit too heavily on the STEM\/humanities divide. Dont worry, if you study the humanities, youll be OK felt patronizing after a while.",
                "Too long of a zoom lecture",
                "Strengths: guest lecturers, topic, explanations, supportive professors, freedom for curiosity, and exploration of  interests\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: structure often unclear, unclear grading and lacking rubrics\/direction for essays and projects, lack of adequate communication about assignments with students",
                "Strengths: good sci credit for non-STEM kids\r\nWeaknesses: takes itself much too seriously, highly repetitive, there are two profs and way too many guest lectures so the course has no consistent narrative, for some reason they find it necessary to assign a final paper, final exam, and final group project",
                "Strengths: interesting topic, low workload during most of the semester, and our professors were very nice. Weaknesses: very unorganized, I wish we had more information on canvas about what was expected of our assignments. Also, it was unfortunately difficult to engage with this class in its online lecture structure.",
                "strengths: the professors clearly care so deeply about the course and their students. guest lectures are great. incorporation of humanities cool-ish. practical takeaways (e.g. lecture w lynelle scheeberg (sp?)) are reeeeeaaaallllly helpful. learning how to do a sleep log. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS! and animal lectures.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: seems to be a sorta inordinate amount of work, in the last week (final paper, final exam, final project)",
                "There were many guest lecturers that repeated some things we had already learned about. I was very anxious about the multiple-choice exams because I had no idea what we were going to get tested on. We did not receive feedback on our exams. We only received the right answers without finding out which ones we got wrong.",
                "The professors are lovely people clearly passionate about their subject, and they bring a wealth of knowledge to the course. There are three final assessments (a paper, a project, and an exam). It would be nice if these components are spaced out more in the future. Also, I felt like the exam questions were perhaps too specific at times. And, I wish we heard back on our exam scores and essay scores sooner so that we could incorporate the feedback into our learning.",
                "Very good introductory course to sleep with an emphasis on not being too STEM heavy for non-STEM students. However, the class felt a bit disorganized. Often times something would be mentioned and then it was said \"you don't know this but we'll review it in another class\" which was disorienting. The class needs better organization and flow of topics.",
                "Strengths: The course approaches the topic with the assumption that college science is unfamiliar to many of the students. This meant that they teach at a slow pace and make the lessons clear. It also isn't an extremely technical science class and the curriculum also teaches about sleep in art, philosophy, and literature as well. Very light workload which was appreciated during the pandemic.",
                "Zoom sometimes made it difficult to always stay forcused during lecture.\r\n\r\nThe strength is the people teaching. Dr. Kryger, Dr. Baddam, and all the TF's were incredibly passionate about the material, and that excitement came out in our lectures, discussions, and even assignments.",
                "No real weaknesses of the course, guest lecturers and content was interesting assignments were engaging and diverse. The final project could have a higher weighting because it was very enjoyable and I think students responded really well to it",
                "The expectations for the written assignments could have been made a bit clearer.",
                "Great class with really interesting material but a LOT of work",
                "Because of the online format, it was a bit more difficult to engage during class. The lectures were larger and less inviting for participation. It could be improved by breaking up lectures into smaller discussion sections to invite more discourse about the subject material.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Easily accessible materials\r\n- Instructors had wonderful teaching styles, obvious enthusiasm for and experience in their field, highly personable in talking with students\r\n- Well-rounded syllabus gives holistic view of sleep science\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Instructors could have helped groups form for the term project; many students were panicking in the last weeks because they had no groups to do the term project with (eventually it was all resolved but there was, in my opinion, unnecessary confusion).",
                "Strength: Great professors\r\n\r\nWeakness: Exams were a little tricky but the projects and problem sets for the sleep logs are good boosts.",
                "Readings felt unnecessarily dense as they did not relate to class assignments in any way. The combination of essays and exams in the same week felt overwhelming.",
                "weekly workload was great. however, having a final assessment, project, and essay would be a lot to end a regular semester (let alone one conducted over zoom\/remotely). I would consider emphasizing two of the three, especially considering that most students are not cognitive science majors with an incredibly deep understanding of sleep. I believe it would eliminate redundancy in final work. Also, more in-depth rubrics for expected work would be very helpful for future students, I can assure."

Dr. Kryger and Dr. Baddam tailor this course to nonmajors and it's absolutely perfect and really facilitates a comfortable learning environment. Also, everyone needs sleep, and college students sleep horribly, so it was incredibly beneficially for my personal sleep hygiene and I've taught my friends and family so much from it",

At its best, this class made me really aware of 1) how much sleep I need, 2) how cool the mechanisms of sleep are, and 3) how much we still dont know about sleep  how it is, truly, a mystery. If nothing else, the course will show you how much humans NEED sleep  and for Yale students, the more convinced you are of that fact, the better. Dr. Kryger and Dr. Baddam are solid, old-school professors. Their teaching style wasnt necessarily the most dynamic  it was a pretty standard Powerpoint slides + lecture format, but hey, it worked. I felt like the exams were both fair, but multiple choice seems like an outdated format when people have so many different learning styles. Finally, the combination of a final exam, project, and paper was a bit much, but I suppose it can be nice to have many different graded assignments so that each one carries less weight.",

I absolutely hate science classes and was very afraid to fulfill my SC credit, but this class was interesting and the coursework was very manageable. You do have to study for the two tests, but the professors make it clear what needs to be reviewed. Also, the professors clearly value learning over grades, so they designed the grade work to reflect your work by including a few different kinds of assignments (two creative ones!) and made sure that the weight of the tests does not sink your grade.",
                "Yes! As a non-STEM person, I was a little traumatized by my first science credit. That's how I ended up in this class. And, If you need a science credit, this is a very manageable course that does not expect its students to know much going in. \r\nThat being said, this far exceeded my expectations. It went from my science credit to a class I was always excited for, and maybe one of the more practical classes I've taken at Yale. I highly recommend if you're even remotely interested in sleep.",
                "Yes, very interesting, professors are great and the assignments are engaging",
                "Yes, this was a great science class for a non-stem major.",
                "yes! Great science credit",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The professors emphasized the importance of bettering and learning about our sleep health over stressing about a grade. This helped create a very comfortable learning environment where purely learning was at the forefront of the class's agenda.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially because college students often have unhealthy sleeping habits and there is a bad culture of taking pride in pushing one's body to the limits through sleeping less. Every student will benefit from learning why sleep is important and how more sleep improves performance.",
                "Great science credit in comparison to doing harder science classes",
                "The course itself was very interesting and actually improved my knowledge on sleep, my sleep habits, etc. So yes I would certainly recommend the class if someone were interested in taking it for those reasons."
