Ultimately, I am much more informed about fiscal and monetary policy, and the way they can be used to prevent instability or limit it once it occurs.",

                "This course was strong in its diversity of countries that we studied. Unlike a lot of other classes we looked extensively at Asia and other continents outside of the Americas. For a seminar, the class was very lecture oriented. However, it still managed to be very engaging.",
                "Strengths: such an amazing professor, great content\r\n\r\nWeakness: would have been nice to have more more discussion-like classes where people could actually debate these topics - I know there isn't much for debate since it's super empirical but it would've been nice.",
                "Strengths: content is great, student presentations are interesting, reading/workload is not too much, Sigga is a very interesting person/has alot of knowledge to share and is very responsive to students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: would be great for the classes to have a bit more of a seminar component as compared to lectures, and for there to be a bit more time for questions for students",
                "Strengths: incredible prof, super relevant material, fair workload\r\nWeaknesses: didn't receive much feedback (grade-wise) during the course, so don't know how I stand",
                "Sigga is fantastic, student presentations allow for lots of engagement and the workload is very reasonable\r\nMaybe a little bit more student participation and guidance on the final paper would be helpful",
                "This is a great course to take if you already have a strong background in banking and financial policy. Sigga is a great professor, but she definitely goes very fast over the material. I only had some basic background on the topics and most things went flying over my head. It's really a course where you retain the things that you wish to retain. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it makes the course very light on workload, but if you want to receive a deep dive on various financial concepts this is not the course to take. However, if on the other hand you wish to apply banking concepts that you already know in real world examples, this is a great course.",
                "The class could be improved with a break in the middle of each class time since it is 2 hours long. It is also largely a lecture even though it is seminar size, so slowing it down for more questions and discussion might be good since it can be a lot fo material at once. But overall very engaging professor and if you are interested in the material you will have a good time!",
                "I think this is a really great course for students interested in how our international financial system works. I think that it is more of a lecture than a seminar, so students should keep that in mind as they decide whether or not it is for them. Something that would have been very helpful in the course is more definitions of terms. I was often googling concepts to understand what they were referring to, and I think it would have been useful to hear about definitions of difficult financial jargon in class.",

                "Absolutely! Sigga is an excellent professor and enough reason to take the class. In addition to her passionate teaching and broad experience, the class is engaging and truly informative. I have much more context now for how the financial system operates and sometimes fails.",
                "Yeah! Super chill econ class that is absolutely fascinating. Great to have an in-depth understanding of the Fed and financial stability because it affects everyone, especially if you are interested in working in finance.",
                "Definitely, if you are interested in macroeconomics and have some background I think it is very interesting and Sigga is an interesting person, too! If you don't not have an Econ background at all, it may feel a bit overwhelming at first but I think you should be fine - just ask questions and advocate for yourself.",
                "Yes, I would totally recommend this course. Sigga is awesome, and the course has really changed the way I view central banks, financial institutions, and daily economic life.",
                "Yes 100%\r\nSigga is amazing, the material is interesting and relevant and the class is full of bright people who love to participate. Writing the final paper was very rewarding and not too much work if planned ahead of time",
                "Yes!",
                "If you are a senior looking for an econ capstone course that is not going to take much time off your schedule, while also understanding some of the most famous financial crisis, this is a great course to take. However, you will certainly enjoy more the material if you have a strong background in banking and financial theory. The assignments were enjoyable and for the most part open-ended. We had to write a short paper on any banking crisis, prepare a quick presentation on any topic related to a week's readings and take an open-book, untimed, take-home final exam which was very straight forward.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the material. It is not a lot of work and you get out what you put in, but it may go over your head if you don't really care too much about banking/finance. Sigga is a great professor though, and she is very knowledgable and engaging!",
                "Yes. I think this is a great course for understanding how banks work and how financial crises develop. I had no experience in or knowledge of banking before I took this course, so I would just note that my lack of background in this field meant that I had a large learning curve. By the middle of the semester, I was far more comfortable, but it was a tough first few weeks of trying to make sense of things.",
                "Yes! Sigga calls this class a TED talk, and its a relatively chill econ seminar where you learn the underpinning policies that govern the financial system. If youre interested in the topic, then yes, take it by all means.",
                "Yes! This was a very enjoyable course which teaches you a lot about the financial system."
