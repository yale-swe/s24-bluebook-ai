    "The workload is often too intense to provide a positive learning environment.",
    "very small class size so forced you to speak a lot and practice speaking.",
    "Like any other language course, French is A LOT of work, but the struggle certainly molds you into a better French speaker, reader, and writer. The redactions (short to medium length compositions), which are due at the end of each unit, can be a challenge, but I saw errors in my written French decrease over the course of the semester.",
    "The course is well structured to provide a wide variety of stories for students to engage with. The course's weakness is its workload, which is often excessive.",
    "I think itd be nice if the class was less structured and we spent less time on the films. I also wish the class was a little larger so that there can be more active discussion10 people seems right.\r\nI liked reading the books, especially Camu."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. this course is good for people who want to learn french at a high level.",
    "Yes. It's a lot of work, but if you want to get better at French, you need to put in the time. There's no way around it.",
    "I would not recommend FREN 130 to a student unless they are truly dedicated to learning french and are prepared to spend the requisite 2 hours plus per night on homework. The texts and movies, while enjoyable, were often ruined for me because of how much we had to absorb in one night. If you fall behind even by a day, the course quickly becomes overwhelming and depressing. If a student has a light enough schedule to allow them time to spend 10 hours per week on homework then they should absolutely take this interesting course, otherwise, they should look elsewhere for their language credits."
