                "I gained knowledge about climate, climate change, and their relations to society from social sciences and humanities literature spanning a wide historical range and geographical focus. I learned to analyze the heated contemporary climate debates in light of cultural and historical contexts. I obtained insights about the heterogeneous lived realities that are often blurred by grand narratives and solutions about global climate change. The course profoundly changed how I engaged with the \"climate crisis\" both professionally and personally.",
                "I learned about the social science and humanitarian applications of climate change.",
                "I learned some interesting and unexpected intersections between climate change and other areas in the humanities, and some academic jargon concerning the climate change area.",
                "Cultual analyses relating to climate change. Human impacts and perception of impact on climate and environmental surroundings.",
                "It teaches you to question \"what makes this natural disaster a disaster,\" who has the power in forming environmental policy and preconceptions (e.g. we spoke about how island nations conceive of climate change differently and how migration is seen differently in different cultures), and how people relate to their surroundings on local to global scales. We applied anthropological techniques to talk about climate change deniers and climate scientists, which I particularly enjoyed.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of the course include: 1) the syllabus was really well designed and expansive, with readings from diverse authors from Ibn Khaldun to indigenous scholars from Oceania, which effectively historicizes and contextualizes climate in diverse human societies; 2) the lectures each week were exceptionally insightful and thought provoking, which helped connected diverse readings to the theme and modeled an anthropological lens into climate change; 3) the class assignments are of the right amount, where both the class commentaries and final paper helped me digest and apply the course materials in my own research.",
                "I think that the readings were applicable and the discussions were interesting, but the timeline for feedback was not conducive to being proactive about the term paper.",
                "I really like the leniency with the long paper at the end of the course, I think it's a unique opportunity at Yale to just write about something that interests you without being constrained by an assignment. I also really enjoyed the commentary aspect of the course, it was really interesting having discussion lead by my peers. I just wish the lecture itself was more engaging.",
                "The insights gained from the lectures, readings, and class discussions are plentiful. One aspect that I think could be improved is the opportunity for student comments during the lecture portion of the class. At the beginning of the semester, the professor asked questions to students during his lecture, but by the end of the semester, there were very few questions. These questions allow for more discussion and I feel that they help encourage student engagement during class.",
                "The 25-page final paper is essentially the only assignment in the course, except for two weeks where you have to write a two-page single-spaced report. This means that it is helpful if you are self-motivated to do readings and work without deadlines. I am not, so I found it slightly more challenging. But the topics were enjoyable, and the class discussions were often fruitful. Prof. Dove is a FANTASTIC lecturer.",
                "This was a great course! I would have liked a little bit more of a checkpoint structure for the writing process, like submitting a draft for feedback, but other than that the course was fascinating."

                "Yes! This course achieves exactly what it describes in the syllabus: you will never hear climate change debates in the same way. The insights and knowledge from the course are invaluable for anyone to engage with global climate change in a meaningful way.",
                "If you are a graduate student in YSE, or are a strong writer, I recommend this course. The end-of-term essay is really long, so I suggest having good time management as well.",
                "It was a nice, chill class to have in my schedule and I felt like I was learning through rich class discussion. Sometimes the concepts or the jargon felt very intimidating and I didn't fully understand it, so I wish it was more accessible in that way. If you feel comfortable with that and a kind of boring lecture, sure.",
                "Yes! This was my favorite class this semester. This class introduced me to so many different aspects of human-nature relationships and narratives about climate change. The readings are incredibly interesting and I learned so much from the comments of the professor as well as those of other students.",
                "It is a stellar course. The final paper while longs allows you to delve deep into any topic of your interest. For example, I did a modern cultural analysis of emerging TikTok groups, a visual analysis of various animations, and a synthesis of real life examples of Solarpunk design. Solarpunk is a new form of punk (similar to cyberpunk) but which values climate optimism and anti-capitalism as its main forms of promoting human culture in harmony with climate rather than in opposition to it.",
                "I would! It's chill and perhaps not the most practically applicable, but it's worth it for anyone who studies the human side of the environment (which I mean, isn't that everyone to some degree?)",
                "Yes! We covered a fascinating array of topics important for understanding how humans interact with climate and vice versa."
