    "Human body systems! And how we compare to other vertebrates",
    "You learn about different aspects of physiology for the different types of vertebrates.",
    "This course gave me entirely new ways to conceptualize the way organisms interact with their environment and adapt to challenging conditions. Many ecology courses or evolution courses I've taken at Yale have treated organisms and their environments as distinct spheres that occasionally interact, whereas this class reveled that the two are closely integrated with one another. I sometimes find myself seeing wildlife around campus and thinking of metabolic rates, water balances, and thermoregulatory behaviors!",
    "This class taught me so much about physiology, not just of humans, but of different vertebrates as well.",
    "I learned a better understanding of animal physiology. I learned about various different systems."

   "comments": [
    "This was the first year being taught so exam length, question type, chapter focus, quality of study guides, grading scale, etc were all in flux, which is understandable but also a little unnerving. The professor is sweet, knowledgeable, and approachable.",
    "Strengths: Lectures are very clear and teach the information very well. Quizzes keep you on track for learning the material. The teacher is very accessible to ask for help.",
    "This course was full of interesting material, and I wish that I could have taken it on its own so as to have more time to fully immerse myself in all of the material. The reading load could be very high at times, but the lectures were great summaries of the reasons until one could get a chance to get I to the textbook. I think the course could be structured to place more weights on the weekly quizzes though, because they could be somewhat time consuming and only account. For 10% of the grade, while exams counted for the remaining 90%.",
    "The course was very interesting, but relied very heavily on the textbook.",
    "The strengths of this course are that Professor Lattin cares a lot about this course and her students. However, sometimes she went through the material too fast and not in enough detail. Also, a majority of this class's grade was based on tests, so if you didn't do well on a test your grade suffered a lot. I would have appreciated more class work and more test practice. Otherwise, I really liked Professor Lattin and thought that she was very kind and helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Take it! It's a fantastic alternative to regular physiology, the class is small, the professor is friendly, and the material is actually interesting. I've been in too many pre-med courses with high-strung, seething students and this felt far more chill, which is incredibly important to my own mental health.",
    "Yes I'd recommend this! The material was fun and interesting, but that's probably because I'm an E&EB major. The professor is fantastic and is very fun and personable, and the lectures are taught super clearly and well.",
    "I would! This course was amazing and I learned so many cool things about vertebrate physiology! If the student had limited interest in biology, this would not be a course I'd suggest, but if the interest is there, the material is so cool that the workload is more than tolerable.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wants to gain knowledge about the physiology of different vertebrate.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in learning more about physiology. You need a strong chemistry and biology background for some of the units, but otherwise it was pretty fun and straightforward.",
    "Absolutely take this class if it is offered again. Prof. Lattin genuinely cares about her students and is passionate about teaching. While I originally took this class to fulfill a core requirement for E&EB, I would recommend this class to anyone with even a passing interest in physiology, and especially if you've ever wondered how different animals are able to survive extreme conditions.",
    "Yes"
