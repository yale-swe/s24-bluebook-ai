                "I developed all of my skills relating to college level writing, the course really significantly improved my writing level from the high school standard to that of what college essays should be. \r\n\r\nTherefore all the skills I developed were related to this, such as: essay structure and planning, problem->claim exploration of claim etc.",
                "I improved my writing tremendously - through both learning how to structure essay and my overall style of writing. Additionally, I learned a lot about rationality and how to write a research paper.",
                "This course really challenged my writing by forcing me to break it down to the sentence to sentence level and improve fundamentals. Craig is prob my favorite professor at Yale so far. Great course.",
                "Besides the learning the interesting theories about the origins and function of reasoning, by taking this course, I was able to more fully understand what makes up a proper college introduction and how to work backwards during the process of making it. I was also introduced to my first college research paper and the steps that go into making it successful, such as: making a compiled list of all relevant sources first, setting deadlines for completing different parts of the paper, and coming to terms with the fact my claim may change as the paper progresses. Professor Eklund made all of the classes interesting and relevant which helped.",
                "I was able to build writing and analysis skills. This class gave me a new perspective on the way that I approach my own mind and the world around me. This is one of, if not the best, class I have ever taken.",
                "A very strong introduction to writing the college essay, and an interesting smattering of facts about rationality. This is first and foremost a writing class, so do not expect the theme (in this case, rationality) to take precedence."

                "Lectures were not particularly interesting, and there was a disconnect between a lot of the readings we did and the assignments.",

As well as this another strength was the reading material he put together, which really fit the theme of the course and allowed exploration of logic and reasoning while also improving writing skills. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course and something that could be improved is maybe the length of some of the readings as the time needed to properly read through them is too much for the time given.",
                "I found it pretty writing heavy but I do think the work is interesting and helps strengthen skills",
                "The strengths of this course lie in the way it is taught for me. I appreciate that class was spent introducing the material in an interesting manner that made you question what you know about the topic and yourself. Questions that stem from class provided motivation to do the work simply because I wanted to know more about what we were learning. I cannot think of any weaknesses for the course.",
                "I believe this course is very well structured and creates a very good working environment. Professor Eklund is an amazing teacher and does a great job engaging everyone in the lesson and explaining the intricacies of the challenging texts presented.",
                "Strengths  Well-chosen reading material, strong introduction to essay-writing, and professor Eklund is great: engaging and approachable\r\nWeaknesses  for a writing class, we could have written more essays: we only wrote three. On the other hand, I feel like by writing a limited number of essays we were able to focus far more deeply on the mechanics and skills. So I'm not sure where I stand on this."

                "Yes. Highly. Super interesting prof and really mind blowing content.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. Not only is it an opportunity to learn more about how we as humans function, but the teacher is able to convey the information in a way that does not demand the student to have hundreds of hours of homework. The workload, topic, teacher, and vibe were all conducive of learning and making good relationships.",
                "Yes!! Craig was a great professor, and I learned a lot. However, you get out whatever you put in. It is by no means an easy class, especially if you really want to learn.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this to someone else and wish I could take this class again.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It introduced me to the expectations of college writing, close reading, and research. As someone who comfortable with the conventions of a college essay, I certainly still benefited immensely from the course."
