                "Through taking ANTH 280, I learned about the ongoing research in comparative cognition between humans and non-human primates from the theory of mind to language acquisition. We learned about different cognition topics that were researched in primates, particularly our closest living relatives.",
                "I learned about the evolution of primate intelligence and how primates differed from other animals.",
                "The various types of intelligence and how they might have evolved, in addition to the way primatologists tested to discover this information.",
                "learned a lot about the behaviors of primates and how that relates to human behavior",
                "Some insight into the different social structures and cognitive abilities of extant primates, and some of the debates about the selective pressures that may have brought about these different abilities.",
                "This was a fairly interesting course that pretty much covers the basics of all things related to primates. You also get a fair amount of writing practice.",
                "Learned a lot of how primates should be studied, and what current studies have actually proven in terms of their intelligence and cognition.",
                "I genuinely learned a lot of interesting facts about primates and their intelligence. I also learned how to write a good anthropology paper. However, something I hope to learn which was not included was a big picture reflection on the evolutionary origins of human intelligence in primates."

                "I really enjoyed the course. The lectures were focused on interesting topics and the section help me see how I can approach papers for this course and when writing about comparative animal cognition.",
                "Use of multimedia in the lectures was very engaging. Also, the readings were genuinely enjoyable and I learned a lot from completing them every week. I really liked the short paper critiques as the primary assignments. They helped me stay engaged with the course material but weren't a huge workload burden. I do wish that the lectures were recorded with higher quality, since I enjoyed being able to go back and review them but the audio and visual quality was very unpredictable.",
                "Strengths: Professor Watts was a great instructor and a great person to talk to. The reading critiques were also fun to work on.",
                "Maybe take a \"readings for the week\" approach instead of \"readings for this class day\" to ensure better comprehension. Also, while the low workload was appreciated, I find I do better and remember more with weekly assignments. Maybe cut a one or two of the critiques and add a weekly assignment, if possible.",
                "Strengths: the professor is VERY knowledgeable, and the material is super interesting\r\nWeaknesses: slides could be a little more clearly organized, I also wish there were maybe study guides or opportunities to synthesize the material we went over in class because it was so much interesting information but sometimes hard to follow and disconnected",
                "Strengths: professor very knowledgeable and generous with his time. provided SO many thoughtful comments on the arguments we presented in our papers! knows the literature like the back of his hand, and in lectures, always provides a very balanced and objective view on the relevant debates about primate intelligence.\r\nWeaknesses: Lecturing was not the most engaging; it often made me sleepy, but maybe that's partially just due to the quality of Prof Watts's voice. There was not a strong question-asking or interactive culture, and attendance was low. Also, in lecture, sometimes the deep dives into each topic made it difficult to determine one or two main takeaways for that topic; I couldn't see the forest for the trees! For example, the presentation of all the various backs-and-forths in the literature about what abilities chimps have made it difficult to tell what the take-home message was about that particular cognitive ability - does it generally seem like chimps have it or not?",
                "The lectures could be a bit more engaging and it would help if they were tied in to the assignments more closely."

                "It's a really cool course if you're interested in primates! You definitely get out of it what you put into it, so definitely take it if you're interested!",
                "Maybe. It's good for a writing credit, but I was a bit underwhelmed by the content. It sometimes felt like this class might be better titled \"A Survey of Primate Intelligence\" rather than \"the evolution of primate intelligence\" - while we definitely talked about evolution several times in the semester (possible selective pressures for intelligence, etc.), it didn't necessarily feel like the major focus of the class. We spent a lot of time, probably more time, talking about various topics in extant primates, like the different cognitive abilities and social structures that different primates have and experimental studies with chimpanzees.\r\n\r\nYeah I guess just generally I didn't feel like I got much out of the class, and it always made me sleepy even when I had slept well (it was in the middle of the afternoon). The content was cool, and Prof Watts is incredibly nice and knowledgeable and generous with his time and clearly puts a lot of effort into the class, but it was just a pretty non-stimulating class.",
                "I would only recommend it as a writing credit or if you are truly interested in the topic.",
                "Yes, but you will enjoy it much more if have a great interest in primates, if not, I think this course may become quite dull.",
                "If you are genuinely interested in primates, then this is the best class to take about it. Otherwise, you might find this class a little unengaging."
