Some of the books we read, in particular, including Germinal, A Life of Her Own, and Under Fire, were excellent and extremely enlightening.  In fact, I would venture to say they are worth reading even for people with little to no interest in the history of France.  The films, including Paths of Glory, the Battle of Algiers, and La Haine, are similarly worth anyone's time.",

Professor Merriman is a lively and engaging lecturer, and the course traces everything from the Paris Commune to Vichy France to immigration and the banlieues in contemporary France. The readings and documentaries were excellent and expectations for section were very fair."
