                "This course was well-structured and organized to facilitate learning. Professor Zhou provided detailed explanations to all questions and seemed passionate about the subject.",
                "The course applies Chinese language skills in a \"real-world\" topic, and thus allows for substantial growth. However, this course is highly independent. While this is not a weakness, this is different from lower-level Chinese courses and requires some adjustment.",
                "I enjoyed the content and organization of the class, but the high number of students and difference between levels of the students made it difficult to get any speaking practice",
                "This is overall a good course but I would have two main recommendations: first, it could be better organized. Professor Zhou obviously put a lot of effort into making documents for each class, but they were split up into multiple files on Canvas, and often it was difficult to find a particular assignment. It would be easier for the student if there was one unified document for each day of class, with the syllabus, vocabulary, and writing homework assignments all collated in one place. Second, I do not think native speakers should be allowed to take this class. I understand that high-level language courses will always contain a mixed bag of students, but this class had a few students who were literally from China, and often I had no idea what they were saying.",
                "Strengths: Zhou Laoshi is a Yale gem, knows what he's doing, great at recognizing student need and desires, understands when we're burnt out and stressed, brought us to the YUAG, and let us play poker during the last class. Easy exams (fill in the blank? so simple) and easy assignments (fake news stories), along with lenient grading. Weak: grading sometimes took forever, which understandable, but it sometimes felt like the comments were vacuous once it came back (i.e., a random circle on a word I used wrong doesn't tell me how to fix it), and I didn't like that for the midterm we had to write about the stock market that morning as it updated even though I a) have never read an article on the stock market in my life, b) don't plan on it, and c) don't understand how it works, so what I wrote in Chinese was essentially gibberish to me in translation. The final project always feels like more work than it's worth, but he does grade really easily - I wish there was more individualized attention to tones and grammar though, as many students make sense but are never corrected. And native speakers speak way too fast and with really thick accents which makes their speech incomprehensible. Some students had a blatant disregard for punctuality and it showed, and even though Zhou Laoshi stresses that the class is predicated on oral practice and self studying, for some reason he allowed all the quizlets to have pinyin literally in the answers (that's the biggest waste of time for non-heritage students ever because cheating becomes ridiculously easy and almost encouraged), and the amount of times we actually talked about the articles was so little. Guiding questions would be nice, and shorter articles that actually stimulated real questions would be even better (CPTPP, RCEP, and CAI just don't interest me at all, and I've had enough reading about laolinghua shehui or zhongguo de jueqi at this point). It's a current affairs class: not all current affairs are about bad trade agreements and horrible social degradation, some is pop culture related, and I still don't know how to read or talk about any of that. I also think he assumes that our Chinese level just allows for a smooth tranisiton to writing a condolences card and an artist's statement, and it just doesn't and occasionally it appears that he isn't listening to anything you're saying. Alas, he is my favorite Chinese professor here, but this class did let me down a bit."

                "Yes! The peers in the following class will most likely be extremely advanced - either heritage speakers or those with extensive study abroad experience. Enrolling in this course allows you to grow amid highly extraordinary individuals. Additionally, the material explored in the course is also extremely interesting and relevant given that it focuses completely on current affairs.",
                "Yes, but be prepared for a fair amount of busy work. I would not recommend taking this on top of an already demanding schedule.",
                "Sure. It's a maintenance Chinese class that apparently native speakers and heritage students put a ridiculous amount of work into for no reason b/c here I am just doing the prep before class and ending with like a 99.something, which is so high it's crazy. Class is really straightforward. Just wish Zhou Laoshi responded to emails a bit faster!"
