    "The class covers a range of topics in Chinese including making phone calls, traveling abroad, celebrating holidays, buying a house, applying for a job, etc. It introduces an extensive amount of vocabulary ranging from simple more useful words to niche or jargon words, and the class requires a lot of self study and preparation because there is no formal writing practice in class, so you learn to write and read the characters completely on your own time.",
    "I actually learned how to speak chinese.  I took chinese for five years before this course but now I feel I finally learned how to really speak it properly.  Im finally learning tones and figuring out the instincts a chinese speaker needs.",
    "I learned over 500 characters, grammar structures, and listening skills in Chinese.",
    "I learned how to speak, read, and write Chinese.",
    "I developed a stronger understanding of Chinese vocab  and grammar. Speaking and reading improved.",
    "Chinese listening skills.",
    "I think that all of my Mandarin skills vastly improved because of this course, but I was especially impressed with my improvements in reading comprehension and tones.",
    "More advanced conversational and written chinese.",
    "Obviously I learned a lot of Chinese. Liang Laoshi really put in an effort to explain a lot of grammar that at first seems to be nonsensical. As a result, I feel like I definitely have a good grasp on all the new grammar we learned. Definitely take this class with Liang Laoshi.",
    "My Mandarin improved."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very conducive to teaching students speaking and listening skills, but the writing aspect of the course definitely has the weakest emphasis. Also, the course content is very well organized and has many words and sentence patterns that return in later chapters. I do also wish the class had more cultural aspects in it. The heritage L3 class I have heard has much more culture and history in their curriculum, whereas in Chinese 130, the most culture we learn is celebrating mid-autumn harvest festival.",
    "I definitely learned a lot from the daily quizzes.  However, I often forgot a lot, particularly how to write the characters, soon after the quizzes.  The tutorials were extremely helpful and oral practice in class improved my tones massively.",
    "I think this course is organized very well. \r\n\r\nHowever, the in class lectures are only helpful to learning the grammar structures.",
    "Very strong course. One flaw was it was quite repetitive, so sometimes it was quite dull.",
    "This course is fantastic! Very intense -- required about an hour of work every day -- but well worth it.",
    "Meeting every day means Chinese is always on your mind. Although the daily grind can sometimes feel like a lot, the extent to which we practice is certainly a great strength.\r\n\r\nOne thing I didn't like a lot was that you only get 5 sec preparation time on the oral tests. However I suppose this makes sense since it tries to get you to come up with on the spot thoughts.",
    "The course workload is too much. A lot of it seems to be like busy work."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone. The Chinese department is very good, and the class is good for developing practical Chinese skills, and the book is very interesting to follow.",
    "I would only take this course if you just need one more semester to complete your language credit.",
    "If you were interested in massively improving your chinese ability, take this course.",
    "Yes. Fantastic course for the study of Mandarin.",
    "Absolutely. If you wanna learn Chinese, there's not a better place to do so than Yale. Take advantage of these classes. Also with China becoming more and more important, learning Chinese is a very good investment for your future."
