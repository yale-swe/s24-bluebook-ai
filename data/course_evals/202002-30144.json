    "Integral calculus and applications.",
    "How to do calculus?",
    "Calculus II with integration, infinite series and sequences and volumes\/polar\/parametric functions.",
    "By taking this course, I developed a stronger understanding of sequences, series and various types of functions. I became better at finding areas under curves and volumes of solids. Most importantly, I feel like this course math me a more confident math student. Due to the shortened length of the class, I was forced to actively study and grapple with concept. I feel more sure in my abilities to learn new concepts on my own and apply them to problem-solving.",
    "I learned more math relating to calc II, including: integrals, applications of integrals, series, Taylor series, parametric functions, and polar functions.",
    "I learned about integration techniques, series and sequences (including power and Taylor series), and parametric and polar equations.",
    "Calculus.",
    "A deep understanding of calculus: from strategies of integration, determining series convergence or divergence and finding volumes. I was able to fully grasp all of the contents covered in the course.",
    "I learned real-life applications of calculus, strategies for taking integrals, and also how to efficiently find proper methods for taking area\/integrals in different cases.",
    "I was able to further develop my skills in Calculus 2 by taking this course. Specifically, complex skills regarding integration."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The pre-recorded videos are super clear, good for learning the content on your own. Instructor and TAs were all very nice (Ethan was especially helpful), clear notes, generally well-structured course. Practice exams were super helpful as well. The polls were a good way to keep students engaged, although the breakout groups were not very effective\/efficient. Perhaps the class time could've covered a little more of the material.",
    "I think the course was structured really well and everyone definitely had the resources to succeed if they took advantage of them.",
    "I really liked the short times of an hour long for class. It wasn't too exhausting. Strengths: Prof. Smith's teaching and the TAs. Weaknesses: It felt kind of rushed because the classes are only five weeks long. When we had breakout room sessions, it felt too short to get anything done and because so, it was kind of a waste of time, especially when no one talked. I recommend we stick to breakout sessions for workshop sessions.",
    "Strengths of the course include the pre-class explorations and the workshops. I think the workshops were just as valuable, if not more valuable, than class time. Other strengths include the accessibility of the professor and TF's. A weakness was the fact that we received very little feedback on our problem sets.",
    "This course had many resources, and multiple ways of teaching including videos, explorations, class time, workshops, and office hours which all helped in teaching concepts and problems.",
    "The way in which Professor Brett Smith taught the course was a strength. He delivered clear lectures and was consistently available to help students during one-on-one office hours. In addition, his exams were fair--the questions pushed us to think but were always in line with what we covered, and were graded fairly and timely. I also liked that we had optional problem-solving workshops held by TAs on the days that we did not have class, because I found these workshops to be very useful. Finally, a particular strength of the course is that we had post-exam one-on-one discussions with the professor or TAs. I really appreciated this because it allowed me to get feedback on my work and in general, made me feel supported in my learning. \r\n\r\nA weakness is that the course met only three times a week, once an hour each time. During the school year, I think this schedule would be fitting, but given that we compressed a semester's worth of material into five weeks during this course, I found that we weren't able to cover material deeply with the course time allocated and I wish we had longer class time. I would have liked perhaps meeting 1.5 hours three times a week. I think this would have given us more time to learn about parametric and polar equations, which occurred all of during the last week of class and could have benefited from more in-depth treatment. In addition, I wish the Canvas files section was more organized and that it was easier to find certain files. I did, however, found the Canvas modules section to be extremely organized and helpful, covering the same content as is in the files section.",
    "It was a little rushed at times. The course could use more practice exams before each test.",
    "The software that Professor Smith used to teach us was very convenient and clear with the color coding and space the write the whole lecture's notes in sort of one white board. Furthermore, the online videos were very helpful in refining certain knowledge areas. One weakness would be that it is hard to communicate with other students, as there is no social media platform in which we can ask each other questions.",
    "This class is good at teaching fundamental Calculus 2 skills in such a short period of time, however lecture does not often tackle important problems that may show up on homework or exams. I also did not find group work in breakout rooms to be useful since many people are often quiet and discussing each other's work is difficult on a virtual call. It would also be helpful if lectures could sometimes explain the concepts behind what we are learning, although it is hard to make everything fit in an hour-long lecture.",
    "The course was too short. Three hours per week is not enough to help students master the informtion."

   "comments": [
    "Yes if you like math or need this class as a prereq. The summer version seems like a pretty efficient and painless way to get through it.",
    "Yes for sure. I found it fun and pretty easy.",
    "Yes, if you need to take MATH 115, it's only 5 weeks long but you should keep in mind that the content will be heavily rushed.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this class if you have a decent understanding of Calc I and are looking to build your skills. I took it to be able to apply math concepts to Econ, and I've found it very helpful. But, be willing to work hard and dedicate time to studying! The concepts are hard, so you'll get out what you put into the class.",
    "Yes, even though it was very time consuming, I enjoyed the material and the way in which the class was taught.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn integral calculus or needs it for the discipline that they're studying. I would note though that this course is partly a flipped course (i.e. we were supposed to watch videos and do content exploration before class) and that this course moves extremely fast during the summer, so students should take that into consideration.",
    "If you need Calculus, this is it.",
    "Definitely, as it really get into the depths of calculus by answering the \"big questions\".",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it offers a great deal of calculus-related knowledge that is very useful, however I would suggest that the student take it during the regular academic year where they can spend a longer amount of time on the course since it is a lot of information to take in. The pace of the summer course was a little fast and it made it difficult to deeply comprehend a concept before we quickly moved onto the next one, which can be stressful along with the pressure of exams every 1-2 weeks.",
    "No. I would recommend students take the class during the academic year, because they will have more time to master the information."
