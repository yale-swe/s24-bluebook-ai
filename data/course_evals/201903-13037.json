   "comments": [
    "I became a better writer, thinker, and speaker from our weekly sections. I immensely enjoyed the intellectual stimulation I received in class from discussions on readings and discussions with my peers. The feedback I received from Professor Saraceni helped me become a better writer and also understand the strengths of my own writing.",
    "I learned how to read essays for craft and how to implement those techniques in my own writing. I also learned how to get used to produce more writing and how to workshop and revise essays.",
    "Learnt how to read essays for craft - a skill that will continue to hone my writing beyond this course. Learnt how to write various styles of creative non-fiction and engage with the genre through topics both personal, political and general.",
    "This course is amazing. It helped me improve my writing techniques and make the process much more efficient, and just made me a much better writer overall",
    "I learned many writing skills through emulating the tactics of the authors we read in class.",
    "I learned how to read creative nonfiction for craft and to apply these observations to my own writing, as well general techniques and qualities of good writing, and how to identify areas for improvement in the works of others\/apply notes and edits to my own writing. I also learned how to put out high quality pieces at a relatively fast rate.",
    "My prose and writing style in general improved greatly through this course  for the first time, I began to really focus on how my writing sounded, not just how succinct or coherent my point was. Additionally, I learned a lot about the different structures and aspects of a modern essay, and how to incorporate such ideas into my own work.",
    "I greatly improved my writing and editing skills. I learned the different elements of writing a personal essay."

   "question_id": "YC403-YCWR",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses are that there are large differentials in writing levels at the college level as some students have a lot of experience writing while others less so, which can make differences in writing level very apparent. Perhaps, this class should have certain prerequisites because I don't think I was writing at this level.",
    "The strength of this course is that the workload is totally manageable and all of the readings are actually fun and super enjoyable. It never feels like you have busy work or tedious assignments. The course is very intentional in helping you refine your writing skills.",
    "The course was well-structured to cover 5 styles of creative non-fiction, reading about 5-8 essays for each. I thought the pace was good as it meant I was writing an essay every two weeks and revising it in between so there was a good momentum and I never felt too much pressure by midterms\/finals season. The texts chosen to read were fantastic and each made huge impressions on me. The small class size and roundtable discussions were helpful for facilitating conversations about the essays as well as feedback during workshop sessions. Workshops were incredibly useful for refining my essays but also for learning how to give constructive criticism and read essays with a critical eye.",
    "I loved the workshops, getting valuable feedback from my peers and Professor Saraceni was immensely useful and the atmosphere was always really friendly and supportive. Also loved the structure of the course and the selection of readings, looked forward to them every week",
    "Strengths of the course are the level of engagement and the coverage of different writing topics. Weaknesses are the speed at which we cover each text.",
    "This course's strengths include all the interesting readings and engaging discussions. Professor Saraceni does a wonderful job of introducing how to read for craft, and I believe I am a much better writer because I took this course. One weakness is that towards the end of the semester the discussion format felt a little repetitive.",
    "A main strength of this course is that the format of reading --> first draft --> comments\/workshop --> final draft truly enforces that the goal of the course, beyond just to produce your own writing, is to utilize all these different sources (selected authors, instructor feedback, classmate feedback) to improve your writing. A weakness in some ways is the quick turnover rate; I always feel like I would like more time to work on each piece. At the same time, I think that this builds up the important ability to produce work quickly.",
    "I think the strengths of the course are its small size, excellent instructor, and general structure  I specifically liked the frequency of the writings and the workshops. The weaknesses are only that at times it moves a little quickly and the readings do not line up necessarily with what we are working on.",
    "Strengths: \r\n- I really enjoyed coming to class. \r\n- We read some amazing essays. \r\n- It was a great experience to workshop essays and receive lots of feedback. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Sometimes it felt like we were only praising authors, and I would have appreciated more critical analysis."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if they have exemplary background in writing or aren't afraid to be exposed to much better writers.",
    "YES!! Take this class. I was nervous to take it as I am not an english\/humanities student. But I ended up taking it to fulfill my WR requirement (after a push from a friend who had taken it) and am SO glad I did.",
    "Yes! This course was instrumental in reigniting my love for writing and it teaches writing in a very natural way (learning from what we read). It is also a good creative balance to more academic classes with research papers (although we did briefly cover how to do research while writing a cultural criticism) and exams, and in many ways allows for more advanced writing since you can focus solely on craft.",
    "Take this course if you can!! Especially with Professor Saraceni. You will have fascinating in-class discussions, receive really useful feedback and identify specific weaknesses, and overall become a better writer - it's a really rewarding experience and you will not regret it.",
    "Yes. Professor Saraceni is a great professor who keeps the classroom's momentum going.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially English 120 with Professor Saraceni! The readings were incredibly interesting, and my writing skills improved significantly.",
    "I think that everyone at Yale should take this course. Everyone here is going to be writing, and this gives you the skills to express your ideas about several different types of subjects through various modes, and beyond that teaches you how to improve your writing, a skill that is truly invaluable.",
    "I would! If one is looking for a class that is more creative and prose based than ENG 114, this is certainly an excellent option.",
    "Yes! This is a great course to take if you are interested in personal essays. You do have to write a lot over the course of the semester, but you receive lots of feedback and it is a very enjoyable course."
