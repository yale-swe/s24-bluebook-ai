But more importantly, I learned about how they are all connected. I also improved my writing skills (for writing a philosophical paper) and how to be a better discusser.",
                "The most valuable skill gained from this class is how to write a philosophy paper. Being that essay writing of that style is something that is rarely taught in high school, I'm glad to have taken the class and gotten that background knowledge before being plunged into other classes where the expectation is that you already understand the expectations for writing philosophically.",

The one weakness Id say was if we had a 5 min break in the middle of class I think engagement would go way up. The class is very taxing because we have to think so hard and Id get burnt out  halfway through and not be able to engage as much at the end. A short break could fix this!",
                "The course is very discussion based which I quite enjoyed. I wish we could have had more small writing prompts to help us improve our ability to present and argument and defend it with premises and examples.",
                "At points, it felt as though some of the readings were too complex for their own good to a point that they hindered the discussions that we were able to have about them. Professor Laurie Paul was a definite strength of the class. If nothing else, her energy and knowledge about the subject was enough to keep us engaged on a daily basis, and she did aid in guiding us through any misunderstanding.",
                "A strength of this course is how flexible the curriculum was. We spent as much time as needed to discuss topics that were difficult or that particularly interested the class. However as a result, we did not cover everything that was originally on the syllabus.",

                "Yes I would definitely recommend this class to other students. If you are interested in philosophy and to learn about the effect of human experiences, and are looking for a class to challenge you and help you strengthen your writing and discussion skills, then this is the perfect class for you.",
                "I would recommend this course for two main reasons: one, so they could gain the skills that I listed in box 1, and two, so they could experience having Laurie Paul as a professor.",
