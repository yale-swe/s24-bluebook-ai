   "comments": [
    "developed an understanding of how to critically analyze historical and political texts both analytically and within their historical contexts, compare\/contrast texts from this and last semester, actively engage with and argue for\/against proposed ideas in class, gained new insight on how personal worldviews shape how the reader interprets the text",
    "I learned so much about generations of political thought, I learned how to think in a more concise and accurate way, became a better writer, especially in regards to political theory, and learned a lot from my classmates. I think this class was very dynamic in many ways - the reading, discussions, papers and exam at least, so accordingly it's really hard to sum up everything I gained from it. But I'm sure it influenced the way I'll think about politics for a long time in an important, impactful way. The way we were able to compare authors and their ideas, in essays but even more so in studying for the final and taking it, was incredible. It's so rewarding to be able to connect Arendt with Machiavelli, etc.",
    "Development of historical\/political thought post-Machiavelli, modern development of governance, social contract, revolution, religion, etc.\r\nEssay\/analytical writing, enjoyed section discussions",
    "Analytical reading, precise argumentation and writing",
    "I developed analytic skills as we examined thoughts by different political thinkers, and learned to put them into historical contexts. I also developed a better understanding of important concepts such as democracy and social contract, and learned to think about them critically.",
    "This was a very rewarding course. Its a really interesting opportunity to confront political philosophy in a ton of different styles. It teaches you a really interesting mind of mental elasticity.",
    "This course gives you a tremendous introduction to political philosophy. Now I have nuanced, clear pictures of each thinkers work. By writing essays, I improved my ability to retain nuance in my comparisons. This course also has so many excellent readings that learning how to do close reading was a challenge.",
    "Foundation of American politics, differing conceptions of the sovereign, state of human nature, morality and the law, freedom and the law, equality vs freedom, what is democracy? \r\nI was able to challenge my own blanket view of democracy (what we have currently) and look at the origins of representative government. By reading Nietzsche, Hobbes, etc., I was able to more thoroughly develop my own political views by challenging and arguing against views that I disagree with it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: covers a great array of texts from a variety of genres and backgrounds, the pacing is great as far as being able to keep up with readings, the selected passages were fun\/interesting to read \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: n\/a",
    "A general comment for DS: this course would have greatly benefitted from re-working the syllabus. Al-Farabi in the first semester was almost completely unnecessary. By eliminating him and moving Machiavelli to the first semester, we could have gained a week to read Luther, Adam Smith, or Freud. The readings in this course covered a lot of ground, but could have been much more manageable for students by trimming 10-15 minutes a reading.",
    "There were truly few weaknesses. I think too much reading was assigned, but many students chose not to do all of it. For the few of us who committed to doing all the DS reading this year it was a lot. The discussions in this class were the best of my year in DS which I really appreciated. Professor Herdt was great, letting us lead the way but helping out when we needed it. I could go on and on - it was a great class.",
    "Overall, very engaging course, would definitely recommend to those interested in political philosophy.",
    "Too much reading at times, could focus more on protestant reformation, really well connected course work",
    "I felt that the course was overall very strong, although I have some suggestions for how the syllabus might be reworked. I, as well as many of my peers, felt that Nietzsche would be better suited for philosophy. I also felt that it would be very insightful to read James Baldwin's political writings in H\/P. I thought that the course could be improved by stronger direction towards a particular discussion, though I felt that the Canvas discussions were helpful in class.",
    "This course covers a wide range of thinkers across history and has a good sense of continuity within the course itself. It could have been better by having stronger connections to thinkers that weve read in the fall semester, perhaps by providing more historical context on the historical\/political development in europe during the middle ages and the Reformation.",
    "The course is good although some texts are challenging. It would be nice to be given a bit more of a break down of each work.",
    "Amazing selection of thinkers who built on, contrasted, and paralleled each other. The readings were rarely overwhelming.",
    "The strength of the class is that it is very much based on student engagement and discussion. That being said, I thought sometimes it was difficult to insert opinions into the conversation that were not shared by the majority. I also thought sometimes certain thoughts were not given full consideration because they did not fit with the scheduled plan for the discussion."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course as an intro course to political and social theory in the core of the Western canon (essentially I would recommend this course knowing how fast-paced the program is which limits the number of authors and the depth of the course); for DS it's perfect",
    "Yes, absolutely! Anyone who is interested in history and\/or politics, and disciplined enough to do a lot of reading and be engaged for 1:15 in seminars, I think this would be a great experience.",
    "Yes!",
    "yes- great basis for political philosophy",
    "Yes. This course provides a good foundation in western political thoughts. Its syllabus is broad-based, but we were able to examine some concepts in detail during discussions and essay writing.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Its a really interesting class and the discussion format is a great way to handle the texts.",
    "Totally. Amazing survey of political philosophy that is ready made for great discussion and help from star faculty. A must for any social sciences or humanities major.",
    "Yes I would because it is important to understand the history of political theory to understand the modern day."
