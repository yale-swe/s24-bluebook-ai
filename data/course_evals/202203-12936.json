                "Professor Burger's lectures are full of interesting and in-depth information, but can get a little dull at times. It would have been helpful if there was more written information provided during the lectures, as sometimes all of the locations, people, and timelines were hard to follow and organize from verbal information alone.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were excellent. Professor Burger's expertise and experience clearly shone through the lectures and their level of detail, both in terms of key principles of thinking like an archaeologist and in terms of the actual subject matter. He seems to have had a hand in nearly everything in Andean archaeology or at least knows other people who had a larger hand in any topic very well. I would recommend the class to anyone for this reason; we often hear about Yale professors teaching lectures in part from personal research expertise, but I haven't experienced it anywhere else to the same extent as in this class in terms of how much it impacted the overall/day-to-day content of the course. Usually, it's excursions into topics of interest/topics of research for a class or two; here, it felt like the experience shone through nearly every lecture in some way.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading felt a bit opaque at times, especially considering the small number of graded assignments. The exercises/map quiz (15% total, each out of 10 points) were graded fairly, but it wasn't ever really clear what level of detail or specificity we needed for them, and almost the entirety of the grade was determined by a midterm worth 35% of the grade and a final/final paper worth 50%. It was very good for keeping the workload manageable with the rest of my schedule, but it would also be best if we got a bit more guidance.",
                "The course is interesting but a little difficult to follow.  Short assignments spread evenly throughout the semester would have been helpful and more pictures during lectures.",
                "It would be much more helpful and instructive if the class slides had more textual information included, rather than just names of sites and pictures of artifacts and sites. Additionally, those slides should be uploaded to Canvas so that students can review when studying for the midterm and final exams.",
                "Strength: interesting topics discussed in class\r\n\r\nCould improve: allowing material used in class (powerpoints) to be available for students to help in preparing for exams."

                "Absolutely recommend! Professor Burger's class is a hidden gem. His experience and connections in the field are fascinating to hear about, as is of course the actual subject matter. The workload is very, very manageable, with only a few small exercises and assessments throughout the whole semester. And this class qualifies you for the Albers Grant, which Burger loves to remind us about! I should note that you should not go into this class expecting extensive coverage on the Inca Empire; Burger really wanted to emphasize pre-Inca civilizations.",
                "Yes",
                "No, only if youre very interested in the subject matter.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the history of Peru and other South American countries, as well as the artistic and architectural history of the ancient Andes.",
                "Strongly recommend to anyone interested in the subject matter!",
                "I learned a lot, was inspired to do a lot of additional research, and I enjoyed the exams as well as the readings addressing the paleoclimate and geography of the Central Andes. However, this class is oriented towards a Western audience, and the reactions of other students to sacred archeological materials and depictions of rituals made me feel a bit out of place.",
                "Yes. It's a very interesting class with a lot of connect that is difficult to find on the internet.",
                "Depends upon the student's interest in archaeology and in this specific region of the world.",
                "Yes, because it's a good introductory course in the department of anthropology for students outside of the major."
