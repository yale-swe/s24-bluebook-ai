                "I learned to think about the body as a site of knowledge production and enactment, the liberatory potential of dancing/moving/doing queerly, combining my interests in ethnic studies, queer theory and performance studies! I loved our final assignment, called \"embodied book club,\" where we had to pick a book, read it, and design a 15min exercise (not an oral presentation, but an embodied activity) to teach a concept in the book to the class. I've been making \"performance scores\" for other classes ever since, I think it's so cool and counters the Yale/Western academy idea that only verbal knowledge is valid.",
                "There was a higher exposure to queer theory with particular focus on the experiences of Caribbean people and intersectionality of Caribbean identity. In this class healthy academic debate seamlessly woven into regular class activity and by the end of the course we also had exposure to performance scores and we were able to create them and perform them.",

                "Strengths: fascinating readings, Prof. Reid is excellent at condensing and explaining the key themes of a text. Weaknesses: probably class size -- especially with the Embodied Book Club presentations, I think having more time to discuss our books would've been very helpful.",
                "The classroom was a very safe space to discuss many different topics under the umbrella of queerness and the the Caribbean. I really loved learning from Professor Reid and I felt as if each week I was learning something new. It may have been helpful to talk about our definitions of queerness earlier on in the semester instead of saving it for the end too!",
                "I loved this course so much. The readings were amazing, Professor Reid is so INCREDIBLY brilliant and kind and an amazing discussion leader, and I genuinely loved the assignments (and the pacing of theminstead of a traditional midterm paper and final structure, we had more lengthy weekly assignments that invited us deeply into the material, and one larger project). \r\nOne thing was that we didn't all share some of the history and background for different dance forms/geographic locations (that was essential to grasping and working with the theory we focused on). More intentional lecturing/support developing that foundational knowledge as we studied theory would have been helpful.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that it allows for a lot of student autonomy. Students help lead discussions and direct topics with their questions and understandings of the text. One of the weaknesses of the class  is because it is so dependent on student participation when the students don't have much to say the class can drag a lot.",
                "Weekly mixtape assignments are the greatest idea of all time, syllabus readings are always fun and interesting, lots of opportunity for student-led and student-collaborative discussion and learning, absolutely wonderful, fun and respectful class environment, and as someone very much not from a dance/movement background I still found the embodied explorations and embodied book club assignments really enjoyable and insightful!"

                "Yes! Highly recommend to any student looking to deepen their learning of performance beyond the white Eurocentric canon, or just generally have an awesome time studying performance culture from an area that doesn't get enough attention."
