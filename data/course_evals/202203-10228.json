                "The senior essay was an opportunity to test out the literary and writing skills I'd developed over the last four years on a topic that I truly cared about. While the advice I got was not necessarily pragmatic or specific to the sentences, arguments etc. that I was writing, my advisors were incredibly supportive from a scholarly and psychological perspective. They assured me when I was struggling and offered me many sources to delve into, but the skills/knowledge/insight that I gained was largely because of (and proportional to) my own research and risk-taking.",

                "The element of community was very strong in this course, owed greatly to the efforts by the department to connect individual students with other essay writers.",
                "It's an incredible opportunity, and a great culmination of the English major. I wish some things were a little more standardized in terms of writing style, formatting, etc. Also, I think it was a little bit unclear what the weekly meetings were for, and how mandatory they were. Other than that, it was incredible, and the professors (Profs Mukhopadyay and Conroy) were wonderful advisors and very kind. Also, the deadline structure was very helpful and made it so I wasn't rushing at all towards the end.",
                "I think the original readings of \"how to write an essay\" at the beginning of the year were completely unhelpful, however, the workshopping process was exceedingly helpful.",
                "Strengths: The monthly deadlines for this class are helpful to keep me on track (especially having a rough draft due a month before the final essay is due). The flexibility of being able to choose when to meet with my advisor is also very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The mandatory weekly class could sometimes feel a bit tedious. The weekly class also didn't really help with building a sense of community between senior essay students. I think in the future, it could help to organize one or two social events for senior essay writers (ie taking all of them out to a dinner or running a study break with food!).",
                "I didn't find the class sessions to be all that helpful in their content. We largely reiterated commonly understood writing advice and read previous senior essays which I found more or less compelling/useful in their styles. I would have liked to work more directly with my peers, who unfortunately were rarely in class and therefore left the sessions somewhat empty and reluctant. More occasions of pairing up and--though this is logistically difficult--keeping the class size larger would help me get a better understanding of other people's projects and help sympathize where each of us are at any given stage of writing.",
                "The deadlines are EARLY and that's a good thing, in my opinion. I think having a second mandatory check-in with Peter would've been good."

                "Yes, but I recommend starting in the summer since the timeline is very squeezed. Perhaps the default duration of the senior essay should be two terms instead of one term!",
                "Yes! Satisfying and a unique opportunity to write an essay about something you really care about.",
                "I would. I think it's an excellent culmination of my work in the major.",
                "YES! Absolutely. I was originally hesitant to write a senior essay due to the high workload, but it ended up being the best English experience I have had at Yale. Working one-on-one with an advisor was a truly unique opportunity to rapidly improve my writing. I learned so much through writing this essay that has transformed the way I think about writing papers for English (and other) classes. There is no other English class at Yale where you can focus on the same paper for a whole semester and receive WEEKLY feedback on your writing. It's the best writing class! \r\n\r\nUltimately, I think what makes this course work well is when you write about a topic that you are genuinely interested in and when you have an advisor that you work really well with. So overall, I would really recommend this class with the caveat that you should choose a topic and advisor carefully because both will be what shape your essay experience!",
                "The department warns you not to write a senior essay unless you're absolutely sure you can meet the deadlines. While true, I'd add an addendum that if you're like me and have personal/psychological/health problems that often interrupt your ability to get things in on time or work consistently, it's still definitely possible and fulfilling to do the senior essay; you just have to put in extra time before the semester begins to plan, research/annotated bib, and get some pages in before the deadlines start rolling in. The class is much more manageable if you've already gotten a handle on how much work you can put in a day/week and then adjust your expectations accordingly.\r\nThat said, if you have something you're passionate about learning and writing about, go for it. This was the most rewarding academic experience I've had at Yale and I happily borrowed time from other classes to complete the project.",
                "Yes, the senior essay was a very rewarding experience. I would recommend it, especially if you have a particular subject of interest you want to explore.",
                "I mean, if you're writing the Senior Essay, you're taking it. That being said, you don't exactly have to show up. It doesn't affect the grade you will receive on your essay (I hope). When I got out of bed in time, I did genuinely enjoy being there.\r\nAnd if you're considering whether or not to write a Senior Essay, well, that's a thorny question. Make sure you actually want to write such a long paper. I found it fulfilling, and it will be useful if I apply to grad school. It's a whole lot of stress and headache, but it gives you something you can really be proud of."
