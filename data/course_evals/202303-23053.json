The professor is knowledgeable and very engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: this course is in more of a lecture style than a seminar, which can get somewhat disengaging at times. The professor did try to get engagement from students in the form of questions, but I think a few discussions might also be fun and help students stay 100% engaged with the material."
