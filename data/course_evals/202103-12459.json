                "Critical reading, drawing connections between texts, public speaking, analyzing historical documents (and the absence thereof)",
                "I have developed and learned so many new skills, knowledges, and insights by taking this course. Firstly, I learned how to really get at the heart of large texts and find what they're really trying to say. I can fully parse through a text and say \"This is important, this is what the author is trying to drive home.\" and I can also say \"This is cool, but it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of the author's goals and motivations.\" I've learned the importance of historically situating a piece of literature or an archive while analyzing and examining it so I can piece together all of the moving parts, some of which I can't directly find in the pages. I learned how to analyze a primary source and quickly get at what the goals of this source are, what about this source complicates preexisting literature, and what about this source is relevant to the questions I want to answer. I wrote my first ever historiography in this course, and learning that skill was so intellectually stimulating and while writing this paper, I truly found my voice as a writer and stood confident in how I carried the reader through my argument as a writer. All of these skills beautifully and eloquently culminated into my final project and essay, where I learned how to transpose the histories and handlings of histories from one moment of time onto another moment of time to trace out discontinuities and continuities and figure out what that means when it comes to the questions I want to answer through my project or essay.",
                "I learned an incredible amount about the history of abolition. I learned about the ways in which abolitionist reasoning and practice and theory has evolved over time, from the institution of enslavement in the United States to the present forms of enslavement happening in prisons and other carceral spaces. This being said, we also talked about the legacies of enslavement and if it makes sense to categorize incarceration as enslavement in the first place. This class gave me so much to think about, so much to chew on, and I'm delighting in doing so even in this review. It's a really wonderful class that really makes you think about what history means, what history tells us, what history *can't* tell us, and how we can continue forward. I learned so so much. Really. Wow.",
                "Micah's detailed feedback on all written assignments and the writing workshops we did in class strengthened my writing. The readings on the syllabus were excellent, and Micah incorporated a wide variety of scholarship. This variety was really helpful in encouraging us to think in a multitude of ways about the same topic or history. I particularly appreciated the queer studies and disability studies readings (especially Decarcerating Disability) -- I've studied the history that this class focused on many times in many classes, but the way prisons were framed in this class felt very new to me. As a result, the readings really pushed my thinking not only in this class, but in my other courses and in my thesis as well.",
                "In taking this course, I gained a more intricate understanding of what abolition is through the study of its historical complexities and intricacies. Throughout our 13 weeks in class, we studied the history of abolition through a series of writings. Each week the reading responses helped shape me into a more concise writer, as I had to synthesize my thoughts in 500 words or less. Additionally, by studying abolition in a chronological, cumulative manner I became better at analyzing concepts both on a macro and micro scale. Overall, while this course focused on American abolition, my experience in the class has shown me how broad a concept abolition is and has thus shifted my perspective toward a more global lens.",
                "I learned many critical analyses skills throughout my weekly reading responses and through close reading assignments. I also wrote my first historiography at Yale. We bridged a lot of what I knew from other classes about the Civil War and Reconstruction with contemporary abolitionist ideology and drew through lines between abolitionist frameworks over time. I felt like I gained a better understanding of how abolitionism is grounded in history and how to read and write about abolitionist theory.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of slavery and racial constructions/relations in the US, and how they feed into current-day anti-racist struggles and movements. I learned about the Abolitionist movement, its historical and contemporary manifestations, and its intersections with other struggles like feminist and queer struggles, disability justice, etc. The course provided a strong analysis of the differences and continuities between the concerns and goals of the abolitionist movement under slavery and outside of it. I feel like I have a much better grasp of US history of racial relations and racial justice movements. I learned the importance of locating the discourse of struggle and movement-building within historical and geographic specificity. I also learned how to read and write better through exercises and generous feedback provided by the instructor. I learned how to make an argument, conduct original analysis primary sources, write a historiography, and engage in active discourse with my peers.",
                "I learned so much in this course, which blended Black feminist theory, carceral geography, queer studies, history, and more in its compelling narrative tracking abolition from slavery to the modern day. I learned about fugitive resistance, the gendered nature of our carceral system, the matrix of violence and the criminalization of survival, the nuances of fugitive slave narratives, 1970s antiprison organizing, and (maybe most importantly), how to connect individual actions of resistance by enslaved people and incarcerated people to larger abolitionist movements. I also learned a lot about analytical writing in this field."

            "comments": [
                "The seminar style was really lovely -- I enjoyed being able to hear and learn from my peers and their personal experiences. Micah created an environment that felt genuinely safe, welcoming, and supportive, and I felt much more comfortable contributing to class discussions than I ever have previously. \r\nThere was a quite substantial workload, which is not a weakness but was something I don't think I was fully prepared for prior to enrolling in the class.",
                "Everything about this course is an absolute strength. Readings were selected carefully and creatively and they really challenged us to look for what things tie (or don't tie) multiple sources together. The course format was also a great strength. We started off the class each week with one student giving an oral presentation on the readings and someone else responding to the presentation, and the ideas brought about from the presenting and responding is what would lead in to our discussion on the readings. We also took class time to talk about what was supposed to go in papers, which was really helpful as someone who never was assigned a primary source analysis that couldn't be over 2 pages or who didn't know what a historiography was. At the end of class every week, we would write in groups a definition of the word \"abolition,\" and as the weeks went on, this practice became more and more formative especially at the end when during the last class, all of us had to come up with a collective definition for the word. We couldn't come to a concrete, finished definition ... but that was the whole point, and although that was frustrating at the end of class it was also such a powerful and formative way to send us off at the end of our last class. Everything about this class was truly a strength.",
                "This class was all strengths. The history we investigated in this class was unlike any other class I've ever taken. The history was so much that I just didn't know, we learned about Reconstruction, about prison riots, about what it means to call for abolition and then put that into practice. Focusing on the experiences of Black women throughout the seminar is something I will NEVER forgetthis class and the syllabus and ESPECIALLY Prof. Micah Khater really went out of their way to make this class interrogate the ways in which history is taught. As in, this class utilized sources that didn't just focus on history we just easily know or take at face value: this class engaged scholars that are doing the hard work of finding the pieces of history that have been ignored and bringing them to the fore.\r\nAlso, the class asked us to think about our own relationships to abolition and how we can be a part of the continuing fight for abolition, including understanding what abolition is and how it evolves over time. This class made me both hopeful and apprehensive but mostly hopeful. I'm a hug fan.",
                "The strengths were many. I think the classroom environment was the best of any course I've taken at Yale. I appreciated the diversity of perspectives and backgrounds of the other students; the community of the class I think will last even though the semester is over. Micah was very intentional and vocal about creating a space where students felt comfortable and valued, and the discussions were deeply generative as a result. I'm sometimes in classes where I feel like most of my learning is done through the readings; in this class, I was excited to come to class every week and left class every week feeling that I had really benefited from the discussion.\r\n\r\nI know some students didn't love the respondent role, and Micah was really open to that feedback. We voted on how to adjust the role partway through the semester so that we benefitted more from it. I actually preferred the original format of the respondent role, and I think as a class we might have gotten more out of it if we had a little crash course or example presentation/response on the first or second day of class. Overall, though, I think beginning each class by hearing from other students was an innovative way to center student voices in the classroom. I got a lot out of those roles each week.",
                "The entire course syllabus contained an array of compelling, thought-provoking readings. With these titles being so carefully selected, our class discussions were always insightful with a high level of engagement. Additionally, I appreciated that our writing assignments built off of each other for the final essay. This cumulative approach worked well for myself because it made the process of writing a lot less daunting and thus enabled me to write a better final product. I think the reading responses work well in their own right, but in the future it might be worthwhile to instead implement an online discussion section. By being able to see and bounce off of everybody's ideas, I find that these types of platforms facilitate more discussion and debate.",
                "This class didnt have many weaknesses. It was well organized, assignments were well thought out, relevant to the course and our learning, and we received a lot of detailed feedback on each of them. In class discussions and activities were also incredibly thoughtful.",
                "Strengths: I think the professor - Micah Khater - is phenomenal and she put so much of her time and energy into the course. The class periods themselves seemed to fly by as every day she came prepared with a plan to structure the time and keep discussions moving forward. The assignments were very clear and the readings engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I felt as though our discussions were so abstract and theoretical that it was hard to see the implications of them outside of just an academic setting.",
                "I really responded to the chronological sequence of the course structure - the way each week was guided by a different aspect or manifestation of the Abolitionist movement, and how there was a general linear progression in time over the weeks. I really responded to beginning and ending with fiction - it made me excited about a range of approaches and engagements and created a reading momentum at the outset which led into the weeks. The practice of writing definitions of abolition each week also served as a great way to end each class by reflecting and trying to gather the most important points. The course was really well thought out and Im not sure I have many suggestions for improvements! It might have been nice to address early 20th century a bit more to close the gap between the two legs of the course but I understand time constraints and am not sure how that would have bene possible.",

I would recommend this course to any and every student.",

I learned so much, I think that this class is essential for anyone considering racial justice work or even understanding racial justice better (which should be everyone). It is not easy because the material is upsetting and difficult and sometimes dense, because that is the history we're dealing with. It's a class that really makes you think, you discover so much about what history is and how it is created, it's a class that I will take forward in my arsenal of ideas about the world. Absolutely take this class if you ever can.",

                "Yes absolutely! A very historically grounded yet super contemporarily relevant class with a wonderful professor.",
                "Yes! The entire content of the course is extremely interesting. \r\n\r\nWhen thinking about abolition today, the entire idea is often wrapped up in the abolition of prisons. However, by taking this course you learn about the historical foundations of our current abolitionist movement. Through this chronological study, you are simultaneously introduced to fresh perspectives on abolition that you might not have considered fitting into an abolitionist praxis before. \r\n\r\nThe reading load is definitely significant but Micah is quite accommodating and, if the workload seems unmanageable, she often amends assignments to fit the needs of her students. While the 20 page paper might seem daunting, the course is set up so that you can work on this paper cumulatively, making the process of writing a lot smoother. \r\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend taking this course to anyone who wants to learn more about abolition.",
                "Absolutely! If you are even a little curious about abolition you should 100% take this class.  It is hands down the best class Ive taken at Yale. Micah is the most thoughtful and detail oriented professor Ive had. She provides great feedback and is so invested in our learning and growth. The class discussions and other activities we did reflect this investment! Due to both the structure and content of this class, every week was incredibly engaging, and all built toward the final project.",
                "Yes definitely take this course if you want a challenge and are interested in learning about abolitionist frameworks from slavery to mass incarceration. It is sometimes quite high level and confusing but overall the professor is great and the readings interesting!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to others - Professor Khaters teaching methodology is very effective. Not only is the knowledge gained super important (I think its important for everyone to study US history through the lens of anti-racist struggles, and in a way this course also provides a legacy of a historically successful resistance movement that is important to learn from), the course is also challenging in terms of grappling with really difficult and important questions about race in the US. It provides a language to talk about race. It also has a strong emphasis on writing which I find very useful.",
                "YES! The best course I've taken at Yale. I learned so much about abolition and I feel like this was a rare course that centered the real, embodied experience of incarceration and slavery rather than the theoretical. This course changed the way I will approach history for the rest of my life."
