The course also helped me learn how to use technological tools (e.g. QGIS) to aid in the study of spatial economics.",
                "I learned about a new frontier of economics: how does the topography of space affect the economic activity of consumers and producers? At a high level, there were three baseline models that helped capture the mathematical representation of space in relation to economics: the monocentric city, Rosen-Roback, and Armington models. The first half of the semester is extremely focused on the math behind these models. During the second half, we started to use the models a little bit to understand how improvement in transportation affects social welfare, congestion and ways to reduce it, the importance of urban planning for urbanization, social inequality, and climate change.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: exposure to frontier research by one of its pioneers\r\nWeaknesses: not always clear how these models would be useful to us, unless we plan to go into spatial economics ourselves.  Also, a lot of the substantive, math-y course content came in the first six lectures, and had we spent more time going through the models and what each variable\/equation means in the first few days, it would have made learning easier for the rest of the semester",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material that the professor himself has done a lot of novel work in; psets and tests are reasonable.\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
                "This course is well-designed, the lectures are interesting, good feedback is given, and its grading has a good split between participation, homework, and exams. Furthermore, the course teaches a lot with a relatively small workload. The main weakness is that rote memorization does at times play a role on exams; students are expected to know the equations for almost all models and while students are sometimes reminded of model setups on exams, this isn't guaranteed. I believe that giving students a formula sheet, or even just a half page of notes, would help students focus more on the course's content and takeaways and less on rote memorization. Additionally, having access to a practice final and solutions for the practice midterm and final would help students better prepare for exams. Regardless, these are relatively minor nitpicks and apply to many courses, not just this; overall, this course is an excellent example of how interesting lectures combined with targeted learning objectives on homework assignments can create an excellent learning experience without problem sets taking several hours each week.",
                "I think the slides are ok but could be improved so that the important content is more emphasized. Right now, everything has the same level of importance and it is sometimes hard to follow the train of thought. Ryungha, the TF, was also amazing at explaining the content and answering questions during discussion sections.\r\n\r\nThe math needs to be explained from the beginning to the end. It might be even better to just ditch the PowerPoint and hand-write it on the chalkboard once we start discussing the math behind the models. Even after studying everything for the final exam, I don't understand a lot of the deep underlying foundations. The math is a black box since it doesn't really follow any logic, but is very circular.",
                "The spatial model content can be more spread out",
                "The strength of this class is that Professor Costas is very kind and really cares about the students. There are few psets and they are really doable particularly if going to office hours or getting help from the TA. The weakness is that it was at 9am and there was a lot of material that was covered in the class. Perhaps some interactive activities like working together in a Group one class to use GIS and do some sort of race to find shortest distance or something like that would make the class slightly more interactive.",
                "I think that the class is generally well taught and the material builds well over the course of the class so that everything feels interconnected. The subject material is genuinely interesting as well."

                "Pretty hard exams, lots of material and algebra to be memorized.",
                "I would say only take this course if you're coming in with an interest in urban or trade economics. Without that prior interest, the model can get a little dry.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning more about the role of space in economics. Also if you're interested in more theoretical economics, since the course is mainly theory-driven",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, particularly students who have the appropriate background (multivariate calculus) and are looking for a \"lighter\" upper-level economics course. This course provides interesting insight into topics many students, including economics students, hadn't considered, without adding too much to a student's weekly workload.",
                "NO!! Don't take it!! This course made me actively angry every time I had to spend time on it. It is not clear what we are supposed to take from each lecture, and when we do the math, it is done so poorly. Objectively speaking, the math in the course is not hard (it's just derivatives and algebra), but if you want intuition behind the equation, forget it. Every time we create a model, there is a random set of (small) algebraic equations that are necessary for the model to work. For example, welfare equals consumption times prices (W=CP). Yes, this makes intuitive sense. But the definition of welfare could also be productivity times labor (W=AL) or wage over price index (W=w\/P) or consumption times utility (W=Cu). Even if we assume we know which relationship we need for a specific model, the way that these models are solved is so circular. Yes, the algebra works, but unless you know which random relationship or ratio or other equation you need, it becomes impossible to just randomly check and manipulate equations. Furthermore, assuming that you do manage to solve the equation, there is no real application or understanding of the model. The midterm and final are basically rote memorization to rederive models from lecture slides (since the models are impossible to actually come up with on the spot). Overall, this class gets too stuck on the math and the math is complete mumbo jumbo randomness--the complete opposite of what math should be (elegant and logical). The only saving grace is that Ryungha, the TF, was able to explain some of the concepts and was super helpful on problem sets.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes I would if you are okay and interested with the material\/content. Interest certainly matters in the course as if you dont find it interesting then you may have a hard time following along.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to another student. It has interesting applications to the real world, and has a very manageable workload while still allowing you to learn a lot. Although the course is lecture style, the class is small enough and Professor Arkolakis makes an effort to know his students. I like that there was a mathematical foundation as well to a lot of the work.",
                "This course is one of the easiest Econ electives and probably the easiest CS+Econ intersection course. The material isn't particularly complex, and there are only 3 problem sets. The exams are also reasonable. Overall, I'd say this class is a good choice if you're looking for something easy. However, I don't know how applicable the material is, or if I'll ever use the knowledge I gained in the course. For example, the course primarily studies models that describe welfare, wages, labour allocations, and price indices across space. However, the model is mathematical so not too usable without the numbers available."
