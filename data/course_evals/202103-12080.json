                "Henk taught a very strong sense of design principles and creative processes. The class was much less focused on simple graphic designs, and instead focused on teaching strategic and creative approaches to good design.",
                "An amazing introduction on how to think like a designer. While the workload was pretty heavy, it was a nice break from the standard Pset or readings. It was nice to exercise a different part of my brain!",
                "The underlying principals behind modern-day graphic design, but not using computer technology like Photoshop, etc.",
                "Ive never taken a graphic design course before, so this was my first introduction to the actual methods behind graphic design. Ive found the courses subject material to be extremely useful in my own endeavors in graphic design, whether for personal use or to further my career.",
                "Great introduction to graphic design - emphasis on individual projects, which make up the course work, but Henk also does an amazing job of giving us historical examples and presentations that showed us a great portion of the graphic design world. Super interesting class! developed skills for  how to critic others work and language to talk about design."

                "The strength of this class is Henk and his commitment to strong design principles and strategy. Henk operates with--and brings out in his students--professional behavior immediately. Weakness is that in class time can get a bit boring--spending 2+ hours talking about everyones work or their half-fleshed out ideas. Maybe more variety could improve the class structure?",
                "The course is an excellent introduction to the principals of graphic design and the assignments are sequentially arranged so that your skills as a designer grow over the semester.",
                "The strength of the course comes from the way Henk has it set up. Every project taught me something different about graphic design. If there was any weakness to the course, it would just come from the fact that there isnt enough time to learn more.",
                "Henk is an amazing professor, he is incredibly kind and structured critiques in a way that make them super helpful and low stakes - they are not intimidating and the class environment is super fun. He has great insight for how to improve work and extend create your ideas. He also gives lots of time to develop and work on projects - while projects are a lot of work, they are stretched out over a few weeks, with much smaller deadlines in between."

                "Yes! It is a very fun class with some great lessons on thinking like a designer.",
                "Yes! This class is not a walk in the park - there are homework assignments due in almost every class - but if you want to learn about things like visual rhythm, balanced compositions, and communicating a message using visual forms, this is the class for you. It is NOT a photoshop class, which some students did not like. In my opinion, having to make collages and draw by hand allowed me to better understand graphic design, but know what you are walking into.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. You learn graphic design in a way that wouldnt be possible without the course and the professor.",
