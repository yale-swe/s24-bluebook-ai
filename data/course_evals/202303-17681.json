                "I think about objects and makers in a totally new way now. I know what museum objects FEEL like, how they were made, the motivations, contexts, amd implications of making, work, trade, and being human while interacting with objects. It's an especially interesting class to take in a modern world of plastics and mass production.",

                "Lots of knowledge on studying and identifying i objects",
                "Although I've taken art history courses before, I learned about the materials and processes of art that I had never considered to have such depth and relevance. The language of objects, the making of ceramic, wood, textile, and metal objects, as well as the interchange of objects (how they are trade and used) is absolutely fascinating after having taken this course.",
                "HSAR110 was an awesome course. I'm not an Art History major but you learn so much about decorative objects and art in general.",
                "Great class! Professor Cooke is extremely knowledgeable and was great at explaining every topic covered in class. I learned how to think about art in terms of its creation and technique.",
                "I learned about decorative arts with wooden, textile, base metal, and ceramic materials, and how different techniques and decorative elements were transmitted across the world in each case.",
                "- I developed skills in the analysis of objects and their cultural influences, functions, interchange etc \r\n- I developed my oral and written communication skills to analyze art \r\n- the lectures were very well complemented by the sections in the object study room of the YUAG",
                "Object art history",
                "How to look closely at objects to understand and appreciate their history; how to utilize the sense of touch; how to look at the world in terms of interconnected trade routes and how to view materials in terms of their intrinsic qualities and their global appeal. Material literacy and embodied knowledge of ceramics, textiles, base metals, and wood objects.",

Now, I have a better idea of the processes behind the creation of everyday objects and the trends of global circulation. The course did a wonderful job of discussing the influence of global objects. For example, I do not view artistic trends as copying others now. Instead, I can recognize that they are part of a broader global scheme of responding to markets and valued artistic traditions."

                "Section was super interesting and is the biggest strength of the course.",
                "I just thought that the second half of the course was much less defined than the first. It often felt redundant and surface level.",
                "Cooke is a great lecturer and really knows his stuff. Very kind professor, but felt bad that most of his students didn't bother to show up to lecture. He typically brings in his own objects for you to look at and touch at the end of lecture. Section is also amazing. Typically you go to the YAG and look at and touch objects pertinent to that week's lectures and readings. Workload is very manageable and never felt like busy work.",
                "Strengths: It is absolutely amazing to be able to go into the YUAG and handle these objects. Lecturers are pretty interesting, and grading is generally pretty lenient. Weaknesses: Very little information is stored in the lecture slides themselves so studying for exams becomes difficult without extremely thorough notes.",
                "I think I was good with object study, but sometimes taking notes was hard.",
                "The course had many strengths as it is very well organized, detailed information and examples at each lecture, with sections at the YUAG - extremely engaging is many ways, although can at times be overwhelming.",
                "I've never taken an art history course prior, but the professor and TA were amazing at explaining everything. Definitely loved being able to handle the physical objects during section!",
                "The strengths of this course are that it allows you in touch and interact with the material that you are learning about. I can tell the the professor is an expert and is passionate about this material, and the book that this course is based on is an excellent resource. The weaknesses of this course are I feel the expectations for the label assignments are a little vague, and maybe more direction with those would he useful. For example, if the professor or TFs would go over labels with us and explain what is good or bad about them.",
                "- strengths: Prof Cooke and TA Sarah Bochicchio!!! Seeing their passion and knowledge of the objects and their interesting interpretations throughout the semester was truly inspiring!!\r\n- another strength: the variety of objects and materials discussed as well as their cultural influences, functions, etc; I felt like there was a truly holistic analysis of the topic of the course\r\n- weakness: lectures felt a bit repetitive towards the end of the semester and the material covered before the midterm as well as the terms we had to learn for it were a lot, so the course could potentially be improved if the material before the midterm was spread out in more lectures",
                "Engaging classes and session",
                "Strengths: three-dimensional understanding of art and the world; new ways of engaging with the everyday objects around us; opportunities to physically interact with objects in the YUAG and to engage with the collections in the galleries. Weaknesses: long and redundant readings which sometimes duplicate lecture material.",
                "I love the use of weekly section in this course. Going to the Yale Art Gallery to discuss the concepts explored in class helped to reinforce my learning. I also felt that the lectures were engaging. The midterm and final were also helpful to celebrate the learning throughout the semester."

                "Yes, whether you are taking this just for a credit, or you actually want to get started in art history, this course was so fun and interesting.",
                "Would recommend this course to both an art student as well as those looking to learn more casually about art.",
                "I think this course gives a necessary background in global objects that art history majors especially but also everyone should know. Cooke is also legendary.",
                "YES, lovely course. Especially if you're a curious individual, looking at how objects are made and the influences in shape and design as trade routes grow is fascinating, but Cooke stops it from being overwhelming.",
                "Yes, but only if talking thematically about objects interests you. There's not a ton of history/lineage that's followed, but you learn a lot about the process of making and all of the fascinating nuances that come up in trade, museums, handling, and society.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially to fulfill a distributional requirement. You get a lot of interesting experiences with old artifacts and get to learn a lot about different types of decorative arts, with almost no workload or grade pressure.",
                "Yes definitely, it was very interesting.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course, be it to someone without an art history background or to those needing an HSAR 100 course for the major.",
                "Yes! I think this class is perfect as your 5th credit. Even if you have no idea about/never interacted with decorative art, you will definitely learn something. Professor Cooke and the TAs were super helpful. Highly recommend.",
                "I could not recommend this class enough!",
                "Yes I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in taking an art class that is approachable for non-art students. This was the first art class I've ever taken but I was still able to understand the content and be successful in the course.",
                "I would 100% recommend the course to another student!! I don't think there could be a better introduction to the history of art for both majors and non-majors!! The teaching team, Professor Cooke's extensive knowledge of the topic and passion for teaching it made this such a great course!!",
                "If you are looking for a relatively easy course with little weekly workload this is definitely an option. The class is at time interesting, although mostly boring, and you're not gonna learn much. Assignments are very easy, and take little time, but the exams are harder than they need to be, relative to the difficulty of the class, the engagement that it requires, and how important it is to most students.",
                "I think it depends what you're looking for. As a non art history major who was interested in taking an introductory course that allowed for hands-on interaction with the objects and gave opportunity to make something, I thought the class was really interesting and fun, though it required more time than I thought. I ended up studying more for this class than all but one of my other classes, and still ended with a worse grade (though not significantly, just down one grade) than I did in any of the other 4 classes I took. I think this is just likely due to me being weaker in my writing skills, but I think it's something to be aware of, especially if you are taking it for a distributional credit as I was and don't need it for your major.",
                "Yes! Very interesting!",
                "Yesthe course takes advantage of Yale's resources and gives students exposure to unique objects which they would not otherwise appreciate. After Global Decorative Arts, you will look at and think about objects more consciously.",
                "I would recommend this course to every student. I think that any student can benefit from a survey of art history that hails from the examination of global objects. The material is extremely engaging and valuable.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who would enjoy going to the YUAG and doing a little bit of arts and crafts. However, this course is a bit more challenging for someone going into art history blind. If you have never taken an art history course be prepared to be a bit lost on the exams."
