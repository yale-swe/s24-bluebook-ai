The delivery of the content was absolutely stellar and he would consistently check in for our feedback and ask how the class could be improved. I think there was just the right amount and difficulty of assignments to facilitate learning and Professor Adesola created a very very welcoming learning environment where everyone knew they could contribute and make mistakes without fear of embarrassment.\r\n \r\nPerhaps the only weakness of the class was that it would be possible to fly under the radar and not contribute but even then Professor Adesola always made sure to involve everyone so no one could really stay silent for too long.\r\n\r\nMy favorite class this semester! I cant wait for L2!",
