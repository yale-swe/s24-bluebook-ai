I learned about the methods of the field of linguistic documentation and revitalization and about some general linguistic concepts. I also learned a lot about the cases of specific languages and the efforts to revitalize them. Also, you learn a lot about the different ways to measure the danger of extinction that a language is in and the 'number' of languages on the planet.",
                "The title is accurate - I learned a lot about linguistic diversity and endangerment and what this means in the broader context of the world. It was incredibly valuable to have a class full of students from different backgrounds and with a variety of experiences that enriched my understanding of content in a really valuable way.",

Students also learn to write case studies, conduct extensive research on specific languages and issues regarding endangered languages, and critically read and analyze (often old) linguistic literature."

                "Strengths: interesting material and Professor Ko is very good at sparking conversation.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were at times long and felt a bit redundant. Also, the only thing we did was readings/comments on Perusall and then discussion in class (aside from one visit to the Beinecke and a talk with Professor Bowern). It was a bit monotonous in that regard, but the material was still very interesting.",
                "I think this course was maybe a little too discussion based for the amount of new content. We sometimes saw similar texts for two weeks at a time and by the third class there wasn't much to say. I think some change in the presentation of the material would be beneficial. Also, maybe not just presentations and/or discussions on papers every class would be good. It got a little repetitive, and I enjoyed it, but would have liked to see some variation.",
                "I like that this course covered a broad array of issues and took a very multidisciplinary approach to looking at language study, including discussions of colonial history and theories. I appreciated that it included languages from across the world. In terms of weaknesses, I think this class is somewhat falsely advertised. Reading the description, I was under the impression it was a lecture, but it was very much a seminar. In addition to this, I think the course should be renamed \"Language Endangerment and Revitalization\" because it does not go particularly into depth in the subject of language diversity. I also think the course could benefit from being broken down and organized by more structured and cohesive units; it felt like the subjects we studied kind of jumped around and didn't necessarily build on each other."

You'll learn a lot about the world and some linguistic dynamics that are more important than we realize. I would recommend this course to anyone. It was a 10/10.",
