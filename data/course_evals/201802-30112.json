    "This course has been one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I loved the sequence of the classes and how it they all built on each other. Maybe working in small groups to talk about reading more could have been helpful in starting conversations about the readings.",
    "A big strength for me was the hands on cooking and field trips to the different places to really get to see and interact with the ideas we were talking about. The days with only lectures were slightly less engaging and I really benefited from the interactive parts.",
    "The lecture should be more related to the papers",
    "Taking this course over the summer was wonderful, since it was in seminar format and we were able to make lots of visits to various Yale and New Haven locations.",
    "The course was really engaging, especially the field trips. The readings were interesting and everyone in the class participated in discussions. The only thing I think could be improved is the amount of guidance we received for the papers. For the first assignment, we had a class reading that we could model our papers after, which was really helpful. For the other papers, I found it hard to understand the expectations and wished we'd had stricter or more explicitly defined guidelines. Some example papers or theses would have been helpful, since the style of writing for the class is different from what most students are used to.",
    "strength is that it was a small seminar course where everyone contributed to a more fruitful discussion of topics. great balance of interactive learning (ie. working with hands, visiting farm) and professor Trumpler was great at fostering a challenging and interesting discourse."

    "The topic of this course was very interesting. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class and more specifically the summer session version of this class. Having a smaller more intimate class during the summer allowed us to do a lot more fun and interesting things around cooking and women in cooking. The professor is incredible as well and very friendly and knowledgable in all aspects of life which was interesting.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely! This course made me rethink my preconceived notions about food practices across cultures, especially with relation to gender and health\/food science. This course also gives you the opportunity to write about topics that interest you.",
    "Yes. I would definitely recommed the class, especially over the summer. Prof Trumpler is a great teacher and the seminar version of the class was really engaging. We went on really interesting field trips (YUAG, Beinecke, Yale Farm, etc) for a lot of classes so it didn't feel boring or repetitive.",
    "Yes. Our relationship with food is such an integral aspect of the human condition. Its such a primal subject that many gloss over it as if its too elementary or any rationale of the like, but learning about primal aspects of the human condition raises our self-awareness and fulfills the ultimate purpose of a liberal education: to encourage orthogonal thinking and broaden horizons."
