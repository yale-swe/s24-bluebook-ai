                "Wish the lecture slides were more than just pictures and that the lectures went more chronologically instead of thematic. I had trouble understanding the Professor at times due to his mumbling and I didnt find the lectures very engaging but I think thats because they are too long for the 11:35-12:50 block. Words on slides definitely help me follow the lecture more and stay more engaged.",
                "Strengths: The material was interesting and fairly interdisciplinary; I enjoyed many of the readings. Weaknesses: Lectures tended to drag on sometimes and they were not very interactive. It would have been helpful to have more signposting of important content in the lectures. I also would have preferred a grading scheme with less weight on the exams (especially the final exam) -- perhaps weekly discussion posts or a short writing assignment for 10-15% of the course grade would have helped even things out without substantially increasing the workload.",
                "Lectures very engaging,  interesting photos, sometimes names were not included in PowerPoint and hard to transcribe. Perhaps a master list of all proper names so that students are better able to spell them.",
                "Loved the time we spent in the Beinecke.  I only wish we had more time with primary sources.",
                "Strengths were that we covered very interesting topics and sections were very useful. Weaknesses was that it was a bit boring sometimes. Could be improved with more PowerPoint power rather than just speaking",
                "Professor Antonov gives enjoyable lectures with interesting content. The lack of supplement (i.e., lecture notes, list of terms) for the lectures made it difficult to know which topics could be used for ID questions on exams. The discussion section was more thematic and technical (historiography), which was useful as a history student, but left the reading largely unadressed. Discussion posts or an adjustment to the section priorities could help make the readings more important. The Buskovitch textbook was more important to the course than the Antonova guide, so their status as recommended and required materials respectively should be reversed."
