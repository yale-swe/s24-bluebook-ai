We read some engaging texts related to curriculums, class, and privilege. My favorite part of the course came at the end when we explored memoirs from Coates, Westover, and others. I enjoyed thinking critically about the education we are receiving at Yale, especially with the large cohort of international students in the class.",

                "This course was hard to engage with due to the remote aspect. It's often hard to engage remotely with a recoded lecture. The in-person element would have been more enjoyable, so I recommend that for people able to attend on campus.",
                "Strengths: Pretty much no work, and being pass\/fail, the work itself required zero effort. Content-wise, every lecture had an interesting insight or two, and it's a fun half-credit to take if you need it. Also, Prof Lewis is a great guy, and his soliloquys and discussions have restored a tiny fragment of my faith in the Yale administration. Weaknesses: The content does get a bit drab at times, especially if you don't particularly enjoy history and\/or literature.",
                "the readings were interesting but lectures and section were useless and felt like Yale propaganda. Marvin Chun's guest lecture was an hour-long speech justifying Yale's obsession with the endowment",
                "The course is well-organized into distinct parts and helps understand what college is about. However, the insights drawn from this course don't go further than the common knowledge about college education. I also appreciated guest speakers at this class.",
                "The material itself is engaging, but it was difficult to really engage and follow along when the lecture was recorded live.",
                "Solid course.",
                "Very engaging lecture and course material.",
                "Slightly unstructured at times but very cool discussion modes",
                "Professor Lewis is an extremely kind, caring, and intelligent man who makes it clear how deeply he cares for our well-being. The class provided a low stress environment to have conversations I believe all students should have. It is important to think critically about the role of college in our lives as we step through these formative years.",
                "Can't think of any weaknesses. Was a really good course",

He made the class (which, for future readers, was mainly composed of first-year international students who needed to take an in-person class for visa purposes) into a true community, and I am grateful to him for that. His thoughtfulness and intentionality regarding the course material were apparent. Regarding possible improvements: I am not sure if this course will be taught in the future, but if so, I do not think sections are necessary.",
