                "I have a solid framework for approaching anti-racist education at both the individual teacher and social\/structural level. I understand the difference between anti-racist and alternative pedagogies such as multicultural and decolonial. From guest lecturers I gained influential insights into the teaching profession and the steps I want to invest in post graduation. Notably, I learned about teacher education programs, traditional certification, teaching and learning communities and how to choose a school district to work in. Through my Teacher Accomplice Project I have learned about supporting inservice teachers as Yale students, paying particular attention to the labor division and power dynamics of that relationship. I have done research on anti-racism in STEM education at the K-12 levels in creative and innovative ways. I have learned about teaching Black\/Latinx studies, place-based pedagogies, Indigenous and Asian American studies as well.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Guest lecturers who are in-service teachers, teacher educators, youth\/community\/labor activists provided a critical, outside of Yale perspective of the teaching profession. More importantly, they painted a picture for students of the type of teaching and learning community that we might aspire to join or create for ourselves post-graduation. A community that supports anti-racist pedagogy both within and outside of the classroom, for all members of the classroom, students, teachers, parents and local people. Another strength was the practice of \"3-questions\" which I will elaborate on more in the virtual teaching section.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Frankly, none. This class was rigorous and dynamic and Professor HoSang was flexible enough to accommodate both.",
                "Strengths- Professor HoSang is great, The content is great, TAP projects were genuinely transformational (if you are remotely interested in teaching or going into the education field, this is a great opportunity to work with New Haven teachers), the class time was always packed with speakers who shared so so much wisdom with us. This course could not have exceeded my expectations more than it did. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- I wish we had more time to sit in the things we were reading and hearing about from speakers\/ HoSang. Obviously, this class meets once a week but more discussions would have been nice.",
                "I loved this course so much! I got to develop a lesson plan and actually teach it in a New Haven high school! Every single guest lecture was sensational and the teach ins for teachers were unforgettable. It was a lot of work but it was worth it ten times over.",
                "Strengths: bridging theory into practice, being real about the world, and talking to people doing real work.. I feel like in ethnic studies we can get really caught up in just the readings and envisioning different futures\/possibilities without actually thinking about what conditions we are working in. We did theory in this class, definitely, but it was all in preparation for accompanying teachers in our Teaching Accompaniment Project by providing them with resources for their classroom based on their needs (example, for a social studies classroom my partner and i mainly looked for primary  and secondary sources that highlighted Indigenous voices during the colonization period). Also we had a LOT of speakers, most of them teachers, some of them professors, some of them organizers. I think this class did an amazing job at grounding all of us and really bridging all of these academic texts to what the possibilities are in the classroom. I loved this class because of that, probably my favorite humanities course because it connected to the real world and to talking to people who are actually doing the work. I wish more professors were like Professor HoSang and integrated class and the outside, developed partnerships with outside organizations and communities, like HoSang did with this class and the ARTLC (anti racist teaching and learning collective). If you want this, please take this class. If you're an ERM or EDST major, please take this class. I think we all need a class that is not just about doing readings. workload is manageable, but i think this class requires more attention than other classes do.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there was a lot to keep track of, it was easy to forget assignments, so just watch out for that. if that doesnt change, make sure to have a good organization system. between the canvas posts, the readings, the spreadsheets, the work with New Haven teachers, and sporadic other canvas pages, and additional roles in the class like helping with the ethnic studies events planning it can be really easy to forget to do something or dedicate less time to something than something else.",
                "This class was packed with way more content than could be covered completely in just one semester, and I mean that in the best way. There was not a single moment wasted in this class because everything we learned was incredibly important and relevant. I found myself wishing we could spend more time on each week's topic because I felt like I needed more than just an hour and fifty minute session once a week to really fully understand and think about what we learned.",
                "Strengths - Prof HoSang is fantastic and works hard to adapt the class to students needs. Guest speakers made the class fantastic! Hopefully this will continue even after Covid. Getting to work with real teachers is pretty great as well \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - while working with teachers is fantastic, it also creates another layer of coordination to manage. So keep this in mind as you think about what workload is realistic for you!",
                "Strengths: all the guest speakers! the class community created! prof. hosang! the real world interactions working with teachers!\r\nWeaknesses: the tuesday night two hour slot kinda brutal tho... also, this could be a strength or weakness but all the students in the class shared very similar interests of er&m \/ teaching so there weren't necessarily a lot of diverse perspectives",
                "Definitely the highlight of the course was working with a local teacher to compile resources to supplement their teaching! I learned so much from the teacher I was paired with, and looking for resources and activities for him to implement into his classroom was both fun and challenging.\r\n\r\nOne way the course could be improved is by having reading responses\/discussion posts to be due at a consistent time each week."

                "Successful during the pandemic was the practice of \"3 Questions\" which highlighted a couple of students each seminar to ask and answer three personal questions during class. Through very brief questions such as \"Who\/where are you from?\" \"What brings you to this class?\" \"What was the best thing that happened to you this week?\" I felt like I really got to know my peers even in the virtual format. This pedagogy was critical to building a community of trust within which students were empowered to share new ideas, make mistakes, and learn more deeply.",
                "I appreciated the fact that TAP projects could be adjusted to our own schedule-- this came in handy given virtual learning and covid",
                "I LOVED that this class had a balance of activities to split the ~2 hours together from 7-8:50 pm on a tuesday evening. Prof HoSang always started with music and chat check ins, then 3 questions which was a mini interview to get to know each other better, then a mini lecture or a guest speaker, and discussion either before or after, plus reporting on our projects. Like, we do a lot in class, but it is all different and requires different levels of engagement that are not just sitting in discussion for 2 hours straight. We mix up light listening and laughing, with more focused listening, with discussion, with sharing stuff. Also Prof Hosang gives breaks in between. It really made a zoom class come more alive and feel less overwhelming, although the time of the day was exhausting.",

Anyone who is invested in building (classroom) communities that reimagine power structures, resource allocation and community would gain from this course. You will interact personally with CT educators, activists and elders from whom you will gain infinite knowledge about learning, outside the Yale institution. You will join a teaching and learning community of your own and, in conversation with Professor HoSang and your peers, will feel supported in your future pursuits for anti-racist pedagogies and curriculum.",

                "Yes! My favorite class so far at yale!",
                "Yes. Here's why:\r\n- Prof HoSang is amazing\r\n- getting out of our own heads and going to meet people who are actually teaching and doing the work of anti racist teaching as well as talking to organizers and students\r\n- talking to amazing amazing teachers, literally gave me so much hope and joy to hear them talk about their work and their students\r\n- the people who take this class really make this class come alive, it's a whole community (and it was VIRTUAL!! I can't imagine it in person)\r\n- everyone is learning, it never feels like someone knows more, professor invites everyone to share even if you don't have anything substantial to say, and he really believes that everyone has something to learn and contribute, so you never feel like you are not \"smart\" or anything similar\r\n- healthy learning space",
                "Yes! But you really have to be on board with the work being undertaken by the course. I feel that this class could be so productive because we started on the same page about anti-racist learning and the need for itit wasn't a debate about whether we should be implementing it, it was a collective conversation about how to do it. This doesn't mean that there weren't any disagreements or that making mistakes was unacceptable, but we learned at the very beginning to expect that we wouldn't have all the answers and that all of us were learning together.",
                "For sure! If you are interested in working with students and teachers and getting a hands on approach to this side of classroom learning this is the class for you. It was challenging in the best way possible. With that said, be prepared to put in extra work to ensure that the content you provide to teachers is great quality and to coordinate multiple check ins with them to ensure youre all on the right track. Overall, very rewarding",
                "Absolutely! I recommend any course with Prof. HoSang if you can get in. This one is particularly unique because instead of just talking about theory, you walk the walk and put it into practice by listening to real classroom teachers guest speak + working on a semester long project or two with real classroom teachers in CT.",
                "absolutely! this class will really get you thinking about what anti-racist teaching and learning looks like on a practical level, and will also connect you with some amazing teachers and leaders who are already deeply involved in the work."
