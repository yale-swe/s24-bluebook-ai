    "I'm finally able to read, write, and speak with proper (!) pronunciation in Vietnamese. This alone made the class worth it for me. I'm also more confident speaking Vietnamese with my family and friends, and learned about aspects of Vietnamese culture that I hadn't known before.",
    "This class did an excellent job of improving my Vietnamese writing, grammar and vocabulary. Moreover, Thays literary and philosophical perspectives deeply enrich ones understanding of the history of the language.",
    "Increase my ability to write and communicate in Vietnamese.",
    "I learned that it doesn't matter as much whether or not I finished all of the worksheets every week. As this is a heritage class, I realized that I would get out of the class what I put in. All students have different goals as to how far they want to improve in the language."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths: the class is geared towards discussion and participation. Thay Quang is an excellent language instructor; he welcomes questions, and often makes the effort to speak to students one-on-one about how their day is going before and after class. The workload is manageable, and I enjoy going to class. The vocabulary that was taught was especially helpful for conversations with my parents and grandparents. I love that the class is focused on writing and reading; I find that my ability to properly do both now has ironically helped my speaking abilities exponentially.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses: I really, really despise pointless busywork, and unfortunately, this is the one things that annoyed me most about this class. Some of the most time-consuming homework revolved around translating poetic phrases that my Vietnamese parents and grandparents had never even heard of, and there was too little grammar instruction, something I was desperately seeking. Not enough class time was spent on grammar explanations, but the ones that were were fantastic. Vietnamese is not like English at all, and sometimes you need some hand-holding to be able to see this difference. If you are a pragmatist like I am, this will annoy you. Also, I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT MY GRADE IS! I feel like this is crucial to know to see how you're doing in the class, and to know if you need to ask for help. I don't really care about the letter grade, I just want to know how I can improve!",
    "Strengths: guided classroom discussions with Thay, a wide variety of assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none to write about",
    "Some times it could get a little unorganized.",
    "My teacher is one of the best that I have ever seen. In the lessons that he gives to his students, he always cleverly weaves in Vietnamese culture. I learned a lot of new vocabulary because of the focus on particular modules."

   "comments": [
    "If you're Vietnamese-American, I would highly recommend it for the sole reason of gaining confidence in your speaking abilities. This is a gift whose value cannot be overstated. When you go home and speak to your family with your improved Vietnamese, they will go, \"ooh, ahh\" and trust me, you will feel like a million bucks. Nothing feels better than finally being able to have a conversation with your grandparents without having to pepper your sentences with English. Not to mention that the workload is reasonable, perfect for a first-year especially, and most of the homework is conducive towards the goal of improving your writing and reading.",
    "Yes, there is no better class to step up your ability to speak and write Vietnamese.",
    "Depends.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in improving their Vietnamese. However, I would have to say that whoever takes this course must be prepared to be accountable for his or her own progress."
