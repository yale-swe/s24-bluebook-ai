                "Strengths: discussion format promoted engagement with the material. The weekly emails helped me parse the theory readings before we discussed them in class. Broad range of texts introduced me to literature and movements from all over the world\/all throughout history.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: somewhat lacking in direction on how to approach the papers. Also, sometimes felt like you were supposed to know things that you don't necessarily know, given that this is an intro course.",
                "This class was way TOO long, a straight 2 hour class is too long to have and to focus during. Maybe divide this class into 2 sessions would be more helpful, and also offering a discussion section to further discuss the material. Having a TA was so helpful though!",
                "This course gave a lot of interesting insight on literary practices in multiple genres\/cultures, as well as some important theoretical texts. I would have liked the structure of the course material to be a little clearer (e.g. perhaps following a timeline), in addition to a more comprehensive look at the evolution of literary theory as a whole.",
                "Strengths: This is not a class that you can succeed in without doing the readings. It is often tempting to skim or skip a particularly dense theory essay; doing so is rendered impossible as you have to write a couple of thoughtful responses to each and participate in discussion which presumes a decent understanding of the material on your part. Thus, you're forced to learn how to read theory texts in a way you might not find in many other classes. Hodgkin himself is quite the skilled and rigorous reader, not only of the material he teaches, but also the essays he grades. There's no bullshitting him, both on papers and in discussion. He provides great feedback though. Our TF, Maru Pabn, was simply wonderful and a great resource. The literary fiction readings were also quite interesting, though quite niche (intentionally), and included a game (fun!) and movie (weird!).\r\nWeaknesses: The course, I often felt, lack a clear sense of direction. Contextualization would have helped, both in regards to the individual readings and to the class itself. It would have been helpful if Hodgkin had established some clear goals and expectations for the course at the beginning of the semester (e.g. what we would be learning, what we wouldn't be). Also, he should have spent the beginning (or end) of each class giving us a \"lecture\" over the week's readings. The fiction readings, though interesting, were fairly biased towards the professor's area of expertise (central Eurasia). This is, of course, understandable, but might be a turn off for some. Also, two hour seminars on Zoom were a pain.",
                "Among the course's foremost strengths is its structure. The syllabus is carefully designed to ensure both (1) substantial engagement with formative ideas in literary theory and (2) competence in putting them to use in the analysis of literature, for the sake of developing a greater methodological arsenal. In particular, I found Prof. Hodgkin's pairing of literary and theoretical texts to be consistently generative and rich; the theory readings worked wonderfully as probes into the complexities of the literary readings and vice versa. I also appreciated his avoidance of canon set-pieces  which students are likely to have encountered n times (e.g., reading Eliot for the discussion of New Criticism)   in favor of lesser-known works from a wealth of different languages and traditions.  The sequential development of the writing assignments was similarly thoughtful, encouraging students to progressively gain confidence and independence as interpreters. The more constrained papers in the first half of the semester demanded precision and flexibility and so helped to refine my responses to the open-ended prompts later in the term. Additionally, Prof. Hodgkin's feedback was always thorough, insightful, and constructive. His passion for the material and dedication to his students was manifest throughout the term.  \r\n\r\nProf. Hodgkin's success in rousing seminar discussion, however, was somewhat more mixed. At first, our meetings were uneven: students were relatively quiet and Prof. Hodgkin did a good bit of directing and explicating. Now and again, his questions were leading in a way that inhibited student participation. I can appreciate the pedagogical conundrum here: the course is focused on the exploration (and implementation) of particular methods of literary study, rather than on the open-ended investigation of particular literary works; through the lens of any given literary method, there are determinate things to notice and decipher in texts. The methodological orientation of the class thereby occasionally seemed more compatible with lecture than reciprocal exchange, as it felt like we were working to *decode* something fixed (a line of the theory, a relevant pattern in the literary text) rather than to *advance* our collective understanding  in ways that might take all of us by surprise. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, I found that as the semester progressed, we naturally settled into a satisfying balance of professorially guided and student-directed discussion. As participation become livelier, Prof. Hodgkin grew skilled at knowing when to desist from laboring towards an interpretative point (if it didn't seem like we were getting there ourselves). He also created more opportunities for us to talk among ourselves, including, notably, the culminating chapter of the final class. As such, my only advice for the next iteration of the course would be to import some of these strategies into the earlier weeks, in order to expedite the growing pains. Perhaps more regular usage of break-out groups would help foster a collaborative environment as well."

                "Yes, but mostly as a requirement for the major. It is a very specific way of thinking and writing, which took a lot of trial and error for me to get right. Sometimes it felt like there were implicit prerequisites (even though there are no official prerequisites) such as knowledge of the classics and meter in poetry--it almost felt like it was geared toward DS students. Still, it is an interesting class with highly varied literature, and it teaches you how to write and think as a comparatist.",
                "If you don't have to take this course as a comp lit pre req then DON'T take it. It's so tedious and takes so much time to finish the readings and do the weekly responses (3 due for one day...). The class time is way too long and it's so hard to concentrate for that long. I really wasn't engaged with the material as much as I hoped and the class really was not engaging. I just felt like I learned nothing when I left the class, if anything I was even more confused. And then when I got my papers back I just didn't understand what was expected of me. It was just a lot of work and a BIG BIG challenge for an INTRO lit course. I would not recommend if you don't have to take it.",

I found the class highly demanding and sometimes directionless. However, looking back, I appreciate much of that challenge it made me engage with texts in a way I otherwise wouldn't have. The class improved my writing at the level of structure and argumentation, but not style. If you want to gain a broad (and semi-deep) familiarity with literary theory (i.e. read a diverse set of texts), I'm not aware of a better substitute. However, if you want to take a class because you love literature and want to study it in a formal way, there are certainly better alternatives.",
                "If you're curious about literature and how to interface with it, yes. The course will introduce you to new interpretative strategies, encourage you to think critically about the interactions between texts (both thematic and contextual), and hone your sophistication and imagination as a literary critic."
