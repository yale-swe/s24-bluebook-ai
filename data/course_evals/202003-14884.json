                "I learned a lot about Marx's depiction of the Capitalist system. In Class we discussed Marx's main critiques of the capitalist system, how his depiction of capitalism can be compared against our modern world, the influence of capitalism in non-economic spheres of life and much more. I developed the skill for conducting analysis of a philosophical text in spheres beyond that of the philosophical argument itself. We discussed a lot about the literary and historical value of Marx's Das Kapital text and these discussions taught me a lot.",
                "Deep insight into Marx's Capital - contemporary and literal interpretations. Just one book, but it was a fantastic journey into the depths of Marxian thought, from sociology to history to economics. A truly superb exploration of the theoretical foundations of 'Marxism' and challenging the preconceived notions about Capital. We were apparently the \"first group of undergraduates in 50 years who have critically read Vol. 1 like this.'   My way of thinking has been fundamentally changed - workers of the world, unite!",

The book starts with an explanation of what commodity is and how they are traded, to how they are made and how labor is exploited under capitalism. The book is a very thorough analysis of how capitalism works, the historical tendencies of capitalism towards subsumption and centralization, and a graphic illustration of the abuse and exploitation of workers under this system. It is the ultimate horror story. The colloquium once a week was also a great overview of present-day Marxist scholarship and how current thinkers interact with a text that, while almost two centuries old, remains as prescient as ever.",

                "This is an amazing course for everyone who is interested in marxism or wants to expand their understanding of capitalism. It is incredibly well-taught, challenging but not overwhelming, and has fostered some of the most intellectually fulfilling conversations of my Yale career so far.",
                "Focus on the primary text was a plus.  Student engagement was generally pretty high - Prof North encouraged this.  On the to be improved side, Capital could have benefited from some readings that were a little more critical.  Alternatively, one of the guest speakers could have been chosen from a list of prominent critics.",
                "The strengths of this class this semester were definitely Prof North, the TA's Vanessa and Leana, and the CT scan assignments which we were responsible for on a weekly basis.  Prof North was spectacular in his presentation of the context of the class. He also always created a welcoming environment in the seminar where many discussions were had. The TA's Vanessa and Leana also contributed to the success of the class. Vanessa is very knowledgeable of Marx's texts and the insights she provided in class improved my understanding of the philosophical content of the text. Leana on the other hand allowed me to perceive the connections between the philosophical content of the text and the audio-visual arts (in addition to literature). Finally, the CT scan assignments which we were responsible for on a weekly basis forced me to engage with the text in more ways than I would have otherwise.",
                "Strengths - Paul North's teaching is fantastic, so were the CT scans (and Vanessa's comments). The colloquium was well organized and educational. Essays were fun and thought-provoking. Great discussion.\r\nWeaknesses - The presentations could be more organized, and the class-notes\/readings could be more structured.",
                "Lectures were almost too long",
                "The course was wonderful, Professor North and the TAs were extremely smart, interesting, and kind, and helped make the difficult material more approachable.",
                "Paul North is a fantastic professor who explains the ideas of the text in a thoughtful and thought-provoking manner. The other biggest strength of this course is that it is completely devoted to Marx's Capital, which is something you are unlikely to find anywhere else in the institutional neoliberal course curriculum of Yale University. It is a place where students can feel comfortable discussing radical leftist ideas (or challenging those ideas, if they choose). The two hour seminar format could be difficult to sit through at times, and the ending of Capital felt a bit rushed, but overall one of the best classes I've taken here.",
