I believe I was able to improve my writing proficiency and harness my voice as a leader in the classroom. I realized the insight that a hero is not always a traditional superpower-wielding individual, rather there are many antiheroes who can have even greater impact on an audience and society as a whole.",
                "A complete introduction into film and literature in the crime, gangster, detective, and spy genre. This class was an incredible opportunity to dive into many films and novels of this type and learn how they connect.",

                "strengths: a compassionate professor who really wants the best for his students!! He is incredibly insightful. \r\nweaknesses: the course lacked a lot of engagement between students and became more of a lecture at times",
                "Professor Friedfeld provided lots of feedback on our papers and asks great questions to facilitate meaningful discussion. Professor Friedfeld encourages students to take stylistic risks when writing.",
                "There are absolutely no weaknesses to this course. Every single piece of literature and film assigned for homework and class was fruitful and allowed for deep analysis of the themes of the course. The three essays perfectly compliment each other and allow all of the students to be prideful about their work. This class was flawless.",
                "The professor and the content on the syllabus are both fantastic.",
                "Really kind and inspiring Professor and interesting material; weakness was the large amount of material that was too time consuming to get through so I was struggling to know what was most important and we would actually talk about in class. Also I wish I knew the class would be on zoom in the beginning, I wouldve still taken it but would be good to know.",
                "Content was incredibly enjoyable, Eddy was amazing and so understanding, felt like he really cared about his students. \r\n\r\nI don't know how it could be any better!",
                "Strengths: Eddy knows so much, he is a fountain of knowledge, he's also just so fun to talk to and learn from!\r\nWeaknesses: I kind of wish we had covered more queer/female/POC characters and addressed some more of the problematic aspects of various male archetypes and behaviors",
                "Strengths: well organized for learning, great lectures, interesting assignments, extremely passionate and personable Professor. \r\nWeaknesses: none\r\nImprovements: would like to receive a copy of Professor Friedfelds presentation slides after class. They would often be packed with extra content/info that Id love to have seen.",
                "Wide range across American cinema is covered, largely male heroes and villains but unfortunately that reflects hollywood's historical landscape.",
                "Strengths include engaging material that students will enjoy reading/watching even if it were not for class. For future versions of this class, it might be fun to do a group screening of the movies so that the class can engage with the material together. I also wish that we had been notified that this course would be taught solely online, and I hope that future iterations of this course are taught in person. It is difficult to have a true seminar experience without the in-person setting."

                "Yes, you are provided the opportunity to expand your film lexicon. Professor Friedfeld encourages students to write about whatever they are passionate about, allowing us to write our best works.",
                "I absolutely recommend this course to other students no matter their major. Professor Friedfeld has been my favorite professor I have had at Yale and is so knowledgeable in his area of study. The course allows students to write about matters that greatly interest them and learn about exciting and engaging topics of heroism and individuality. As long as you are interested in learning about film, heroes, villains, and their interactions, TAKE THIS COURSE!",
                "Yes, 100%. If you get the chance to take this course, do it.",
                "Yes, it was fun to learn a lot about all the movies, and Professor Friedfeld is very kind and encouraging Professor.",
                "YES! Just a really enjoyable writing option for those that enjoy film, Eddy allows you to really dig into topics for the papers in a meaningful way that genuinely interest you. Never felt overly pressured or stressed the whole semester, great class.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in this kind of overview of American cinema; check the syllabus beforehand",
                "Yes. The homework is literally watching movies and reading books. The 3 papers are fun prompts (for example, write about a Movie/book that has impacted an older relative) and Eddy Friedfeld grades generously. Hes also extremely passionate about teaching, the subject matter, AND his students (with a great sense of humor). Felt that our class bonded really well, too. Flexible about deadlines. Plenty of writing feedback. This course is the definition of fun.",
                "Yes, I think it can be a fun class and good deviation from other courses taught at yale. You learn a lot about important films that many people have watched and are often mentioned in society. I also gained a greater appreciation for older cinema through this class.",
                "Yes! Super interesting course material and great professor.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I had a lot of fun exploring different genres within American TV/movies/books in pop culture. It's the kind of class where you don't mind doing the homework because the material is so enjoyable."
