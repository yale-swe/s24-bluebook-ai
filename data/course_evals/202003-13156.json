                "I learned more about the cultural connections and histories of the early modern Atlantic, in particular looking at material and visual cultures from the Caribbean.  I also learned more about curatorial skills and insights into critiques of art museums.",
                "I came into this class not having taken a single art history class or engaged with any kind of academic visual analysis before, so I was definitely out of my comfort zone when the semester began, but I learned a lot of things very quickly. From the assigned readings and discussions in class (and some generous help from classmates), I learned how to perform basic visual analysis on art objects, how to write a visual analysis paper, and how to contribute to discussions around art history and visual analysis. Having taken this class, I feel pretty equipped to perform visual analyses on art objects from various contexts!\r\nAside from learning how to perform and write visual analysis, I learned a lot about how artistic production relates to the class' major themes of colonialism, enslavement, genocide, white supremacy and more.  \r\nAnd on a last note, I learned a lot about the processes that are behind curating art exhibitions, something which I wasn't expecting to learn. I thought that our class discussions on how to (if at all) present art or objects that are connected to processes of colonialism, enslavement, or genocide was very interesting."

                "I thought this class was great. The readings were very interesting and connected to one another, and I loved the questions Professor Fromont posed in class. I also liked the way the final project was structured. We had a lot of time to engage with a topic that we were really excited about.",
                "Strengths: The variety of assignments kept things interesting; Prof. Fromont always asked insightful questions and helped me consider many aspects of a topic that I hadn't before\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The asynchronous assignments (such as making narrated powerpoints) often took quite a long time, but hardly counted at all towards our final grade. If the assignments are going to take that much work, I wish they counted for more than just a few percentage points.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that although it covers a variety of contexts and history, it also allows each student to research things they are interested in and to share these with the class. Besides visual analysis and historical context, I also gained a lot just from being able to hear from everyone else in the class. There was a big focus on everyone sharing informal presentations which meant we got to hear about topics or items each person had researched. Professor Fromont also ensured everyone was able to share their feedback and questions. One weakness of this course was that it could be unstructured at times and we would have weekly tasks that were sometimes not totally clear. However, these weekly tasks were usually low-stakes so this isn't a big problem and we were able to do them more as a learning activity than an assessment.",
                "One strength of the class was the weekly tasks that were assigned to us. I thought they were successful both as exercises of visual analysis in and of themselves, and as ways to prepare us for the topic that we were going to be discussing that week. I was sad that we didn't spend any time in class engaging with these weekly tasks more. Sometimes we were assigned to create small powerpoint presentations, and I thought it would have been nice to share these with one another in class (instead of the professor encouraging us to engage with them outside of class, which is valid but not very effective in my opinion). \r\nAnother strength of the course was the small number of students, and its emphasis on discussion. I'm the quite type in classes so I don't usually volunteer to speak, but I thought that the professor's efforts at calling on each and every one of us to participate were nerve-wracking, but really fruitful."

                "I thought the structure of the course worked really well. Most weeks we did activities asynchronously in addition to our synchronous meetings, and I really enjoyed hearing about other people's outside-of-class activities during our meetings.",
                "This class was really well adapted to covid!! We had a small class so it was easy to build some level of human interaction, there was lots of flexibility about homework and the final assessment format, which allowed us to either do a research paper or virtual art exhibition to develop curatorial techniques while playing to the virtual aspect of online learning. It was also good that Professor Fromont gave us asynchronous, non-online tasks like developing a herbarium, as this helped get us off the computer to reduce Zoom fatigue.",
                "Firstly, I appreciated that the professor was lenient with assignment deadlines! \r\nI also appreciated the professor's efforts at getting everyone to participate in class by asking us to take turns in participating. It's easy to fade into the background in virtual classes, so the professor's insistence of everyone participating was nice. \r\nThe weekly tasks were also a really successful way to engage students during the covid pandemic, and I really enjoyed doing them. Visually analyzing your own surroundings and connecting our discoveries with topics in class felt really engaging and rewarding."

                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in history, art, art history, looking at art museums critically, or understanding the history and politics of material and visual dimensions and representations of topics like colonization and enslavement. This course is great for people who don't have too much experience with visual analysis as the course helps with those skills with a visual analysis paper and practice in class. It also doesn't require prior knowledge as the readings are both interesting and clearly written. I would say this is a must-take course for anyone interested in working in museums or galleries partly because of one text on the reading list called \"The Whole Picture\" by Alice Procter.",
                "Yes, I would! You will learn a lot about how artistic production is deeply connected to processes of colonialism, enslavement, and genocide, and if you are new to art history classes, I think this class offers a strong introduction to visual analysis and scholarship around art production. Overall, the discussions in class were fun and engaging, and the weekly tasks helped keep me physically invested in the topics that we discussed. The reading was also not too much. An educational and engaging class! :)"
