                "1. The strength of this class is that its very different from other courses at Yale. It was fun to dance and learn about something not as academic. \r\n\r\n2. The main weakness of this course is that while the professor is well meaning, he had no idea how to structure a class. I do not blame him, I blame Yale you cannot just give an expert on a topic free reign to format a seminar however he wants if he has no idea what a seminar should look like. I enjoyed the class but the structure had many flaws. I will list some of the issues below. \r\n- This was a seminar, and no one ever talked. Basically, he read a few sentences from our reading responses aloud at the beginning of class for about 5 minutes then he had us dance but we didn't receive much instruction on that either we basically just followed him. Then he would introduce that weeks speaker and would basically talk to them for an hour while we sat there and didn't say a word. In the last few classes we were able to ask them one question but I am pretty sure the whole point of a Yale seminar is for the students to talk and interact with the professor and the other students. I don't think one person ever spoke directly to another student. Again, I don't blame him, if the university is going to hire a professional ballet dancer to teach a seminar they have to give him some guidelines. At least tell him that the students should talk to each other. \r\n- Never received a single ounce of written feedback or grades even on our midterm\r\n- The assignments were very vague and gave no examples of what he'd actually like to see\r\n- When our assignments were due, as well as their requirements were assigned very close to when they were due and gave us very little ability to plan ahead.",
                "Professor Ulbricht is warm, kind, and encouraging! He creates an inclusive environment in which learning is fun and engaging.",
                "I absolutely loved the dancing component."
