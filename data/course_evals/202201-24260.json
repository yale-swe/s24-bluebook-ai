I also became better at listening to my peers in class, who always had insightful comments to offer.",
                "Exposed me to some new writers and styles of writing and helped me analyze literary tropes in a more literary-history sense.",
                "Gained a very strong understanding of the detective genre and it's development over time. Became a better writer as well, given good targeted feedback.",
                "I developed a real understanding of the evolution of the detective story from its progenitors to the earliest landmark pieces to all the places the genre has established itself up to the present. I have now read way more and more varied detective stories, and I could point out the influences and structures that a modern story in this genre would be utilizing. I also gained meaningful insights on surveillance and information management, on justice, on the \"rules\" of a story or genre, on the distinctly gamelike component of the detective genre, and many other fascinating questions of philosophy and cultural history through our amazing in-class conversations and Prof Grimstad's helpful launching points.",
                "I learned much about the detective genre, as well as improved my writing skills significantly.",
                "In addition to tracking the evolution of the unique genre of the Detective Story (its beginnings in Poe and Doyle to the hardboiled mean streets of noir to the postmodern, meta works like Borges and Nabokov), I developed a lot of skills in close readingparticularly, how to utilize cited evidence from a text and really delve into its diction and syntax to tie it the overall argument.",
                "Major insight into the detective genre over the years! I developed skills of close analysis for this genre specifically, for novels, short stories, and movies alike.",
                "This class gave me an incredible insight into the genre in an incredible depth.",
                "Learned about the history of the detective fiction genre and so much more! Prof. Grimstad managed to bring philosophy and literature from throughout history to the table, which made for some fascinating discussions.",

                "The workload was really high and the discussions were definitely hybrid lecture\/discussions in that Grimstad talked a lot, which isn't necessarily bad.",
                "Amazing class. Very informative and interesting.",
                "Strength is the class time. Everyone is super ready to engage and has so much to say because of the wonderful material.",
                "Great great class, Grimstad is a huge strength and I think the content of the class also meant there was always a fun \"let's solve this together\" detective attitude toward any question we faced. No busywork which is great, just reading, coming prepared to class, and three literary analysis papers throughout the semester. I thought the structure of classes was great, with Grimstad giving a short introduction that laid out some interesting themes we could talk about and also gave helpful historical and cultural context to whatever story we were talking about in that class. This helped me understand how every text was building on those before it and how they all came together in a beautiful network or timeline, and it also gave us plenty to work off of when the conversation moved into the class' hands after ~10 minutes. Great classroom atmosphere. One thing I might suggest: we talked a lot about the detective genre and games, and I think it could have been interesting to play Clue or some other detective game at some point in the class to really have a specific shared experience to collectively compare with the experience of reading a book or watching a movie.",
                "All of the material was highly engaging and professor Grimstad is one of my now favorite professors at Yale. There were one or two books that were less related and enjoyable, but that happens with every class.",
                "Strengths: engaging readings, just the right workload, fun seminar discussions. Weaknesses: wish paper prompts could be a tad less analytical (maybe have the option to do a creative assignment one time).",
                "The course spans a very wide era of detective fiction and a class that is incredibly involved with the content. Professor Grimstad has an extensive knowledge of the genre and is enthralled when talking about the works which ripples out into discussion. Though some set up time is required in section and is very thought provoking, it did take time away from the class discussion.",
                "The syllabus is very well-designed and the discussion sections are very inspired. What Professor Grimstad says at the beginning of class is always very wonderful. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "I really like the variety of stories in the class, but less hard boiled crime please!",
                "Syllabus was awesome. Class discussions were pretty useless."

                "Sure, it was a fun literature course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class! If you're into detective stories it's truly the class for you, but if you're not could become redundant. Amazing class truly.",
                "One of my favorite classes I've taken. I think an interesting metric to judge seminars by is the type of environment that forms between the students. Despite being at the top of limit for the number of students, this class quickly became a tight knit group by virtue of the rich discussions that were inspired which in turn led to all students feeling comfortable and eager to contribute and share their ideas. I looked forward to every class",
                "I would recommend this course. It shouldn't require a lot of effort, plus it's super fun material. Also because of the material, most people engage a lot, which is fun. Also Professor Grimstad is wonderful and knows so much about everything and also guides discussions well and wants people to engage.",
                "YES! Amazing class and a highlight of every week. Grimstad is awesome and it's so fun to carry around this full slice of cultural history around afterwards. Texts are fun to read and conversations are fun to take part in. Can't recommend enough, especially if you like thinking about the philosophical theses of \"low brow\" fiction and culture.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes; even if one is not an English major, it is still an approachable and interesting class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. The readings are engaging (and fun!) and discussion is always lively. Highly recommend",
                "If youre interested in the detective genre at all, yes!! The course is fascinating and gives such focused insight into an often looked-over genre.",
                "If you are a fan of detective fiction and mystery novels, then most definitely. It is an incredible immersion into the genre with some great material. You will not like every book or story that you read, but the overwhelming majority of them are great.",
                "Yes! It is a lot of fun and very insightful",
                "I would recommend it! The detective story is a fun topic, and the ideas of seeing, investigating, etc. can be applied to many aspects in life.",
                "Sure, if only because you get to read\/watch awesome stuff. But the class discussions were disappointing, and I didn't feel like I gained much from them."
