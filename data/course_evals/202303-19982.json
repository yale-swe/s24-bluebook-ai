It changed my perception of the practice of writing; it is as much an art as it can be a mechanical process. Through the way Professor Green taught us to read the essays, it was only possible for us to start picking up on the tried and true techniques that would improve our writing. Amazing class. I also really improved my public speaking skills in discussion. I was forced to organize my ideas into more concise and eloquent passages that were more effective in getting my point across.",

                "Highly everyone has something to gain from this course. It equips you with a toolbox for writing well in contexts far beyond creative nonfiction writing. Each student needs to look inward to pull out their writing in ways that are often uncomfortable. Yet it gives closure to the loose ends of emotional experiences and also brings out the best insights and often times, humor. Really shapes you as a human being and reading peers' and professionals' essays shed so many new perspectives.",
