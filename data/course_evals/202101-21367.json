You learn about preservation, archaeological reports, and the development of the human species through an intersection of several different hominin species originating in Africa. You also learn about societies and cultures of Africa, the rise of cities and the Neolithic revolution, and the specific work of the professors in the field.",
                "As an absolute beginner to archaeology, I learned about what archaeologists actually do and what tools/methods they use, and what factors (environmental, social, political) affect their finds findings. I also learned about the evolution of hominids, and the beginnings of modern human behavior."

                "The midterm was extremely intense, while the final was chill. Undecided if that's a strength or weakness. \r\n\r\nGreat job of covering so much material in a comprehensive manner.",
                "I prefer lectures to take place in the class, and virtual lectures can be a bit dry and hard to focus on. Not being able to ask questions in the moment can be frustrating. \r\nThe class had issues where data on the syllabus was changed abruptly without modification to the syllabus itself or a visible announcement. This will be discussed more.\r\nThe class did not discuss the readings often. It would have been nice to have a discussion section or devote some of class time to going through some very interesting readings that felt like an afterthought.",
                "I think it could be improved by inspiring more discussion, and also by giving reminders about the weekly section reports.",
                "Strengths: The subjects taught are super interesting, and the professors are great! Weaknesses: As an absolute beginner, the readings were tough for me to follow. The good thing was that all of the readings didn't end up being super critical -- there were just certain ones that I reread for the regional comparison assignment."

The professors are knowledgeable and experts in their fields and answered questions gracefully and effectively, even if there was often not enough time for them. I would recommend it, but recommend students pay very close attention to the dates and information regarding assessments to ensure they do not suffer in the same way our class did.",
