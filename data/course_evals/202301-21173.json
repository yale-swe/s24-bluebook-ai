                "This course discusses how capitalism can be studied through anthropological approaches and how capitalism must be seen as an anthropological rather than an economic system. It does a lot of work to discuss capitalism and its impact on culture, and everyday experiences.",
                "This class is sort of like a survey course of different ways to approach the intersection of ethnography and capitalism. This course provides a great introduction to ethnography as a whole. In this class, we paid careful attention to not just the content of our readings but the very structure of it. In doing so, we think deeply about what strategies anthropologists use when writing their ethnographies.",
                "I learned what ethnography is and how it is used to explore essential questions about what capitalism is. Developed skills in juggling large amounts of reading, and developed discussion skills."

            "comments": [
                "This course is very good at teaching you how to actually conduct an ethnography, and it is set up well to keep you on track for writing the longer paper as he has smaller deadlines throughout the course. The only thing that could be better is if we started doing the practical work earlier in the semester. Sometimes, the reading discussions would drag on, and I feel like it would have been better to just switch to talking about practical work like we did in the end of the semester. This would also have allowed us to do a more in depth project, which would have been cool and good practice for future ethnography work.",
                "Strengths:\r\n - The syllabus is perfectly crafted, a great balance between ethnographies and theory\r\n - The sophomore seminar format creates a great sense of community\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n - Especially at the beginning of the course, it was difficult to understand why we chose to study capitalism from an ethnographic lens\r\n - I wish class activities were more varied. I really appreciated the second class, where we simulated a Polish shoe factory, and the class where we talked about Prof Roger's child's money circulation worksheet. More hands-on ways of connecting with the course material.\r\n - Assessment structure: I would have liked more writing assignments throughout the semester graded for completion, for instance pre or post-class discussion posts or creative/personal writing assignments like \"the shoes on your feet.\" So many thoughts floated after each class and wished for a space to recollect, organize, and apply to my own life. I also wish that I could've gotten feedback on my writing before the bigger midterm essay. I also wish that the midterm could ask for less number of connections to the course content.",
                "Strengths- interesting content, great final project\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- discussion could be guided a bit more",
                "The course does a good job of exposing you to various ways of studying capitalism and different ways capitalism is experienced across people. Just because of my personal interests, the most interesting part was our discussion of medical anthropology and people's experiences navigating capitalist structures for their healthcare. I think that class could be a bit better if it focused more on these kinds of things, looking at how capitalism influences very intimate parts of people's lives. I would have loved to learn more about how sexuality is formed in capitalist systems, how health is formed, how disability is formed, etc. The course was very heavy on things like marketing and formation of personhood but I feel like that link could have been made stronger. The readings were good. I enjoyed Dunn, Cattelino, and Ho as our larger ethnographies (Fattal fell a little flat for me) and I think the articles discussing racial capitalism were incredible. I think the seminar could use a little more instructor direction to make many of the connections to everyday life clearer and more relevant.\r\n\r\ni also think that many of the classes started to feel like they were dragging on and like we were rushed for our final project. I think it would have been better to integrate the project much earlier in the class, allotting some time at the end of each class for the project rather than lumping it all at the end.",
                "The strength of this course is the seminar discussions themselves. It is great that there exist sophomore seminars. The readings themselves were manageable and engaging. The structure of the class was also helpful and conducive to learning complex ideas, while also being fun. It was quite a change of pace from the usual hot and academically steamy nature of seminar courses.",
                "I loved how small the course is, and I felt like it really made it so everyone was engaged. I also liked how only sophomores were in the class, and we were able to create community that way. The readings were also quite engaging, and I felt like I was able to gain a holistic view of capitalism."

                "Yes. Rogers is a really wonderful and knowledgeable professor. It is really a privilege to work with him in such a small group, so I would recommend taking the class if you get the opportunity. It is also a great way to get into seminar type courses with less pressure as all students in the class are sophomores.",
                "We live in a time where capitalism is often thrown around but people rarely understand how it is created. This class definitely gives you some cultural capital at the dining hall table next time someone says \"f capitalism.\"",
                "Yes! Great introduction to ethnography!!!",
                "yes if you need a social science credit or are an anthro major!",
                "That really depends on the person I'm talking to. If they want a broader look at capitalism as a cultural practice then possibly (though this may not be the first class I recommend for that). If they're looking for a more specific way in which humanity is constructed and reproduces capitalism, then I would probably look somewhere else.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in the study of larger 'systems' (for lack of better word), not just capitalism. This course is great for non-anthropology majors and anthropology majors alike, but I encourage those willing to take a pause from they think capitalism is to understand what different ways capitalisms exist. In doing so, can one benefit from this course and enrich their understanding of the complexities of capitalism that contest reductionist thinking.",
                "Yes! No matter what major you are, this class will likely have a relation to whatever you are studying. This is such a unique course in content and in class makeup."
