                "I had already done some study of counterpoint and part writing, but I really enjoyed learning how to combine these more basic components into more complicated structures like fugues.",
                "Knowledge of Baroque tonal counterpoint in two and three parts; figured bass harmonizations; cadential progressions; writing lines of music to accompany others; fugue writing; real and tonal answer; partimento; sequences, and general rules of music theory",
                "Really in-detail knowledge of late Baroque music and working skill with counterpoint (mostly up to three voices), culminating in knowledge of composing/analyzing fugues",
                "A more intuitive understanding of Baroque harmony, fugal structure, and voice-leading.",
                "learned how to write counterpoint in the baroque style, mainly fugues",
                "I learned a ton in this course. In the first half of the semester, we focused on exploring the various topics and facets of music theory that would be applied to our work later in the semester. In the second half of the semester, we focused more on composition and writing music in the baroque style. Aside from everything new that we learned, I think my skills in other areas of music theory were strengthened as a result."

            "comments": [
                "I did not particularly see the point of the listening portion of the weekly quizzes.",
                "Strengths: very well taught and organised! The material was properly set out such that one built on the foundation each week with new information. This made writing the midterm and final projects seamless, as each assignment aptly prepared you for the next. The class had very easy to follow notes provided by the instructor, and all feedback was clear and returned promptly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very few; I would say perhaps introducing the rule of the octave a bit earlier would help with the first set of assignments.",
                "I loved the balance between composition and analysis. The two are two sides of the same coin and that was really well balanced here. I also really liked the nature of the assignments and the quizzes. They were small enough that they wouldnt feel extremely stressful but just meaningful enough to be good practice. The listening playlists too were really good with getting your ears used to the idiom, which is critical here.",
                "Strengths: Malcolm is a great teacher; he's kind, understanding, and clearly knows his subject well. I very much appreciated the class handouts provided after class, which basically synthesized everything we learned that day. I also liked that we didn't approach counterpoint in terms of strict rules, but we instead tried to gain a more intuitive understanding of what was idiomatic/not idiomatic. The workload and expectations were pretty reasonable as well. \r\nWeaknesses: Since this was a seminar, I wish there was more of a social/collaborative environment in the class. The class atmosphere could get a little dry, and there wasn't much opportunity to get to know my classmates better. Also, sometimes the grading felt slightly arbitrary, but there was not anything wildly out of place.",
                "strengths were organization- i liked the combo of lecture and then getting the handout later\r\n\r\nweakness was pacing, some classes felt like review/assignment practice while others felt like key information\r\n--instead review/in-class demos could be spread out more evenly with a little new material each day,\r\n--you can throw in some interesting side techniques like canon writing as enrichment even though we are still practicing writing a whole fugue and aren't ready to incorporate those techniques into a piece\r\n--you could also start analyzing whole fugues at the beginning of the semester and culminate with something like the art of fugue/ offertorium/ goldberg variations; this would be in parallel to much simpler model composition exercises\r\n--that way, as soon as we can write invertible subject/answer pairs, we can start plugging them into the fugal schemes which we have already analyzed for two months or so",
                "I think one of the strengths of this course was the small class size. Our classes felt much closer to a conversation than a lecture. It was extremely easy to ask questions and the professor was very accessible when help was needed. Another strength was the ability to resubmit assignments. I think the process of making corrections was helpful in terms of learning the material and becoming more skillful. Personally, the main weakness of this course was that it was more application based and less learning based. This passed semester I took music lessons for credit which require a co-requisite music theory course, and between the other classes I was registered for, MUSI 402 was one of the few co-requisite courses that fit into my schedule, and with the new option to self-place in music theory, I chose to take MUSI 402 as my co-requisite course, despite it being my first semester of freshman year. Overall, I'm glad I took the class, it was really informative and I learned a ton, but I think because it was the first music course I had taken at Yale, I lacked some of the knowledge required to really be able to apply myself in the course. Because of this, I found myself having to spend quite a bit more time on each assignment because I had to spend a lot of extra time learning material that the other students in the class were already familiar with."

                "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in Baroque Tonal counterpoint! Malcolm is an excellent teacher and was very engaged with the material; he teaches the material from the \"ground up\" so to speak, so even someone with little experience (beyond 210) can follow along easily. The class is a fair amount of work, but it's rewarding at the end to be able to look at your compositions and realise how much you've learned. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in music theory and applying Baroque counterpoint to composition.",
                "Yes, if they are at all interested in the music of the late baroque. I took the class specifically wanting to learn more about fugues, a genre that I love and am very happy with what I came away with so I would absolutely recommend to anyone with similar interests.",
