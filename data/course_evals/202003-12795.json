This course, obviously, can not cover the whole Constitution, but it covers those topics that are most relevant to our discussions today. The class was super insightful in understanding why some decisions were made and their justifications that eliminates our hindsight bias, but also learning about avenues to redress these mistakes. I have also significantly improved my writing after this class by learning how to question my assertions more widely.",

                "Professor Silverstein is an obvious strength to this class. Silverstein is incredibly knowledgeable on the topic, and provides a modern outlook on issues of constitutional law that help challenge some of the assumptions we hold. This class also rises to the name of a \"seminar\" because Silverstein allows students to participate often rather than pressing his own opinions on them. Silverstein makes time for students, and that is perhaps his biggest strength.",
                "I think the quality of the class is really dependent on the group of people in the seminar. Prof Silverstein is very nice, very approachable, very knowledgable, and will help you if you just ask. However, this class was very intimidating at times just due to the other people in the class and their insightful contributions. You just have to see if the class fits your learning style.",
                "The course was extremely engaging, the discussions were typically excellent, and the readings were great. One thing I really liked was the \"blog\" that the class ran where anyone could write a short article outlining an opinion on current events or the class material. This was a good way to hear people fully describe their ideas in a way that can't happen in a class discussion. The biggest weakness is that sometimes the reading schedule was changed close enough to a class that it would be a bit hard to plan around.",
                "I think the strength of this class is definitely the professor. Silverstein was a great professor and really knows his stuff.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings and essay prompts Weaknesses: takes too long for essays to be graded and returned",
                "A strength of this class is that each of the readings is valuable to the purpose of the course and the overall workload is very manageable. The discussions are facilitated well to provide a deeper understanding of the readings as well as their current applications.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The readings in the course are exceptionally well cultivated, with each week having a unique theme\r\n-Professor Silverstein does a phenomenal job of leading class discussions, keeping things moving in the right direction without intervening too much or cutting students off\r\n-The blog posts (which are graded and therefore compulsory) are an engaging way to reflect on class material and interact with peers in a slightly less structured environment. \r\n-The essay prompts are engaging but still manageable, and deadlines are announced well in advance.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-While not a significant issue, the readings for some weeks are longer than others. They are never unmanageable though.",
                "I think the course was strong in that the topics were very interesting and connected easily with the discussions. If you are able to devote a lot of time to the class, you will learn so much and acquire many new perspectives and an appreciation for the founding principles of the United States. A weakness is that although the class was fairly organized and Professor Silverstein upload a lot of the readings to Canvas, it was often confusing which readings we needed to complete for each class and the syllabus was not always accurate. By giving us the readings for the week instead of the class, I found myself not being able to process and get to all the readings by Tuesday, but then we wouldn't even need to have read all of those until Thursday. If it was specified what we needed for each day, I think more students would have been prepared and be able to engage in the discussion. If not, the amount of reading is very overwhelming and the discussions weren't as strong because most people had not completed the readings.",
                "Very engaging class and reading, but Zoom format made it difficult for a coherent discussion.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the material is interesting, the discussions are engaging, and the work is worthwhile. The weaknesses of the course are that sometimes the discussions are dominated by a few and there aren't too many chances to show off your understanding of the material besides discussions."

                "Without in-person interaction students could not leave class excited to finish their class discussions over cups of coffee, but Professor Silverstein provided an alternative to solve this dilemma. The chance to post blog-posts and respond to others thoughts on current politics allowed for the open forum outside of class that I thought would be excluded in the COVID-19 learning atmosphere. I enjoyed engaging with my classmates thoughts and adding my opinions to the discussion as well.",

It was a bit hard to stay focused for the entire class time since it was a long period to be on Zoom but for the most part the virtual format was not a major weakness of this specific class.",

There's a lot more thinking than there is history, though your thoughts and claims are based on writings and court cases. \r\nIf you are taking this course because you are truly interested in the topic, go for it. Those who put in the effort to do all the readings and stay engaged are well rewarded. If you are taking this course because you are looking for a So credit or because the ratings seem really high, think again. The class is only as interesting as you are engaged. The same goes for workload; if you struggle with being engaged with the topic, readings and papers become much more difficult.\r\nThat being said, this class was very intellectually stimulating and made me think a lot. I would recommend this course to students truly interested in the topic.",
                "Yes! I could not recommend this class enough, even if you are not interested in constitutional law more broadly. Professor Silverstein creates an unforgettable atmosphere in his class and is super approachable. The class allows you to question your assumptions about certain topics in law, and provides and incredible background in some foundations topics. This is a must take while at Yale.",
                "I would say shop the class to see if you want this class because it isn't for everyone. There is a lot of reading and you have to get ready to really contribute to feel fulfilled. That being said, the professor is great and really nice.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to someone interested in US government. In some ways it surveyed a lot of different topics about the United States, the constitution in particular but it was not limited to just the constitution. I think I came out of it with a greater understanding of the forces impacting American society and the role that the constitution plays.",
                "I personally did not enjoy this class. I think if you think are sincerely interested in studying the Constitution, then this is the class for you. This class taught me that I am not that interested in conlaw and I suppose that is one benefit of this course. I did not hate it, but I did not get as much enjoyment out of it as I thought I would.",

                "Yes, yes, yes. I was delighted to be able to take this course, and it was the absolute highlight of my first-semester experience at Yale. There's so much to take away from this course, whether you're interested in history, politics, law or just in American society. You'll be exposed to a fascinating set of readings, and get to interact with a tight-knit and likeminded group of classmates. The small, discussion-based nature of the class also means that it is better suited to Zoom than most.",
                "This course is very much student-led with much emphasis on discussion and analysis. I would recommend this course to another student that really wants to ask the questions about American politics they feel they have not had the chance to. Professor Silverstein is open to discussion after class and I would argue those that engage with the readings in this class more will better enjoy this course. Overtime, the reading does become more demanding, but I think it is a glimpse of the academic standards of a Yale College student, and thus, many will benefit from taking this course their freshmen year.",
                "If you are interested in law and American political theory and don't have a super rigorous schedule for the semester than yes. If you have a lot of high workload classes and are taking this as an extra elective then no. In order to actually enjoy this class it is necessary to read everything and be very engaged. If you cannot devote time to this class it is such a huge burden and not enjoyable. The readings pile up and they are not easy. If you haven't completed the readings you won't be able to participate in class and it will be very hard to pay attention. The few weeks I was able to fully process the readings I loved the class and the discussions and learned so much so I highly recommend taking it if you have time.",
