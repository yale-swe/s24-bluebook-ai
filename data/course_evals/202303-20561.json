Each week, I actively engaged in absorbing new insights about East Asian women, delving into their lives and exploring their remarkable artwork. The class sessions were thoughtfully structured, featuring extensive reading lists that not only comprehensively covered the subject matter but also included relevant materials.\r\n\r\nVisiting the museum to view the artwork proved to be an enlightening and invaluable experience, allowing me to appreciate the pieces in person and deepen my understanding of the artistic context. The course broadened my perspective by introducing me to the often-overlooked art history of women in China, Japan, and Korea. As someone of East Asian descent, I was genuinely surprised to discover many artists and works that I had not encountered or heard of before."
