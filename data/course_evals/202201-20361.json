The class is an invaluable education for any historian or would-be statesman.",

I learned how to prepare and give a presentation with less than twenty-four hours' notice.  On the softer, more important front: I learned how to be an \"empathetic\" evaluator of events, rather than a sympathetic or a critical one.  I learned a dozen frameworks for asking the question: what do you do when there are no good choices, and you must do something?"

                "Strengths: Paul Kennedy. It's. Paul. Kennedy. Take the class for him. He is an astonishing historian who has incredible insights. He also is just a quite funny, if in an understated way, storyteller and his tangents or diversions alone make the class worth it. Also, frankly, this is the only course like it at Yale that teaches you how to look at the big picture of strategy and functions as a deep dive into Grand Strategy using the interwar period as a case study. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: if you think this is a seminar, you are wrong. Basically Kennedy just talks to you for an hour, then 3 students each give 20 min presentations (which are quite fun to prepare), and then maybe 1 or 2 comments from the class. Thats it so if you feel the compulsive need to talk, don't take this class. However, I thought this was in the end a strength! After all, its more Paul Kennedy. Isn't that what you wanted?",
                "Listening to Prof Kennedy is always a joy. This course is barely a seminar though, really just the prof talking a lot and some student presentations which can be frustrating for some.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kennedy was an amazing seminar leader. He was funny, interesting, and thought-provoking. One day after class my friend and I dashed to the nearest coffee shop to jot down some anecdotes/ideas that he had said. I thought to myself how crazy this was  two college students furiously trying to write down everything our instructor had said because we didnt want to ever forget it.\r\nWeaknesses: The only weaknesses here were German mobilization, the class was perfect.",
                "The course needs more discussion, and less of Prof. Kennedy musing about random topics. The readings need to be better prioritized.",
                "I would rely less on student presentations"

                "If you like strategy, history, or just good stories, take this class already. Paul Kennedy is a national treasure, and he teaches you way more than anyone else ever will about strategy and what it means to be a historian. He's also just an excellent professor, who cares about his students, and may periodically invite you to tea and cookies! The class is fantastic, though you don't talk much its basically just Kennedy talking to you. If you can accept that, however, its excellent it basically means for 2 hour a week you can lean back, relax a bit, and just ponder history and the hard choices you would have to make if you were leading France in 1936. You will certainly walk away with more sympathy for the politicians of the period. You will also walk away far better prepared for the complex and difficult world we face today.\r\n\r\nTake the class. It's. Paul. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nI will say you do have to write a 22 page final paper. That is a real pain. But it made me more prepared for my thesis, and frankly the work during the rest of the seminar is quite light.",
                "If you are curious about international relations, military balance, or WW2, this class will be rewarding.",
                "Yes. The course matter is interesting and you have one of the most brilliant historians completely willing to meet/advise you.",
