                "A strong foundation in elementary Chinese vocabulary, pronunciation, and translation. Additionally, a foundational preparation in radicals and history that are invaluable to future Chinese study.",
                "I was constantly somewhat in awe of the speed at which we learned Chinese in this class. We moved at a constant breakneck pace through the lessons in the textbook, but didn't sacrifice much depth along the way, so I feel like I have a solid understanding of not only the characters and sounds themselves, but also some usage details of the expressions we've learned, and an appreciable amount of grammar. There was a lot of emphasis on sentence structures and grammatical constructions, which helped organize our knowledge and helped us form reasonably complex and logical sentences, which was another skill I'll carry into my further Chinese studies. Also, our pronunciation was pretty strictly critiqued, so the foundations I started building in this class will be stronger for it moving forward.",
                "I feel that my Chinese proficiency has improved much more than I initially expected. Through this class, I gained a new and positive perspective and attitude toward learning the language, and wish to continue taking it further in my academic career.",
                "This class taught me how to efficiently self-study and to also reach out to outside sources for help and studying.",
                "I learned a great introduction to Chinese and my accent and intuition for the grammar improved tremendously.",
                "I gained an understanding of basic Chinese grammar and vocabulary. I now have a good foundation for more advanced Chinese classes. I can read simple paragraphs and hold basic conversations.",
                "Learned introductory knowledge of Mandarin Chinese: speaking, grammar, writing, culture, etc...",
                "Basic speaking, reading, writing, and listening in Chinese. Topics such as introducing yourself, hobbies, shopping, and transportation were covered"

                "Strengths: Small class sizes with high levels of engagement every day, fast-paced learning, lenient grading, strong cultural incorporation, and fair exams based with no surprises. It is very clear that the point of the course is learning rather than receiving a certain grade.",
                "Overall, this course was very strong and quite well organized. One thing is that it would be great if updated slideshows from class were posted on the course website or Canvas page  that way we could go back and do exercises that we inevitably skip over in class due to lack of time, and also go practice old exercises in preparation for exams.",
                "The class was very engaging and exciting every day. I genuinely cannot think of any weaknesses in the course.",
                "I think the strengths to this class was the effort and support from Professor Li. She made sure that if you needed help she would be there and could find you more help through TA hours and etc. I personally don't think there were any weaknesses.",
                "Very rigorous, class was fast paced and interesting every day. I think there should be a higher emphasis on writing characters.",
                "One strength is frequent participation. Students are given many opportunities to read aloud to the class, which helps develop reading and pronunciation skills. The homework load is medium\/high, but manageable and the homework is highly relevant to the lessons. The main thing that could be improved is making the lessons less formulaic. The structure of each week is identical, which can sometimes be tedious.",
                "Always engaged with the students directly, which facilitates effective language learning.",
                "Strengths: There is not enough space on this form for the strengths of this class. It's engaging, fun, you get to learn a real world skill, bond with your classmates. It is hard in the best way. Personally, I was a complete beginner when I started this class and it definitely did not come easily to me but this was still one of my favorite courses this semester. My professor () was AMAZING. You will may not be ready for real world conversations after this class (I am not) but you will have made some significant progress toward that goal.\r\nWeaknesses: None"

                "Without a doubt; any student interested in learning Chinese would be doing themselves a disservice by not doing so during their time at Yale. The Chinese department cannot be rivaled by any peer institution.",
                "If you want to learn Chinese, yes. It's not like the course will consume your entire schedule, but it is a significant commitment, and though I risk repeating the clich, you really do get out of it what you put in, and that can and will be a surprising amount if you put care into the class. The pace is fast but usually exhilarating (the textbook and the class drills do a good job of keeping things interesting), and the regular cadence of homework and assessments actually becomes a boon because you know exactly what to expect and when to expect it.",
                "Yes. If anyone has even the slightest interest in learning Chinese I suggest they start here.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I think learning Chinese is really cool and very interesting to learn. The workload may be a lot for some but I think it's very doable.",
                "Yes. This course is very engaging and practical.",
                "Yes, I would.",
                "I would recommend this course. This is my most difficult class, but it is also my most rewarding. Though I have much left to learn, I have improved a lot in one semester.",
                "Yes, if you intend on learning Mandarin Chinese, this course teaches it very well through direct interaction with classmates and the instructor.",
                "YES!! Take this class. It is well structured and you will learn a lot! It is definitely challenging and requires a decent amount of work, but it is worth it. The classroom environment was amazing, looked forward to class almost every day."
