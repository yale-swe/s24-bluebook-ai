In terms of direct, hands-on skills: I learned how to shoot photos on a film camera with film, how to develop film, how to use a dark room, how make prints and wash prints with film, special silver paper, and an enlarger. We also had a wonderful opportunity to be introduced to a wide array of photographic styles, as well as the history of photography, and had visiting artists, and go to the special arts collection. Most importantly, this class taught me how to better think like a photographer and make compelling photos. I learned how to think more deeply about composition and subject, and push myself into new areas of photo taking.",

Ben had such a great way to bringing excitement and energy to the class room, had a real way of identifying how to identify great creative directions for your work. If you can take it with Ben, you must. \r\n\r\nBeyond that, I really improved my photo taking skills, and learned how to think about composition and using light to make more compelling photos than when I began. The amount of growth was tremendous!",
