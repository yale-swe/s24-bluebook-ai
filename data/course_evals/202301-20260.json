                "This class was very interesting. It was super impactful to be in a mostly female environment and I learned a lot about not only the history of childbirth practices but how medical practices intersect with social and political culture.",
                "Provides a pretty in depth overview of the history of childbirth over time in the United States, covering colonial times to the present. Although not a writing class per se, it does provide some significant help with writing historical papers, and Prof. Tannenbaum provides a decent amount of feedback on assignments.",
                "We took a deep dive into childbirth and what defined a good birth and motherhood throughout history",
                "In-depth knowledge of childbirth history alongside a development of science throughout the past 200 years; honed my writing skills.",

            "comments": [
                "Absolutely loved the course and the discussion that came with it. Professor Tannenbaum was amazing at facilitating discussion and giving us thought provoking questions to lead our train of thought. The only weakness of the course was the relatively repetitive readings in the middle of the semester. I wish there was more variety when it came to talking about midwives/we talked about other aspects of childbirth.",
                "This course was one of the best I have taken at Yale so far. The group of students was amazing and created an environment where everyone could share and where people could respectfully disagree and even have their minds changed (which is how it should be but often is not). The course is laid out very thoughtfully, and there are plenty of chances to get Professor Tannenbaum's feedback. The only weakness is the workload, which is about a book a week plus weekly discussion posts and a few papers. However, I think that the workload was manageable if you worked for it, and I think that there was a lot of value in all the material we covered.",
                "Strengths: The subject material is fascinating, and the class discussions were such a beautiful blend of personal thoughts and feelings on childbirth with academic material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have loved a little bit more feedback on my papers! Grading was not too harsh but could sometimes feel sort of arbitrary. I'd also note that the language in the course often feels a little bit trans-exclusionary --- this is definitely tricky territory to navigate given that many of the texts we read were themselves dated, but I think the course could benefit dramatically from having a class later in the semester devoted to birthing parents that don't identify as women.",
                "The idea and foundation of the class are very very good. I think the course could be improved by shortening some of the readings. Many of the readings were quite long (almost 300 pages in one week), which made it hard to not skim the readings, Since the readings sometimes repeated themselves, it could be helpful to choose some of the best chapters in the book rather than the entire book.",
                "Strengths, the discussions were quite engaging! \r\n\r\nWeakness: i wish we incorporated more material about childbirth in the trans community and birthing technologies. I also wish we spoke about childbirth in black communities outside of the context of slavery and struggling",
                "More diverse set of authors! Discussion of trans and queer childbirth.",
                "Strengths: Provides a very good overview of the history of midwifery and obstetrics in America. I think the analysis of primary sources like Martha Ballard's diary was really fascinating and enriching. I also really liked our field trips to the medical library.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course didn't tell the stories of many different American women, like immigrants, Indigenous women, and Latina women. The professor seemed aware of these holes, but there was no evidence of her trying to rectify them in the syllabus. Though there may not be entire books written on this subject due to a lack of documentation surrounding these groups, there certainly are at least essays or book chapters that the professor could include. I think, broadly, the syllabus could benefit from a greater diversity of readings from different sources instead of just the handful of books we read over the semester. I would have liked to see more essays, for instance. This would have made the weekly readings more approachable and would have brought more subjects for discussion in class as well as giving us the chance to read the works of more diverse authors. I also think that class could have been slightly more structured. I really liked our somewhat rambling discussions, but I think I could have taken more away from the course if they had a bit more of a framework."

                "Yes! Great HSHM seminar, especially for someone who has never taken a seminar before.",
                "Yes! Professor Tannenbaum is great and has designed a great class. Even if you aren't really interested in birth, you will be by the end of the course! She does a wonderful job of tying childbirth to greater social and historical context, along with brief discussions of how this plays out today. She also does a great job of teaching you how to do historical research and write historically, so if you are new to that, do not fear! The workload is heavy, but I think all of the readings were enjoyable and found the work rewarding. Overall, TAKE THIS CLASS!",
                "Yes! I learned so, so much about the history of childbirth and how it interacts with gender, race, class etc. It felt like I was learning about this gigantic piece of history that had been totally, conscpicuously absent from my education previously. I truly think everyone should take this class -- especially those who are interested in going into medicine.",
