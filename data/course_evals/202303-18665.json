                "I learned a lot about American political systems in general in this class, which was a very helpful overall. This class clearly illustrates the limitations of the American political system as it relates to climate policy. It provided many opportunities to learn from your peers and covered a wide variety of topics (e.g., climate policy and national security). Overall, it gave great exposure to American environmental policy.",
                "I learned more about the dynamics of the United States political system and how they impede US climate policy. One of the most valuable insights I gained was about polarization (or lack thereof) in the United States."

                "The readings were very interesting and comprehensive. I also enjoyed listening to other students present their work. I think the only weakness of the course is that the lectures can get repetitive at times.",
                "I found the argument papers fun, and the content is very interesting. Professor Swenson is also a very kind man. Weaknesses: the course format was a mini-lecture followed by student presentations, and it was often quite time-constrained. Also, the take-home final exam was a twelve-page essay, which can eb a lot if you are doing other final exam tasks.",
                "Strengths: I absolutely loved the structure of the course and the diverse array of readings Professor Swenson put together - truly learned so much! Loved the presentation structure within each class in engaging different students on a given week\r\nWeaknesses: at times a bit disorganized, but never to the point of affecting classes",
                "unorganized, unclear about units, unclear about assignment grading",
                "This class is fantastic. I found the leminar format to be very engaging, and the assignments left room for creativity. Professor Swenson led his discussions with thoughtful questions.",
                "The course was engaging through the presentions that all students did all throughout the semester. This helped students really dive into different perspectives and units.",
                "The general introduction to American political institutions in the start of the course was very helpful. I also appreciated the breadth of the course and the readings which were very comprehensive. The class atmosphere was very comfortable, and the student presentations were very interesting.",
                "Strengths: I liked the style of readings in this class. It was interesting to read news articles, given the issues covered were present-day problems.\r\nWeaknesses/improvements: I wish this class had been a true seminar. I think students could have learned more and taken more out of the course if there was room for and encouragement of discussion. I think this would also push students to more fully engage with the readings. I also felt as though the professor was looking for us to reflect his point of view in our writing."

I left this class feeling hopeless about environmental politics and discouraged to pursue a career in this discipline  nearly all solutions raised in this course or in written assignments were shot down as infeasible."
