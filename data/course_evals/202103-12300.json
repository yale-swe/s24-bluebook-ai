                "I learned about current issues in public health, global health, and science journalism. Topics ranged from Covid-19 to tobacco companies, bioethics, reporting new scientific research, vaccine hesitancy, and crisis response.",
                "I learned how to read and analyze scientific literature and media articles and how to critically think about issues in medicine and public health.",
                "I learned how to better interpret detailed scientific articles and develop tools to make them understandable by lay people.",
                "This is truly an inspirational class for me. It made me want to become a leader of public health. I mean, analyzing such vast issues of public health while also having a platform to discuss with other peers made me realize the sincerity and dedication of those in public health. I learned about the shady inner-workings of our healthcare system but also the immediate need for help. From transplants, to COVID, to HIV, to smoking, to ethics, there was just so much to discuss and read about. I learned how to better understand medical literature. But I also learned how to interact with medical professionals better as well."

            "comments": [
                "I think the premise of this course is incredible and important, especially in this public health environment. That being said, the course was organized very poorly and there was no concrete curriculum or grading policy. Everyone in the class was confused about the expectations for the class. We had 2 quizzes and 2 papers. The papers were fine, although again the expectations were not very clear. The quizzes, on the other hand, were very poorly managed. We had loose discussions over the course of the semester, which mostly culminated in very surface level discussion where we agreed yes! this is a problem! When asked what the quizzes would be on, the professor simply said everything or I dont know. With no knowledge of what he was supposedly testing, it was difficult to study or even really learn anything.",
                "Strengths: The material was good. Readings and in-class discussions were interesting. Had a few great guest speakers. Weaknesses: Prof Bazell was not extremely excited to interact with his students. The class was kind of monotonous. The actual grading diverged quite a bit from the syllabus, and there wasn't much feedback throughout the course.",
                "didn't discuss all the readings that we did so it felt like we had many readings for no reason",
                "Strengths: this course covered a lot of interesting and widespread topics, we had a lot of speakers come to speak about various topics, we didn't spend too much time on each topic so a lot of topics were addressed. Our papers allowed us to explore topics we are genuinely passionate about, which was really exciting. Weaknesses: our conversations were very limited and often features someone presenting an idea, rather than a class-wide discussion. We were asked to provide discussion topics before class, but those were rarely used or were briefly touched on at the end of class.",
                "This course did a great job in brining in a variety of different case studies that expanded my understanding of public health issues. The course also had a variety of different ways for students to engage with the work and exercise their understanding. The course was somewhat weakened by the lack of structure that was initially inviting to have a a more broad range of topics, but turned into a disengaging atmosphere. This could be improved by having a more robust and detailed rubric.",
                "The strengths were the diverse content, the cool skits and modes of explaining material, and the freedom in the writings. There needs to be more graded content and sort of a disciplined system of coursework and quizzes. Also, more direct feedback from the instructor about our place in the class, on our essays, and not just giving us letter grades at random."

                "I am immensely interested in the topics, but I didn't have a good time taking this course, so...",
                "Yes, this is a good course to take if you are genuinely interested in learning about the topics covered in class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are self motivated and are able to keep up with the readings in preparation for class.",
                "I highly recommend this course as an intro level public health class to someone mildly interested in the field. It does provide us with the necessary tools to take more advanced courses to discover more about the state of public health in the world."
