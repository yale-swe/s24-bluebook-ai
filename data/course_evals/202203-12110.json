Over all, course taught a very comprehensive range of modeling techniques and was a great introduction to chaos theory. PSETs were of a perfect workload if you have previous experience in Python or MATLAB."

Not only is the subject matter super interesting, the Prof. Korenaga is a genius and has a great sense of humor. This is a bit of a \"dark horse\" class that few have taken, but provides a really great introduction to modeling various systems.",
