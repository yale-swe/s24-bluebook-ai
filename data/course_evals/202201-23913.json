                "I learned more about Latin American Revolutions and how they relate with each other. I also learned more about the indigenous, slave, and loyalist aspects of the American Revolutions. While taking this class, I learned more about how to search for primary sources and evaluate them.",
                "I got better at evaluating primary sources and writing essays and responses. I also got better at reading secondary historical texts.",
                "I learned about the age of revolutions in the Atlantic world. I also did primary source research at the Beineke archives for the first time.",
                "Strong foundational knowledge concerning the American, Haitian, and various Latin American independence movements through the perspective of the Atlantic World, and how to conduct research in the Beinecke",
                "Archival research, historiography, writing for history in general",
                "Through taking this course I began to investigate the web of interconnectivity between Europe, Africa, and the Americas that defined the Atlantic world, and how these connections influenced the makeup and the outcome of wars for independence across North and South America. I found the makings of the Atlantic world; through the African slave trade, imperial conquest of indigenous lands, and the evolution of the political, economic, and cultural identity of these colonies heartbreaking yet essential to study, and I appreciate the factual and in-depth treatment we gave to this unit. I'm fascinated by the Haitian revolution  especially how the interplay between Haitian ex-slaves, Black generals, white colonists, officials from the French Republic, and the influence of Spain and Britain impacted the evolution of the only successful large-scale slave revolution, how Haiti established itself as a nation, and how the meaning of the revolution was interpreted by different economic classes and different racial groups throughout the Americas and in Europe, and I hope to continue studying this aspect of the history of the Age of Revolutions. Writing our investigative papers taught me how to use the resources in the Beinecke. It taught me how to research primary sources detailing a historical event and place the event, its interpretations, and its historical significance in the context of a globalized Atlantic world during the Age of Revolutions. I used these skills in my final paper to analyze how revolutionary movements practice diplomacy with European and regional Western powers throughout their wars for independence and compare and contrast how the goals of these revolutions  and the socio-racial-economic makeup of its constituents  influenced how the Atlantic world viewed these revolutions and ultimately the outcome of these wars for independence. I will continue to hone these skills in future investigative classes and in my own inquiries into the history of the Age of Revolutions.",

            "comments": [
                "I think that a strength is how the different concepts of the revolutions are introduced and are presented so that the connections between them can be readily interpreted. The course could be improved by giving more general contextualization to the Latin American Revolutions, because most people do not have previous knowledge about them.",
                "I really liked all the things we did. To some degree for the Haitian revolution, and definitely for the Latin American revolutions I had very little knowledge of the basics of what happened, so it was difficult to come up with more complicated thoughts about the readings. Some background on the facts of what happened would have been nice, potentially from something like a book to read\/video to watch before the course started or a quick student presentation.",
                "Doing our own research and many of the readings were really interesting. I sometimes found the class format to be repetitive because it was always just a discussion of the readings.",
                "All around a very strong course. Although the entire class is spent on seminar discussion with input from the professor. It would have been nice to have presentations or an introduction to the topic besides the readings.",
                "Great weakness of the course is it assumes a level of knowledge on the subject that most students did not have. It was really cool to examine and discuss original documents in a classroom setting, but I feel that the discussion would have been improved had there been one or two class periods per revolution devoted to lecture on the subject to give an overview to discuss from. Perhaps not necessary with American revolution though. The strengths were the discussions when there was that level of understanding, some really cool ideas were unpacked.",
                "This course did a phenomenal job of juxtaposing different revolutions and movements for independence to see how they compare, how our perception of their historical significance and impact is influence by the goals of these revolutions and how they were perceived by the international community, and how the outcome of these movements influenced the structure of the region in question immediately after gaining independence and throughout its history afterwards. The biweekly seminar style discussions helped us learn from other's interpretation of the readings, which gives a new perspective on the event of study. The reading load for some weeks was pretty heavy, and as such we often didn't discuss the bulk of the reading. Spreading out some of the readings would help broaden discussions to encompass a wide range of important topics while also enabling students to begin to trace common themes between readings and historical events that would help frame discussions and inspire papers.",
                "The discussion format for this class was excellent, and the amount of time that we got to spend in the Beinecke Library doing research was eye opening. I think that the general progression of Revolutions is very logical and helpful, I just think we could spend less classes on the American Revolution since most people are already familiar with it. I think it would be good to have a class on the general outline of the Bolivarian campaigns, as well as another class on the independence movement in Brazil."

                "Yes, I would really recommend this course. We were able to learn a lot about not just the revolutions themselves but the various actors within them such as indigenous peoples, slaves and freedmen, and loyalists. Learning about the roles of these actors enrichens out understanding of the revolutions. Along with this, going to the Beinecke was a great opportunity to become accustomed to working with primary sources.",
                "Yes, I think this is a great course, and a great way to get accustomed to looking at Beineke materials and reading historical texts. When I took it, the course was also quite small, which meant each person had a lot of time to speak (and you will probably get in if you rank it)",
                "Professor Echeverri is great and the readings are interesting. However, be prepared to not be able to finish all of the readings because it is a lot of pages per week!",
                "Yes, it is a very approachable and accessible introduction to Latin American history and research at Yale. The writing assignments are very doable with great feedback from the professor.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! The course material is fascinating, class discussions are insightful, and the workload is not too much for a history first year seminar. Doing research in the Beinecke was a fantastic experience and one that I would definitely recommend to everyone. At the end of the course I gained a more profound understanding of the events, processes, and people that shaped the outcome of revolutions and wars for independence across the Americas, and how the impact of these movement shapes the identity of the nations today. Overall, this was an amazing course that I'd recommend to anyone with even a small interest in the history of the Americas, the history of slavery, and the study of revolutionary movements.",
                "Absolutely. A very useful pre-industrial history seminar that gives a good sense of the Atlantic world during the age of Revolutions. Even if you are not from the region or have no background experience with it, it is very easy to understand the concepts because the professor explains them very well."
