                "I learned so much more from this class than I ever imagined I would. It's not an easy A, but taking it is so rewarding in so many ways. It covers all the physics of major weather events, atmospheric circulation and structure, oceanic circulation and the impacts of humans on these delicate systems. It scratches the surface of climate change but doesn't really get too far into it depending on how the first half of the semester is paced. I think the most valuable skill I got from this course was the ability to combine the quantitative and qualitative elements of Earth's natural systems.",

                "How to comprehend physics formulas and discuss their importance in the dynamics of the global weather systems, of oceanography, and global warming. I greatly improved my unit conversion skills. I deeply understand the forces that are acting on earth to produce global phenomenons.",

                "I learned a lot about the earths atmosphere and oceans. I developed better QR skills and made use of office hours.",
                "This course gave an overview of the science behind the atmosphere, weather, and the oceans. We also learned briefly about the paleoclimate and the science of modern climate change. In particular, I learned a lot about the physics of clouds and storm systems, the physics of ocean currents, and interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean.",
                "A sound understanding of the foundations of environmental science, atmosphere, and climate change.",

We spent less time on the oceans than the atmosphere, but the ocean weeks were an excellent overview of oceanography. We only spent one week on human caused climate change, but it was also very informative. The course heavily focuses on the quantitative aspects of topics and the atmosphere portion in particular contains a lot of math and graphs. I found that the math gave me a much better understanding of the course topics and it was nice when professor Lora switched to the chalkboard from slideshows.",

            "comments": [
                "This course's strengths include how engaging it is, its accessibility to non-STEM majors, and Professor Lora's offering of a Q&A session before each exam. One recommendation I can make would be for the syllabus to make mention of the grading curve in the syllabus. I think it is assumed that students will expect a curve, but since a curve is not employed in all classes, not everyone assumed it, making a poor average on the first midterm exceptionally stressful until the curve was mentioned mid-way through the term.",
                "I think that the material was overall taught in a decent manner but giving more examples would be useful to the learning process. I also think that this course could benefit from being a bit more accessible. The lectures not being recorded and all things written on the board not being published on canvas means that missing even one class could ruin your understanding of concepts. Overall the professor was inflexible and unapproachable.",
                "This course is great, if you're a STEM major, probably. It's definitely not a QR/Sc gut. You'll learn a ton of information, but it's hard. Exams were made even harder by the fact that there were never any review problems posted before the exam, and we weren't able to see the formula sheets before the exams. We were reassured that everything we'd need would be on the sheet, but sometimes were were formulas we were just expected to know. I think they fixed the sheet for the final.",
                "The class was too broad, we covered and were tested on an overwhelming amount of information. I felt that I wasn't learning and more memorizing numbers, formulas and information to dispose of it after the exams. The professor did not have sympathy for his students' understanding of the content, he cared more about covering every topic briefly. I had to go back and teach myself almost every topic we covered in lecture. The strength of this class was the textbook we used, it was much easier to understand the content than the lectures. The Teaching Assistants were not helpful either, they barley understood the topics in office hours and were not much help. It felt like this course was setting its students up to fail, and judging by the exam grades the entire class was struggling.",
                "The course is structured in a good way. However, presentations are basically collections of some random photos the previous instructor took. I think that presentations could be more informative because now they don't make any sense. The problem sets for this course were absolutely terrible. Sometimes they asked very concrete things asked in the lecture and not mentioned anywhere else. The whole course was simply one huge frustration. The only thing which helped is the same Yale course posted 10 years ago on YouTube.",
                "The average scores for all of the midterms were very low, and I think it was because it was difficult to prepare for the exams. It felt like even if you studied, it didn't pay off on the exams. There were no practice problems or clear topics to focus on, so basically everything was fair game. A lot of the important material was not on the slides and was instead mentioned briefly in lecture or written on the board, so you had to rely on your own notes to study. I think that there needs to be more notes and practice problems available for students to use to study.",
                "This course could be improved by focusing more on explaining topics and less about rushing through to get to all the units. The teaching fellows also often gave incorrect answers for questions on problem sets.",
                "One strength is the variety of material that we learned. Another strength is that we had review sessions for exams. One improvement would be to have sections for review.",
                "This course gives a very good overview of the physics of the atmosphere and ocean. I also learned a lot about how different weather phenomena occur, such as freezing rain, snow, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes, which was fascinating. All of the problem sets are doable and add a lot to my understanding. The one small weakness of the class is that there are not posted notes or practice problems for a fraction of the content (especially at the beginning of the semester), which can make it slightly harder to review. However, this class was still very enjoyable overall.",
                "The professor goes incredibly fast. Although the lectures are interesting, the speed of the class makes it almost impossible to catch everything.",
                "The class seems pretty well suited to those within this major, so I cannot comment on how it could be improved. It is quite difficult for those who do not have science or math inclinations, such as myself.",
                "Strengths: Juan Lora is a great, engaging instructor. Subject matter was very interesting and presented in detail.\r\nWeaknesses: a few more demonstrations/videos/real life examples would be cool to give context to what we are learning",
                "The lectures are thoughtfully-organized, well-paced, very accessible to people of different backgrounds, while being closely linked to the textbook. Professor Lora does a wonderful job at explaining concepts with clarity and precision. One of the best STEM lecture class I have taken!",
                "If the lectures were online it would be nice--even just slides. Also if the correct answers to the psets and midterms were posted that would be nice too.",
                "I thought it was a really good course overall although I do wish the slideshows that accompanied lecture had a few more key words/descriptions as opposed to some stretches of only pictures",
                "Weaknesses - three midterms and a final is a lot, and I would have preferred to have less exams and exams to be weighted less in favor of an extra three days of class and learning \r\n\r\nStrengths - we covered a lot of material and I felt consistently engaged and that I had a good grasp on the subject by the end.",
                "Some crucial formulae were missing from slides posted on Canvas, which made it hard to study for exams.",
                "The course provided a good overview of atmospheric science but could have been more engaging",
                "I learned a lot of helpful information during lectures, especially regarding the atmosphere. The ocean section of the class is very brief, in comparison. However, the course structure is not the most helpful and the instructor appears to be dismissive of student comments.",
                "The structure of lecture and sparseness of slides is not conducive to student learning. The formulas and essential quantitative aspects of the class are just mentioned once in lecture and there is no way to find or refer to notes from class. It would be helpful if there was more intention or clear communication about what material was important.",
                "Weakness was they were very picky about the way you worded things, like on test if you didnt use the right wording but yet you still explained the concept correctly take would still take lots of points off ie 13/16\r\n\r\nYou never knew what was going to be on the test so youre studying a lot of material and most of it wasnt going to be on the test since the exams were like 5 questions.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is professor Lora. He is an interesting and very knowledgable lecturer. I also thought the TFs were very helpful in office hours. I think this course could be improved slightly in its pace. We missed out on the last week of the syllabus due to time constraints and I think if the midterms were done outside of class, we could have made it.",
                "Strengths: the topics are interesting, the textbook is super helpful. Professor Lora also has great content knowledge and feedback on psets was helpful each week. I also think the concepts are well organized for understanding.\r\nWeaknesses: The P-sets felt very representative of work done in class but the exams were difficult (often timing). It was hard to know exactly what to prepare for each exam (other than attempting to review the entire syllabus which isn't efficient) which I think showed in student performance. Having practice exam problems would have been really helpful for the quantitative aspects and perhaps a guided review session on concepts to study would be helpful for the qualitative aspects. This is because the course covers a lot of ground and the exams were graded with an eye to specificity so if you missed a detail and it was on the exam it would have a large impact. \r\n In the beginning there were variations between TAs and what support was being provided/how prepared they were to field student questions -- this bettered over time but was still a bit rough at first when students were trying to figure out how to do well on psets.",
                "Due to some mental and physical health issues, I was unable to participate much and ended up failing in class. \r\n\r\nI was interested in the course topics and the processes we learned but I just unfortunately took. this class at a bad time in my life."

                "This course is phenomenal. Don't think twice before registering for it. Problem sets will be difficult, but Professor Lora is open to brief discussion about them privately after class, so if you have a clarifying question, he can answer it for you.",
                "Not unless it's a major requirement. This course was overall far more difficult than it was worth and missing even one class made me feel like I lost all of the understanding that I had of the topics covered. The professor seemed uninterested in teaching the material and overall uninterested in being there.",
                "Yes!! I loved this course and the content that was taught.",
                "I wouldn't recommend it to another humanities major like me. I've never taken an EPS or Physics class before in high school or at Yale, and I thought that this would be an easier introduction to planetary sciences that I could use to fulfill a QR credit. It was really hard. I spent hours studying for every test only to get 60s and 70s, which was a bummer! The class overall was way harder and way more work than I expected, way more quantitative than qualitative. There was also so much information covered that I really struggled to keep track of. Lots of things to memorize.",
                "NOT A GUT! I had to teach myself most of the enormously broad topics we covered. The p-sets were difficult and the exams were even more so. The professor did not let us use notes or give us formulas in the formation we were taught. The information at the end of the semester was even more rushed and the final midterm a week before the final felt unnecessary and stressful. There was no possible way for a students to understand the entirety of the content. The course should be just atmospheres, the oceans and climate change segments were very rushed.",
                "No. Absolutely no.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are familiar with the geological aspect of the earth",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially a student who has some past experience with physics. The class is doable without past physics experience and only requires a knowledge of algebra, but having previous physics knowledge can be helpful. The physics of the atmosphere and ocean was very fascinating to learn about and helped me understand common weather phenomena that I had experienced.",
                "No. It is very interesting material and the professor shows lots of knowledge, but there is too much material to cover is such little time.",
                "Only if you intend to go into earth or planetary sciences. The course is fascinating, but it is very, very, difficult if you struggle with quantitative-based assignments. Concepts were easy to grasp, calculations were quite difficult.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the subject matter - I loved it. Keep in mind though that there is a lot of math!",
                "YES! The class has a lot to offer while being very accessible to everyone. Topics are super interesting too, if you want to learn more about clouds and oceans and ice cores!",
                "If they were interested in the topic then I think it is a very good class.",
                "I definitely would! Interesting and knowledge applicable to day to day life",
                "Yes, but only to a student planning on studying environmental science or EPS because of the heavy workload and the tough grading.",
                "Not a QR gut and not that well facilitated to learning.",
                "Absolutely, the course is exactly as advertised.",
                "If the course is taught by the same instructor, I would recommend taking it credit/D/Fail. The overall structure of the course is not great, and I would not recommend it to a first-year entering college. There are no study guides or recordings, grading is unnecessarily harsh, and the review sessions are hosted less than a day before the midterms. I did gain some useful knowledge regarding the subject, and it would have been a much more enjoyable experience if there isn't such a big mismatch between a high effort/vast amount of time spent and a low reward.",
                "I would not recommend it to other humanities students like myself.",
                "If you want to have good grades then do not take course",
                "If you want to understand how weather works, I would definitely take this class. The class provides a nice overview of the ocean-atmosphere system and the math behind it. I also think that understanding earth's climate system from a quantitative perspective is valuable for anyone passionate about climate change.",
                "I would say yes if you are an evst/eps major but probably not for someone looking for a science/qr (unless you're okay/comfortable with pursuing a credit d because if you struggle or have a rough spot this class will become a stressor). You will learn a lot and I'm really glad I challenged myself to take a course outside of my comfort zone (as someone with little background in eps) but the grading and exams ended up taking more mental space than engaging with the content. The pacing is really fast both in lecture and tests which is not ideal and it was hard to know what to cover for exams because it was often suggested to review every concept which was not an efficient means of studying. If you do take it, I also really recommend supplementing with youtube videos (from week 1 onwards, build it into your schedule) to bolster some of the concepts as lectures move quickly."
