                "I learned how to assess passages from the Bible more critically, which allowed for me to grow aware of the influences of literary choices in the books as well as better understand how this contributed to the messaging of different parts of the Bible.",
                "It was a privilege to take this course with Professor Brisman. I developed an appreciation for the complexity of the Bible from a literary perspective that has enriched my relationship with it. People came to this course with different levels of familiarity with the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament; some had no prior experience and others had a lot. Everyone was very respectful and engaged with the discussion. I had grown up with the Bible in Sunday School, but I had always passively absorbed the stories without considering the competing voices telling them and the historical context and pressures that the authors faced. One of the most illuminating exercises we performed regularly was to read a set of verses aloud in three different translations, and to see how the translator's addition of a single word could completely reverse the meaning in one of the translations. Professor Brisman then swooped in with the original Hebrew or Greek phrase, and explained the meanings and ambiguities offered by the original text that were lost in translation. He supplemented biblical passages with anecdotes from his life and current events that made ancient stories feel particularly relevant. Thanks to this course, I feel confident in my ability to critically analyze and appreciate the Bible. I don't know if I would have ever had another opportunity to obtain these skills outside of this course. The insights I gained in this course will stay with me for the rest of my life.",

                "Probably one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Certainly the most engaging. No weaknesses that I can think of.",
                "This course was structured in such a way that facilitated wonderful discussions of specific passages in the Bible. I also appreciated that this course did not inherently require existing knowledge of the Bible and was discussed in a purely literary sense. I also appreciated that it was not too difficult to meet with the professor one-on-one to discuss individualized questions. \r\n\r\nI think that the greatest weakness of this course is that not enough time was dedicated to essay production, which was ultimately the decider of ones grade. Although the feedback on each essay would be thorough and quite helpful, it seemed strange that participation in class discussions did not factor into ones performance in the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Brisman is an expert on the Bible and provides in-the-moment translations of the original Hebrew and Greek and explains the scholarly and religious receptions of specific passages. The other students were dedicated to the course. Professor Brisman also accepted and gave detailed feedback on drafts of every essay. He made himself very available to meet with all of us for office hours. He clearly cares very much about the course and about the students. Weaknesses: none."

                "I feel as if words can insufficiently express my gratitude for the absolute treasure of a learning experience I enjoyed this semester as a student in Brisman's Bible as Literature course. This course was everything I was hoping it would be and more. The Bible, such a hotly-contested, enigmatic, tragic, romantic, despairing, optimistic, cruel, and compassionate text all at once is a staple of Western intellectual, literary, and, most significantly, theological history that every student ought to wrestle with. And man, how many people get it wrong! Brisman, although not being one to toot his own horn, is one of those who gets it right. Don't believe me, take the course and see for yourself.",
                "ONLY take this course if you are actually interested in close analysis and comparison of specific Bible passages. If you're looking for a general overview take the lecture",
                "yes, absolutely. this is a must-take for anyone who is interested in the abrahamic faiths in any capacity.",
                "Definitely. This is one of the must take courses at Yale. Everyone who can take it should.",
                "This is a wonderful course, and I would recommend it to any course. The way that it is conducted facilitates enlightening discussions. However, I would recommend either taking it for credit or auditing, as the grading on essays is rather harsh, and ones grade is determined effectively by performance on two of three essays (making each one rather high-stakes).",
                "A thousand times yes. Out of all of the courses I have taken at Yale, this one will stay with me for the rest of my life.",
