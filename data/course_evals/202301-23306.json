                "I learned the basics of how to evaluate a film, how to watch a film, and how to make connections between literature theory and filmic material.",
                "I learned a lot about Southeast Asian history, both film history and in a broader sense. As someone who has never taken a film class, I also learned a lot about what is important to examine in films, like editing, framing, lighting, sound, music, etc., and how they can convey a filmmaker's message.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of Southeast Asia as well as the cinemas and films that have come from them, as well as the interesting relationships between capital and film",
                "Youll learn about how film acts as a representative medium for social change, political critique, and cultural preservation. Youll watch movies from countries all throughout Southeast Asia and develop an appreciation for the unique film industry in each country.",

                "Strengths of the class: Amazing syllabus and a very enthusiastic professor. The readings were really rich and dynamic. As someone who is not a film major and had little experience with non-commercial media, this class was refreshing and felt appropriately advanced.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Not a ton of weaknesses to discuss this class, although I would say that since this class met once a week for a longer period than most classes, it can feel very static, especially if the whole time the professor is delivering a lecture.",
                "The workload is more writing and reading than you think, but it is still pretty manageable. Learning how to view films with a critical eye was enjoyable.  Qui Ha is very amiable, she is patient and understanding. She is also knowledgable and has great insight on the films in class discussion. I probably would have enjoyed the class more if I were not taking 5 classes this semester.",
                "Nicely organized and the readings are mostly really cool and interesting. The professor is great and super sweet. If you have a good group of students, youll really enjoy it, but the discussion could get stale if the group of students isnt engaged, which happened more than I would have liked.",
                "The class is very well organized and Prof. Nguyen clearly cares so much about all of her students. The only weakness was the group presentation\/lectures ended up being more stressful and time consuming rather than satisfying."

                "I would definitely recommend it, especially to diaspora SEA students who want to be challenged and engage more critically with a diaspora identity. Themes in this course include trans nationality, the city, gender and queer time, and cultural processes.",
                "Absolutely, especially if you're interested in films of countries underrepresented in national cinema",
                "Yes, even if you arent a film studies major, this is a great way to engage with Southeast Asian culture and learn more about the region. Youll learn about the strategies filmmakers use to communicate, and itll make you appreciate film more overall.",
                "Yes, as long as you're comfortable speaking in class discussions."
