I learned about the history and different cultural groups of Ecuador, such as the indigenous Kichwas of Peguche and the Amazon, both through class presentations and directly living with the people on field trips. As someone who used to very much be a city person, I gained a deep appreciation for nature while being outdoors during the excursions, as well as how it appeared in the films in the course.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The opportunity to visit indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian communities and learn from the people who live there. Additionally, student-led presentations allowed for increased student engagement in the course material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course lacked a clear set of language learning goals, respect for students and their time, and a sensible syllabus. To begin, I do not think my Spanish improved much as the result of class assignments or work. Rather, I have improved due to the increased opportunity to speak Spanish with my host mother and with others in the program. For example, the course has many repeat assignments (two in-class essays, three oral reflections) with similar instructions. However, we did not receive feedback on any of our oral reflections before completing the next and we recieved our first essay back minutes before completing the next. To me, this lack of timely grading indicates that the assingments are more to have grades in the gradebook than to serve as rigorous pedagogical tools. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the course often felt like it was disrespectful of my time. While we had many afternoons free, we also had 3+ hours of homework nightly making it difficult to spend that free time anywhere but in a cafe doing my homework! We had only three total free days in Quito, all of which our professor recommended we spend working on our final projects. I did not feel like I had the time I wanted to explore the city, visit more museums, or simply have some relaxing time with classmates. Furthermore, our class often runs late without any acknowledgment or apology which seems to add insult to injury to our already limited free time. \r\n\r\nFinally, the syllabus for this course needs an overhaul. There are, first of all, many readings that no longer exist on the internet! Additionally, there is a lot of repetition between the readings, three or four articles that essentially describe similar topics. The course also seems very imbalanced, some days there is a significant amount of reading and homework where as other days there is not, for no apparent reason. To that point, our last week was incredibly assignment dense and felt very rushed and frantic compared to weeks 3 and 4 of the course. My main criticism of the homework/workload of this course is that save for two times in class, we never discussed our readings as a group. In fact, we never had a full group roundtable discussion about any topic, movie, trip, or reading. This seems like an incredible oversight given how small the course was, fifteen students, and a waste of an opportunity for an effective pedagogical tool. \r\n\r\nSuggested improvements: Critical thinking about the readings in the syllabus and what will actually serve students well. Making an effort to end class on time and return student assignments in a timely manner (or simply communicate about when students can expect grades). Moving class museum visits into the afternoons of days we already have class to allow for more free days in Quito. More group discussions, class discussions, and times to share ideas with one another in the classroom.",
                "The course is incredibly intensive. There is limited rest time which can be tiring for students and leave limited flexibility for personal leisure.",
                "Strengths: within the 5 weeks, we were given a comprehensive overview of the rich ecological and cultural diversity within Ecuador, especially since we were able to stay directly with members of these communities and participate in their day-to-day lives. The relatively sparse schedule (10 am to 1 pm classes) meant that there was time to explore the city or hang out with your friends and host family if you so choose. The oral presentations, which each student has to do one of, helped me engage with the material more, especially when they established context for movies or conversations that we would have later during the class. The professor makes very detailed corrections across assignments. \r\nWeaknesses: the expectations for assignments weren't always clear while we were completing them, particularly for the final project (I chose the short film option and did not know what length I should be aiming for, what analysis I needed to provide in the commentary, etc.) I wish I got feedback sooner, since it would've been helpful to digest it and make corrections before I had to do the same type of assignment (e.g essay/oral reflection) again. We didn't have much dedicated time to discuss the readings, and sometimes it feels like theyre unrelated to what's happening in class. There is an itinerary outlining every day of the program, but it's pretty vague regarding the actual activities, and I wasn't always prepared with what I packed.",
                "Strengths: the biggest strength of the course is definitely the time you get to spend living in and exploring Ecuador. All three trips (especially the last two to Otavalo/Chota and the Amazon) were incredible, and just spending time in such an amazing country is a joy. A large part of the class involves traveling to different sites and museums around Quito (the historic center, the Trude Sojka museum, La Capilla del Hombre, etc.), which really makes the class special. Spending time with the various host families, both in Quito and during the excursions, is also an incredible experience. Weaknesses: the class material itself was not particularly well organized. It's worth noting that this does not affect the quality of the program too much, as the majority of \"class time\" is spent learning about and visiting various sites around Ecuador, but it is still not ideal. During most nights in Quito (not on excursions), we were assigned multiple hours of homework, much of which we never discussed in class at all, and I would wager that almost every student skipped at least some of the (often tedious and repetitive) readings. Assignments, though often tedious, are at least not overly burdensome.",
                "Strengths:\r\nAll the people and destinations are really lovely! There was always a sense of safety and community amongst the group and all other groups we interacted with. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nVery intensive and immersive! Which can be a good thing, but get ready for 5 weeks of non-stop activities (mostly fun!)",
                "Quite a lot of programming, not much class time. Could use some Spanish language instruction, as some students arent native speakers.",
                "Overall, I think the course was fantastic. I am especially grateful that we had the opportunity to take so many trips. It really felt like we got to explore a country rather than just a single city. I do think that, during our time in Quito, a little more free time would be welcomed. A few full free days rather than a bunch of free afternoons could maybe achieve this.",
                "I think there were a lot of readings, but other than that the course was amazing."

                "I would definitely recommend this program, not just as a course, but as an experience of thoroughly exploring Ecuador and being exposed to its rich biodiversity and amazing people. Don't feel too overwhelmed about the film aspect, because there is no expectation of prior knowledge of technical concepts, and the guest speakers will gladly answer questions you have regarding the meanings of specific elements. There'll be some crunch nights after trips and especially during the final week, but you'll also have a decent amount of time to relax in the afternoons. The overall experience is something you won't forget, at least for a very long time.",
                "Overall, I cannot recommend this course enough, especially if it is your first summer at Yale. The organization of the classroom instruction was admittedly not amazing, but that is a small price to pay for all of the amazing experiences that you will get by living in and traveling around Ecuador for five weeks. Don't be too intimidated if you don't consider yourself an amazing Spanish speaker going into the classyes, a good portion of the students in the class were native speakers or had spoken Spanish at home for many years, but I learned Spanish in middle/high school, was one of the less proficient Spanish speakers on the program, and still had basically no issues doing well in the class. Getting to stay with so many local Ecuadorian families is amazing and truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that you will not regret.",
                "Yes! 100%. Ecuador is a lovely country to visit to better your Spanish.",
                "Yes! I learned a ton and overall had a lot of fun. The program is well run, and all the host families seem great. And if you're willing to put in effort and participate, you'll do well.",
                "Absolutely!!! I loved this class so much! The trips made it fun to learn about and experience various cultures. I really liked our trip to Otavalo and I think the added time there was the perfect amount."
