    "I learnt about various figures considered geniuses throughout the centuries, like Leonardo da Vinci, Mozart and Newton. I also learnt about their lives, their approaches and the influences that shaped them.",
    "How to think about and define genius",
    "I learned what the word genius means. How to accurately dissect a word that has been around for millennia and how the word has changed meaning. I learned the difference between a genius and a prodigy. What creativity means. I truly think this is a course that everyone would benefit from taking.",
    "I improved on my writing skills slightly but not a significant amount. I learned a lot of interesting facts about a few case studies of geniuses that we looked at. Overall, a pretty interesting course.",
    "I improved my writing skills a great deal. We learnt a lot about some of the most influential people in history, and the particular circumstances that produced their genius."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course felt much more like a lecture, than a seminar and hence participation was limited from the students. Material was often presented to the students and it was not very interactive. The material was interesting but the actual class time I felt could have been used in a more productive manner.",
    "I like how it was online. Can be improved with more time for actual discussion and less of the professor talking",
    "I truly thought this was a very thought out course that had excellent pacing. The only tough part was the in-class discussions as it is hard to host those online. I did think the paper topics were challenging, but really well done as it made you think for yourself and apply the course material that we learned.",
    "I was hoping to learn more about writing in this course but it was hard to get significant feedback. This was likely due to the time constraint of it being a summer course so I understand it would be difficult to improve on this.",
    "Since it's a summer course, it moves very quickly. But I actually enjoyed the immersion into the subject matter. I think perhaps the class conversations could be more open and less directed by the professor, which would maybe allow students to engage in a more natural way."

   "comments": [
    "If you were interested in this topic, yes. But if you took this course to improve your writing, I don't feel like this would have been accomplished.",
    "Yes it was decent. I liked the material and it wasnt too much work.",
    "I definitely would as it is super interesting. Who knew that the ancient Greeks saw genius as something that came from the heavens and not from man? That genius has changed its meaning several times over. The difference between a genius and a prodigy. The fact that being a genius usually means your life is tragic and are ultimately alone in your obsession.",
    "I would recommend the course to others because it is online so it is easily accessible for students who travel over the summer. I would not say that it was a low level of work, but I was able to manage it with a full time (40 hours a week) summer lab job. As a stem major, I found the course intriguing and it was a great course to take to fulfill distributional requirements. Definitely one of the more interesting courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, the course material alone makes it worth it. I know more about Einstein, Mozart and Da Vinci than I ever thought I would. And more importantly, I know more about the cognitive processes that give rise to high performance in a particular field of endeavor.  This is invaluable knowledge."
