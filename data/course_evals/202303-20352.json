I also learned about scientific writing and data analysis.",

Through taking this course, you get to apply lots of the concepts that you learn in lecture to real-life scenarios. You also get to learn how to write manuscript-style laboratory reports if that is not something you have done before.",

                "This course is a lot of work. Plenty of other reviews will tell you that. But what the other review don't tell you is that it's 110% worth it. The only way to learn these skills is by researching and writing and presenting, which is exactly what you do. That being said, Dr. Cooper is incredibly helpful and flexible. The TF's are beyond supportive both in lab and section. So, while the work is difficult, it's made infinitely better by the support system in place.",
                "Most labs were well-structured, informative, and designed to enhance student learning and engagement. However, certain experiments weren't so well explained, most notably Experiment 6.",
                "The lab manual are very detailed and you can learn from it. But also at the same time, it takes a lot of time to read and write the lab reports.",
                "Strengths: Paul Cooper!!!!! He is a fantastic instructor. He was very accommodating to students and was always very helpful when you reached out for assistance. The lab reports are time-consuming, but you learn a lot through them. The TFs were also helpful. We always received clear feedback and the instructions for assignments were comprehensive and clear. Weaknesses: Takes a lot of time, but that is expected.",
                "Strengths: The main strength of this course was Dr. Paul Cooper! He was a truly kind man and cared very deeply about the success of his students in this course. Even in the more confusing experiments with lots of steps, he always made sure to take things slowly and explain even the most simple of concepts in a non-condescending manner.\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Strength: detailed experimental procedures, reasonable deadlines\r\nWeakness: could've had more detail regarding weight of various sections of lab report / more examples of exemplary scientific writing",
                "Decently interesting experiments, efficient use of lab time, freedom to engage with others during down time.",
                "The strength of this class is that it forces you to work ahead and plan out your time in order to complete assignments on time. I'm not sure if this is really a strength, but it certainly built character through suffering.\r\nThe weakness of this class is that there is no reason why anyone needs to go through this amount of processing data and writing reports to become better at physical chemistry. Such content would be better formatted into a research skill development class or some other class that has no connection with physical chemistry itself. Other chemistry lab classes don't have this intense of report-writing as a central component, and I fail to understand why physical chemistry lab is the exception."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, but probably only if they need to take it in the first place. This course, along with the lecture course, has been truly revamped from what it used to be. The labs are very enjoyable and not too difficult to carry out. You will receive a tremendous amount of support from the teaching staff in all aspects of the course. The laboratory reports, especially towards the end, take a great deal of time to complete. My best advice is to not wait until the final days to complete them. You will easily sink >20 hours into one if you do so.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone except chemistry majors taking it to fulfill course requirements. That said, it's a decent laboratory -- especially given that it's 1 course credit. Also, it's totally fine to take it non-concurrently with physical chemistry lecture -- if anything, it might be better because you'll already be familiar with all topics.",
                "Chem major requirement -- however, it's not as bad as the previous reviews say. That's not to say it's not a lot of work, as the last lab report is extensive, but the workload is extremely manageable.",
                "No. Don't take this class unless you are required to.",
                "If it's not required, probably not, unless you for some reason are very very interested in physical chemistry and nothing else but are not a chemistry major. That being said, as a required class it's nothing to dread and definitely not something to switch your major over if this is the main reason for wanting to switch your major. It was hard but definitely doable if you manage your time well and start lab reports early!!"
