                "Topics taught in this class include theoretical models of chemical processes, Laplace transforms, transfer functions, behavior of first-order and second-order processes, feedback controllers, control systems, behavior and stability of closed-loop control systems, PID controller design, frequency responses, feedforward control, cascade control, multi-loop and multivariable controls. Class participation is a good chunk of your grade, so you learn to ask lots of questions and collaborate with classmates in class and with Loewenberg. During recitation, you gain lots of insight into the assigned problems: how to do them and fine tune the topics they cover.",
                "I learned about control theory and how it is applied broadly to Chemical Engineering. To put it in more simple terms, you are basically learning how microchips work, but instead of using chips to do computations, you are using reactors to churn out molecules. As someone deeply interested in systems, this was super cool.",

                "Some of the concepts can be difficult to get a grasp on and MATLAB/Simulink will be finnicky without experience, but the book and office hours proved to be helpful in addressing these weaknesses.",
                "The course gave you a lot of different ways to learn the information: lectures, lecture notes, and a very good textbook. However, the material moved very fast, especially later in the semester.",
                "Strengths: Dr Loewenberg. Take it with him if you can! He genuinely cares about your learning and is very very intelligent. He is also not too harsh or demanding with exams, but makes the psets challenging so you can take the time to mull over them properly. He adjusts the pace of classes according to students and is very flexible. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was a better textbook for the class. It is very convoluted and not very aligned with lectures. Also the psets weren't graded until the very last day of class.",
                "The material is interesting and definitely has relevant real world applications. The course got pretty complicated quit quickly h try Pugh and I would advise anyone to beware that the first half of the course is significantly easier than the second half.",
                "Strengths: Pace of problem sets, flexibility on deadlines, Professor Loewenberg's teaching.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes lectures got off track.",
                "The textbook was actually every good, I highly suggest that future students read the assigned textbook sections since class can be very confusing.",
                "This course forcused heavily on theory of process control, but I wish we had learned more about some of the practical design questions (i.e. hardware, control softwares, etc.). I think the course could have been a bit better organized, but I did appreciate the focus on getting a strong background in the fundamentals (transfer functions, block diagrams, etc.). I appreciated also that we did lots of problems over the course of the semester.",
                "Strenghts of this course have to be the professor and his care for his students. He was very gracious about meeting us where we were at, offering help if needed, and prioritizing student learning and quality of work over strict deadlines. I feel like I learned a lot from this course. The only weakness of this course were that the psets were very difficult, which was for the most part ok but sometimes individual psets were very time-consuming. But again, the professor was very forgiving with extensions as long as you were getting the work done. Sometimes we wouldn't have a recitation session but most of the time we did and they were very helpful.",
                "Virtually all of the lecture notes are accessible before class, so you are able to refer to them before class. Weekly recitation is very helpful in going over the week's topics and learning how to solve problems (definitely recommend going). The topic schedule provided in the syllabus is pretty accurate. Practice exam problems and solutions are given before each midterm. Grading policy favors student improvement and class participation. Lectures and recitation are also via Zoom and recorded to watch later.",
                "Strengths: Professor Loewenberg cares about his students, and this is very much appreciated. His main goal is to teach, and that eventually makes the class an enjoyable experience. I really appreciate his dedication.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures. Professor Loewenberg cares but unfortunately he often times falls into the same \"explanation holes\", where he just takes off to outer atmosphere whereas most of the students are on earth, wondering what happened. I think the way to address is it's quite simple. It just necessitates Prof. Loewenberg to explain almost every detail (at least at the very beginning) because otherwise lectures feel too blurry and way too complicated.",
                "The course is very well-organized - the mixture of Professor Loewenberg's lecture notes that he provided in advance, the textbook and in person lectures provide an opportunity to throughly review the content in different formats and wording. Professor Loewenberg's office hours very also very helpful in reviewing the content and resolving some of the problems. It was also nice to learn to use Matlab specifically for process control, a skill that can further be carried forward and adapted for industry and research settings. While the content is very challenging, it really comes together in the end, especially in the practice problems that Professor Loewenberg provides as a study resource for the exams. \r\nThe problem sets showcased a multitude of systems and presented interesting scenarios, but were very difficult to figure out at times. Hence, problem sets that were slightly more representative of the lectures and exams would be useful.",
                "Strengths: the course material is well-explained and course is well-taught despite the complexity of the topic, homework problems were very relevant, textbook explained things clearly\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there was not a huge emphasis on design of PID controllers (mostly focusing on analyzing PID controllers and their limits of operation)",

                "Yes! You have to take it as a ChemE senior or junior, so make sure to do it with friends as the concepts can get very abstract and tough to understand at times. If you're taking it with Loewenberg, expect difficult psets but easy non-cumulative exams.",

                "Certainly wouldn't recommend this for fun, but if you're reading this that's not one of your options anyways... The course content itself is actually pretty useful/interesting for ChemE industry purposes, but the way its taught is a little abstract. The psets are dense and numerous so stay on top of that, but otherwise if you take the class with Loewenberg the exam schedule/content is fair and you should be prepared well.",
                "I would only recommend this class to students that need it for the ChemE major. I liked the course, but I don't think the material is very useful for people not in engineering.",
                "I would recommend this course. It's a required course for ABET ChemE majors.",
                "Yes. The content is fascinating. And if you are taking it because of ChemE, definitely take it with Loewenberg.",
