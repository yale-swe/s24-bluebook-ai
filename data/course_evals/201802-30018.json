   "comments": [
    "The insights of protecting environment and some significant chemistry skills and concepts",
    "The course returns to the essence of chemistry learning. The connection between chemistry and the environment is well illustrated and learned. The couse provides a better insight into chemistry as a green science.",
    "Basic knowledge about chemistry. \r\nThe important chemistry concepts that build up the world.",
    "During the course, I learned how to apply chemistry knowledge we learn at school to everyday phenomenon. For example, I am now able to explain the mechanism by which batteries and electronically devices work by referring to simple redox chemical reactions.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, I was able to gain further insight into the mechanism of global warming and green chemistry. I can now give a comprehensive and scientific explanation for why burning fossil fuels is bad and alternative energy source should be sought; why the ozone depletes and why it should be a concern. I chose this course because I am interested in sustainable environmental development; now I can walk away feeling more confident in the fundamentals of green chemistry and environmental science. The knowledge I acquired during the course would also help me in planning future projects for my BioTech club at school. Having learned the concept of how energy is converted from one form to another, I am more convinced that the plan of making a moss table to generate electricity from photosynthesis can be achieved. \r\n\r\nFinally, I also acquired basic chemical calculation skills from the course. This skill is fundamental to all higher chemistry studies. The course did not help me so much as to improve my calculation skills, but it enabled me to have a more flexible mind around calculating chemistry questions. I am also able to  better understand some complicated concepts of chemistry with the help of simple calculations. For example, it was at first difficult for me to accept the fact that in a reaction, some energy can turn into mass, however, with the help of a calculation sample and some basic understanding of this concept, I am able to myself calculate and verify this concept.",
    "General understanding of the basic concepts, some demonstration based on the chemical concepts we learned in class, and the history of some chemistry-related events.",
    "Fundamental chemistry knowledge \r\nEnvironmental perspectives toward the use of chemical \r\nHow to create a more sustainable world",
    "I have learned a lot of knowledge such as the reason and the principle of air pollutionthe composition of it and how to prevent it. Furthermorethere are a lot of experiments about the division of lightthe principle of acid and baseand the composition of polymers.",
    "a more detailed understanding of how chemistry affects our life.",
    "I have a more comprehensive understanding of the relation between chemistry and the environment. I also learned more about time management for reviewing and homework."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: demos and the level of engagement \r\nNo weakness",
    "I think that the course is a little compacted in one month.",
    "The course provides hands on experience to give a clearer understanding for people in the area of chemistry.",
    "The demos and explanation in this course are interesting and actually attract the students.\r\nThe content about calculation part is probably not quite emphasized.",
    "Strengths: \r\n-relevant to everyday life. The scientific knowledge acquired is very useful.\r\n-compact. I gained a lot of new knowledge in a short time of five weeks. \r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n-access to books. Unlike my other course, the text book of this course was not very easily accessible even at the Yale library.",
    "Strength: \r\n1. a lot of demo done in class which are all very great and interesting as well as helping students understanding concepts. \r\n2. Dr. G is a good lecturer who is very patient and kind, holding office hour everyday after classes.\r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\n1. There are deadline of the assignments before the next day test and exam. The assignment we done have not been marked yet so I did not know whether I did them correctly or wrong. Consequently, I may do the similar type of question in the test and exam too.\r\n2. Hand the homework online that we need to spend a lot of time typing mathematical formulas.",
    "The course if mainly lecture and demos, it would be much better if students get the chance to do experiments.",
    "The course was filled with interesting demonstrations and the overall pace was relatively slow so everyone could follow."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If any students are interested in choosing a fun, hand on experiment chemistry course, they should choose this one!\r\nThis course can really make you think about chemistry in daily context, not only a abstract symbol. And you could learn many arising problems on environment among the world.",
    "Yes. Because by taking this course, students will gain a lot of knowledge in this field. Environmental problems are very urgent nowadays.",
    "The course illustrates the most basic concepts of chemistry and is very good for students who are interested in science.",
    "Yes, I will. This is a great opportunity to take a closer look at the chemistry world. The class is interesting and professor does do demos in every single lesson.",
    "I would recommend this course to students with a relatively solid foundation in basic chemistry knowledge. Although the course does start from the very fundamentals, but the fast pace of the course means that you have to understand a concept well and very quickly. I would also strongly recommend the course to students willing to study environmental sciences or green chemistry. The course will bestow you the knowledge necessary to create and design product to tackle sustainable issues in the world.",
    "I would say this is a general introduction course for students who did not know anything about chemistry. For students who have already knew something about chemistry, they can take a more challenged course alternatively.",
    "Yesbecause this course is very practicaland students could learn a lot of knwoledge relates to life",
    "I would. The normal chemistry courses even include AP environmental sciences or Ap chemistry doesn't talk about how chem effect us in detailed. Chem in context is a great chance to get deep into some issues.",
    "Yes. I received elaborate comment for every homework submitted. It was a great chance to build strong chemistry foundation and also an enjoyable experience for so many demonstrations."
