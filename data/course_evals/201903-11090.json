   "comments": [
    "I learned about healthcare policies and how race, class, economics, and so many more factors play into the policies that are created. I also learned how healthcare for the urban poor came to be developed throughout time. I learned to ask more profound questions, such as \"what even is health?\"",
    "I learned a lot about the structural barriers within our healthcare system and how the way that health has been defined throughout the last 150ish years has really affected the way it is made available to (or restricted from) different members of society.",
    "I learned about different themes in American healthcare history",
    "I learned about the healthcare system in the US, specifically more about Medicare and Medicaid.",
    "- more interaction with history, especially that of New Haven\r\n- learned how to access primary sources at Yale\r\n- how to critically engage with such primary sources and the factors that lead to what is being told in these sources",
    "I learned about the history of healthcare along many different axes: the rise of hospitals, community activism, federal policies, marginalized populations.",
    "Analysis of historical texts, essay writing, discussion of sensitive medical ethical topics",
    "Differing definitions of health, health disparities along class and race lines in the U.S., historical movements in American healthcare",
    "I gained a deeper appreciation and understanding of healthcare delivery and provision for different marginalized groups. This is definitely a very interesting course that has gave me greater insights about the inequalities of healthcare, the decisions made about healthcare policies and the considerations of different stakeholders.",
    "As a non-humanities student, I was able to learn how to write a research paper!",
    "Speaking as a student who is not in HSHM or pre-med, I learned so much in this course about healthcare insurance, Medicare\/Medicaid, and the history of hospitals and clinics in the United States. I also learned how to use Yale Library's manuscripts and archives through this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength is the discussions that the students have about the assigned readings. It's a great way to facilitate learning and dialogue. I also like how there are reading response questions that cater to those who might not necessarily be comfortable speaking up in class. There were some moments of awkward silence after questions were posed during many of the discussions\/the same people kept answering questions, but I'm not sure how to remedy that.",
    "Strengths: nearly all of the readings for this course were extremely engaging and really informative. Additionally, a wide variety of perspectives were also introduced in the readings as well. I also loved how many primary sources we read in class. My section was also incredible because everyone was so thoughtful, and the environment felt very welcoming for all of us to discuss what we were taking from the readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For some of the weeks Professor Abedin provided us with a theme or topic we should follow through the readings, which I found really helpful, and I definitely wish we had had that for more of the weeks.",
    "the big weakness: I would receive an A- without clear feedback on how I could improve. The Professor's comments would site specific, smaller, detail-oriented qualms that came down to grader's subjective preference and did not provide objective guidance. I could not improve to satisfy the Professor on the next assignment because there weren't bigger picture issues, only \"you should have included X author\"",
    "We didn't receive any feedback on whether our questions or participation were appropriate. Those were two large portions of our grade, so it would have been nice to know how we were doing in those regards. I liked how we read each other's questions in class and I thought the discussions were good.",
    "strengths:\r\n- seminar style made for good conversation\r\n- felt like a safe space to share opinions, agree, disagree\r\n- made history accessible\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- I think having more resources that we can refer back to after class would be helpful to refer back to; the days we wrote things out together on the chalkboard were particularly helpful",
    "I wished we worked more in small groups or varied the activities we did in class. The discussions were great, but it would have been nice to try something different once in a while.",
    "I learned a lot through the readings. The discussions were not particularly fruitful.",
    "The readings were fantastic. Very engaging. Especially the weeks combining historical texts with modern op-eds. Also, the weekly question format was good for facilitating learning and discussion.",
    "Strengths: A great history course for those with a shaky background in history, super interesting material, and a supportive and fair professor. I really enjoyed going to class, and I can say for certain that this was probably one of my favorite classes so far at Yale \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings were super long and not that beneficial, and there wasn't that much support for students who didn't have a background in writing lengthier humanities research papers---while the material was manageable for someone with minimal experience in history, writing the paper was difficult because I wasn't always sure how to start or what I should emphasize.",
    "+ Readings were fantastic: informative & interesting while being manageable \r\n+ Topics were well organized and explained\r\n+ Class was well structured\r\n- Some discussions would have been more meaningful with greater input from the professor",
    "The course is overall a big big disappointment. I am a pre-med and was ecstatic for taking the class but found the discussions to be quite dull. The timeline activity at the beginning of class is interesting but also never gets brought into class discussion. The class conversation was dominated by pre-meds which I was happy about at first but realized that everyone would just say the same thing. I think more than 90% of the class was pre-med and whenever someone not pre-med spoke it was quite clear to see that they approached the topic from a different perspective. Maybe in the future, a better mix of pre-med and non pre-med would be helpful.",
    "Strengths: I loved the range of readings each week in this class and how there was always a selection of secondary and primary sources to put in conversation. The weekly reading questions was super helpful in sparking class discussion (and getting me to think much more critically about the readings before class actually met). The timeline activity was also incredibly helpful in relating the topics of each week together\/seeing how they fit together chronologically. Also the introduction to using Yale's archives was really helpful in preparing for the final research paper. \r\nWeaknesses: Class discussion was normally awesome, but it really is dependent on what you and your classmates make of it and how much you prepare each week."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning more deeply about how social, economic, and political factors come to shape different people's ideas of health and how it can be addressed.",
    "Yes! If you are premed I absolutely think you should take this course. The course offers a really interesting (non-scientific) view of medicine and the healthcare system, which is noticeably absent from all of the premed requirements. Additionally, Professor Abedin is also a physician herself, and it was really interesting to hear her perspective on her career given that she has been thinking about all of the issues we discussed in the class for a really long time.",
    "Great class discussions over fantastic readings, but do the readings or you will not benefit!",
    "I would recommend this class. You definitely learn a lot but there is a fair amount of writing involved.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This class allowed us to trace the policies and actions that led to the development of policy that contributed to the very real health inequities we see today.",
    "Yes! Opens your eyes to the deep-rooted problems in our biomedical system.",
    "Yes, mostly because of the subject and readings.",
    "Yes---it's a wonderful course and you learn a lot if you do all the readings (and you should if you can!)",
    "Definitely, this course provides many insights into healthcare for various groups of marginalized individuals and seeks to understand the context and nuances behind healthcare delivery and provision. This would highly recommend this course to everyone.",
    "If you do not get into this class do not feel upset, the most interesting thing about it is the title and then it just goes downhill from there. Discussions were dull, and I feel Prof. Abedin while incredibly interesting, fills the semester with multiple pointless assignments.",
    "Yes absolutely! You learn so much about US healthcare's history and get a useful background to give context to the current healthcare debate in the US. The final research paper does sneak up on you though without a lot of check-ins in class so be proactive!"
