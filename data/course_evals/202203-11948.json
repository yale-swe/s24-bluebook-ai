The way this class is structured is challenging because it forces you to engage in the mindset of a developmental psychology researcher, which is an especially unique framework compared to other psychology disciplines. The active learning style of the class made it really easy to engage with the course and it's evident that Dr. Leonard was heavily informed by research on what is most successful in education.

            "comments": [
                "Dr. Leonard is keeping a pulse on the life of the discipline! I got a sense that the research that we were learning about was not outdated and was reflecting the discipline's present perspectives and where the discipline is actually heading as well. This course is structured with student feedback in mind to make it more effective for student engagement. Dr. Leonard fostered a really welcoming environment for discussion that helped students make connections with one another and feel confident sharing their perspectives. The work that we did in the class was really engaging and I feel like I worked on an actual skill as opposed to just memorizing hard, concrete facts. I feel like I gained something really valuable from the class that is going to proceed to help me not only in psychology research, but other writing for other disciplines as well. I sincerely appreciated that Dr. Leonard was also incredibly cognizant of the myriad of influences that have shaped the discipline and I felt like she was appropriately mindful of sociocultural factors that many psychology professors seem to downplay or flat-out ignore. \r\nHowever, because I feel so much like this course helped me facilitate a skillset, I do think that the course felt like we were developing a research methodology to engage in developmental psychology research as opposed to learning about what we do know about developmental psychology. I know that there are a lot of \"fundamental\" concepts in developmental psychology that we debunked, but it didn't feel like there was a robust bibliography of knowledge regarding developmental psychology that I've absorbed. I do, however, know how to find those facts that I would need to be able to effectively execute developmental psychology research, which is honestly a far more valuable form of knowledge than just \"I can list 50 facts about children.\"",
                "good mix of interactive and lecture style classes kept it interesting and engaging.\r\nLow pressure quizzes and graded work, enough time to prepare and perfect the projects for the class",
                "Strength: very interesting and multiple activities, I truly felt like I was listened to and heard in a lecture which is difficult",
                "strengths - professor was very engaged and open to criticism, engaged in active learning activities\r\nweakness - due date of paper (would be better if it was due during reading period or finals)",
                "the activities we did-- some were good some were not as good. change the public information project pitch to a different more concrete activity. liked that we didn't have to do three exams-- made engagement easier. keep quiz format.",
                "Strengths: I liked the diverse assignments, but sometimes I didn't quite enjoy the group work as much.. For example, for the reverse inference challenge, it was quite disorganized and I didn't think that I was learning a lot from it.",
                "Strengths: Format was a good mix of lecture classes and collaborative projects. The lectures meant we learned the material and the projects helped us reprocess what we had learned. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were done too fast, such that class often ended early but many people had missed large swaths of the material as they struggled to keep up. Additionally, lecture slides were posted after classes, meaning that to take notes, one could not annotate the lecture slides.",
                "I loved how the layout was more open and discussion based rather than just a lecture. Being able to work in smaller groups was great to facilitate conversation and learning",
                "strengths - interesting course load that lectures keep interesting; different types of assignments\r\nweaknesses - structure of course isn't really designed for seminar styled discussions and group work that we are told to participate in; not enough guidelines on projects",
                "I thought this course was not very engaging and the assignments were very generic about scientific research rather than focused on developmental psychology. There was also a lot of overlap with Intro to Psych\/Cog Sci, so I didn't feel like I got a lot of new stuff out of it.",
                "Strengths: Engaging course material, engaging lecture style\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: midterm\/final paper work often had high expectations for quality but not enough guidance\/chances for feedback and revision",
                "I really enjoyed the practical aspects of the course - and the teamwork! Doing teamwork in class and not having to organise outside of class was also a major +. The lectures were so engaging and interesting, and I loved the little 'pollevs' throughout - kept me engaged. I found the course overall to be really fantastic. My one criticism would be that it would have been great to have more support for the final research paper - maybe doing a rough draft and getting feedback first?",
                "I really enjoyed the interactiveness of the class, and the material was very engaging. There was some time where I wished I was able to just sit in lecture and absorb the material because it is so interesting.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that the major assignments (midterm project and final essay) allow the student to hone in on their specific interests in developmental psychology, which allows for depth of learning. Most of my learning about developmental psychology actually came from these two assignments. One of the weaknesses of this course is the amount of lecturing that occurs. Lecture time was greatly undermined by the amount of active learning that was incorporated, which affected the range of topics to learn about. Topics were covered very superficially. This isnt to say that the active learning component of class wasnt beneficial; I just think that maybe the class would benefit from having a discussion section and using that time to incorporate the active learning strategies.",
                "This course is super engaging and there's plenty of chances to get involved and collaborate with peers! I really enjoyed the setup of this class and the way the lectures were given.",
                "Of course, the topic of the course is very large, but I do wish we were able to learn more information. It felt very much like an intro course (although I guess that's the point?). When in the class, it was very engaging. It was definitely not one where I was distracted or thinking about other things. Outside of the class, it did not take up an unreasonable amount of time. The balance of time was thus a strength!",
                "Strengths: lots of student participation in ways that felt helpful to understanding the topics. Really enjoyed how there was a mix of group work and individual work. I liked that there were no big exams, just small lecture quizzes because I felt like I could demonstrate what I was learning while working on the projects. There was a wide range of assignment types that allowed for a lot of creativity. Only weakness is a few times when trying out new activities did not get the timing correct, so we had to rush to finish.",
                "Engaging lecture setup, I felt involved all the time. Easy to focus and keep up. Lot of homework, but helped a lot with learning and understanding.",
                "Strengths: Lecture participation is done via PollEverywhere, Professor is knowledgeable and passionate\r\nWeaknesses: You need to study before lecture quizzes to do well, some assignments are unclear",
                "Strengths: Enthusiastic prof, kind and helpful TA's, videos in class, not overwhelming workload. Weaknesses: While some people liked them, I felt there were too many group projects. Many of the group projects could have been done easily by just one person. While some of the assignments were good, a couple (especially the Anatomy of a Research Paper assignment) felt like busywork. I felt like what I was being graded on had nothing to do with my actual understanding. Additionally, the TA's don't necessarily read your work closely. If you find a mistake in their grading, they are nice, however.  Also, I felt the course often tried to apply the curriculum of developmental psychology to the field of education but was pretty detached from actual issues, policies, and practices in the education field. There were no readings about education issues, and it didn't seem like the professor or TA's had much experience in education, so any discussion about education was just based on speculation and felt unproductive. Finally, a lot of the material was repeated from PSYC 110, so that sometimes made the lessons less engaging.",
                "Strength: The TAs are amazing and Prof. Leonard is very engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of group work and Prof. Leonard had a tendency to speed through her lectures, which made it difficult to absorb the information.",
                "The variety of assignments was nice and Professor Leonard seemed really kind. However, the PollEverywhere seemed unnecessary and was often glitchy. Also, sometimes the feedback received on assignments made it seem like there was some rubric I should have been aware of beforehand, which didn't make sense if expectations for the assignment were not clearly established.",
                "The material is not that interesting, but a strength is that the class is structured to be very collaborative.",
                "Lectures and instructions were always incredibly clear, PollEv kept the attendees engaged, content was engaging. Sometimes the timing was off for group activities, but that is understandable since it is difficult to gage the time needed for a lot of the discussions.",
                "I liked how the class was mostly project-based. I think the only weakness I can think of is how the content lectures were restatements of the textbook reading; I think choosing one or the other would have been better.",
                "This course was great and taught a lot but I think the quizzes should be structured to encompass more of the big ideas from class.",
                "In general, this course takes a very Western approach to development, and I did not get what I wanted out of this course. The lectures were not really interesting despite me being very interested in child development. Knowledge could have been deepened but instead was a vague survey course with one single \"cultural psychology\" or something adjacent lecture. I think there should be more emphasis on putting worldly perspectives on child development and charting it as one specific timeline\/be more cohesive.\r\nThe grading was also stressful despite me doing well in the course. Assignments were unnecessarily structured, particularly the group projects. Take this course if you have no other psyc requirements you can take.",
                "This course is very organized, however, I would appreciate less time focusing on research methods. In addition, I would have appreciated a more active TA.",
                "The strengths are the way the course is structures. The lectures include poles and discussion questions which give you a break from listening and taking notes to actually think for yourself. Also there are methods challenges which help you get a deeper understanding of psychology research papers. A weakness might be the size of the class to the TA ratio. I think it might have been helpful to have another TA or two so there were more office hour times to attend.",
                "Strengths - broad range of assignments\r\nWeaknesses - Make the quizzes less specific",
                "Professor Leonard puts a lot of thought into pedagogy and making the course engaging and high quality. One note would be that developmental psychology is really hard to place -- months don't mean much to me, in a baby sense. Putting together the developmental timeline a little more strongly would be helpful.",
                "I believe that a strength of this course was having us create a rough draft for our final paper before Thanksgiving break. I think a weakness will be the time given for method challenges and the randomization of team members.",
                "I believe the structure of the course was very strong. A little more guidance for the bigger projects and how to approach them would be very helpful for the future.",

                "ABSOLUTELY!!!! Dr. Leonard is a godsend of a professor and I am so grateful to have had the chance to take a class with her. She is an immensely charismatic and engaging professor who genuinely cares about effective student learning and I can foresee this course becoming fine-tuned to the input of students over the years. I felt relaxed about this course because everything was incredibly clear and I knew exactly what to expect in terms of expectations for participation, assignments, grading, and materials. The assignments are also just fun and engaging. I feel like I actually was able to enjoy engaging with the material in the class because it didn't feel like a task to do, it really just felt like a game. I think that the methods challenge assignments are really interesting because they transform the course from a lecture to a pseudo-seminar. It's a really welcoming and engaging environment and I felt really happy in this course because it is so well-structured to engage students with the material. The material isn't outdated; the memes in the slides aren't outdated AND the research is engaged in critically to reflect current moves within the discipline to be far more mindful of systemic factors influencing research outcomes.",
                "It's very interactive and very much about learning how to be a scientist. If you like writing papers over taking exams, SURE! But if you just want to learn content in lectures and be tested on it in exams, I wouldn't recommend it.",

                "Interesting and engaging way to learn more about developmental psychology. The content is not very difficult, it is similar to an intro level class but far more engaging activities and assignments throughout the semester.",
                "Sure! I don't think its the most mind-blowing, life-changing course, but it is fun and fair. Plus, Dr. Leonard cares so much as do most of the other students!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is very good groundwork for understanding human nature and how we develop through our lifetimes. You also get to learn about how smart and amazing babies are, and develop more understanding of how best to nurture the growth of children!",
                "Yes. Professor Leonard does a great job of making the lectures engaging and fun. I learned a lot during the course and I never felt drained by it.",
                "Yes! Really fun. But be ready to put in some work!",
                "Sure. It's not super challenging, but the final paper (15 pages) can be overwhelming if you have other stuff going on. This honestly feels like a recap of AP psychology, there isn't much new learning if you've already taken a psych class or two before. Still, this is a good course for an easy A, especially if you need it for distributional or your major.",
                "Yes. The class definitely conveys important information that everyone should honestly know, if not as psychologists and educators, then as parents. While I found some aspects of the organization occasionally frustrating, the class was ultimately informative and had a very manageable workload.",
                "Yes depending on what you're looking for. The course was less about the facts of developmental psychology and more about how to set up developmental psych experiments. A super useful skill and well-taught but if you're looking for a background in dev psych literature this isn't the best course for that.",
                "Yes, you will learn all about developmental psychology! Coming into the course I didn't have a clear understanding of what the field entailed, and now I know a lot about various studies and subtopics.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you are specifically interested in developmental psychology. This was a different genre of psychology from others I have studied. I did not find the information particularly interesting, which made the work less interesting as well. That said, I'm sure its a great class for people interested in child development and the science of babies!",
                "Yes. Content is engaging, the professors and all the TAs are incredibly well-versed in the content so any question you have will always be answered without hesitation. There are writing assignments that are graded quite strictly for a psychology course, so just make sure you are putting in ample effort in them and not treating it like a gut assignment.",
                "Yes - feedback is clear, Prof Leonard is a great lecturer, content is interesting, grading is fair, and workload is very reasonable. I genuinely learned a lot from this class just because material was presented in an engaging way.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is fun.",
                "Yes!  This course is fun and engaging and not too much work.",
                "No. Only take this course if you can't find another one. Unnecessarily stressful and not interesting lecture topics.",
                "Yes. If you're interested in child psychology or how our ways of thinking changes throughout development, then take this course!",
                "Yes, its a fun course! But its also a little difficult to adjust to the grading and expectations of the TAs.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The professor and TA's really care about the class engagement and that you are learning and it also is just very interesting concepts that are relevant to many concepts that we face in everyday life.",
                "Yes, it was a great class and Professor Leonard was great!",
                "Yes, if you have an interest in developmental psychology. Because it is a psychology requirement \/ counts as a core course, I think engagement can sometimes be low, but it was well-run and interesting.",
                "I would recommend this class to students interested in child psychology. The content we went over is stuff you can learn from a textbook very easily but the form of presentation was enjoying and interactive.",
                "Yes take it if you have any interest in child psychology or psychology at all.",
                "Absolutely! Know what you're going into, that you will be studying a lot about babies, and children, but that it is a great introduction to this dimension of psychology. Professor Leonard is so good at teaching and makes many topics accessible, and her drive to motivate her students and make the course better is inspirational!"
