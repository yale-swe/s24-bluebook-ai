                "This course was instrumental in helping me better understand the central texts of modern political philosophy. All of the texts were relevant, and the syllabus flowed nicely. I feel that my ability to comprehend and write about complex political issues improved greatly.",
                "Analytical thinking/reading skills, knowledge of political theorists/thinkers, discussion and writing skills.",
                "This course provided a good introduction to the political thinkers of the Western world, starting with Machiavelli. I especially liked comparing the ideas of thinkers, and seeing how political theory evolved and changed over time. The essays were challenging, but prompted me to think critically and creatively about the thinkers we read.",
                "I learned about the crucial political philosophers from Machiavelli to Arendt. I also improved my ability to defend a position about a particular political philosophy in both my speaking and my writing.",
                "I was able to challenge my seminar skills, strengthening my spoken clarity, reading comprehension, and argumentative writing techniques.",
                "HandP has taught me more about human thought and action throughout history. Seeing and comparing the different ways political thinkers have interpreted the engines which drive history forward have given me a better lens for understanding the modern world.",
                "This course provided me with a strong foundation not only for understanding the progression of Western political thought but also for advancing my personal critiques of the writers. I've developed my ability to point out certain flaws in the arguments rather than viewing the thinkers as definitively correct, and I really enjoy comparing how the social contract of ideas of human flourishing have evolved over time. With this foundation, I'm more confident and motivated to explore other areas of political thought, and this course does a great job situating students within a clear tradition of Western thought. I've also improved my seminar discussion skills and learned to push forward the conversation through asking questions regarding the text. Reading these authors in tandem has taught me to read actively and analyze how each author deals with a similar set of questions in terms of what the ideal government structure is, how to maintain stability, the role of history in political theory, the relationship between the state and human rights, etc.",
                "I learned how to delve into the arguments and nuances of early modern and modern political theory and how to compare and contrast various political theories and theorist and the impact of their work. I also learned how to blend philosophical and political viewpoints in my writing and how to craft a political philosophy paper which addressed both the historical context and the political content of such theories. I also learned how to put forth various arguments both in favor of and opposed to political theories discussed in class and to debate them with my classmates.",
                "In this Historical and Political Thought discussion section, I developed two important skills. One was the ability to concisely summarize my thoughts in real time. Thinking quickly about synthesis in a conversational context helped me verbalize and express my opinions as they came about. I also became a more analytical thinker, and hence a more analytical writer.",
                "I learned how to really catch myself when reading to make sure I'm actually understanding what the author is saying. I think I got a really solid overview of political thought since Machiavelli, and the amount that I know now on the subject compared the amount I was exposed to before is leagues greater."

                "I greatly enjoyed this course and the selection of works chosen. It was very informative and we were able to go into some depth with each author. Throughout the semester, all expectations set for the course were very reasonable and tied into what we were discussing in class. However, the final exam, I believe, did not do a great job testing what we had discussed. The selections for the text identifications were not from sections that were focused on, and given the large volume of reading we had to do, I believe it was unreasonable to expect people to know them. Additionally, they made it more difficult to show we understood the main ideas each thinker had, instead focusing on rather obscure aspects of their works. I learned a lot in the course, but I believe the final did not let me show the knowledge I had gained in an adequate way.",
                "N/A",
                "This is the best course I have taken so far at Yale. This course dos a great job of creating dialogue between the texts and situating students within a tradition of Western political thought, starting from Machiavelli and tracing his influence on the present. I enjoyed starting with the social contract theorists, since their systems of thought were highly structured and made it easier to know what questions to ask in the next reading for comparison. In terms of the syllabus, I was pretty satisfied with getting enough time to discuss the excerpts we read, although I think that Mill could have been solely a text for the philosophy track, since his theory of utilitarianism leaves a lot of room for philosophical critique, though he could be replaced by a more strictly political thinker. We received some historical contextualization during lectures, but if possible it would be great to make more connections between the texts and the historical background in which they happened.",
                "The strengths are the amazing books and political theories that we consider as part of our curriculum, and I very much enjoyed the engaging, entertaining, and profound discussions we had in class discussing such thinkers as Hobbes, Rousseau, and Nietzsche and the implications of their work. Weaknesses might just be that the reading list was very large for any class and thus we had to rush through seminal works of political philosophy within two or three classes, so we never had enough time to delve into each work sufficiently (although this is a general complaint with Directed Studies as a whole).",
                "The best aspects of this course were the rambunctious, but well moderated, discussions. It would have been helpful if certain moments or chapters were highlighted in the reading assignments so we could know where to focus our attention, especially with so many pages to sort through.",
                "The course moves very fast but that's DS. H&P in the spring focuses on political thought where the fall focuses more on history, so I enjoyed the spring more, but others obviously prefer the history."

If you have the opportunity to take the class with Professor Rubinelli, I would jump on it. She is a great professor that actively engaged with us and helped me gain a much deeper understanding of the texts.",

                "Yes ! It is the best",
                "Yes, this course was my favorite seminar, and I was lucky to have such an engaged group of peers and an encouraging professor. I preferred the spring semester of H&P to the fall, just because I find political thought more structured and interesting to critique. We read thinkers incredibly central to producing the political and social structures that we live in today, and this course provides you with an origin for that thought.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to interested students, especially those who are interested in political theory and philosophy rather than just history (which the first semester of H&P mostly consists of). However, I would stress that the student should make sure to have enough time and commitment to genuinely engage in the texts and the ideas behind them so they can adequately debate them during class and write about them meaningfully.",
                "Yes! Lucia was a wonderful professor, and I feel like i've learned so much!",
                "I would absolutely recommend DS H&P. Even for those not going into politics, it changes how you look at the modern world to understand the original documents that sparked revolutions and shaped societies."
