            "comments": [
                "Strengths: you learn a ton in just one semester and bond with your fellow classmates because the class is small and you will spend a lot of time working on psets together. Weaknesses: The lectures were fast-paced and hard to follow at times due to Mochrie making mistakes and writing messily. Pset problems were frequently impossible to solve unless you attend office hours because the lecture notes are hard to understand.",
                "Strengths: This class can be taken for those who havent taken linear algebra or differential equations. Exam questions are always similar difficulty to those on PSETs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Since this is an accelerated math class, no proof or where each equation comes from is explained.",
                "Class was well organized and Simon is an amazing instructor. I learned a ton in this class and feel well equipped to take higher level physics classes. The class developed a real camaraderie as we all spent study halls working on the psets together which was awesome.",
                "Strengths: allows students to gain the mathematical skills required for 400 level physics courses in one semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very high workload, especially in the first 2/3 of the semester. Psets were often extremely long and difficult. Professor assumed most of us had more experience with mathematica than we actually did, so completing some parts of problems that required complicated mathematica calculations was difficult, if not impossible for many students.",
                "You get to learn a lot of math that prove useful in physics. However, the course is extremely hard to follow and is a lot of work for every pset. You will have to put in a lot of time to work on the psets and go to office hours. Also, the teaching isn't always the most clear or efficient-- I knew Linear Algebra well going into this class and the professor's explanation of linear algebra made me confused as well.",
                "The study hall is very helpful. It is a great place to go over the materials again outside class. The professor and teaching fellow is very helpful during study hall hours too."

                "Yes, but you need to know what you're getting into. It's much harder to do well in this course than in other diff eqs courses here, but you learn much, much more. The smaller class size contributes to the overall experience. If you just need a diff eqs course to satisfy a requirement, this is probably not the course for you. If you need to actually learn how to solve diff eqs because you're a physics major or something, consider taking this course, but know it's a big time commitment.",
                "Yes, definitely take it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in accelerating their access to 400 level physics courses. I would also advise those students to avoid taking other high-level courses concurrently simply because PHYS 301 requires a significant amount of time, effort, and mental energy.",
                "Honestly, no. Yes you learn a lot, yes you will be prepared to take any other difficult course at Yale. But this course really threw me into doubting everything about my credentials as a physics student and the entire semester I felt like sisyphus turning pset in after pset and still having more psets due.",
                "Yes especially if you are a physics major. You get to learn the differential equations under the context of physics."
