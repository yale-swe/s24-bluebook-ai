Super cool in that you get exposure to an amazing collection of human bones that demonstrate the vast diversity in human anatomy and structure.",

                "I learned how to identify all 206 bones as well as bone features and important muscles and nerves that originate and transmit from those features. I developed good memorizing skills that helped me do well in this class as well as how to think about bones in evolutionary and developmental aspects.",

I am able to identify various skeletal structures within bones and identify the directions of each bones. I got the chance to look at real human skeletons, and intrigued more of my interest towards my dream major biology."

                "Strengths: The fact that this was a predominantly lab-based course helped with fostering connections between students and professors, as well as giving students a sense of excitement when it comes to exploring a new system of bones. The class also allows for independent work for students who prefer to work alone. This flipped classroom aspect of the class puts the responsibility of learning in the hands of the students, and really helps with the tactile, verbal, and visual learning of the bones.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Labs is very useful for students to get familiar with those real bone material.\r\nThe percentage of lectures could be increased",
                "The strengths of this class include the emphasis on the lab aspect of the course, the abundantly available resources including the professor and the TF, as well as the human bone specimens we got to handle. I do not think this class had any weaknesses other than the fact that it was too short!"

                "Yes, this course is fascinating and more dynamic than other classes at Yale. It attracts a wide array of students, ranging from anthropology to history to biology majors. For those who are interested in anatomy, this is the closest thing you can get at Yale in terms of bone structure.",

                "Yes, definitely! The student to teacher ratio was great and you really got to ask as many questions as you had to the professor or the TF and they were more than willing to help. The hands-on aspect of the class greatly appealed to me and made the class as great as it was.",
                "Yes because it definitely helps me to challenge myself (although I failed), but I got more understandings and knew how much I was insufficient in certain topics, and let me know myself more in a specific way through the study."
