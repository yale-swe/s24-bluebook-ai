                "I learned how to connect Jewish poetry across countries and generations, both to itself and to Judaism and Jewish culture.",
                "read a lot of really good poetry",
                "I learned about a series of important Jewish poets, and techniques and frameworks for how to best analyze them individually and as a group.",
                "This is one of my favorite classes I have ever taken. I learned so much not only about Jewish poets but about modern poetry in general, how to understand poetry through enjoyment, how to talk about poetry without always needing to have a dogmatic argument, and how to discuss literary themes like naming, liminality, and Jewish imagination.",
                "I unlocked a deep love of poetry and emotion from reading. Also, I learned so much about Jewish culture, the religion and the wide variety of connected experiences. I engaged more deeply than ever with newly discovered writers.",
                "This course introduces students to poets and poetics that are not covered in many other courses offered at Yale (if any). Many of these poets are completely ignored by the courses offered within the English department, in spite of the fact that the poets were integral to the tradition(s) of English poetry after Pound. Aside from cultivating familiarity with this important material, I think that this is also a good course in which to develop practices of reading poetry. Engaging with this kind of avant-garde material can be alienating, but this course is truly no-background-required: thanks to the mix of backgrounds and Professor Cole's sensitivity to classroom dynamics, the seminar discussions were a welcoming place to discuss close readings, intertextual links, historical understandings of poems, and immediate personal reactions.",
                "After this course, I feel I inherited a framework in which I could understand the tickings of a patchwork of poets, poets who were obsessed with disruption, who had pledged allegiance to truth-telling or who simply had questions they demanded be voiced. I began to learn the timeline of the hurt and triumphs of generations of Jews to better understand the distinct experience of present Jewry. I learned the value in precision within poetic translation, in the concision of my language and the telling nature of form. I began to crave poems that were drunks with nouns, that disquieted me, that offered up unexpected catharsis, that got under peoples skin."

                "Strengths: Professor Cole is a gem. His knowledge of the poetry (and the poets! in many cases) was the best part of the course. The range of Jewish and non-Jewish students and their knowledge and perspectives was amazing as well. I also enjoyed the flexibility of being able to respond creatively for the midterm and final, which gave me the most room to reflect and work with the poetry.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly discussion posts weren't SUPER effective. Most of the time I felt like I was just writing something to write something, and I thought the weeks where we were asked to prepare a",
                "strengths: read a lot of good poets and poems, not a huge workload\r\nweaknesses: sometimes class dragged on and got a bit boring",
                "One of my favorite things about this course was the creative opportunities we had to engage with the texts, either in pairs, or though creative projects as our midterms and final asessments. One thing that could maybe be improved is the reading load, I feel like because there were so many poems each week (and because we had to get so many books), it was hard to dive into any one poet or poem in a deep way. While it would change the structure of the class, I do wish we had a narrower focus at times.",
                "I loved this class and can see very few potential improvements",
                "AMAZING! I loved how it was organized. I dont know if this would be possible but it would have been nice to require people to submit discussion posts 24 hours before class just so we can read everyones. Everyone was so incredibly brilliant!",
                "Professor Cole is an exceptionally kind and committed professor, and he is a real expert on these poets. His approach is that of a learned poet, so the seminar conversation is driven more by excitement about the material than an interest in assigning poems to categories or analyzing them through a particularly academic lens. I feel that this is a strength in many ways, but it's something to be aware of if you're hyper-focused on one concern, such as Marxism and poetry. I also really appreciated the diverse pedagogic approaches, which ranged from facilitated discussion to student-direct presentations. I would have preferred a smaller class (closer to 12 than 18), as the larger class size seemed to get in the way of class bonding and made it harder to have a cohesive conversation in class. It rarely felt like we were addressing each other in conversation about the text--it felt more like one person at a time speaking to Professor Cole, with the occasional reference to a previous comment. I like it when professors draw connections between students' comments or ask students to call on the next speaker after speaking themselves, and I think that seminar discussion could have been even more robust if there had been more emphasis on students talking to each other. The other weakness was that while we focused on deep engagement with individual poems in class, the reading load was heavy such that it was difficult to pause and re-read individual poems. The Canvas posts also felt a bit onerous and I'm not sure how much they really helped us engage with each other before class.",
                "Strengths: phenomenal selection of readings, captivating lectures, valuable\/interactive discussion posts, an engaging 2 hour class setting, open-ended\/creative final projects, incredibly thoughtful feedback to your writing\r\nWeaknesses: inclusion of an even wider range of Jewish authors\/more global representation of the Jewish diaspora"

You also get to write two essays that have creative options, and you can basically do whatever you want that still engages with the material.",

Prof Cole is a really cool person to learn from and the workload is really manageable, there are basically two big assignments that you have a lot of freedom with, and reading the poems is actually quite fun. It is a two hour seminar so it can get boring especially if you dont like classes that are mostly students talking about what they think.",

This has hands-down been my favorite course at Yale."
