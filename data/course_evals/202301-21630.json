                "The course was excellent, and I enjoyed it greatly.",
                "The workbook lessons were useful in reinforcing vocabulary and sentence structures but I would have appreciated a more structured schedule to it",
                "I feel as if the 50 minute period every day is not enough time to truly engage with the language. As for strengths, it does provide complex sentence structure and grammatical understanding of the language.",
                "This course was great at building and increasing comfort with the language in a safe environment. I think the class was less stringent than intro classes in other languages would be, although I don't think that is a weakness considering the difficulty for many students of learning a language with an entirely different script."
