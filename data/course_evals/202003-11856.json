                "For anyone who doesn't have a background in bench research (my focus is largely clinical human research), this is a great introduction to basic lab techniques (e.g. PCR, RNA extraction). We also ran into legitimate problems in our experiments and learned a lot about understanding what goes wrong and how to address it going forward. The critical thinking and problem-solving was central to the course and made the experience valuable even if we weren't able to get the results we were hoping for.",
                "This course provided some good experiencing in conducting experiments aimed at determining the impact of gene knock outs. We learned both about general approaches used widely in biology, like qPCR and gels, as well as topics more specific to using worms as model organisms.",
                "I learned how to perform RNA extraction, miniprep, transformation. I also got a refresher in preparing gels and running PCRs."

                "The strengths of the course include that there is strong continuity from class to class -- because it is a real research project, you have an idea of where it is going and can trace your progress logically. The absolute greatest strength, however, is Prof. Nelson. He cares so much and so openly about the course, the students, and our growth that it is impossible not to get excited about it. He puts in an immense amount of work to make the experiments run smoothly, even coming in on weekends to redo them if the results aren't quite what he was expecting. The weakness for this year was that the course is really reliant on experiments working properly, so when they don't work several times, it can stall progress. This was compounded by our only being in class for half the time, so we had trouble seeing what was happening on the days when we joined class remotely. Perhaps in the future, if reduced classroom capacity continues, it would be helpful to have a bigger room\/to spread out into two rooms with a TF so that everyone can come in every day.",
                "I think it's great that the course is built around an actual project. It feels more engaging and directed than every other lab class I've taken. We struggled to get results, which will happen during a project, but I still thought this is the format that every lab class should be modeled on. Professor Nelson was very supportive and did a great job explaining procedures, but using more visuals like a power point, beyond just writing on the board, would have made it a bit clearer at times."

                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone looking for a high-level but understandable bio lab experience. I felt I was learning deeply in a stress-free way, and I am sad the course is only half a semester long.",
                "Yes, it's very refreshing to do a lab class that involves an actual project, rather than practicing certain techniques without any purpose. Professor Nelson is also a great presence in the classroom.",
                "I'd recommend this course once it's in-person again. We all appreciated the work Professor Nelson put into this course for this half in-person\/virtual format, but it was difficult to follow the organization of the course and expectations felt slightly ambiguous in this format."
