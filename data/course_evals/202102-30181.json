We engaged with multiple current research papers, and were taught how to insightfully  read and understand their results. Additionally,  the discussion sections taught us how to structure arguments regarding morality and question the procedures and findings of others.",

This includes our evolutionary influences, cultural factors, and frameworks on how morality is influences across individuals and cultures.",
                "This course provided an in-depth survey of some of the most important topics in moral psychology, incorporating research and writing on morality from a variety of perspectives. I gained skills in distinguishing philosophical and psychological arguments about human morality, reading scientific research, and unpacking scholarly written and oral arguments. One key takeaway from the course was the importance of emotions in our everyday moral lives, and how our sentiments can work with and against our capacity for reason. Another was the great variability, but also the many similarities between the moral perspectives of different people, groups, and societies.",

                "Strengths: Interesting content.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures did not match readings, which have been updated since the lectures were recorded. As a result, the course felt a bit disjointed, and unsure in its ultimate argument. Also wished that sections did more than just go over the readings -- It would be nice to see the readings incorporated into a broader discussion.",
                "The course was rich with insightful material - none of the readings or videos ever seemed to be a waste of time. The live discussions, as well, were engaging and interesting. However, the weekly reading responses were due prior to the discussion section when we covered the readings, so I often felt I was at a disadvantage in writing them, as I did not always fully understand the topics involved.",
                "This course was very engaging and offered lots of interesting material to learn from. However, the weekly reading responses were consistently returned later than expected so they did not provide feedback week to week. Additionally, the lack of feedback made it hard to gauge what the final grade would be.",
                "Maybe the professor can provide some PPT.",
                "Strengths: engaging, stimulating, discussions are really interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings are super long and sometimes dry (some can be really interesting!), very little time spent with the prof. (All of his lectures are recorded)",
                "Overall this is a wonderful course, but I feel like there actually could be more topics involved.",
                "A strength was the great instructors. Paul Bloom was an engaging lecturer, both in the pre-recorded videons and on-zoom discussion. Mark Sheskin was a great section leader and was so engaging in how he lead our weekly sections. Furthermore, the content itself was both interesting, and structured well, giving a mix of both research/experimental examples and broad, overarching ideas. A weakness of the course, though, was how the pre-recorded lectures and live discussions worked with eachother (or rather, didn't work with eachtother). Often times in our seminar-style discussions with Prof Bloom, we only got to a small subset of the topics covered in the week's videos. These sections were interesting and really fun since he tried to get us to talk and debate with eachother, but sections with Bloom felt more exploratory rather than material-based. That very well may have been the point, but it was something I wasn't expecting. In the end almost all my notes came from the recorded lectures and not the live sessions. Another plus was the readings. They varied, and included things from ted talks to research articles to book excerpts and were fairly managable. A downside of the course was the grading scheme - we were given weekly reading responses that were graded on a scale of 1-5. Most people started scoring very low so that we could guage our improvements on these responses, but it was a bit strange that we got a document of writing tips *after* the first assignment was submitted instead of before. The feedback on the assignments were great, though, and really helped improve both my style of writing to more closely match the style that was desired by the instructors, and to improve the overall clairty of my arguments.",
                "One strength of the course was its format, with one small weekly meeting with Professor Bloom and another with a section leader. These two sessions had different styles and purposes. The former was more exploratory and debate-oriented, allowing students to voice their own opinions,  while the latter was more systematic and focused on breaking down key arguments and ideas. This mixed approach was very successful and helped make the course more fun, engaging, and informative. A potential weakness of the course was a lack of opportunities for organic student-led discussion rather than directed discussions or activities. However, this was understandable given the wealth of material being covered.  One suggestion would be to devote a portion of section meetings to open student discussion about the course material.",

This was definitely one of the most interesting courses I have taken at Yale so far.",

                "I would reccomend this course, especially if you aren't a psychology or philosophy student. All of my classmates were STEM or other non-phil humanities students, so it was really cool to see all of us learning these interesting concepts and building our own opinions on them for the first time. The course was maybe 20% material on philosophy and 80% on psychology relating to the philosophy, which is a huge plus if like me, you were worried about being thrown into some sort of philosophy deep end. While I wouldn't call the course a gut since the grading seemed fairly harsh, I definitely still reccomend it if you want a very welcoming and engaging environment to learn about some new topics that isn't super cutthroat. Maybe a good credit/d class!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student remotely interested in questions of morality: right and wrong, fair and unfair, just and unjust (which should really be all students). The topics covered have relevance to all human affairs, with discussions ranging from behavioral economics to politics and religion. The course material is readily applicable to everyday life, but it is approached in a rigorous and generally scientific manner (though philosophy also plays an important role).",
