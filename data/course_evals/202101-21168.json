                "What I learned in this class was split into two sections.\r\n\r\nReadings: Our readings gave a comprehensive overlook of wonder in infants and children, as well as a look into the elements that underlie wonder in all ages. We read about abstract concepts, mechanistic vs. functional explanations, history of science, open-ended questions, and scientific misinformation. This is just a brief summary of some of the topics we covered.\r\nClass: I really enjoyed class, because it was a fun mix of reading overviews and our professor's experience with science education. Some classes were spent more on reading topics. Other classes were more anecdotal. We would listen to Professor Keil's personal accounts of wonder, and share our own opinions on generational differences in science education. Each class also had breakout rooms, kindly facilitated by a graduate student's thought experiments.\r\n\r\nWe also each did one \"wonder presentation,\" and I can say with confidence that I will not forget the research I did for my wonder. I have an in depth understanding of my topic, as well as some knowledge from other students' presentations.",
                "I learned how to communicate with people in a way that promotes wonder more. Mostly this consists of asking questions and supporting interests that people raise. It's been especially good for talking to little kids."

                "Strengths are that Prof. Keil is very knowledgeable and passionate about teaching the information that the class is very engaging",
                "I liked the format and the weekly writing assignment, but I thought some of the discussions could be more engaging. Perhaps this was a limitation of zoom learning. I loved the wonder assignment and the final project!",
                "Excellent instruction and selection of readings was very strong, provocative and relevant",
                "The wonder presentations were certainly a highlight, the range of interests in the class varied widely and I learned so many new things.",
                "Strengths: \r\nCasual atmosphere geared towards learning and not grades; short presentations to break up the class; brief break-out room discussions (amazing thought experiments courtesy of our business grad student!)\r\nI loved the homework system. We usually had 2-3 readings to do, coupled with a reading response to be turned in once a week. The reading response was limited to 200 words and was meant to be in response to a specific question. Professor Keil's reading response prompts were novel and forced us to think outside of the box. In all honesty, this is the only class where I consistently 'deep-read' my readings. I wanted to have a good grasp of the papers' arguments to better generate my own answer and not simply summarize. Writing succinctly is a skill in and of itself, and I'm thankful that responses were formatted this way. They made the coursework more engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSome days we spent a bit more time on anecdotes than I would have liked, but this is not to say that I didn't enjoy the more anecdotal days. If anything, I was more excited about the reading topics for those lessons and wanted to dissect them more.",
                "Each unit (basically 1/week) varies in terms of how accessible, interesting, and functionally applicable it is. You learn some cool and interesting things from a professor who is really passionate about the material, but the pace can feel fast and slow at the wrong times because of the variation with topics. You essentially learn two-three big ideas that are reinforced throughout. So, on the bright side, you know a few interesting and applicable things really well, and on the other hand, you don't know that many things."

They often came to me with bizarre processes or concepts that they didn't understand, and told me to bring them up in class :)\r\nI never once felt academically overwhelmed (in the grade-specific way students often are); it was a calm and casual atmosphere. If you're okay with this more slow-going vibe, this class if for you. You'll be learning about learning curiosities, so anyone who is interested in childhood education or about their own waning academic wonder (like me), will enjoy Childhood Wonder. If you're a non-cogsci/psych major, I get the sense that you would manage the topics pretty well. Though it's always helpful to have some background to further bolster your understanding.",
