                "Strengths are that by the end of the course, theoretically, you have a strong foundation for the language. Weaknesses are the fast pace, daily assignments, and not so much actual teaching.",
                "I don't know how other language classes are taught since this is my first one, but I think it can be much more organized. I don't know if it's just about Arabic, but it seems that we leave so many things out when we learn, that is, we learn in a sort of \"messy\" way and not in a structured, hierarchical way. Also, the homeworks are for the big part of the course excessive, which makes some of the excitement for the class to wear off.",
                "Most of the actual learning which takes place in this course occurs through the homework and textbook reading assigned. this means the students self-teach much of the course instead of learning from the professor herself. It would be helpful if the teacher would actively teach key concepts in class instead of assuming student knowledge all the time, especially when it became clear students were not engaged nor aware of the material being taught.",
                "This course really forces you to participate and do the work, which is good; however, it was frustrating that homework assignments were given no feedback because the assignments often felt like needless busy work.",
                "A strength of this course is all the different ways you can be exposed to the Arabic language- after the first month, most of class would be conducted in Arabic, we had asynchronous learning time once a week to listen to various dialects in different conversation contexts, and we had opportunities outside of class to practice (with each other, with our TA, with the Arab Student Association etc).\r\nA weakness would be the intensity-- it is very easy to fall behind, especially because the class picks up pace very quickly. Homework, on average, takes more than two hours *a day* and that is just for completion (expect 3-4 hours a day for mastery)."

            "comments": [
                "You will learn a lot if you make this class a priority and put a lot work in. Arabic is a very difficult language and A LOT of work is necessary to see any results. Any prospective student should know that the daily homework assignments take 30 minutes to 2 hours, there are weekly quizzes and tests that rely on a lot of brute vocab memorization, Sarab is nice but has unrealistically high expectations for the class and is sometimes not the most understanding. Expect to figure out almost everything on your own (eg you learn the script from a textbook basically) because grammar is barely taught and class is overall very unstructured. I will personally not be taking L2 because of the workload, the shaky foundation I have from L1, and the fact that I doubt I'll be conversationally fluent even at L5 (not to mention that MSA is not really spoken and the dialects need to be learned separately). Although I don't necessary recommend it, I don't regret taking this semester of Arabic and I encourage others to do so if they know what they're getting themselves into.",
                "Yes, despite the weaknesses that I listed, Arabic is a truly beautiful language and Professor Al Ani is a very good instructor.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student if they are willing to devote a significant portion of their studying time to this class. The teacher makes it clear that this class should be the students priority at the beginning and this holds up to be true, especially with the amount of self-teaching and homework assigned in class. The professor is rigid and demanding much of the time, and this can be stressful if you dont know or expect this class to be time-consuming.",
                "I would, if you actually want to learn Arabic and are willing to do the work and show up every day.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is passionate about learning a new language starting from the basics-- if you have experience with languages like Hebrew, Spanish, French, Latin, or Semitic languages you will probably have a bit of an easier time picking up the roots of Arabic words but still you will have to put in a lot (emphasis on a lot) of effort into the class."
