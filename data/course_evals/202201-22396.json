                "the readings are very interesting and relevant to the course. The syllabus is also quite comprehensive, allowing us to truly grasp the different aspects of medicine that is integrally tied to uncertainty. The classes mainly consisted of Prof. Morrison lecturing and although it was very interesting and compelling to listen to him, a lot of the course was passive learning.",
                "The strength of this course is the professor genuinely cares about his students and their understandings of the intricacies of medicine. Also, the class is very engaging. The weakness of this course is often students don't really interact with one another during class times. One student says their thoughts, and then another speaks which may or may not be related to anything their peers says. I hope in the future discussion time will be more collaborative.",
                "strengths: amazing professor, so many fun field trips, you learn so much, the discussion are some of the most interesting I've had at Yale (think medicine, ethics, psychology, philosophy, God, religion, the nature of life, empiricism, relativism, etc)\r\n\r\nweaknesses: none; the readings are manageable and the essays are based on personal experiences (very interesting to write)",
                "Strengths: best professor on campus, very good readings.\r\n\r\nWeakness: can be a lot to read every week",
                "The class was taught phenomenally well and the professor demonstrated a passion for both the course material and teaching. Frequent field trips made the class engaging and hands-on. Readings were selected and arranged to create a cohesive and interesting curriculum."

                "Yes this class is great for both stem and non stem majors! Geared towards pre-med but I'm CS-Econ and thought it was a cool class. Reading are a lot though.",
                "absolutely, it is a niche of a topic that is extremely important to truly understand and integrate, especially if you are a pre-med but even if you are not.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student, particularly any that are interested in a career related to health. Dr. Morrison is a gem and the class itself is a great way to have a more holistic understanding of medicine and not get so bogged down in the STEM pre-reqs.",
                "100%. my favorite course I've taken at Yale my whole first year. Dr. Morrison is such a kind, caring, and generous professor and he really just wants to share his abundance of knowledge and insights about the world with us. it's a privilege to take every one of his lectures, and i'm so glad to have taken this class. we went on field trips to marsh botanical gardens, the medical library, a procedure lab, beinecke, etc. and learned a ton about philosophy.",
                "Yes. Dr. Morrison is amazing and will be there to help you out the entire way. His feedbacks are also the best ones i have received so far. Even if you are not interested in medicine, this is a class you should take.",
                "Yes, especially to anyone who plans to study medicine or be a scientists; it is an important lesson to learn early on that although we are constantly seeking to reduce uncertainty, it will always exist.",
                "Yes, particularly for an aspiring doctor, this course is very illuminating. It is difficult to imagine how the humanities might apply to something as hands-on and practical as medicine--this course does a fantastic job at investigating this intersection and demonstrating how a solid grasp on the humanities can inform many important aspects of doctorhood."
