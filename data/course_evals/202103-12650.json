                "This class taught me how to think critically about the ideological forces and political organizing behind social movements. I learned most from my classmates who brought fascinating perspectives to the material we covered. This class is definitely an upper-level seminar: I felt like the students who got the most out of the course were the ones who had background knowledge of social movements around the world or well-known political ideologies that have shaped history. I would not take this course without having taken another history class about the Middle East!!!",
                "This course was integral in my advancement as a student. I learned historical methods and learned a variety of materials regarding the Middle East.",
                "I learned the methods of developing historiography in this class. I am not a history major, so some of the ways of learning were completely new to me, which Hamzah did a very good job of walking me through. I learned how to examine history from more than just the basic historicist manner."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths are the readings, the discussion, and also the fact that Hamzah is an awesome guy. I always enjoyed the discussions and he would add important comments and information as well.",
                "Strengths of this course -- we discussed many of our readings in a much more sophisticated way than most of my other classes. We were continuously pushed to offer new or interesting insight into what we discussed. I think the biggest overall strength is the challenge to think critically about various moments in history and the motivations behind political actions. We also asked important theoretical questions about identity and nation.\r\nWeaknesses of this course -- we did not cover the very basic facts or timeline of many of the movements we discussed. It was therefore difficult to place these moments in time. We should have had a stronger introduction into the history of the Middle East on a broader level before diving into specific leaders and movements. I felt like I was missing a lot of background information and context that could have made the material more relevant and accessible. I also think that we covered a TON of material. There was often too much reading to be realistically accomplished in one week alongside other course work.",
                "This course was wonderful and I don't see any ways it could be improved. Hamzah was very good at facilitating deep and meaningful conversations without taking over. The course should be considered high level as the material is plenty.",
                "The course was amazing, and much of its strength came from the readings that were provided to facilitate discussion. There were a few weaknesses in the course as well, which I assume will easily be smoothed out considering this was the first time the course was taught. Some of these include there not being much of a basis of background for the history, and what felt like an assumption that much of the knowledge that was discussed was already known by most of the students."

This course will require a lot of work if you really want to learn all that it has to offer. That being said, it's worth putting in the work if you have the time!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student as long as it is being taught by Hamzah because the course itself would not have gone as well if it weren't for his ability to direct discussions.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who already have a background in Middle Eastern history. For students that might not have as much experience, the coursework can be daunting."
