This is a mechanical engineering elective, not a theory course. We spent long enough learning about math that I think I forgot some of the fluid mechanics I learned in junior year.",

Never do you get a cooler application of a very hard subject than getting to use your boring fluid knowledge to apply it to planes.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets are not long but very difficult. Luckily there are problem sessions where de la Mora walks you through challenging problems.\r\n\r\nGo in with comfortable math knowledge and ability to apply fluids otherwise it will be very hard",
                "No. It's only an elective, you can afford to choose something else. Beth Bennett's classes may be harder and require more work, but you will be much more motivated to work in them because she is an excellent teacher and you'll know what's going on. This one was a real struggle, probably the worst class I've taken in college.",
