                "I learned about the pharmaceutical industry and how it operates, the specific mechanisms behind many of the leading diseases in the world, how to model a biotech company and forecast profits for a drug, and a lot more. I also learned how the pharmaceutical business approaches many issues when it comes to discovering, running clinical trials for, filing for approval, launching, and commercializing drugs. Overall, I learned a lot about how economics and science intersect in the pharmaceutical industry.",

                "I really enjoyed the class and it was very accessible for non-science majors. The assignments were very fun and I learned a lot. Maybe more practice with valuation would be helpful.",
                "I loved this course. Its topic is so interesting and interdisciplinary, which brings together students who wouldn't normally all be taking a class together and introduces new perspectives to a seminar class. The material is fascinating and up-to-date, and the course manages to survey a lot of things while still going far enough into detail that you can talk intelligently about and understand current topics in the field. Dr. Dash and Dr. Raskin are knowledgeable and entertaining professors, and I looked forward to going to class every week. The readings for this class rock, particularly all the case studies. The weekly workload is relatively light, except for the midterm and final. The midterm paper was a substantial amount of work, though it was helpful that we walked through a simple case in class and that reference links were provided. The final paper was easier than expected given the dummy model, detailed instructions, and the experience doing research from the midterm, though I wonder if it would've been better as a group project, where each person researches one of the pipeline drugs?",
                "Strengths: I really liked both Dr. Raskin and Dr. Dash, they played off each other and made class fun and interesting to attend! They have a lot of expertise in these areas and they also brought in some amazing guest speakers who were great to learn from. I enjoyed that the class was pretty participatory and it was one of the most practical/application-based classes I have taken here at Yale which I appreciated. Both Dr. Raskin & Dr. Dash also make themselves very available and helpful during office hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The midterm/final projects are a LOT of work whereas most weeks in the class are not much work and just a few readings, so if you're someone who procrastinates or wants work to be a little bit more evenly spaced out, it might be difficult. Sometimes class can get a little bit repetitive with numerous case studies of similar-ish situations, so I wonder if there would be more opportunity for debate/discussion at some points.",
                "The topics and case studies were interesting.",
                "Interesting course to learn about biotech in a general sense and some drugs and disease mechanisms. However, we didnt delve deep into one drug or learn in depth about modeling or forecasting. It was mostly self taught, which made this course difficult for the midterm and final",
                "Strengths include engaging lessons, professors who are knowledgeable about the topics, and in-class activities.",
                "The content of the class is interesting and professors working directly in the industry.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Raskin and Dr. Dash are amazing. I really liked the course content and the way it was taught. \r\nWeaknesses: More practice on valuation before the final project would have been helpful."

                "Absolutely take this class if this is a topic area that interests you. The professors themselves are also endlessly interesting, and it's worth taking the class for that reason alone. It's a good class to take your senior year, to hang out with other seniors outside of your major in an engaging and well-taught seminar. Be wary of the work required of the midterm and final, though - I want to say it took me 20 hours or more for each?",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any economics student who is interested in science/has a scientific background or any pre-med student because this course teaches you a lot of content that you wouldn't otherwise learn in medical school but is important for people involved in medicine to know about the drugs they prescribe to patients. It was really interesting to be able to apply concepts of economics and business management to what is fundamentally a business rooted in science.",
                "If you are interested in the crossroads of medicine and economics. It introduces basic concepts in both of the fields.",
                "I would! I learned a lot about the drug development landscape and the intersection between medicine and business/valuation!",
                "Yes I learned a lot",
                "Its a good senior seminar if you are premed or want to take a course related to medicine and biotech. I learned a lot, however, the midterms and finals were a lot of work because I didnt have much modeling experience on excel, and the teachers werent too clear or helpful when it came to that. It was self taught and tbh I didnt know what I was doing for the midterm. The cases we read were interesting, and we would spend the following class discussing it. However, we only touched the surface of so many drugs and so many diseases. It felt super rushed sometimes. I feel like I would have gotten more out of the course if we focused on less drugs and diseases and talked more about it. The speakers were interesting to meet and listen to.",
                "Yes! This a great class for anyone interested in interdisciplinary studies of economics and biology.",
                "YES DEFINITELY. Especially if you're interested in both science and business. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale for sure."
