                "I think a little less reading at times so that we can focus on few essays and dive deeper into them. The strengths are the creativity required in the course and the open space to be completely vulnerable and feel welcome.  One of the biggest strengths of this course is the ability to turn in drafts before final entry because it enhances the essay so much.",
                "i enjoyed participation in this course and I enjoyed many of the essays and writers we were able to read. a weakness is that at times the prompts (or at least my professors interpretations of them) felt limiting, as though if we did not write the essay as she wanted it written there would be more negative feedback rather than having the prompts as loose guidelines to help us generate ideas. i wish that we could've written more and that we could've gotten feedback from peers in person on almost everything we wrote. i think having more prompts to choose from could've been more exciting\/engaging.",
                "The strengths of this course are the feedback and the engagement with readings.",
                "I think that this course is different depending on who teaches it so Im only speaking for my class when I say we had a lot of homework. This was sometimes a good thing because it forced me to work hard but sometimes if I was really busy I would skip it entirely or not give it my full attention so I could just get it done. If there was less homework I may have been able to focus more on it.",
                "The course was organized very well and the flow of the semester was quite good. Additionally, the essays selected by my teacher were very good and used many interesting techniques that I had not appreciated fully until we discussed them in class.",
                "This class has a lot of work, but it is very beneficial."

                "YES YES YES! But only with Ms. Jones. I'm biased, I know. She was really just the best and made the course so amazing. Having a great instructor for a class like this makes all the difference. The readings she chose were so fun to read and were from a range of timelines, from early in American history to today. The grading can be stiff but honestly just put in the work for the class and you'll get a grade that reflects it.",

                "definitely would recommend. it's one of those yale classes everyone should take; but ideally and hopefully you'll feel compatible with all your classmates so that you each can get out more of what you put into it. i wish that everyone in my class cared just a bit more or seemed more passionate and opinionated, but the group was still fun.",
