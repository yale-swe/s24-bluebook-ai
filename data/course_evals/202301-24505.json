I loved the class discussions we had sitting around the table together. \r\nOne thing that could've made this class better would be more time engaging with immediate issues in the Deaf community. We spent a lot of time at the beginning of the semester learning about history, and I enjoyed that--but I wish we could've discussed more recent issues as well.",
                "Strengths: classroom debates, small class size, relevant topics. Weaknesses: would have liked to have more feedback on our own signing to improve throughout the semester.",
                "This class is amazing for practicing ASL and learning how to form arguments and express more complex thoughts. I did feel like I wasn't able to engage as deeply with the material as I wanted to at times though.",
                "Difficult to stay engaged for 75 minute classes",
                "Biggest strength is Dr. S and her interest in the subject. Some of my favorite moments in the class were when we would discuss the way Deaf issues affect her and how she feels about them. Overall, the course is pretty geared towards the units, I would have liked some more vocabulary like in ASL 1-4. I was learning signs more informally, but not as much as in the earlier levels."
