                "The project portion of this course is by far the highlight. I learned how to conduct oral history interviews and interact with archives both on the front and back end (doing the actual archive versus using them after the fact). The reading load was a bit heavy all of the readings were well contextualized within class time which was very helpful.",
                "The readings were really fascinating. I wish wed dont more in class discussion of them. The course seemed to be mainly focused on ethnographic methods, so I would just be prepared for that if youre taking the class. Its less discussion of ethnographic work and more learning how to do it.",
                "I really enjoyed working with La Casa's files through helping organizing the remaining boxes of the La Casa - DB archives and conducting an oral history interview with a Yale alumnus. The guided discussions were also very productive and I loved to learn about the behind the scenes of ethnography. I think expectations of of the archival box assignment could have been more clearer as archivists requested one thing, and Professor Ramos-Zayas expected another."

                "Absolutely! Its a really great methods course for the ER&M major in that you learn so much about ethnography but it is also a really fun class in terms of the projects. It is a really valuable experience to get to work with the archives and life stories of Latinos who came to Yale before us and in a way that is about actually interacting with those stories rather than just reading and writing about them. Professor Ramos-Zayas is also a wonderful teacher!",
                "Yes, if youre interested in how ethnography works. If youre just looking to read ethnography, this course is more focused on ethnographic methods rather that discussing readings.",
                "Absolutely, this is a must-take class if you are interested in the experiences of Latinx students at Yale, histories of La Casa / Despierta Boricua / MEChA. Professor Ramos-Zayas is invested in her students' learning, engagement, and well-being. She made ethnography accessible and I learned so much about the stakes of latinx ethnographic work."
