                "I learned an overview of the different types of films, from festival films to films targeted at a popular national audience. I was exposed to several new cultures and aspects of history that I hadn't known before, and I was also able to practice generalisable methods of analysis.",
                "I learned to be aware of different techniques and methods that I normally wouldnt notice when watching a film.",
                "I learnt the knowledge of comparative literature, how to analyze movies in historical and social contexts and looking at cinema in a global perspective.",

                "I developed an appreciation for film and for watching films that don't originate from Hollywood. I gained analytical skills, and learned to pay closer attention to light, color, shadow, textures, camera angles, diegetic and non-diegetic music, the use of repeated objects and shapes, the overlay of visual scenes with audio from the same or different scenes, common narrative arcs and how they can be broken, and various ways characters can serve as props in other characters' narratives. I learned how to format those observations in the context of an analytical essay.",
                "The ability to analyze film, specific production techniques such as camera angle, prop placement, etc., and the purpose of those techniques. Films can convey messages and feelings without you even realizing it is conveying the message to you.",
                "Writing, critical thinking, history, argumentation. The course has pushed us to speak our minds, but also to criticize it as well. I still remember the instructors note on writing our paper: a good argument is one that is debatable. It reminds me how we should always have a concession on several things before we can argue on different interpretations.",

                "This class taught me extended knowledge of various world regions' cultures, traditions, places, and periods. Through film analysis of non-Western films, I've gained a further understanding of colonialism and globalization and its impact globally. Furthermore, through the assignments of film analysis essays, I've accumulated my skills in critical thinking, argumentation, and writing. Through the help of the Professor and TA, who actively accommodated and encouraged students to voice their thoughts, this class also helped increase my confidence in-class participation.",

                "The strength of World Cinema lies in how insightful and interactive it is. However, its interactivity, in the beginning, is only limited towards the lecturer and the students. Towards the end, Professor Figlerowicz gives us a discussion circle that lets the interactivity to be shared amongst the classmates.",
                "Strengths: it creates a lot of discussion space and encourage all students to express their ideas; different ideas can all be accepted and elaborated by teachers; knowledge will be appropriately emphasized to get a whole picture of what we are learning\r\nWeakness: Some films are a little boring (especially at the beginning) that may be difficult for students to adapt and watch through the movie; Some aspects of the film technique like camera angles, composition etc. are not included in the class; some background infos are a bit hard to understand and no PPTs can aided for understanding (usually).\r\nImprovement: Encourage students to watch the movie that may be boring (or watch them in class), or change the order of the movie presented; use PPTs for all teachings and upload them to Canvas; Include more perspective of the technique; use more interactions (not just discussion) to make each class a little more different.",
                "This is an excellent course; it's completely changed how I'll watch movies for the rest of my life. I really enjoyed the class discussions and I appreciated Professor Figlerowicz and Colton's office hours.",
                "A strength of this course is that all of the films were very easily accessible and the format of the class ran smoothly. The only weakness is it was difficult for me to stay focused and locked in for all 3 hours of class, 3 hours is a little long.",
                "The course can benefit from more readings, but also discussing more on that reading. I understand that while the reading is important, the instructors might refrain from discussing it too much since it might put more burden on students, but I think pushing this burden would excite the class more. The class would benefit from different kinds of arguments and perspectives from different readings.",
                "i enjoyed it and felt there were not many weaknesses",
                "i love how this class members always offering their opinion. it helps to gain various point of view and understanding. some movies might be boring for some students because they couldn't relate to the storyline, or the genre, but I think it is the essence of learning world cinema; getting out of your comfort zone.",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. This class consists of a balanced time allocation between lectures and group discussions during each meeting, making the learning process easy to follow and understand. \r\n2. This class's workload is manageable, making it fit for students with no prior background in film studies. \r\n3. The professor and TA are very proactive, kind, and accommodating for students. They always spare time to answer every student's questions, even during break time. They appreciate every student's participation in class, which creates a comfortable atmosphere for the students to be proactive during the learning process. They also provide clear and elaborate feedback after assignments and office hours, which helps students improve their work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. I found some of the films challenging to understand while watching on my own (due to unfamiliarity and distraction), so I think it would be more constructive if a screening outside of class hours could be conducted for each film in the Alice Cinema, where the whole class watches the film collectively. In this way, students can allocate a fixed time to watch each film with minimal distractions.",
                "Due to the name itself, I was hoping that the course itself will jump more into the learning of culture and its exposure on films. As a visiting student from a country with different education system, I was not fully understand that the class is actually more focused in the art of the making of films so I was having many difficulties. It is clear that you need to have basic understanding in the world of films to be able to develop in the class. Although, the course itself is a fun experience as it is unique that we learn about the world's different type of cinematic development."

For students who are interested in movies or literature, this class serves as a great tool for them to get more about the movie and its form of speaking, and can encourage students to discover movie and find some interests. The wideness of the film selected in class can also let students can a rough view of the development of the film industry.",

If I'd watched the films on my own, I wouldn't have gotten nearly as much out of them. Professor Figlerowicz is amazing, and I really enjoyed our class discussions.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed watching these films and learning about the filmmaking techniques within each one.",
                "Yes. Movie is a uniquely big and important media in the world. The ability to look deeply into media is important, not only for art, but also other things we consume. The push in habituating critical thinking through cinema is necessary, since it is an important skillset everyone should have.",

I also learned broader historical contexts about parts of the world that I hadn't known before.",

Since the course also introduced me to many movies I'd otherwise never touched, it has taught me to respect and give a chance to more media. I'll definitely be more open in watching new stuff.  Using movie in an academic setting is also interesting, since it's a new thing for me. So this approachable method in introducing world history, social issues, and more is an important thing in my toolbox",
