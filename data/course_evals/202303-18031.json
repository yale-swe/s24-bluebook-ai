Without giving away the content of the course, one learns the complications and legacy of slavery and the historical journey through the Civil War, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights Movement, and today's world. There are critical moments in a Black person's life that every Black person will face, and they are almost always in white space. Understanding how a complex society works is a significant part of this course as well. One will also be able to understand some of the behaviors of white people. This understanding is based on generational ideology and a status quo.",

                "- understanding the Black experience as it applies to the racial caste and historical oppression \r\n- how to breakdown the racial framework to its parts that we see today \r\n- gained the insight of understanding and adding voice to things I had experienced as a Black person in America but didnt know why or how",

                "Through a sociological context, throughout the course, I learned about what the struggle for freedom truly meant for the African American population. I also gained insights into the ways African Americans have had to conduct themselves, not just to thrive, but also to survive."

                "weaknesses only: \r\n- he never let us speak, and in the off chance we decided we had something to say he cut us off\r\n- he completely disregards the struggles of black women, black members of the LGBTQ+ community and other marginalized groups in his analysis of what it means to manage one's identity in a white space\r\n- he is incredibly outdated in his diction as he references black people in distinctive opposition to others instead of viewing one's identity as their own (he will compare what he considers to be \"proper\" black people to \"uneducated\" black people and as an ethnographer and sociologist who studies the black experience he has yet to recognize how dangerous this rhetoric is. i brought it up once in class (with all of my classmates agreeing with me) and he told me to \"not get too caught up on the details\" which was disrespectful and quite honestly perpetuated an odd dynamic in the classroom for the rest of the semester because everyone was scared to disagree with him\r\n- he has an odd sense of respect for every man in the classroom and tends to overlook, speak over, and minimize the opinions the women who are in the classroom",
                "It was extremely disorganized. There was no syllabus and the assignments were random and based on what Anderson felt like.",
                "Strength- great reading list, can encompass a range of topics outside of the main theme, allows for lots of personal insight and life application, great guest speakers, very knowledgeable and enlightening Professor \r\n\r\nWeakness- not a lot of class time devoted for student conversation and opinion, very loosely followed syllabus, reading material assigned in an untimely manner too closely before class time, not a firm structure of class",
                "I enjoyed the guest speakers that were brought into the class, as well as the richness of the assigned texts. I felt, however, that we did not have adequate discussion of the texts during class, as I was hoping for a seminar. Also, I was expecting students to have more opportunities to express their own experiences with Blackness (as the vast majority of the class was Black), but we were rarely given the chance."

However, as a white person, I would highly recommend this course to people who believe that racism is not built into our societies, laws, and personal gains. This recommendation is not one of accusation but instead offers a unique opportunity to broaden one's knowledge of a population of people they cannot truly perceptualize. The class does not attack or blame any one source but takes a historical dive into the institutions that created and harbored racial inequality.",

However it offers amazing insight into what is to be Black and a White America and the White spaces of this country and how we all are affected and function under these castes and systems.",
                "No. This course has great potential, but I would not recommend it in its current form. Professor Anderson spent every class talking about himself and his work, rather than making space for the students or texts he assigned. Even when he invited guests, he would interrupt and talk over them. We did not know when to expect assignments and what they would entail until the day they were assigned, sometimes with a very quick turnaround. Even though this course had the greatest proportion of Black students, Professor Anderson did not help to foster a class community, which left us feeling disconnected from each other.",
