                "Strengths:\r\n- learning about the Weimar republic through the lens of a genuinely fun-to-watch TV show made the class quite enjoyable during that period\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- homework was too much for the first half of the semester\r\n- classes lacked much energy or excitement, fairly repetitive",
                "Instead of having the Babylon Berlin episode discussions dominated by two people in each class, I think it would be good to open the discussions to everyone as was the case in the first half of the semester, and not have presentations.\r\n\r\nWe wasted so much time on Babylon Berlin. It consumed nearly half the semester. The second season was excessive, and the third season was completely unnecessary. I think in the future a better format would be to have students watch only the first season at home and spend only 2-3 classes discussing the entire season. German history and culture are so interesting. It was unfortunate to restrict our study of it to the few themes explored in the tv series. \r\n\r\nWe didnt study what was arguably the most important and consequential period of German History 1933-1945. Missing out on such a pivotal period was a big failing of this class. \r\n\r\nEach paper has an early deadline which you can use to submit a first draft and receive feedback before submitting the final draft. I appreciated this feature of the class. \r\n\r\nMarion is another big strength of this class. She is a kind and thoughtful instructor and provides ample feedback to help improve your ability as a German speaker.",

I'd tell them that if they want to keep their German at a certain standard then this course could be an option, but that there might be other more engaging German courses  out there too.",
