While previously I didnt really think I could understand much from papers, I now believe that I can dive into papers and with enough work understand a majority of the details. I have a better understanding of methods in cell biology and how the researchers get the figures that they show in papers. I gained insight as to how scientists think when they organize and choose their figures to tell a story. I became better at writing about science and summarizing the important takeaways of figures. My understanding of the cytoskeleton is also stronger now.",

In all my future TAing\/teaching, if I could just emulate her, I know I'm improving the lives of my students.\r\n\r\nBut also, lots of biology. I learned how to put together and give longer (~25 min) presentations to peers. I learned how to read primarily literature better. I learned that the cytoskeleton and extremely complex and essentially plays a roll in everything. Even though the information wasn't directly related to my research, it was still totally worth it for the learning experience.",

                "Overall excellent",
                "I love how organized this class is. We read one paper every week and get to focus in depth on it by discussing as many of the figures and experiments as we can in class. Everyone in the class got a chance to present the backgrounds or methods for one paper, and we got the chance to participate every week. The class environment is also very wonderful because Professor Chandhoke is so patient and kind, and she makes us all feel welcome.  I don't think there were any weaknesses.",
                "Strength - Dean C is a really wonderful person and professor. Dean C is always there to help you.\r\nWeakness - Sometimes the papers are really long and we don't discuss everything, but it's hard to find short papers.",
                "This class was an awesome experience as a senior in MCDB who felt pretty unconnected from most of my previous classes. Being able to talk each week with my peers was a huge strength of the class. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that could be improved was the length of student presentations. Many weeks I felt myself tuning out after 75 minutes of being lectured at. I wished a.) students made their presentations more interactive and b.) presentations had a max time limit.",
                "This course, as Dean C mentions at the beginning, is in fact as much as each student wants to make of it. This is a strength of the courseyou will get what you are looking for. If you want a light workload and a relatively chill course, it is possible to skim the papers and get the broad takeaways. Generally, however, students in this course are very motivated to understand the detailsif you want to develop in your paper reading skills, this course is fantastic practice, and Dean C gives helpful feedback for the students. Dean C herself is highly supportive and thoughtful, and gives her students a good deal of freedomfor example, it was nice to be able to choose to do reading responses for only 5 of the 10 papers. Dean C recognizes and rewards good effort on the reading responses, so it does not feel like youve wasted your time even if youve spent a sizeable chunk of time on them. One potential weakness is because theres no set topical structure in the course, students may not come out with as much structured knowledge about the cytoskeleton. This may however, be a product of the way this course is designed, which is geared toward understanding papers and common themes as opposed to a thorough description of the different players of the cytoskeleton. Depending on what you want out of the course this may or may not be an issuemost of what I gained from this course were skills as opposed to facts.",
                "It's always tough over Zoom. Throughout each class, Dean C had private chat amongst students disabled. I thought that was a good idea! But I think sometimes even the open chat (i.e. to \"everyone\") was also disabled but there are times I would've liked to ask a question or something. This is just me nit-picking though, I can't think of another way the course could be improved, truly.\r\n\r\nHuge strengths are the kindness of Dean C (which probably everyone will talk about in their evals) and the time she puts into the course. She reads your response thoroughly and meets with you many days before your presentation. I personally had almost nothing done compared to my partner, but she was still really kind and understanding - just pointed me in the right direction which was all I needed!",
                "Fair workload, and very well set up for student success. Very organized from the start.",

                "Except for the shift from in person to virtual meetings, it didnt feel like many other aspects of this course needed to adjust to the remote situation. It was kind of Dean C to hand\/mail out papers to students. I do wish I had gotten to know more of the other students. Just for this remote time, perhaps more group assignments or even having 3 person groups for discussing figures as opposed to 2 on occasion may have helped.",
                "I think there is a harsh reality to Zoom classes - that they will never be quite as dynamic or fluid as in-person classes. However, I've realized that very often, students and professors use \"oh, that's just Zoom\" as an excuse to accept mediocrity. Often students will be scrolling through social media during class just because their camera is off and say \"oh, it's not my fault, I just get distracted\". Likewise, professors will give unengaging and brutally fast lectures without a true care for students because \"the students have their cameras off anyways\" or whatnot. Dean C showed how it was done. I often felt as though I was in the physical classroom. I could see people's reactions, their giggles at Dean C's stories, their involuntary gaffaws when a student makes a funny comment, etc. She facilitated everything really well. Maybe it was the small class size. Maybe it was the connection we all felt as senior MCDB students. Maybe it was because it was in the morning. Probably a little of everything, but Dean C tied it all together into an amazing class.",
