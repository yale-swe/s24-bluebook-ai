I understand the goal of the course was to practice speaking and developing my speaking ability, but I really would have liked to learn more tenses and sentence structure because some of the thigs we covered was boring and not really relevant to modern life.",

                "I liked how this course encouraged a lot of participation but I wish that we had a bit more focus on grammar. It was difficult to improve my actual Spanish speaking...I could only understand those with more sophisticated speech.",

The weaknesses are the topics covered which can get repetitive and somewhat boring."

If you pay attention to the vocab and grammar structures used in the texts youre analyzing and make the effort, youll get even more out of it than if the prof was making you do grammar worksheets.",
