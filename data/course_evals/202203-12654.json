                "Lectures long and can be dry, however, Professor Bennett is extremely nice and in touch with student needs",
                "Lectures are amazing and Professor Bennett is a great Professor. She is really good at explaining concepts that can be very difficult to understand in an intuitive way. Additionally, the course is really well organized, office hours are really helpful, and the TAs are also really helpful.",
                "This course is really well-structured. The course material builds your understanding from the ground up and gradually gives you more difficult challenges. The course never felt overwhelming, but always felt challenging; the course difficulty is geared well towards its intended audience. I think the psets were all very relevant to the lecture material, which helped me stay motivated to learn. \r\n\r\nI honestly can't think of any weaknesses. This is a very solid course that is well-designed and teaches you exactly what it says it will teach you.",
                "beth is an incredible prof. she really takes the time to teach you coding and is very fair. lot's of OH to assist with any questions.",
                "I think that the course was extremely organized and that Beth did a great job structuring the course. The problem sets are not too bad but do require some thought before coding. If this course were to be improved, I would say that the exams should have more time, as they were quite difficult to successfully complete and debug within the time we were given.",
                "It was a very strong course. I came in with zero coding experience and was able to catch-up to speed very quickly.",
                "I believe that this course is extremely strong, it goes at a good pace and has all the necessary tools to learn and do the problem sets efficiently .",
                "well organized",
                "Strengths: Professor Bennett is an amazing lecturer and reaches out to talk informally. Constant stream of office hours and help sessions. Notes are so clear. Lectures recorded. Sample codes super useful in terms of understanding, and so are the PSets. \r\nWeaknesses: None. Pretty much a perfect intro coding course.",
                "I thought it was a very well conducted and supported course with many many available office hours for help. Course recordings and sample codes were very informative and insightful.",
                "A strength of this course is its organization as it is very structured to make it easy to learn and follow along. A weakness is the style of teaching which is very boring and therefore difficult to follow at times as there is no engagement just reading off slides.",
                "I believe that the structure of exams could be improved. For a class that often stresses doing things in a certain way to reflect what a job environment might look like, it doesn't make sense to give students 75 minutes to build an entire code effectively from scratch when there would be no such time pressure in a real-world setting. Other coding/data science classes have take-home exams that would work very well here, especially since this is an intro class where there is a large range of previous coding knowledge and experience among the students.",
                "Strengths: \r\nThe simplicity of lectures and the abundance of information on all programming languages learned. The example codes were also easy to follow.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThere could be more opportunities early in the year to improve on coding skills that are necessary for later psets",
                "In this course, asking for help with questions and assignments was very easy. There were multiple office hours and help sessions each week, and the sessions were placed across a wide variety of times, making attending them very easy. In addition, the lectures in the course were very well organized, with a clear connection between each of the classes, and the slides were easily accessible outside of class.",
                "The strengths are that it effectively teaches you how to code. Professor Bennett has structured this course perfectly to facilitate student learning."

                "Absolutely! While the course material is dry, Dr. Bennett makes the course incredibly engaging and very accessible.",

                "It depends on what you're looking for. If you want an intro programming course, it's okay but not the best. If you just want to learn some C/C++ then it's a good course.",

                "Absolutely. \r\n\r\nFor context, I knew nothing about how to program when I started. I really don't think there is any better way to learn CS than with Professor Bennett. You might be put off initially by the languages because C and C++ are \"old\" but truth is there are plenty of reasons to learn C and C++, and more as your first language. I learned so much in this class and I look forward to taking more CS classes in the future as I feel well prepared.\r\n\r\nOne thing to be cautious is that workload spikes near the end of the semester, so plan ahead for that.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course if you're looking to develop a very solid fundamental understanding of programming. You won't be learning anything too advanced, but this is a great gateway into higher-level courses if you want to take those. If you don't want to take additional programming courses, this is still an excellent choice because all of the psets and projects are geared towards real-world applications.",
                "Yes, if you don't plan on going much further into cs and just want to code for engineering, physics, etc.",

                "Yes. I felt like the PSETs effectively built upon each other, and I learned a lot from each one. It was also very interesting from an engineering perspective.",
                "I highly recommend this course for any engineer or any student wanting to try coding. It taught me a lot in a relatively short amount of time in a fun and engaging way.",
                "It's a hard class. But very organized and well taught.",
                "yes",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to take introductory coding, From what I've heard, this is much much better than CS50 or the other introductory computer science options. Obviously would recommend to anyone who can use it for their major, but this is a great course for anyone.",
                "Absolutely! Whether coming with some CS background or none (like I did), it is a very suitable course.",
                "If you want basics in coding I would look to the CS department instead of this course as they cover more languages that are used more routinely, as C and C++ are not the most commonly used languages, and will go more in depth.",
                "Yes, if they want a baseline understanding of C, and C++ and its concepts as well as an introduction to Matlab they should take this class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course for any students looking to learn an introduction to programming. This course presents programming in C, MATLAB, and C++ in a very approach manner, and it is very easy to get help with you need it.",
                "Yes, the course does a great job of teaching you some languages and giving you an understanding of the nature of programming without the overly stressful workload of other introductory computer science courses. However, it is still time consuming."
