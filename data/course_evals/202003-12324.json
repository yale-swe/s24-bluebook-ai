The class does a really good job of diving into the intersection between law and tech and teaching you about how they affect each other. Instead of simply relying on popular rhetoric, I was able to learn the legal basis behind censorship and privacy claims, net neutrality, and so many of the events we see with tech today. My biggest takeaway was understanding how legal frameworks can support or hinder technological innovation, how harmful technology can be safely regulated, and how the law needs to change to catch up to tech. It is a highly relevant class irrespective of what your field is.",
                "The biggest skill I developed through this course is the ability to think critically about laws and court decisions. I learned to read court documents and glean the most useful information out of them. Brad's goal for this course wasn't to teach us the specifics about tech law (though I do remember the discussions about CFAA, DMCA, copyright, etc); it was to build a foundation for thinking about all law critically through topics like rules vs standards vs norms, knowingly vs intentionally, where is the line, etc. I definitely gained quite a bit of knowledge about the field of law through this course.",

Before taking this class, I had not realized how complex these issues are or how misunderstood they are in politics today. This course has also helped me improve my reading comprehension (reading large texts and finding the important information) and auditory comprehension (understanding lecture material) skills, as well as my ability to construct a strong and nuanced argument.",

For example, in the midterm, we had to evaluate whether certain works infringed on the copyright of Disney's Lion King's \"Circle of Life,\" and here, we really had to apply our problem solving, weighing, and judgement skills. It also goes without saying that I gained knowledge of digital law and the different aspects that govern the way we (as a society) handle tortious behavior on the internet.",

This was very instructive as it encouraged us to view our comments as claims rather than just remarks--and to make sure that we had a way to back up our claims. This process honed the argumentation style of much of the class. \r\nI also think I learned a few things about law, mostly copyright law because that's what I found most interesting, and, more importantly, Brad did a good job of ensuring that our takeaways were the critical pieces of information."

                "This course is exceptional. The singular complaint I have is that it was online and thus inherently less interactive. Brad is an incredible professor who has developed a system and style that stick with students for long after the class has ended.",
                "Strengths: Professor is extremely knowledgeable and very engaging, always keeps the class interesting and fun. Course content is very interesting, current and relevant.\r\nWeaknesses: Feedback for assignments is delayed considerably.",
                "I definitely got enough out of the class, but would have benefited from doing all the readings. Strength: Brad is very engaging and energetic. He's not the typical Yale lecturer. Weakness: you don't get back any graded assignment until the very end. Not sure if it's just me, but I haven't gotten back the reading responses, nor my midterm grade yet, and it's reading week. Another weakness is that the readings are a bit much, although Brad points out which ones are absolutely necessary and which ones you can skim.",

                "Strengths: Brad, his teaching, and the class discussions. Weaknesses: took a while to return grades and provide feedback on written assignments.",
                "The strengths are definitely the professor (although he will try to convince you that you shouldn't take the class if he's \"too much\" for you). This course also introduces you to law in a way that I feel most political science courses fail to (even though this is a CPSC course). One weakness is that this scam of a school refuses to give him more TAs so we never get grades back (not Brad's fault). I didn't receive graded feedback until after the last class of the semester. The midterm also kinda ruined my halloween (I know, corona, but it is my favorite holiday and was supposed to be my one escape from this hellhole) so that was sad so maybe if it was not over halloweekend I would have had a better time. This isn't really a strength or a weakness but THIS IS NOT A GUT! The readings take a while!",
                "Bear in mind I was digital b\/c of COVID-19:\r\n\r\nWeakness: Zoom lectures are inherently terrible--they kill all sense of live sharing of space, and draining and hellish. but that's not Brad's fault. \r\n\r\nStrength: Brad. He makes the material engaging and interesting. I have no desire to be a lawyer, and this class (read: Brad) makes me reconsider it. He is a phenomenal professor, and I wish i could've taken it with him live.  To any prospective students, Take this class. If you're able to wait to take it in person, do it then. If not you will still learn a lot.",
                "Strengths: Entertaining, insightful, fun\r\nWeaknesses: No grades, have no idea how you're doing in the course, unbearable amount of weekly reading",
                "The strengths of the course are the useful examples Brad provides when teaching the legal concepts. He can explain complex ideas in a way that makes them more manageable to understand. However, I felt like this course did not have enough support. There were limited office hours and no feedback was given on any of the graded assignments. It was very hard to know how I was doing in the class and what I could do to improve my performance.",
                "The lectures were terrific but feedback was insanely slow and hindered my ability to improve the analytical skills with which I engaged course materials.",
                "Material is cool, instructor is lively and engaging, workload is manageable. Only possible improvement would be more timely feedback.",
                "Strengths: I learned so much in such a short period of time, Brad is extremely smart and explains things very well.\r\nWeaknesses: the Zoom format made it harder to participate in class",
                "Strengths: the material is highly relevant and I found it pretty interesting. Learning the legal basis behind tech innovation, privacy, censorship, etc. is a very powerful tool and something that everybody should understand. \r\nWeaknesses: it is possibly the most poorly organised class ever. We didn't get a single reading response grade all semester, and we only got the midterm grade during finals period. We had no information at all about the final project, and it was eventually made optional. Readings were posted on Sunday evening for Monday class, giving us no time to write reading responses. Also, the midterm was ABSURD. It was a take-home essay question format, and the word limit was 7000 WORDS. This is not an exaggeration. Most people wrote over 5000 words, and that was definitely the necessary amount. The readings are also absurdly long, but you can skim them\/not do all of them. \r\n\r\nBrad warns you that you should take this class only if you like his personality -- and he is absolutely right. If you are not a fan of his teaching style and personality, you will regret taking the class.",
                "Brad is the strength of this course -- he is an incredible lecturer and instructor and does a great job at coaxing out individual opinions from students (which I think is a big deal, when most courses just want students to understand the material and write good papers). His hypotheticals really made me question my own opinions and the law as a whole. One weakness of this course, however, is its lack of organization. Nothing was ever posted on Canvas, and no grades or comments were ever returned to me, until the last week of classes. Readings were posted on a separate website, but there were a ridiculously large amount of them and it took me forever to get through them. I bet a lot of other students didn't even read half of them, as they were not required readings for the most part. I mostly embraced the disorganization, but there were definitely some moments (for example, the final reading responses are due at the end of the semester and only a few weeks before the end did I find out that we could only write one per week... there was some frantic writing going on!) where I felt more than a little stressed from the disorganization of the course.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is the content. The topics covered in the course are very interesting. Brad is also a great professor. The biggest weakness of the course is the lack of structure. Lectures can be hard to follow at times, and grades are not returned in a timely manner.",
                "We received no feedback at all on any course work the entire semester. I had no clue how I was doing on assignments, and therefore couldnt have done anything to improve them if I was missing the mark. Considering we turned in a midterm and at least 5 papers, I find this utterly ridiculous.",
                "This class and its material are very interesting, and the professor was extremely charismatic and engaging. Unfortunately, the courses setup does not transition well to a virtual format. Student engagement was less than ideal, and a handful of highly interactive students led the majority of the discussions. The class benefitted strongly from the virtual format by creating a relevant scenario in which cross-internet relationships matter. \r\n\r\nOverall, one of the biggest cruxes of this course is that it relies on high student engagement, by virtue of being centered around student discourse. It is hard to form these relationships virtually, and a tangible effect this had was the ultimate cancellation of the final project since it usually was done in groups that had naturally formed throughout the course of the semester.",
                "Cold calling should be implemented to increase student engagement during live virtual seminars.",
                "maybe less readings. I found myself having to pick and choose which ones I would read. Are they all important?",
                "Strengths: Interesting readings, a good mix of pop-culture readings and actual legal information.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I never received feedback on any work until after the end of semester.  I still don't have any feedback on any of reading responses.  The class lacks structure. There is no roadmap (like most classes have) dividing the class into chewable sections. It's all one big cluster of info. This made it difficult to study for the midterm. The professor never asked for mid-semester feedback to correct any of this.",
                "The strength of the class was that it was easy to digest. The various readings and videos we used were very memorable and funny (a lot of them being comedic parodies), so I made a lot of flashbulb memories of the material in this course. The weakness of this class is that it is difficult to execute online. A lot of the hypothetical situations were made awkward by the lack of participation and awareness you couldn't really see how other people reacted to a given situation, so it was hard to start discussions. Despite this, I also argue that the online-only format lended some strength to the class, allowing people to easily share files or XKCDs to the class that they enjoyed and found relevant, and the fact that videos and online media were easier to present in an online only format made the class transition much more smoothly. \r\nThe lack of interaction was the greatest weakness of this course. Besides student-student interaction and professor-student interaction in the class, I had no way to gauge how much I actually knew in the course. We wrote response papers that we never got feedback on, and our midterm was returned weeks after it was due. The lack of feedback on the response papers (i.e. something that could gauge how much we understood the material) interfered with my midterm as I had no idea as to how confident I should be about the material on the exam or where I was neglecting other information.",
                "I think there should be more TAs or at least more involvement from them; I only heard of them when I got my midterm grade back after the semester was well over. I think it would be helpful to have emails so as to easily ask questions outside of class time",
                "Strength: lecture was fun \r\nWeakness: received no material back during the semester",
                "I can't really comment on the strengths and weaknesses of the course because this year was so weird. Some of the memes were stale, which I get is necessary, but also like a FIVE minute youtube video from 2011 is not always easy to enjoy."

                "The final project was made optional, so I appreciated that. I'm not sure if anything else was changed to suit pandemic learning though. It was almost like Brad gave up and said sorry, this class just won't work as well on Zoom, sucks to suck.",
                "This class isn't meant to be taken in a virtual setting, but Brad's personality and energy helped make the course work over Zoom.",
                "It was nice that Brad worked really hard to connect with us, although like he said I don't feel like many people tried to connect with him. The only change from normal years was that the lecture itself wasn't in person and he really did try to remedy that virtually.",
                "Zoom sucks. I will write this in every evaluation for every course I take. Distanced learning is incredibly flawed. Everything suffers because of the lack of human presence, I will include this in every evaluation. I refuse to let the administration pretend things worked well this fall. They did not. \r\n\r\nRe: CPSC183. Brad tried his damnedest. He kept people engaged during the lecture, audience participation was encouraged. This is the only lecture class I actively wanted to keep my video turned on it. The lectures are best live. This course would not have the same value prerecorded.",
                "I felt like this class was too large to establish a level of comfort for participating often on Zoom. I wish there was a larger use of polls and breakout rooms. No one in my class was able to make any friends in the class and I felt quite disconnected from the class atmosphere. I wish there could also be an effort to create discussion or study groups and more access to office hours.",
                "Doing lectures live and not recorded made the lectures more fun and engaging. Wasn't like watching youtube tutorials which most virtual lectures are like. It was weird that some people participated a lot and others were silent with cameras off the whole time. Not sure if it's bad or not or what to do about it.",
                "I think Brad did a great job going over readings with us in class. I got bored watching some of the videos he would present because I just didnt understand the references the videos were making - probably in a lecture hall it would have been easy to turn to a neighbor and ask them whats going on.",
                "Live lectures were good, however it would have been nice to have them recorded (I was in a different time zone for the second half of the semester and the class was at 2am for me).",
                "I don't really feel like any of the class was well-adjusted for the pandemic; it seems to me like this is how Brad has always done it, so that's how it remained. Granted, I think the class was fine in the pandemic, but Brad mentioned a lot that we missed out on some great parts of the class due to it being remote. Brad attempted to do office hours, but I was never able to access it. I completely understand that Brad is busy and has a lot on his plate, but I don't think I ever received an email response from him, which I think is a little unfair in a remote setting. I thought lectures were great and remained engaging, despite the Zoom setting.",
                "I wish that this course had been recorded. There were several times throughout the semester where my Zoom dropped, and I was not able to go back and rewatch what I missed.",
                "The 'leminar' format is, in my opinion, the best format for highly-enrolled classes. It is a versatile format that is able to switch from professor-led discussion into seminar-style student engagement. Our professor was reactive to the needs of the class and changed the schedule of certain classes to make the experience more enjoyable for the students.",
                "Office hours and the ability to ask questions through email to the instructor\/TA definitely made virtual engagement in this course easier for me. For future years of this course (if it is still virtual), I would suggest using breakout rooms or some other kind of small group discussion for the students to get to know each other. I know this was the original plan at the beginning of the semester and I understand why it didn't work out. However, the feeling of community between students did grow with our extra credit final project -- connecting with other students for the first time in the course at the end of the semester still made it worthwhile. Nonetheless, I think that breakout rooms or keeping the group final project for most\/all students would have assisted with the feeling of community.",
                "I loved the videos we were shown in class. I felt left out In the discussions (mostly my fault for not speaking up, but a lot of references were made to things a person \"fresh off the boat\" wouldn't know.",
                "I think this class didn't have any practices geared towards learning during the pandemic, and I think that's actually a beautiful thing. This course can be taught both in-person and in real life. However, like I said before, the lack of being in the same space as other students does hamper the learning a bit. Since the class was mostly a lecture and discussion, I think there's little room for improvement. One thing of note was that we didn't overly discuss there were always videos to watch or resources to read that balanced the amount of talking in the lecture. I do believe that the class could benefit from a more active structure, possibly a live polling or learning feature. While I was studying at UNH, we used a live learning\/polling program called TopHat that made class interaction fun because not only did you have to respond but you could also see other student's responses, so you could gauge what the class was like. I believe that if we were a bit more active, the online class would be totally fine.\r\nOne thing I think was neglected in this course was feedback, as I mentioned earlier. If we received our response papers back earlier with helpful feedback, I'm certain I wouldn't have felt like I wasn't sure where I stood in the course. We received a lot of grades later than expected, which could be improved if papers were simply graded earlier.",
                "I think some things that could help the course would be either a rubric or some feedback on the reading response to make sure students are on course and more office hours including TA office hours",
                "The fact that Brad asked a lot of questions and tried to connect with the class made a huge difference in terms of engagement. However, I cannot imagine being a first year or sophomore doing school from home and trying to navigate a zoom class. It's terrible. Personally, I signed up for this class with a really good friend of mine who was in my \"covid bubble\" this semester which allowed us to join classes together occasionally, and that hugely boosted my engagement. I cannot emphasize enough how important in-person classes are for learning, for a whole lot of nearly intangible reasons that can't be captured by some pseudo-quantitative approach of trying to figure out like how many units of lesson did we get compared to normal. Brad genuinely tried his hardest to engage us all, and he succeeded as much as is humanely possible over zoom. As an instructor, he doesn't have much room for improvement--the problems with the course, and with engagement, and with workload are all problems related to virtual education and are outside of his personal control. Ultimately, until the COVID-19 pandemic ends, the quality of all Yale classes will be significantly diminished, despite the fact that majority of the student body and the majority of instructors--like Brad--are actively trying their hardest to make this work. I feel grateful to have at least taken an interesting class, despite it not having been under the best of circumstances. Another thing that would improve the course that, again, has nothing to do with Brad personally would be if Yale funded more ULAs for the course, so that grading could be completed faster. I didn't get any papers back (even one I turned in the first week) until after the semester ended. I wasn't even mad about that because as far as I could tell there was ONE grader for the course and they seemed super over-burdened."

            "comments": [
                "Take this class. The experience of having taken 183, and more importantly met Brad is exactly the kind of thing I came to Yale for. He's such a fabulous educator and person it's an opportunity no one should pass up.",
                "Yes I would. It is extremely interesting and the professor is very good at what he does.",
                "I would recommend it, but shopping period is when you should really see if it's for you. If not, don't take it. Some classes, Brad just talks and doesn't get to the material, and if you're the type of student who wants to learn every class, then this might not be it for you.",
                "YES, but first shop it to see if you enjoy Brad's teaching style. He's incredibly engaging, and presents the course material in fun and interesting ways. It's such a refreshing class and a great fifth class, but don't take it lightly. Not great if you suffer from grade anxiety, but usually they work out in the end.",
                "No, even if you think you can stand Brad's rants and 500-page weekly readings.\r\nYou also will get absolutely 0 grades back until Reading Period and so will have 0 idea where you stand in the class. Even as I'm writing this Course Evaluation, I haven't received the grades back for any of my 5 reading responses. If you really wanna take it, just Credit\/D\/Fail it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Every CS student at Yale should take this course sometime before they graduate. The course provides a valuable perspective on the impact of technological developments, and it prompts you to question your own beliefs and reevaluate them based on a renewed look on the world.",
                "YES! Brad is such a fun person and he makes the course content-laws- so much fun in creative ways.",
                "Absolutely. It's a must take before you leave Yale.",
                "Please take this course. I took it online during COVID, and I still got SO much out of it. Please take this course. If you engage with it, and with Brad, it will make you a better thinker, make you understand copyright law and privacy. Seriously it is a phenomenal class. I'm just jealous you'll get to take it in person and I had to take it online.",
                "Do not recommend if you want A, A-\/B+ very possible; also a gem of a CR\/D",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to learn about law involving technology and are comfortable with not getting any feedback or knowing your grade in the class. The information learned in class and readings are super interesting, but there is no feedback on any assignments or grades released.",
                "Yes because the material is so fascinating and Brad is a caring, thoughtful lecturer. However, do not expect to improve your writing or to receive great feedback on your submissions.",
                "YES! A MUST TAKE! If you're comfortable with Brad's wacky teaching style (you'll know on day 1), then you are making a grave error by not taking.",
                "Yes. I came into this class a freshman who was remotely interested in going into law and considering IP. This class has taught me that IP law and tech law in general will become incredibly important in the future and has really made me think seriously about eventually becoming a lawyer. I really loved how Brad would give anecdotes about law school\/ his Yale experience during class - as a first-year this helped make me feel like I am part of a bigger community of Yalies.",
                "Depends. The material is great (some parts are dry, but overall interesting and highly relevant) and having just 5 reading responses + midterm is great but the other aspects are not so great. If you are taking the class, you should be sure that you are okay with Brad's personality and you should definitely not expect to get any sort of feedback on your work or any grades back the entire semester. Take the class just for the interesting material and credit D it if the grade matters you. I would probably take it again if I had to, but be prepared for a messy course. Readings are posted the night before class (how is one supposed to write a reading response on them???), Brad doesn't really respond to questions over email, and the midterm is just absurdly long (10 pages of essay writing).",
                "I would! I didn't rate the course super highly because I'm not sure I learned as much as I could've or got as much out of it as I should've in a remote learning setting. Regardless, Brad is a phenomenal instructor and really pushes you to develop your own opinions and think outside the box. It's definitely a fun and (for the most part) chill class. I took it thinking it would be a fun fifth class, but be forewarned that it is NOT a gut. There are a lot of readings to be done and long reading responses to be written in short periods of time. You will have to put time into this class, but if you're interested in the material, engaged, and ready to learn, then it's a fun class to be a part of.",
                "Absolutely take this class. Given the option, definitely wait until it's in person again. But it's worth your time either way.",
                "I think that this course is very interesting. If you are interested in the law at all, this is a great course. That being said, do not take this course if you are concerned with grades. There was little to no feedback returned throughout the semester in terms of grades.",
                "Yes, as long as you are fine with not receiving any feedback the entire semester.",
                "I would highly recommend this class, but strongly advise that it be taken in person if at all possible. It was very difficult to remain engaged at times, despite being very interested in the material and wanting to succeed in the class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if I knew they were interested in the course material and open to a flexible learning style.",
                "Yup! It's a great CS elective and just a very interesting class.",
                "No, I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. There will be no feedback provided to you throughout the semester. There's no syllabus or roadmap (the syllabus gets created as the semester progresses), so you can't read ahead. Readings for Monday were uploaded during the weekend, which means that you either had to do work on weekends, or miss your readings. The readings weren't really further expanded upon in class. In this class I felt like I didn't have much guidance or structure, especially regarding the lack of feedback, but also regarding the last-minute upload of required readings. If we had been given the chance to anonymously provide mid-semester feedback (an option that most other classes provide), some of this may have been corrected. But there was no opportunity for mid-semester feedback either.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I'm a high school student taking this course as  part of the College Before College Program, and this course just about hits all the right notes of what I think a college course should be engaging (I enjoy Brad's humor) but not incessantly needy, comprehensive, and cohesive, among other things. My only gripe with it was the worries I had when I didn't receive feedback but I suppose that might push students to do their best to ensure they know all the material. It refers a lot to pop culture, which is very useful because a lot of students nowadays can connect to the course material easily and engage with it in a meaningful way. The professor's attitude towards teaching really helped make the class stick out in my memory.",
                "Definitely make sure to shop it before taking it. Brads teaching style is very fun and intense but its definitely not for everyone. The class material was very interesting, but be prepared for a decent reading load. Also this might have been because of the online format but we didnt receive any work back during the semester. I thought Id be okay with this as it was said in previous reviews, but once I was in the class I realized I did not feel comfortable with the material and I would have really appreciated some feedback, so really keep this in mind as youre deciding. Some of the classes were a bit awkward because of zoom, but overall the course material was very interesting and presented to us in a fun manner so Id recommend if youre looking for a class to change up your course material.",
                "Yes! This is course is great if you want to get a better understanding of technology and law, but it's also a great place to improve your thinking and arguing skills."
