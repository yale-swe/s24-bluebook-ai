The homework helped to cement concepts taught in class a lot and was engaging, but some of the activities were very similar so it felt repetitive and unnecessary at times, especially because we were assigned quite a lot of homework everyday.",

I think it all depends on if you see yourself wanting to continue with French or not, as well. Ultimately, this is up to the discretion of other students' opinions and plans, but I really enjoyed immersing myself more in French.",

                "Yes! Although classes are everyday, the class size is pretty small, about 10-15 students, so it feels more homey and it is easy to make good friends there, especially because the lessons are engaging and team-work is very often practised.",
                "Yes, I think this class helps a lot with french foundations and sets you up well to start formulating sentences on your own as well as speaking the language fluently."
