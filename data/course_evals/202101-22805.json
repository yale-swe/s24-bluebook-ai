                "Strengths: The course content is interesting and useful, yet not too difficult. This felt like a survey course in the sense that we didn't delve too deeply into any method; rather, the professor introduced us to a wide range of tools and models and opened the door for us to explore more on our own time or future research. The problem sets and final project were fun and intellectually rewarding. I think I learned a lot despite the assignments not taking too long. The professor and teaching assistant were both very helpful and generous with their time. I can't think of any weaknesses for the course.",
                "This course is very underrated! Professor Smith is great at explaining the math behind each method and walking us through Julia. I personally did not find any weaknesses (perhaps a bit more guidance on what is required in the final write-up?).",
                "strengths: material is interesting and relevant, problem sets are helpful, Julia is a cool language, \r\nweaknesses: virtual lecture wasn't always easy to follow, we occasionally got a bit into the weeds in specific models",
                "Great class and Professor and Anthony were both elite at the material and elite at explaining the material. Dont think I could have done this without their help and they really really made the material accessible. \r\n\r\nOnly weakness is LOL the period of confusion between lecture and when I ask for help",
                "The zoom format was challenging but I really enjoyed the class. Most of the learning in my opinion happens through the problem sets and final project so the experience with the class was still very good."

                "Of course! The professor is great, the assignments are fun, and the material is compelling. Most other economics courses at Yale don't offer exposure to this type of coding (in econometrics, for example, you're cleaning data or running regressions) or a similar level of quantitative rigor. I also imagine that the stuff you pick up in this class would come in useful in your first year of graduate school. Some of the models you learn are actually quite sophisticated and relevant to research that's going on now.",
                "Yes, especially if one is interested in macro or finance research. Engaging lectures and problem sets help you learn fundamental methods and their applications to well-known models, and the final project is great for letting you explore a topic of personal interest.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if you want to learn a bit more about how you can apply programming in economics research. I will definitely use this in the future (whether it's for research or a thesis). I came into this course not really expecting anything, but I would say it's one of the Econ courses where I really got to learn how to implement things (as opposed to just solving math problems) and see how they worked.",
                "Definitely, yes. The material is super interesting and important. You'll learn lots of relevant computational skills.",
                "For sure. Take it as junior if you can because this will be helpful for thesis.",
