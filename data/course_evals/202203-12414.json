As advertised, you'll learn a lot about how these topics are derived and more advanced problem-solving skillsthere are very few pset problems (maybe none) where you can just \"plug-and-chug\" numbers into a formula to find the answer."

            "comments": [
                "This class was challenging, but it was engaging.",
                "The strength of this course lies in its explanatory style. Unlike in previous physics courses I've had, PHYS 260 went into great detail about how exactly certain physical principles can be derived and what specific assumptions must be made along the way - in so doing, the course reframed Newtonian mechanics as an intricate logical system in its own right, rather than leaving it as a set of loosely connected arbitrary principles. I'm very excited for the framework built up in this class to be extended in future semesters.\r\n\r\nThe weakest part of the course might lie in the disjointedness between the lectures and the textbook, and sometimes within the textbook itself. While I understand that the lectures and readings are meant to be complementary, some intriguing topics in K&K that the authors explained rather confusingly (momentum flux, normal modes, etc.) were never clarified in class, occasionally leading to some panic.",
                "Strengths are the choice of content was made for intuitive understanding of physics. However, topic presentation and testing had massive room for improvement. The professor is kind but he has not thought sufficiently about what content is interesting or difficult in standard mechanics. While his added topics are frequently engaging and well taught (eg his coverage of oscillator equations and special relativity), more than half of his lectures are on standard textbook topics and these are not high quality. Generally, the textbook explanations were both more intuitive and more detailed for such varied topics as kinematics, momentum, angular velocity/momentum, rotating reference frames, central/2-body lotion. This isnt some brutal critique of his teaching; the topics were discussed and his added content was great. But for intro classes, especially intensive ones that are a lot of work, I think it would benefit if Professor Harris (who is wonderful) spent more time thinking about this. Further, tests were really mediocre; the first test was easy but good questions, the second test was good but way too hard for a class that claims not to curve (the high was a 90, an A- by his initially stated standards, average was 72=C-), the final was fine but weird and had no questions on angular momentum (except a simple integral to calculate inertia) or noninertial reference frames and only one weird question on central body forces, which were half the course. I know though writing tests is hard, and its not the most important thing. In conclusion, it is a good class but theres a lot to improve :)",
                "Strength: use of vectors in the calculation and practice problem is a very good practice, lecture slides are uploaded on time, and Professor Jack Harris was great at explaining the intuitions!!!!!! The peer office hours are very helpful! It's a great course to take!\r\nWeaknesses: there are errors on the lecture slides occasionally, and the slides were too math-heavy (especially during the lectures where lots of mathematical derivation/manipulation were shown at once, it is a bit hard to follow.) Mid-term 1 was set too easy while mid-term 2 was set too difficult. Topics tested in the final could have been made clearer; topics not tested were only announced the day before the final exam. I learned more things by grinding the textbooks.",
                "This course had great problems that made me develop as a problem solver. I enjoyed that some of the lecture material was quite advanced, particularly when deriving certain equations, and that we were not responsible for applying that material. If I had any complaints, it would be that I felt that the difficulty of the second two exams was perhaps a bit too high without any set curve. Furthermore, the lack of practice exams (or extra assigned problems) was frustrating when studying for the exams.",
                "I feel like this course is very very dull. It is very hard to concentrate and learn when there is so much material and it is quite difficult. The lecture style was okay but I often found myself getting lost in class then not being able to catch up to where Jack was in the lecture. The exams are also quite difficult and there is not curve, which I did not like.",
                "Strengths: I learned a lot from this class and have solidified my understanding of classical mechanics. My physics problem solving skills have significantly improved from working on weekly problem sets.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class takes a lot of work and time. The weekly problem sets are no easy task. Try not to overload your schedule if you choose to take PHYS 260.",
                "The material that the course covered was certainly interesting and I enjoyed the mathematical approach. However, this became tainted by the fact that the second midterm and final contained material of a difficulty so far removed from the lectures and p-sets that many within the class felt rendered the class unfair. The fact that the grading policy was repeatedly affirmed to mean there was no curve left myself, and many others, feeling dissatisfied.",
                "The course was every challenging and interesting. I cant think of any ways to improve it.",
                "Lectures are a definite strength. Professor Harris is a great lecturer, and you will learn a topic in a completely new light from what is in the textbook (which itself is a great textbook). It can be hard to keep up during lectures, as the pace is fast, but psets and exams usually only involve the major results from each lecture, not the mathematical details. Psets are also amazingyou will stay up very late on Tuesday nights to solve the hardest problems, but every problem is interesting. The only weakness is that Professor Harris has not taught the class many times before, so errors in his slides (and even sometimes on psets) are not infrequent."

                "I would recommend this course, but only if the student in question has enough time to dedicate to understanding the concepts at a deeper level. Due to time constraints imposed by my other classes this semester, it was difficult to spend enough time on physics to build the intuition the course demands - it can be very easy to get left behind without the requisite preparation.",
                "For those with a proper level of preparation, 100%. I admittedly rushed into this course against my better judgment (especially since I was in the midst of a number of personal issues) and ended up paying the price for my GPA. However, Professor Harris is perhaps the best lecturer I have ever had, and the lessons I learned through the course have ended up making me a better physicist.",
                "Yes, but only if they have a strong mathematical background. I would recommend Physics 200 for most physics majors. For a lot of people with a much more math-oriented background with knowledge of physics, it might be worth looking into skipping this class to take Physics 410 straight out, as a lot of the content is similar to Physics C/physics olympiad stuff.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to people who are previously not as familiar with vector calculus and want to explore a more math-heavy version of classical mechanics at their introduction level.",
                "Only if they have an interest in physics and math, have a sufficient background in both, and plan on using them in their major.",
                "I do not recommend this course. Save your time and effort and take either 180 or 200, especially if you are an engineering or non-physics major. 260 was simply challenging for no real reason. I think the exams were also not very fair and I did not like the style of teaching that professor Harris used.",
                "This is a very difficult class. I would only recommend it to the most prepared physics students. Otherwise, do not take this class. Take 200 if youre on the fence. 260 is very interesting but also incredibly hard if you went to a normal high school and took AP Physics C. The students in this class who did well were generally students from schools where AP physics went far beyond the official AP curriculum.",
                "This class is meant for prospective physics majors with proficiency in AP Physics C material. Learning all the material in PHYS 260 is rewarding, but you need to make sure you do not fall behind on class lectures and readings. The class is cumulative and moves very fast.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would also urge them to consider dropping down to 200 before the first midterm. The class is really really difficult, although it is very interesting.",
                "If you are so well prepared that 200 would be a chore, consider taking 260. Otherwise, it isn't worth the years it will take off your life.",
                "I would struggle to recommend this course seriously to another student. In all honesty, the second midterm and final did not at all reflect how much I learnt in this class, nor how much I had progressed since the start of the semester. Hence, I felt in a constant conflict with the grading policy.",
                "Probably not, the structure of the course makes it feel as if it is geared towards people who already have a strong background in Physics making it difficult to recommend it to a wide range of my peers.",
                "Yes! This was my favorite class during my first semester, and I don't even love physics (and am not a prospective physics major). Taking this class will give you a very deep understanding of classical mechanics, and a few topics (special relativity and especially the last section on determinism if Professor Harris chooses to teach that again, which I hope he does) may change the way you view the world more than any humanities class you take. As all the reviews will tell you, the workload is pretty intense, and the hardest problem sets can take many hours to finish. From what I've heard, many consider 260 to be the most difficult class in the Yale physics department. If you're taking 5+ classes, or you don't feel super confident in your math ability, you should definitely take 200 (from what I've heard, the two classes are both good and teach very similar topics). However, if you are willing to put in the time for a challenging class, you will not regret taking 260. Also, lots of people switch to 200 after a few weeks, so there's no harm in at least trying out 260."
