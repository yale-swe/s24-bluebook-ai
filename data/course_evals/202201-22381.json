                "I learned more grammar especially concerning verb tenses, how to pronounce certain sounds, more vocabulary, and how to form sentences that were more complex.",

                "The course is super relaxed and the assignments are genuinely so fun. All of my friends are jealous of our fun assignments and wish they took Portuguese! The strengths are the amazing professors, incredible course material, and relaxed vibe of the class. I looked forward to it every day and made me excited to keep learning the language. There truly are no weaknesses.",
                "For the most part, I thought the course was well organized. However, the near-constant emphasis on group work sometimes came at the expense of immersion in the language, since students would generally speak with one another in English. I appreciated the opportunity to interact with Lusophone cultural materials, though I sometimes wished for more rigorous/formal discussions of the vocabulary and grammatical structures used in these materials.",
                "The strength of the course is the practical applications of language skills to real world situations and emphasis on cultural understanding. In the future I could use more work on grammar, but I understand this was not the focus of the course.",
                "Loved the projects and overall emphasis on collaboration, lots of assistance in pronunciation",
                "Strengths: It is engaging with all the videos and activities; asynchronous days allowed us to approach material more independently; the learning games we played were really fun",
                "I think it was taught very well, I enjoyed the small class size environment and working in groups.",
