                "This was a great class! I learned a lot about drawing techniques, how to look at an object, how to observe and draw shadows and different textures, and how to draw figures. I experimented with a lot of different techniques and learned to draw in charcoal and ink.",
                "This class teaches you not only how to draw realistically but also how to draw out concepts and ideas that do not yet have a visual form and being comfortable with exploring its visual form. This class also exposes you to many kinds of art-making materials and encourages you to explore them.",

I really liked that we got to explore a lot of mediums and a variety of drawing processes, including screen printing. Learning some more techniques of drawing could be cool.",
                "I think the strength of the class is it is accessible for artists of all levels. The flip side of this is that for someone with a strong art background it doesn't feel as a challenging/doesn't push you that hard. But I think there's a lot of value to reviewing the fundamentals with a class with diverse art backgrounds.",
                "More field trips",
                "This course has many strengths: we received great feedback, had the space to explore what we wanted to do, but also practiced different types of drawing techniques. I dont think this course has weaknesses.",
                "Only strengths! Take this class!",
                "A strength was the wonderful instructor! Carly was great and taught wonderfully. A weakness may be the fast pace of the class.",
                "Tons of practice in the class and through at-home assignments. Strengths are a lot of practicing through doing. Good resources in the class. Our prof bought us a lot of materials and also had live figures come in for figure drawing. Prof Sheehan was a great teacher and definitely one of the strengths of the class. She emphasizes creativity, exploration, and \"not being precious\" with materials. I think it was really valuable to learn that it's easy to want to think you \"messed up\" and want to start over, but part of the process is just continuing to work at the art and keep adding, even if you're uncomfortable.",
                "The final project was very individual, so you get out what you put in.",
                "With this course, you get to develop a daily drawing practice and also work in the studio. It's really cool seeing other students' works and progress, as well as your own. The assignments and exercises are diverse and give you a great opportunity to explore a different range of techniques, styles, subjects, and approaches to your art. The class is very accessible to both art majors and non-art majors.",
                "This course gives you the space to explore many ideas and ways of art-making but also has some structure. You are given an assignment or setup to draw in class, but you can choose to draw it in whatever method you feel comfortable trying out, and students are encouraged to think more about the process than train to become hyperrealistic human cameras.",
                "Weaknesses: I don't think the course was designed well to give students feedback on their work. Although the class is intended to facilitate self-exploration, there were times where feedback was lacking.",

                "Yes, its a great class for art and non-art majors. Definitely a good first step into art for those who arent sure if they want to add an art major.",
                "I would definitely recommend! For perspective art majors, it's a prereq and also very fun and you will review the basics in a helpful way. For others, it is definitely worth it. I think it's super valuable to branch out and you'll find it fulfilling. It's not too much work, but even more importantly you build your own body of creative work and the time you spend in class feels like a refreshing break from academics.",

If you think it'll be an easy 5th class on top of an already difficult, high workload schedule, you'll be in for a surprise. This class has a lot of homework, more than many problem set classes or essay classes. And you're expected to draw a lot outside of class. Definitely think of this class as a time-intensive class but one that's worthwhile if you put the time in. It's very much a \"get what you put in\" kind of class.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! This is a great class that allows you to explore your own drawing style and learn new techniques. For the most part, you get what you put in, and you can really improve artistically if you dedicate yourself to the class and put in the effort. I recommend it to anyone who wants to draw more and improve!",
                "Yes",
                "I'd recommend this course to another student looking to learn how to draw or who likes to draw. It is a fair bit of work, so if you're not interested in the course material it can feel strenuous.",
                "Yeah, you do have to do a lot of work (weekly assignments) but you learn so so much",
