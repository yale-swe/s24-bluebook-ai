                "The course was well-organized and I appreciated how a schedule of assignments was given at the beginning of the year. It was a lot of work, however, so it wasnt very easy to get ahead. But knowing the schedule ahead of time was helpful in planning for test studying etc. there were some assignments that were really hard such as listening to a video and answering a timed quiz about it. These were really hard when the person spoke quickly because unless you are able to understand spoken Mandarin easily you have to go back many times to make sure you understand the material. It would be better to make the quiz not timed because this was really scary and the time added a lot of pressure to fully understand the first time."

For example, during one week, we watched a Chinese movie for 2 days and during another day, we went to the Hong Kong Market on Whitney to buy Chinese-style snacks. The class had a lot of fun activities that made my experience with CHNS 130 very enjoyable.",
                "L3 is a great way to fast-track your grammar and speaking skills as well as your ability to read longer, more complex passages in Chinese. We also learn about modern Chinese culture and the differences between the American and Chinese education systems.",
                "Yes, as long as you are prepared for the high workload, you really learn a lot of Chinese",
                "I would recommend this course. I really enjoyed the classes, and I definitely learned a lot.",
                "if the Chinese department reduces the number of students it has per class, then yes. Overall, it is a great course.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone I retested in learning mandarin and willing to put in a lot of work. The curriculum moved quickly and it required a lot of practice to keep up. The teachers were very encouraging and understanding, which made the work worth it. The class was a lot of fun, especially the final project!"
