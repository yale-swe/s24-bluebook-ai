There was a lot of reading / watching documentaries and other items on the internet.   I learned a lot about how much is offered on the internet.\r\n3.  There was much information on the problems facing social media platforms and how the government may try to help address those problems.  Very interesting.\r\nOnly weakness I can think of were some of the students - - some were not prepared or not listening or simply unwilling to volunteer.  There were several who were prepared, did volunteer and were quite impressive."
