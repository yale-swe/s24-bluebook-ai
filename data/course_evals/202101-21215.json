                "This was an amazing course. No particular things to improve on.",
                "Because of the small class size, going to class felt much more personal. Feedback on drafts and essays is very clear, and the setup of one week for a draft, one week to edit was helpful. The readings are diverse and very interesting.",
                "Strengths: The readings were superb, and the workshops for essays helped my revision process. In addition, the small seminar-style was very beneficial for discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think we could have more time to work on each draft; sometimes, we only had a week or a little more to submit a first draft.",
                "I like how the course was structured, but I think that sometimes the amount of reading that we had was a bit excessive. We didn't always get to everything that we read and it was generally overwhelming to try to use a lot of techniques that we discussed in class in our writing. I like the discussion aspect of it though because the readings that were confusing became understood by the end of class and you were able to get live feedback on your writing during workshops. \r\nAnother critique that I have is that it seemed like we had all the time in the world to write the first two essays then all of the sudden the deadlines for first and final drafts of the last two essays seemed back to back. That doesn't even take into account the usual 5th essay that was made optional due to Covid. I think that the essays should be spaced out better to avoid this claustrophobic feeling that encourages rushed essays.",
                "The course was well-organized, and the readings were generally really interesting! The only weakness I can think of is that the amount of time we had for essays varied  particularly toward the end, some of the essays felt rushed."

                "Yes! Ms. Jones is so passionate about readings and her students' writing. You'll learn how to develop your voice as a writer and analyze pieces of writing (and sentences!) more closely. Workshops are helpful in getting ideas from other students on what to add or change in a paper. You'll also learn more about yourself as a person.",
                "Yes, definitely. You not only improve your own writing, but learn about different techniques and styles from many notable authors. It also gives you lots of freedom in choosing what topic to write about, even though there are around 4 or 5 \"units\"",
                "The course itself was fine. It wasn't necessarily my favorite topic, but as far as writing goes, it allowed for a lot of creativity. It also allowed for a lot of individual attention to your writing which was helpful. I would say take the course if you like narrative writing, but try to find another writing credit if you don't.",
