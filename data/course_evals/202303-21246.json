                "strengths: interesting texts, many classics by great authors \r\nweaknesses: class discussions were quite unstructured and not really rooted in text; conversation did not really build on itself nor were people's thoughts challenged/questioned; felt like everyone was just adding their own two cents on any topic of their choice",
                "The course has an excellent reading list, and the discussions are always fascinating. Prof. Berger has good insight to share on each text  but also gives the proper amount of space for students to work through their own ideas. The essay assignments are manageable, and Prof. Berger is an extremely thoughtful reader. The main thing I could see being improved is that theres little to no wrap-up at the end of the course.",
                "The class was unique and the syllabus was awesome. Furthermore, the professor was great! We explored each text in depth, and I think I learned a lot every class. I do think a little more cohesion would've been appreciated. That is, I would've liked if we had really highlighted the inter-textual trends/themes that we discussed. Certainly, the texts seemed all to be mutually relevant, and I think this could've been emphasized a little more. Thus, we might've really arrived at ways of reading other \"literatures of the plague\"those not on the syllabus."

                "Absolutely! This class will revolutionize how you think about plagues (its not just the Black Death!). The reading list is truly phenomenal and you will walk away with at least one of them changing your life.",
                "yes, if you are interested in the readings. there are many great texts covered in this course. that said, take this course for the texts, not the class discussion. i felt the class discussion was quite flat and not really rooted in text. often felt like we were discussing plot points, not really building an analysis and definitely not challenging others' opinions in the class.",
                "Yes! Prof. Berger is a man well worth knowing  kind and engaging. Obviously its a very relevant topic for our time, and so many of the books are must-reads. It covers ground from the Bible and Illiad through a Phillip Roth book published 2011. Could swap out DS literature for this class and everyone would be the better for it. Basically: if youre at all interested in literature, this is a great class. If you are only interested in plague, the books and discussions will still be worthwhile but you might find that they are a bit too literary.",
                "Yes! You'll learn a lot, and you'll really improve your writing via detailed (yet fair) feedback. The syllabus is great and the discussions are interesting."
