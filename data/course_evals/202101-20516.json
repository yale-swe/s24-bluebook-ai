I also improved my (hand)writing skills considerably and I am very happy with where I ended up -- at the beginning of the year I did not even know the Devanagari script.

                "This course's strength is definitely the instructors. Swapnaji was an absolutely wonderful and very engaging instructor. Additionally, all the material was very interesting, apart from just learning Hindi vocabulary and grammar. A weakness might be that sometimes some assignments were layered on top of one another and I had a large amount of work for the class -- but that only happened a few times.",
                "The course at some points during the midterm felt like way too much work for just 1 credit but the language you learn is fruitful. And of course accommodations were made if needed.",
                "Fantastic Professor and Conversation Teacher. Really enjoyed reading stories. Leave with a good foundation in Hindi language skills.",
                "Strengths - was one of my fun classes this semester! The class was very close to each other despite the virtual format. The teachers are also very understanding and welcoming.\r\nWeaknesses - the course can be kind of disorganized sometimes, but much improved since L3",
                "There are so many strengths! Swapna Ji is absolutely great, and gives you lots of feedback and is happy to meet with you if you need help with something. The classes feel like you're chatting with family friends, and there is absolutely no judgement or social pressure, so you can be completely focused on just improving your Hindi. I would say that the only weakness is the way we learned the many different forms of grammar - it would have been great if we could have had a compilation of the different forms of vocabulary labelled, so that we could differentiate between them more easily and study them better. As it was, I had difficulty recognizing the different tenses by name.",
                "Having a separate meeting time for a consistent conversation section was actually really helpful in improving my ability in speaking. There were a lot of concepts taught, and while there were also a lot of examples verbally given, it would've been helpful to write on a whiteboard simultaneously to show what all is being verbally discussed. This might just been a Zoom-related situation. A quick review of English grammar preceding discussion on certain Hindi concepts would also be helpful as in my English-learning experience, I was never formally taught sentence structures such as subjunctive/causative verbs/etc.."
