   "comments": [
    "I developed my drawing skills. Specifically, I improved in my ability to depict the human form.",
    "This class was one of the highlights of my semester. Ive definitely gained more accuracy and precision in the way I draw, and Ive learned so many new techniques that I would never have considered trying on my own. Im also a lot faster at capturing an image on a page  the quick 30-second poses we practiced drawing were really helpful. Mark really pushed us to excel, and I think it definitely shows in the way all of our drawings have improved this semester.",
    "I began a much better figure drawer.",
    "I learned how to better look at the world from an artistic lens while drawing, and how to draw by building something from the inside out. I improved my charcoal skills in addition to my overall drawing capability",
    "Proportions, how to draw figures with movement (as opposed to stiff), how to draw quickly and confidently, how to use charcoal and ink. Greater understanding of anatomy\/musculature. Developed personal style. Researched and emulated notable artists.",
    "This course drastically improved my drawing ability, especially my ability to draw the human form.",
    "My figure drawings improved vastly. Mark is  great teacher.",
    "I learned a lot about figure drawing as well as drawing in general from this course.",
    "I honed some of my technical drawing skills. There were many opportunities to sketch bodies, as lots of models came in over the course of the semester."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: We were given the freedom to develop our own techniques as artists, and I really appreciated that. I thought that the assignments were fun and helped me develop. And in addition to drawing in the classroom, I liked all of the things we were able to do outside of it (visiting the Peabody and the YUAG for class). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There wasn't much formal instruction, which I didn't actually mind, but there were some things that I lacked a foundation in, and I think my education would have gone faster with a bit more of a formal introduction. (That being said, this isn't an introductory class, so that may not be necessary).",
    "I thought the course had really strong resources. Mark spared no expense buying us interesting papers, pencils, inks, and other materials. We also had a huge variety of models over time, which gave us practice drawing many different human forms. The setting of the course in the second-floor studio of the Sculpture Building was a really important strength  I loved having our own space, where we could go after class to do assignments. \r\nOne weakness is that the course was heavily front-loaded. Our homework assignment for Week 1 was to draw 26 larger-than-life-size pictures of hands, and our homework for Week 2 was 26 feet. But then over the course of the semester, the homework assignments became far less frequent and less demanding. I think the course may have been stronger if wed had a more consistent workload outside of class.",
    "The instructing was very good, and I was forced to push myself in class. I felt that towards the end of the semester homework was much more rare, and I would have appreciated a few more assignments.",
    "Considering that the class size is restricted and we inevitably had to purchases some materials, charging a $75 fee seems excessive, unnecessary, and ultimately a large reason I believe deters many individuals from taking classes in the school of art.",
    "Strengths: this was my favorite class!!!! I just really enjoyed the way it was taught - emphasis on practice and performance and improvement. Study of anatomy was extremely helpful and interesting. Professor pushed students to develop their own style and to do things out of the box\/their comfort zone. Homework was a lot at the beginning but useful and necessary - it was good practice.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes hard to gauge how you were doing in the class. Professor did not provide feedback equally to all members of the class. Might have been nice to have a midterm review of progress in the class so we could know where we stood and what we could do better.",
    "This course had an extremely inconsistent workload. It was impossible to predict what the workload might be for the week, as assignments did not follow the (extremely sparse) syllabus, so it was incredibly difficult to schedule so as to allot the appropriate amount of extra-curricular time to the course from week to week.\r\nThe length of the course was also very arduous, especially directly following lunch.\r\n\r\nThat said, the course was all practical application, which made for maximum growth and improvement.",
    "sometimes it gets a bit tedious to draw the same thing over and over. maybe the course could be a little more theory-based.",
    "I thought this was a strong course.",
    "It was wonderful that we had so much time to sketch bodies in varying time limitations. I was definitely challenged, and Mark gave me some valuable feedback.  I do wish our classes were a bit more structured and involved more workshops that delved into a single skill."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in drawing\/art! Even if you're not an art major, you will enjoy the class and learn a lot.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! If you're considering this course, then you probably already know it's right for you. When else in your life are you going to have the chance to practice sketching the human form? This isn't the kind of thing you're allowed to do at naked parties. Seriously - your precision, technique, and style will all be so much stronger after you've taken this class. I can't recommend it highly enough.",
    "I learned a lot but never wanted to go to class. Mark is intimidating and the class can be discouraging at times. Not super fun but certainly rewarding. Also, there's a lot of work at the beginning of the semester and then barely any towards the end, so don't be freaked out by the amount of work he gives during shopping period.",
    "If you want to become a better artist take it.",
    "Absolutely! The class was an amazing opportunity to study the naked figure and I saw my drawing abilities tremendously improve over the duration of the semester.",
    "Absolutely yes!! This is an amazing art class to take and will push you out of your comfort zone. It is difficult on another level - not in that you have to read a lot and argue\/do intellectual discussions, but in a personal way. This class challenges you to try new things and new techniques and to ultimately improve. Stepping out of the comfort zone may apply to your personality as well as personal style. Incredible, incredible course!",
    "Yes. Mark is a great teacher and the class is a great experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who was serious about wanting to improve their drawing abilities. It is a course that takes a lot of time and dedication, but you will get so much out of it if you put the appropriate time and energy in.",
    "definitely improves your drawing a lot. totally recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course, but be prepared to accept and learn from criticism. Start out Credit-D if you can since you'll draw better if you're not stressed about grading."
