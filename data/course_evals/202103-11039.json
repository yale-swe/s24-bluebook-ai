                "Tying together and expanding on grammar and language skills from earlier courses",
                "My oral and written ability in French increased. I developed a more nuanced understanding of French grammar, and speaking in class helped me feel more comfortable speaking in French.",
                "We reviewed a lot of French grammar, including tenses (present, pass compos, imparfait, futur simple, plus-que-parfait, conditionnel, subjonctif, and a little pass simple), pronouns, articles, adverbs, etc. \r\nWe learned terms to improve our writing, such as words for transitions, causation, contrasts, emphasis, etc.\r\nWe learned vocabulary related to the books we read, including art, immigration, conformity, and memory.\r\nI also learned more about Francophone culture. In particular, I knew very little about Guadeloupe before we read a memoir by an author from Guadeloupe.",
                "My writing, reading, speaking and listening skills all improved quite dramatically; I can now access texts that I previously would have found too difficult or intimidating and write about complex topics. The class also taught me a lot of important grammar, which was very challenging and time-consuming to learn but really improved my confidence speaking and writing in French.",
                "Lots of grammatical concepts and about interesting texts.",
                "I greatly improved my oral and writing skills throughout this course. The vocabulary we learned forced me to think more deeply about what I was saying and specify my language as I'm writing. I also got a really good review on my grammar through the exams and exercises and really improved in sentence construction. I was exposed to new materials through the books we read and really enjoyed the autobiography by Maryse Condo."

                "Weakness - need more structured practice with the vocabulary during class time.\r\nStrength - helpful that we got to do multiple drafts of the Redactions.",
                "I think tying together the grammar, vocabulary and the readings is done very well. The curriculum is well-rounded in all aspects of language skills, and the books we read covered a wide breadth of topics. Sometimes the workload felt very unbalanced, as some days had a lot more work than others.",
                "Strengths: It was very helpful to know the homework schedule for each week from the beginning of the week. There was a fair amount of homework, but at least it was fairly consistent. I liked the books we read, especially \"Art\" and \"Rhinoceros\". I thought the mix of grammar and other content was good.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had been forced to speak at length more often, such as with short presentations or reading aloud. Also, I think it would have been nice to spend some time working on our accents. For how much time it took to watch the movies, I wish we'd spent more time discussing them.",
                "Strengths - a very engaging and dedicated professor; clear, well-structured assignments and overall course progression; really interesting texts that I found challenging without being overwhelming \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - it's hard to think of any! Madame Sherak is wonderful and I really enjoyed the class. It was quite difficult and time-consuming but overall very fair and rewarding",
                "The texts chosen were very good. Many opportunities to practice speaking. Sometimes it felt like we were going too quick.",
                "I'm sure it was just due to the limited time but I definitely felt as if we didn't discuss some of the chapters of texts enough or just on a more complex level. That made it a little difficult at times to understand the text as a whole. But I did like the discussions in general and hearing everyone's thoughts on the texts."

                "L5 French is not an easy course, i.e. heavy workload, but it builds nicely on the earlier courses in the French sequence, and the readings were very enjoyable, especially this year with the addition of \"Le coeur  rire et  pleurer.\" Your French will certainly improve!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students wishing to improve their speaking and writing skills in French.",
                "I would recommend this course. It solidified my grammar and improved my vocabulary, and my French speaking and especially writing is better than before I took it. There was maybe 30-45 minutes of homework for each of the three classes per week (except the weeks where we had to watch a full-length movie for one of the classes), but at least it was consistent and we knew the plan from the beginning of the week. I liked that the classes were about half grammar and half conversation, because the conversations could get a little mentally exhausting by the end.",
                "Yes! Madame Sherak is the best French teacher I've ever had. I hated French in high school, but I enjoyed her class so much that now I want to pursue the certificate. It's definitely not easy but as long as you're willing to put in the time, you should be fine - there was a learning curve for sure, but once I got used to the class it became less intimidating.",
                "Yes, your French improves a lot.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in French at a higher level. I think it sets the tone for any French class that would be taken after this. It's a class meant for those with a genuine interest so it's not to be taken lightly."
