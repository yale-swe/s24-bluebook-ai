                "I learned how to use R and all the statistical concepts I ever learned in 2 years of my undergrad in just 7 weeks.",
                "Accelerated Biostatistics was a significant disappointment. The primary concern was its poor organization. The structure of the syllabus and weekly assignments often felt haphazard and changed constantly, leading to a lack of flow in understanding the core concepts.\r\n\r\nEven more alarming was the excessive workload. The course content and assignments were disproportionately time-consuming. For perspective, the workload for this course occupied at least three times more time than Accelerated Epidemiology and Social and Behavioral Science combined. Many assignments such as the Class Activities\/Quizzes did not contribute to learning in any meaningful way. Such a workload not only dilutes the quality of learning but also places undue stress on students trying to balance other commitments, academic or otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis course's counterpart, Accelerated Epidemiology, was an excellent course taught by Dr. Mayur Desai. It consisted of a well-defined syllabus and expectations and four evenly spaced problem sets and a final exam. In the future, Accelerated Biostatistics could use this course as an example of how a course should be handled.",
                "Basis of various statistical methods",
                "Knowledge and application of statistics, the mathematical basis, limitations and uses in research. Also learnt a lot of R programming.",
                "Introduction to different types of data, graphical representation and interpretation, probability distributions, sampling and hypothesis testing",
                "I learned the fundamentals and foundational concepts of biostatistics through this course.",
                "BIS 515 was an outstanding course in terms of the skills and insights that I obtained, namely:\r\n1. in-depth understanding of the mathematics behind common statistical terms that are often misinterpreted. For example, sensitivity and specificity was wonderfully explained in terms of conditional probability.\r\n2. data handling using R including the ability to test models in regression.\r\n3. clinical concepts incorporated into statistics that helped me interpret and understand research papers,\r\n4. ability to carry out statistical analysis of research papers and also actively identify strengths and flaws in the same,\r\n5. statistical skills including but not limited to hypothesis testing, parametric methods, ANOVA, tests of significance, Regression\r\n6. mathematical skills that were necessary for the in-depth understanding of statistics, including basic functions and limits\r\n7. helped me immensely as a clinician since I felt I was able to interpret research findings, including reports on trials, seamlessly. This was a step towards practicing evidence-based medicine and will hopefully augment my ability to deliver the best level of care to my patients in the future.\r\n\r\nDr. Bartlett was absolutely wonderful as an educator and went out of his way to make sure that we all processed the material and were able to perform statistical analysis independently.",
                "hypothesis testing and doing some functions in R",
                "Learned about basic statistical analysis, types of variables, graphs, p-values.",
                "Understood the basics of biostatistics, concepts like confidence intervals and p-values. I also got a base understanding of how R works. Unfortunately, due to the pace of the course and the way it was taught I couldn't take away much else that would be useful for me in terms of practical application.",
                "I learned the basics of probability, introductory statistical methods, and entry-level techniques for performing data analysis in R. I learned how to interpret and critique simple data, charts, and graphs. The course used medical \/ biostatistical datasets, but the learnings were fairly generalizable."

                "I worked on this course from morning till evening (not an exaggeration) for the entire summer term with basically no time left to work on the other 2 courses. My focus was not on learning as much as trying to hand in the copious amounts of assignments in time. In the beginning I was very excited to learn about R, but this course went so fast and the content was so much that I was pretty much lost after week 2. After that it was just sink or swim. The number of assignments was my second struggle, if you were working on one you knew you were already behind on the next which was due shortly after. Towards the end of the course, the amount of R work became less, but the instructor compensated for this with more non-R assignments.",
                "Throughout my time in the Accelerated Biostatistics, I had to employ alternatives strategies, given the course's inherent challenges. Online resources were invaluable in my understanding.",
                "Homework, discussions with peers and reading the textbook helped the most.",
                "This is is a 7-week intensive course, but the compressed timeframe does not excuse bad teaching. This course has been taught in 7 weeks for several years, and those former professors somehow managed to prepare students adequately. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I (and many fellow students) were reduced to Khan Academy and religiously reading the textbook. The lesson plans were worthless. The ad-hoc recorded in 1 take the night before videos, were actually detrimental to my mastering the important concepts. If you have the misfortune of Yale School of Public Health deciding \"ah well maybe it was a fluke!\" and are being taught by Andrew next summer, here's what you should do if your goal is to master biostatistics (and not just pass):\r\n\r\n- Khan Academy Statistics (which is ridiculous considering we're paying Yale to pay world-class professors to teach us)\r\n- Prepare to spend LOTS of time close reading the textbook and doing the questions at the end of each chapter until you understand\r\n- Keep a list of useful R commands (in Evernote\/Google Doc or something else) that Andrew covers in class with notes explaining what they do in your words. He will never come back to that command later. God forbid you need to rely in ? prop.table() for R's explanation. \r\n- I would say office hours, but only if you get one of the TA's who could actually break down the material for you.",

                "Read the book.",
                "I feel the following helped my learning in the course:\r\n\r\n1. attending class and filling up Dr. Bartlett's class notes. Also actively engaging and following the class helped tremendously.\r\n2. completing lab assignments for R \r\n3. completing problem sets for R\r\n4. attending office hours when stuck at any problem with the assignments\r\n5. skimming through previous day's class notes before class.",
                "Reading the book, google search and asking my classmates to clarify some concepts",
                "Reading the book was very useful to understand the concepts we covered, but unfortunately there wasn't always enough time to do that because of the assignments. \r\nI enjoyed working with R and thought some of the lab assignments were useful to practice. However, I think they could have been shorter since they felt very repetitive.\r\nGoing to the office hours was extremely useful for solving the lab assignments and problem sets.",
                "1. Asking peers who had previous experience with the subject for help in explaining concepts in more detail.\r\n2. Using YouTube resources like Khan Academy and other channels was extremely useful. They explained the concepts very simply and kept in mind that people listening to it could be ranging from no exposure to the subject to significant exposure to it.",
                "(1) I followed along and filled out the lecture notes we were provided in class.\r\n(2) I reviewed the R notebooks when they were fully filled out by the instructor.\r\n(3) I regularly consulted the textbook when things were unclear from the lecture notes.\r\n(4) When all else failed, I did a whole lot of googling."
