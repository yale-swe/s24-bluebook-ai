The pace of the class is very slow, but not too slow that students would lose focus. I looked forward to class every morning, and that is super important because the class met every weekday. The only weaknesses of the course were too much time spent on Da Minha Janela and not quick enough grading.",
                "I appreciated the course's focus on speaking and learning in a manner that deemphasized tests in favor of cultural competency. The opportunity to work with students in other levels was great, as well the experiential learning opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe only weaknesses were that the asynchronous class days typically felt like more work than the regular days, and often took more than 50 minutes to complete the assignments. I also felt that more emphasis on grammar instruction in class would be helpful.",
                "The interactive and realistic learning topics were great. As a spanish speaker, the course was awesome. If I didn't understand Spanish already though, I would have been lost when hearing instructions and assignments. They should be repeated in English.",
                "The focus on involving the students orally instead on simply focusing on grammar etc was great and I believe beneficial to our learning.",
                "This course could have focused more on grammar and reading, but as an introductory course it did just fine."

Everyone I know in other elementary language classes is struggling and not enjoying their experience. Everyone I know in Portuguese absolutely loves it, adores their professors, and has a very low workload. The exams are super relaxed and reflect the material learned. The assignments are very quick and easy. The projects are super fun and interactive. Once again, I cannot recommend it enough: TAKE PORTUGUESE!",
