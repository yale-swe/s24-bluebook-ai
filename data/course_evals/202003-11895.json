I wish there was more office hours during the semester and not just the week leading up to the exam. I had to study on my own fro 2-3 hours a day just to catch up because the lectures were so poorly conducted. The only time I learned was with my TA during discussion section (the TAs were amazing!!!).",
                "Strengths: good TAs\r\nWeaknesses: bad professor, TERRIBLE adjustment to online learning (especially in terms of testing)",
                "live lectures are terrible. only take this class if u need it for a major. one of the worst classes i've taken at yale, typical weed-out class. exams are so hard, class average was like a 60% on each midterm exam...",
                "This course could definitely be improved by listening to students more. I think a Piazza page is so important for ALL STEM courses and I really could have used that resource to help. I hope that the chemistry department will abandon Sapling. We should not have to pay so much for this course: textbook, answer guide, and sapling. It creates a really exclusionary environment for low-income students.",
                "Weakness- The online lectures were a waste of time. Dr. Jorgensen just read from prewritten notes. I did not learn anything from the course instructor. I was taught via the textbook and the preceptor Aaron Clark. The exams (which were written by Dr. Clark) were a bit unfair and did not accurately test the material that was taught. The final exam, however, was a bit more fair than the 2 midterm exams. \r\n\r\nStrength- Sapling was a great tool to do practice problems as I read the textbook. Aaron Clark is a very friendly guy who obviously cares about student success--he does however need a bit more experience on writing exams.",
                "Strengths: I think the rigor of this class is a plus. I know a lot of people complain about this class, but I have found it incredibly rewarding. The content is far more interesting than anything learned in general chemistry. Further, I felt as though adequate emphasis was placed on reinforcing general chemistry skills at the beginning of the semester. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The lectures were a bit \"dry,\" but in all honesty, it's organic chemistry -- if you don't do the reading, the lectures will be boring and confusing. The solution: do the reading. \r\n\r\nI also felt as though the course was a bit \"unbalanced.\" Stereochemistry should have been on the first exam, and the second should have at least included dehydration reactions of alcohols. It was hard to cram for the final since a ton of information and new mechanisms were thrown at us in only 4 lectures.",
                "Strengths: helpful TA's, notes given out in advance, summaries of reactions \r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Jorgensen is not a very engaging professor and makes the material harder to understand and synthesize. At the end of the semester, I stopped going to lectures virtually because I would end up more confused than if I solely learned from the book. Therefore, I most taught myself throughout the entire course with the exception of the discussion section where my TA was FAR more helpful. Also, many times I would be confused as to what was important\/would be tested on exams and what was just additional information provided by the Professor. The course director was often unclear of what mechanisms we needed to know\/didn't need to know, so I often relied on peers who crowd-sourced information on what was neccesary. Clearer messaging and expectations could help remedy this. Also, I have would appreciate slightly more practice materials than one past test and a short review powerpoint. I often found that what I was tested on and what I learned in lecture, section, and the book didn't really align.",
                "TFs are very dedicated to helping students",
                "There are many ways that this course can be improved. Firstly, the keys for all of the midterms we take in the class should be posted on Canvas. I would get answers wrong and even though I went to my discussion section to understand, I lacked a clear rubric outlining the steps of each question. Section is also only 50 minutes, which does not give enough time to properly review each question. The lack of these rubrics\/keys had a significant negative impact on my learning. Secondly, there is only so much professors can do given the circumstances--I also understand that each professor has their own preferences. At the same time, I feel that there were many opportunities where there could be more student participation during the lectures. Students could only ask question by running them by the instructor. I've taken other STEM classes at Yale and the lecture style was more engaging.\r\n\r\nI appreciated how the professor posted the lecture notes on canvas before each class. I also enjoyed how he would talk about his personal experiences with research during the lectures.\r\n\r\nThe peer tutors were my main source of learning\/understanding.",
                "This course is nationally known to be a hard class. Students everywhere struggle with it. This class was incredibly difficult. The weaknesses of it this semester were the style of teaching. While it was amazing getting to learn from a world renowned chemist, the teaching style was not productive for student learning. It was all monotonous and students were basically expected to learn on their own. The strengths were that if you put in the time outside of the class, you would probably do a good job and get a good grade.",
                "strengths: lectures followed book, sapling practice problems were helpful as well as discussion sections",
                "One strength of this course is that the material helps you on your way as a pre-med or your major. Something I think is definitely a weakness is that the way this course is structured makes it go incredibly fast and packs so much material (material that from what I've compared from study websites and other schools' websites is normally learned in orgo II) into very little time. I feel like I had to teach myself the material over the week kind of a surface level or just enough to finish the electronic psets, and then teach myself more in-depth when exams came around.",
                "Since this was an online course, this may be different in the future. That being said, I think a strength is that this course covers a lot of fundamental mechanisms and reactions in organic chemistry, which will probably serve as a foundation for anyone interested in chemistry or the sciences in general. A weakness is that one is often bombarded with information at times that it can be a bit overwhelming.",
                "Overall, I thought the course was well-organized given the online format, and the Sapling problem sets were manageable and helpful in understanding lecture concepts (lots of practice problems!). However, the actual lectures were quite dry. Sometimes Prof. Jorgensen would go through his notes very quickly and it would be hard to follow along.",
                "This course was one of the worst classes I have ever taken at Yale. It was a difficult class that was very poorly adapted for online learning. The tests and homework were entirely unrelated. This was a sentiment shared by many people in the class. This class needed weekly written\/drawing assignments. It was hard to measure how someone was doing in the class based off of the sapling assignments.",
                "The grade for this course was determined by 2 midterms, one final exam, and homework. It could be improved by having more assessments.",
                "Strengths: strong teaching team (prof, Dr. Clark, TFs, peer tutors), very organized -- Prof. Jorgensen's notes and lecture style was clear and to the point, easy to go to the textbook to refer back to content, HW wasn't too heavy but was good practice\r\n\r\nWeakness: orgo is tough in general (this class was taught really well though so helped alleviate some of that difficulty)",
                "The course was well planned. However, I could feel the lack of PowerPoint notes because the handwritten notes weren't as legible.",
                "The strengths of the course is that the material is very well organized and conducive to student learning, however I wish that the material had been taught using a whiteboard so we can see the logic behind the formation of each reaction mechanism, this small addition to the course I think would greatly increase my understanding of the subject matter.",
                "The strengths of this course was that there were multiple tutoring sessions but the weakness of the course was that some of the material was not tested on the exam.",
                "The strengths would the TA discussion sections and Sapling problems set as they gave a very comprehensive. The lectures were really not engaging. The content seemed very rushed and did not take the time to make sure students understood the content but rather on covering a lot of material at once.",
                "A strength was how well organized everything was and how easy it was to navigate the information. They turned what is said to be a very difficult and grueling course into one that I ended up enjoying a lot. Weakness might be that the discussion sections were not that useful.",
                "This course was vastly in-depth and provided a large quantity of knowledge regarding organic chemistry. With that being said, our lecture \"slides\" that were given to the class were pre-written and did not favor the style of learning organic chemistry in my opinion.",
                "-I had to do a lot of the learning by myself and with the help of the peer tutors",
                "The lecture was for me, not well suited for learning. I would have preferred if the professor had written his notes live (on an iPad etc) instead of reading through them. In addition, the testing format on Canvas was not ideal. Multiple choice is not the best way to assess understanding in organic chemistry, and I wished our exams could have been in a pdf format in which we would upload our hand written answers\/work onto gradescope.",
                "Ways to improve: different professor, more engagement virtually -- different logistical process.",
                "This course had the following weaknesses: exams were far more difficult than lectures and problem sets, it was never clear what we needed to know for exams, and it felt like the teaching staff were kind of expecting things to operate like we weren't online and facing the difficulties that introduced, but maybe that is just me. \r\nThe lectures were always very good and Dr. Jorgensen did a good job of explaining things, but there was a clear disconnect between lectures and exam content. Also, this seems to be a common problem in intro chemistry courses, the practice exams from previous years are all but useless. If they aren't covering similar content or in a similar structure, it might be best to not include them at all. It would be much better to have practice exams that mimicked the content and structure of the real exams so that students knew what to expect and what to prepare for. Maybe also a study guide of some sort to summarize each chapter and what was expected to be known. I understand that you can't give the exact questions from an exam, that would be ridiculous, but it would be far more beneficial if we could at least be prepared for exams. This is also an exam in which far more content than is humanly possible, if you are taking more than the 1 credit that this course is worth, is thrown at students very quickly. If you are going to keep the content of this course so expansive and in-depth, such changes as those above might seriously improve student performance and the value that they get out of the course, a win for us and you.",
                "Strength: TAs were really helpful and I though the book used really helped with understanding.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the way lectures were delivered were not really conducive to learning. I would have preferred slides that more clearly explained material. This is due to COVID, but the formatting of the tests did not reflect what parts of information we did know. Looking at past practice tests, orgs puts an emphasis on understanding parts of a mechanism and why they occur. Multiple choice doesn't really show that. Also, I found it hard trying to find practice problems that really reflected the information presented in the tests.",
                "The strengths of the course were Dr. Clark, the TAs, and all the peer tutors. I found the live lectures to be extremely unhelpful. All the information was just written on a sheet of paper, so you needed to pay careful attention to reading handwriting and interpreting what the notes said. The information was not very organized which made it very difficult to study for tests. I wish professor Jorgensen had made powerpoints or used a tablet to draw the molecules. As a very visual learner, it was extremely difficult to follow reactions without seeing the reaction drawn out or the flow of the electrons in the beginning of the semester.",
                "Strengths: discussion sections were good to supplement learning, recorded lectures so that I could go back and re-watch, peer tutors and review sessions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lectures were hard to follow, lack of engagement with professor",
                "The main weakness was that the course was poorly adapted (including grading) to deal with remote learning for a class filled with mostly sophomores in all possible time zones. Regarding actual course material, I did not have too many problems once I finally learned how I should be studying for this class.",
                "More drawing during lectures instead of slides",
                "The strength of the course was the peer tutors, because they took the time to explain things in a way that the course instructor did not know how to. The weakness of the class was the lectures, because these were taught in a way that did not take into consideration how students actually learn. The method of lectures with a sheet of all the information and no engagement or detailed explanations was very difficult to learn from. It felt like the instructor was not invested in the course and in bettering our experience in the class. Another weakness was the exams, because they were designed in a way that made it nearly impossible to get partial credit, which is usually very important in an organic chemistry class. More feedback should have been taken into consideration for the exams.",
                "The strengths of the course were the teaching assistants as they provided clear instruction in their recitation sections. There were many weaknesses to the course, including the professor, PSETs, exams, and methods of instruction. The lectures were mostly unhelpful and I ended up relying heavily on the book and PSETs for instruction. The PSETs took many hours to do and were graded harshly through Sapling, even if some of your answers were correct. The exams were unreasonable in length and had many trick questions.",
                "Grading was unnecessarily harsh and stressful, especially during a pandemic.",
                "This course was not very accommodating given the transition to the online format for one of the most notoriously difficult courses.",
                "Strengths: TF's were chiller and seemed to always have our best interests at heart, shoutout Alex. Probably the best part of this course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professors pretended like we were still in-person and structured the class as such. Professor was not only bad at teaching but the mode of delivery was absolutely terrible and I do mean bonkers. Every day he'd screen share a pdf of his notes and just scroll through the notes in a *minimized* window. No drawing or slides or anything and he had a tendency to ramble and speak in a monotone. Safe to say this is the least engaging, most boring, and most poorly organized class I have ever taken.\r\n\r\nExams were on canvas, but proctored in Zoom (?) which was always super, super sus. Unlike gen chem and the other orgo classes, there are only two midterms and neither of them get dropped. The lack of forgiveness in the grading and exam scheme is questionable on a normal basis, but given COVID and online schooling, it sent stress levels through the roof. This class is NOT optimized for your learning and you are really just thrown to the wind and expected to teach yourself everything. The exams are very difficult as well although the class is curved.\r\n\r\nPreceptor (Aaron) doesn't have a lot of empathy for students, although he is a better teacher, and neither does Jorgensen. If you want a course where your professors and teaching staff want to see you succeed and will help you do that, this is not that course. I learned absolutely nothing from class. Soul-sucking.",
                "The strengths were that Prof. Jorgensen is a very interesting professor with a good sense of humor but also a wide breadth of real-world experience that he was able to integrate into the lessons.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses, however, significantly offset this positive. The course was taught with Professor Jorgensen simply scrolling through a PDF with barely-legible handwriting and reading out what he thought was significant. This was despite him clearly telling us how normally, he would teach this course in such a way that he would write these notes for the students while lecturing, so the emphasis could be on hearing the concepts, connecting them to the drawings being made, and synthesizing that into your notes during lecture. Instead, lectures became a time to quickly write down everything one could read on the PDF even though everything wasn't specifically covered by Prof. J. Additionally, it became difficult to follow exactly how certain mechanisms took place because professor J did no drawing (despite having the clear option to simply use an iPad) and thus we were expected to know how to draw mechanisms and organic molecules without ever actually seeing them drawn.",
                "This course is a typical organic chemistry course; it is very difficult and challenging, but it is rewarding in the end. That being said, the level of engagement in this course was pretty low, possibly because it was virtual; however, I felt that the teaching staff didn't really care if you were involved in the class or not, and I'd like to see them change the format of the course to get every student more involved somehow.",
                "The sapling questions were helpful in terms of learning about the applications of organic chemistry, however, the test questions were rarely similar. The lectures were not helpful in clearing up discrepancies in the textbook or preparing us for the test. In addition, when questions were asked on lecture material in discussion section, our TA could not answer them for a large part. I think the class could improve by having the lectures and sapling resemble the test more and just promote cohesion overall. Also, more partial credit should have been awarded because having one multiple choice question worth 15 points was ridiculous.",
                "Strengths: This is a standard ochem course. Generally, the course is well organized and follows the textbook very closely. \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures are honestly very dry and sometimes difficult to follow. It is not enough to watch the lectures alone because information or key background information is oftentimes missing, which was frustrating. It's almost impossible to actually do well in this class if you don't read the textbook, which makes you question the usefulness of live lectures. Additionally, homework and practice tests wholly underprepare you for the actual in-class exams.",
                "It was difficult to learn online since a lot of organic chemistry includes drawing. The time difference also made tests difficult.",
                "Strengths: great TAs, good homework practice problems \r\nWeaknesses: exams were a lot tougher than the homework and practice",
                "Having it online was very challenging becaude interacting with peers when discussing questions wasn't possible",
                "The lectures were extremely hard to understand and to learn from, and I felt that I had to self-learn most of the material. Adding an enrichment section to this course where students could be introduced to the concepts in a different and slower way would help greatly.",
                "I feel like it was made as difficult as it could've been. The lectures were unintelligible at times, the notes were difficult to follow, and the exams asked cheap, trick questions sometimes. I feel like I was set up to fail, especially in a semester like this. If I was on campus, I might've been more inclined to just suck it up and study, do more outside of class, and just get better. But this environment made it impossible for me to do those things. Maybe if I had the resources that allowed me to just stay home all the time and study organic chemistry, then I would have felt better prepared and educated. But I didn't have those resources. The chemistry department probably thinks that's a personal problem I guess.",
                "The online platform was extremely detrimental to learning in this class. Life lectures consisted of reading through old notes.",
                "This course was entirely self-taught. The lecture period was not relevant to the materials on the exam, often disorganized and irrelevant. I did not learn from the lectures, but instead from the hours spent after class attempting to learn the information on my own.",
                "It depends on who is lecturing and coordinating the course. This will have a large effect on how you are able to learn in the actual lecture. This semester, learning in the lecture was nearly impossible so teaching yourself was the primary method of learning. A strength was that the course is typically given a pretty good curve. The grades ended up being fair as compared to the grading in other STEM lectures. Additionally, the course should have been split up into 3 midterms like Intro Chem and like other organic chemistry courses in the past instead of just two. As a result, the midterms were 4 chapters of material at a time and there was no 'drop' grade, which would have been nice. Although this is not necessary, I think other chemistry courses set us up to depend on the option of dropping an exam grade.",
                "Strengths-I was pushed to learn the concepts thoroughly\r\nWeaknesses-I wish the professor interacted more with the students.",
                "The course was taught by a well-known scientist in the field. The preceptor office hours were very helpful.",
                "The course could use more student engagement in the course material during class. However, the course still succeeds in teaching large swaths of material, especially in a virtual setting.",
                "This course has really great support systems  lots of TAs and peer tutors who are willing to help. However, the lectures themselves were not very helpful and difficult to understand.",
                "While I appreciated Dr. Clark's enthusiasm for teaching, it didn't really make up for Dr. Jorgenson's lack of it. Dr. Jorgenson was the course lecturer and I found his explanations to be mostly unhelpful to the point that by the end of the semester it became very difficult to watch the lectures as I already had to watch them asynchronously due to course conflict and I really felt like they weren't actually helping me. I always enjoyed attending Dr. Clark's section, but especially towards the end of the semester when Dr. Jorgenson began moving through material much more quickly and much less clearly, I started to feel lost in section because I hadn't actually absorbed all the content yet. Meanwhile earlier in the semester I found section really helpful, but because of Dr. Jorgenson's poor course planning, I couldn't get what I needed out of Dr. Clark's section at the end of the semester. Overall, I think I just wish things had moved a bit faster earlier in the course so there wasn't so much content crammed in at the last minute, which not everyone had the time to dedicate all their time to learning as we had other finals to worry about. I also wish we got more of Dr. Clark in lectures, as I found his explanations much more helpful than Dr. Jorgenson's.",
                "The class was not set up well for the semester during COVID. There were little flexibility and understanding of students' situations. It could be improved if professors listened to students' requests and situations, especially during this time.",
                "The strengths is that section had very interactive learning which was helpful. The weakness is that the lecture was literally so useless and taught me nothing. Professor Jorgenson literally just went on and on about his own research and bragging about how smart he is instead of actually teaching or ever engaging with the class. It could be improved by maybe having a professor that cares just a little bit about his students. Lecture was not engaging at all. Scrolling through a pdf and talking about what is on the pdf is not teaching, in any sense of the word.",
                "Office hours, peer tutoring, and recitations definitely helped me out the most to learn the material. Personally, this is the only reason that I did reasonably well in this class.\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, however, the lectures were WAY too fast. Our professor just breezed through many main topics, but then would make time for rather lengthy tangents\r\n\r\nThe final was incredibly stressful, but I must admit that I believe that the final actually helped me to really cement the material in my head.",
                "The strength of this course was the strong support system provided by the TAs. The weakness was how unfair the class was at times. Unlike previous orgo classes, we weren't allowed to drop any test or problem sets which ended up significantly hurting many people's grades.",
                "No suggestions.",
                "Online learning was a new experience and virtually learning about organic chemistry was not the best option. The course however was well organized",
                "This course had some great, dedicated TAs which worked to help their students throughout the course. Dr. Clark was also did a great job in organizing the class and being accessible to answer student questions. Over the virtual setting, the information in lecture was not transmitted as clearly as I would have hoped, but there's not much that could be done about that.",
                "Very tough online w\/ minimal contact with teaching staff",
                "There were many opportunities to see material and to improve. You see the material first when doing the textbook reading (if you do it), then in the lecture. You're then exposed again in section and then assessed in your homework. In this way, I liked how the course was structured.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of the course that I didn't like were the assessments. The average of the tests was around a 70, which wasn't so bad but it felt that they were designed to test students on less important topics in the material. For example, the first exam barely touched upon reactions, which was the bulk of emphasized in the weeks leading up to the test. Or in the second exam, there were three questions that revolved around Hoffman vs Sayzaff products, which felt unfair considering we didn't spend that much time in class on them.",
                "The weaknesses of this course were exacerbated by the online format. The lectures were not engaging in the slightest and just involved screen sharing an old PDF. Also, the Sapling homeworks had a huge number of bugs that made it way more annoying to do homework than it should've been; they were also graded for correction. The biggest strength of this course were the teaching fellows and peer tutors who basically reexplained lecture topics and answered questions in a much more understandable way. There were not enough time for tests and the test formats were incredibly inconvenient for students studying remotely.",
                "The lectures were long and not as interesting as they could have been, explanations of material was unengaging and long winded",
                "Strengths included the discussion sections, lectures, and saplings  all of which I found very helpful. I did not expect as much thermodynamics on the first midterm as there was it would have been helpful if this was emphasized a bit more. This is pretty specific, but some of the sapling questions don't accept the answer unless the molecule is drawn from a specific perspective  having already accounted for stereochemistry, the molecule additionally needs to be oriented in a specific way that was not indicated in the question. Making these more clear would be helpful.",
                "The strengths of this course were the discussion sections. A weakness of this course was that 90% of the material was based purely on exams, and I found that to be very stressful. Additionally, the virtual lectures did not contain real-time drawings or notes, which I found unhelpful.",
                "It helps to have a really engaged professor for this course. That didn't happen this semester. The TAs and Aaron (the teaching fellow person) were great though. That's where all the learning happened.",
                "Sapling is terrible. It does not correctly mark the right answers with stereochemistry.\r\n\r\nI found myself trying to teach the material to myself often. I felt that the lecture was not helpful and discussion section too infrequent. \r\n\r\nThe availability of the TAs was also not great. I understand they had to do so much this semester, and it is in no way their faults, but it was a harsh transition to go from my 60 person chem class last semester (in which I could and would meet with my section TA often) to a much bigger lecture during the pandemic.",
                "The weakness of the course is the style of teaching. It is quite boring, where the professor reads off his notes and barely answers any questions. It is not conducive to learning, and I know many people (including myself) who just taught themselves the material.",
                "I thought the course was poorly taught, so I ended up self-studying for this class by reading the textbook, watching youtube videos, and doing practice problems.",
                "The professor occasionally attempted to cover, in one lecture,  much more material than was truly digestible, leaving many students struggling to understand the mechanisms of complex reactions, constituting a major weakness. The exam questions were sometimes subtly worded to lead to different answers than the expected, resulting in confusion. The time limit for the two midterms was too strict, preventing students from performing as well as they could have and being able to demonstrate the true extent of their learning. \r\n\r\nA strength of this class was that study guides for some complex reactions were provided prior to exams, clarifying the mechanisms. Having many resources (Sapling, HW, practice exams, etc) was quite helpful for students looking to understand the material and gain experience through practice of problems.",
                "Organic chemistry is a difficult course for students and faculty in the best of times. I think a large part of the issue with the course as a whole is that I get the sense that no one really wants to be there, including both the teaching staff and the students. Any students with a genuine interest in organic chemistry would be in a more advanced class, and everyone else is just there to fulfill a prerequisite. On top of all that, most students go into organic chemistry amidst warnings of doom, so are already expecting the worst, giving the course no real incentive to improve. Perhaps the greatest tragedy is that whenever I actually engaged with the material (probably while studying for a test, certainly not in lecture), I found it quite interesting and wish I had more time to consider what I was reading. Organic Chemistry as a discipline is very interesting, and the mechanisms and how they were discovered is pretty cool, and that is the strength of the course. The weakness of the course is, well, the actual course itself, almost every aspect of which was poorly executed, dull, joyless, and tinged with \"this isn't all that important, but you have to know it for your next quiz\".",
                "The exams were given at one set time: 9 am EST. For people of different time zones this undoubtedly made the experience that much harder (for example Pacific Time Zone people.) Despite this, Jorgensen is a great professor and his passion for Chemistry shines through. He works to inject his research work into the class when possible to show the wide variety of work in the field.",
                "The weakness of the course is that the material is very dry and difficult, even if you go to many office hours. The strength is the TAs, the preceptor, and the tutors.",
                "One strength of this course is the use of discussion (or recitation) sections. Given that this course is a large lecture, I found it very helpful to meet with a smaller discussion group each week to actively discuss practice problems and review lecture material. These discussions heavily relied on breakout rooms, which enabled me to collaborate more effectively with peers. I personally recommend that breakout rooms be incorporated into the large lectures in the future, as this would help break up the monotony of having a single instructor talk and thus keep more students engaged. This monotony, in my opinion, was the greatest weakness of the course. I mean this in no offense to Professor Jorgensen, but by nature of organic chemistry, I often felt that viewing mechanism after mechanism on Jorgensens pre-written notes led students to become both disengaged and supersaturated with information. (This disengagement, I believe, is reflected by the poor attendance of many students during later lectures.) I recommend that this course incorporate something to break up the material by allowing breakout rooms or even granting time to self-solve practice problems as Jorgensen explains his notes, especially if this course remains virtual.",
                "Strength - Much content was online, but Yale is Yale and the exam was way harder than the practice exam given and it was harder than the content I learned online. \r\nWeakness - professor went off on tangents and I felt like material that could have been easily digestible was made harder to understand than necessary."

Since the material wasn't taught well in class we all had to self study and then when the exam came around it was really hard to engage. It just wasn't the appropriate learning or test-taking environment in my opinion.",
                "Recorded lectures and live sections were good \r\nThe testing was terrible though -- I haven't heard of any other online class having 2 midterms and a final (all closed note, on Zoom, timed at 1 hour each (2 for the final)) counting for your ENTIRE grade. All of our homework was only 10% of our entire grade, so it literally all depended on those tests. the tests were also all multiple choice style on Canvas, which means there was no partial credit, so I feel like my grade did not reflect the work I was putting in (at least 2-3 hours every day of the week) or my knowledge of the material at all. They also had no syllabus and came up with all of this stuff on the fly -- so stressful and time consuming",
                "lectures are not very engaging",
                "This course was so unaccommodating and run as if we weren't living through a pandemic. The professor and preceptor proctored our exams at 9 AM EST, meaning that folks on the west coast were forced to wake up at 5 AM to make it to their 6 AM exam. They also decided to remove one of our three exams, giving us only two options to decide our fate without the option to drop any exams and instead make the final worth 40% of our grade. There was no empathy from the professor and preceptor. Honestly, this course only exacerbated the stress of living through a global pandemic and I could have really used the support and instead found only anxiety.",
                "The lecture format was terrible. Dr. Jorgensen sounds better on 2x speed and he merely just reads from prewritten notes. The level of engagement at 9am was outstandingly low. Any other lecture formate would have been better than the methods used for the Fall 2020 semester.",
                "I don't think there's much room for improvement.",
                "I did not feel like the live lecture was engaging. It would have been more engaging if the professor had written out examples while lecturing instead of showing pre-written PDF pages.",
                "It was very helpful to have the lectures recorded and have important notes uploaded to the Files section. The lectures were not very engaging and often hard to follow due to the Professor and his hard-to-read notes.",
                "The keys for all of the midterms we take in the class should be posted on Canvas. I would get answers wrong and even though I went to my discussion section to understand, I lacked a clear rubric outlining the steps of each question. Section is also only 50 minutes, which does not give enough time to properly review each question. The lack of these rubrics\/keys had a significant negative impact on my learning. Secondly, there is only so much professors can do given the circumstances--I also understand that each professor has their own preferences. At the same time, I feel that there were many opportunities where there could be more student participation during the lectures. Students could only ask question by running them by the instructor. I've taken other STEM classes at Yale and the lecture style was more engaging.\r\n\r\nI appreciated how there were peer tutoring hours almost everyday and that the TFs also had lots of hours.",
                "A lot could be improved. The teaching style was not tailored to learning during the pandemic. Organic chemistry is not a regular math or chemistry class where you can just learn numbers. Its all about models and applying your knowledge. That is hard to do over a screen. If the professor had put in his own effort to get an iPad or use models or actually show us more practice problems in class rather than subjecting students to 1.5 hour long monotonous lectures, I believe the course would have worked out better. The teaching team did put in the time to provide office hours and TA sections. I do believe that was successful for those who utilized this resource.",
                "This course did negative amount of work to help us as students in a pandemic. The exams did not test us proportionally to what was covered in class and had multiple trick questions. There were sometimes two entire chapters chock full of difficult material stuffed into one week of class (two 1 hr, 15 min windows). The only virtual engagement there was were normal office hours, but no study halls. Students in different time zones either needed to wake up or stay up at odd hours of the night to take the exams since there was very little sympathy from Prof. Jorgensen and Dr. Clark for students going through a difficult time during the pandemic. Other students were also refused their requests to take the exam at another time that would have been more convenient for them in terms of time of day. (Several students had to take their exams around 6 am or later,  but far earlier than 9am, because of their time zone differences.) They also paid very little attention to exam formatting feedback, where we asked that the exams may be given in a written format and then uploaded to Canvas instead of having mostly multiple-choice tests. I know this isn't too much to ask for: the past exams we were given as practice for our own exams all contained questions where we could explain our work or draw it out instead. In short, our exams did not compare in difficulty, material, or format to past exams. \r\n\r\nI need to leave the TF's and PT's out of this because they were really great and helped the students who were struggling and set up great review sessions for us, but the instructor and head TA Dr. Clark were not helpful and did little to alleviate our concerns for our academic year in the context of the pandemic. And it isn't that there was nothing else they could do; professors in other hard science departments at Yale give it their all when it comes to supporting us as students and making sure our academic resource needs are met.",
                "Recorded lectures are always helpful, especially when one wants to come back and review material. I do think the exams could be improved upon, where more specifically, I felt that multiple choice exams are okay, but if they have a written portion, then that should be considered take-home to allow for completion and reduce the time-crunch and time-pressure when also trying to answer multiple choice.",
                "I understand that things are difficult with Zoom and this might not have been possible without a tablet, but it probably would have been helpful to see some mechanisms drawn out and go through them step by step.",

Technology could have been incorporated better in order to make learning online easier, for example the professor could have written out his notes through out the lecture using one note or some other app. Also since the class was only lectures it might have been helpful for the lectures to be pre-recorded and class time be left for reviewing and asking questions. I do not think this class translated well to an online format. The midterms and the final were especially hard to take online, since they were only multiple choice.",
                "Succeeded: I personally like the anonymity of asking questions during lecture. And although we have office hours normally in person, having them online makes them more accessible and its more easier to interact with other students. \r\n\r\nImproved: the way information was delivered could have been better. Having everything written on paper and not on slides in my opinion makes it more confusing. Too much happening on the screen.",
                "The frequent TA and peer tutor sections during this semester have been extremely useful. The formats of the tests themselves could be improved. For people who find multiple choice tests difficult, it was difficult to make so many transitions this semester. It would have been more helpful to have more written portions of the test or psets where we had more difficult practice as sapling was not fully reflective of the types of questions and concepts that we needed to study. I appreciated the live zoom during exams so that we could ask about any areas of confusion.",

                "Grading was a mess initially, but was fine by the end. Maybe clearer guidelines initially would have been better as I, like many of my peers, just like to know what's coming. Definitely would be beneficial to not be taking an exam at 6 am and having to wake up before that for students on the west coast, etc. I think some of these changes have already been incorporated in Orgo II's syllabus.",

                "Although the main change due to the pandemic was the method by which notes were presented, this method could not be described as \"geared toward learning during the COVID-19 pandemic; instead, it was geared towards minimizing the learning curve for the professor, independent of the negative effects of the methodology on the students' learning abilities. The one strength of the course was the way exams were administered, particularly the last exam (as the prior no-free response\/partial credit exam seemed to have some issues, but the professor\/preceptor course-corrected remarkably well after hearing student feedback). By keeping everyone on zoom with mics on and monitoring when students left the canvas page, I believe they were able to minimize academic dishonesty as much as is reasonably possible while also allowing for a testing environment that did not add significant stress over what an in-person exam would have produced.",
                "I didn't feel that there were any practices geared toward learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, other than lectures and sections being online. I think weekly study guides that go over what was covered that week would be very helpful.",
                "Online Canvas examination was stressful. Nevertheless, the combination of take-home free response and multiple choice quizzes worked.",
                "Having the majority of the test multiple choice without partial credit was incredibly unfair especially during a pandemic. There are other formats that other classes have adopted such as lab reports, weekly collaborative \/ noncollaborative problem sets, fill in the blank, true or false, matching, and other various modes of testing that are more conducive to an online environment.",
                "I genuinely think it is ridiculous to be having exams that only accommodate ET time zones during a pandemic. Taking midterms and finals at 4\/5am local times was honestly ridiculous. While I understand this was a challenging course, I think there are better ways to test student knowledge than traditional forms of testing.",
                "Selecting a more accommodating test time would benefit more students given that this is a sophomore class whose students were mostly remote.",
                "There were no practices geared toward the pandemic. They acted like nothing was different and did the most to make things more difficult for us. They consistently told us to \"deal with it\" when there were pandemic related issues.",
                "Again, live lectures going through old notes did not work in teaching organic chemistry. Possibly writing on a live chalk board, iPad, or notepad would be better.",
                "This course was completely disregarding of the pandemic in a multitude of ways. I had many professors who were more lenient with deadlines, who adjusted their syllabus to help mitigate the inequalities and inequities imposted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, this course did not make any adjustments at all; in past years, the professor has allowed for one exam drop, a total of three exams and a final. This course did the opposite -- gave two exams (no drops allowed) and one final. At least acknowledging the difficult times we are in, that all students cannot attend live lecture and not being passive about it, might be nice.",
                "The lecture approach given COVID-19 was the professor scrolling through a PDF of notes and explaining mechanisms and concepts. This was not effective at all. However, my section was engaging and we got some practice there.",
                "Recorded lectures were necessary for the course. The exams were timed, so if there were technical difficulties, that could be really stressful.",
                "The recorded lectures were good for revisions.",
                "The virtual setup of the class worked for teaching course material. The test format could be improved, although it did get much better as the semester went on.",
                "I think Sapling was honestly the most helpful tool the class had during the pandemic. I know it's not everyone's favorite, but especially towards the end when Dr. Jorgenson began cramming material too quickly for me to be able to keep up in lectures I found my primary method of learning to be doing the Saplings. I think if more time was put into fixing the \"bugs\" with Sapling (i.e. making sure all possible correct answers are accepted, making hints actually useful on all questions), it could be an INCREDIBLE tool for making the material digestible as an online course.",
                "The setup of section succeeded by the way lecture was organized could be improved. The professor had already written down all his notes and posted them for student download, but that resulted in I'm him going through the information way too quickly and did not allow time for students to draw out mechanisms for better understanding. Instead, they were already written down for us, which is not as helpful for comprehending and retaining the information. Furthermore, the professor was limited in answering questions or editing his notes. In fact, he had no way of drawing out examples during the live class to give students examples or answer questions.",
                "None succeeded. What could be improved would be if the instructor could try to be more open minded and learn new technology in order to teach, and if we were asked questions and engaged with the material. So the professor can expect me to dedicate 20 hours a week to his class, but can't spend 1 hour learning how to use a drawing pad\/ipad so that he can actively show us reactions? The apathy towards the students in this class, and the lack of any care as to whether we were engaged or not was astounding, and frankly, deeply disappointing.",
                "Office hours, peer tutoring, and recitations definitely helped me out the most to learn the material. Personally, this is the only reason that I did reasonably well in this class.",
                "A shift toward pre-recorded lectures would help for early classes.",
                "It was quite difficult writing Exams in organic chemistry virtually because we normally need pencil and paper to write the reactions",
                "While there was little engagement in the course, the experience was likely similar to taking this class in an in-person setting. Since this is a big lecture, the only substance to the class was listening to the professor talk through the projected notes. Dr. Jorgensen did stop to answer a few questions asked through the chat which did provide some engagement.",
                "The lectures weren't very engaging. Professor Jorgenson often mentioned that during normal times he would write out reactions as he talked. His COVID methodology of screen sharing a scanned note pad wasn't very engaging and often meant we flew through material. For example, in the last lecture, we covered the entirety of chapter 11, which was an absurd amount of material.",
                "It would be nice for the test formats to be less focused on just preventing cheating and for the convenience of graders, but to actually test students' understanding of organic chemistry by giving them ample time to think. For example, a lot of structures had to be copied to paper since the tests were all online, and I don't feel that the time given allowed for students to look at the screen and back at their papers to draw out the structuresa factor that in-person tests lack since students can mark directly on the test paper. Also, the constant issue with the Saplings were annoying. I liked how the lectures were recorded but the professors didn't seem to understand that students would also watch the recorded lectures and made negative comments about students not attending lecture despite students being in different time zones. The lectures also definitely could have been more engaging and informative. Either the (evidently) very old and yellowing PDF notes the lecturer used could have been improved or the lecturer could just use technology to draw out the concepts being explained clearer.",
                "Lectures could have been more direct and to the point, assessments were very challengin",
                "The discussion sections worked virtually. I actually found them more collaborative than in person discussion sections because we had to work with each other to answer questions. Annotate was also very useful. I also appreciated that lectures were recorded. I think the Canvas midterms and finals format worked, but that weekly or biweekly less high risk quizzes would work better at keeping us engaged.",
                "The live-lectures could certainly be improved.",
                "Office hours were a BIG requirement to do well. The lectures weren't all that helpful unless you already understood what was going on.",
                "More discussion section? Maybe a weekly review like the intro BIOL professors do?\r\n\r\nProblem sets that are written, not Sapling, so we get exposed to more realistic questions for the test.",
                "I don't think the virtuality of this course aided or hindered it at all.",
                "How the course was taught was really ineffective to learn organic chemistry. The professor basically had a pdf document pulled up (not even in full screen) and read off the pdf.",
                "Live lecture was a good move for this course.\r\n\r\nProfessor should change the lectures notes formateither use more color and clearer handwriting, or take notes live while lecturing. It was overwhelming seeing all these structures and mechanisms drawn out already at once, and many times you didnt have enough time to write down during lecture because he underestimated how much time it takes to write down each topic during lecture.",
                "The online components of this course were relatively successful in conveying information in lecture. As expected, some professors may have trouble adapting to technology, which was a slight hindrance in this course (opening windows, minimizing and maximizing screens for visibility of material being presented, Zoom audio, etc). It may be helpful to offer additional training oriented around technology for professors who may benefit\/want these.",
                "Of all of the courses I've taken since the beginning of the pandemic (or perhaps the beginning of my academic career), this may have been the worst pedagogical experience I've ever encountered. I don't expect a super high level of professionalism from these online courses, and I understand that the professors don't have much support in making them, but I do expect a little more than a poorly scanned assembly of hand written looseleaf that I suspect in normal times would be lecture notes for the benefit of the lecturer and not the students. I mean, at least make it full screen. I also resent the course's maximum security approach to online testing. Of course, academic honesty and cheating are serious business, but the automatic assumption that your students are scumbags by nature is more than a little off putting, and no other department feels the need to make their students jump through anywhere near as many hoops. All that aside, if the questions on the test are really so fragile that anyone with access to a book or a search engine would totally invalidate them, then why even bother? Surely any subject actually worth learning should be about understanding concepts and their applications, not memorizing the steps of one particular reaction. For example, the challenge in synthesizing one compound from another should be in framing the problem in terms of chemical concepts and processes, not seeing who can memorize what products permanganate forms at different temperatures. Again, this is just a thought, but any test that's incredibly sensitive to cheating  (i.e. memorization based) probably wasn't engaging much of the mental capacity of the students anyways. I'm here to learn chemistry, not mnemonics. Time to take a page out of the physics department's book here.",
                "The variety of sections and their times worked well to allow students of all regions to easily fit into a spot. The course was well organized and easily allowed people to catch up via the recorded lectures.",
                "The amount of office hours were extremely helpful.  \r\n\r\nThe live, synchronous midterms and finals at 9am EST really does not accommodate for students in other time zones. The teaching staff said that it's because a lot of the class is pre-med and that pre-meds need to be prepared to get up at early\/odd hours anyway, but it's not really fair for students in other time zones.",
                "Personally, I felt that this course had several problems within a virtual format. This was a large lecture, and very few (if any) students ever turned on their cameras. Watching one instructor talk for the entire lecture was often very disengaging. For this reason, I believe that breakout rooms should be incorporated into the live lectures more often in the future. \r\n\r\nThe greatest problem, however, was the poor translation of exams into a virtual format. Writing organic chemistry mechanisms is an artistic skill that cannot be truly showcased in a multiple choice format. Personally, I believe that the best test format was the second midterm, which combined a multiple choice\/fill-in-the-blank timed section with a take-home written section that students later scanned in. However, this formatting would have been even stronger if students were allowed to submit a pdf of their work on the timed section as well, as I believe that having the chance to show ones work could have enabled students to gain partial credit.",
                "Improvement - Discussion Section!!!! Make TA's go through topics as if teaching kindergarteners. More students would get more out of discussion section if it wasn't meant for people who already knew the material. Instead of having students individually go through practice problems, teach them how to do an example yourself and then allow space to do a different problem. Give practice problems. Have a bank of practice problems that were not on an online format. I was doing problems that I did not know were too easy for the course, so I was struggling when it came to the final exam because all the hours I studied were based on practice problems given to me, but also from the textbook that were easier than the exam was. Be straightforward about what's being on the exam."

                "Only if they need it as a requirement.",
                "Most just have to take it",
                "If you have to take this course for pre-med or major requirements and they haven't improved it from when I took it, I am sorry. It will probably be tough unless you have had some experience in organic or AP chemistry. If you come from a school where the chemistry courses were pretty much a joke, like I did, it will be extraordinarily rough for you and I would strongly recommend that you study some organic chemistry on your own before taking this course or at least reduce your credit load.",
                "You definitely learn a lot about organic chemistry, but it is not the most well run course.",
                "No.",
                "Besides premeds and chem majors, I think this course gave a good understanding of the different reactions that set up higher levels of chem so if that is an interest then take it.",
                "No.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student only if you're willing to put in a lot of work by yourself. I found myself spending hours on you tube each week to reteach concepts that weren't presented clearly.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless it is a pre-requisite, due to the intense nature of the course.",
                "No, not unless it is required",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. The content is interesting, but the current teaching staff are not prepared to teach this course well.",
                "I would absolutely not recommend this course to ANYONE. Even if you have to take it as a major requirement or because of premed, maybe try to take First-year orgo instead (if that is a possibility for you) or take this class in spring when it is taught by a different professor. I would avoid this class at all costs. It is poorly structured, poorly taught, and the preceptor and professor don't care about you at all. It had my mental health in shambles this whole semester.",
                "Organic chemistry is an interesting course which, although difficult, did provide me with some interesting reflection and discovery over the course of the semester. Taught as it was, however, it was a horrible course and I have yet to meet anyone who actually enjoyed the teaching method.",
                "Only if they were premed\/chem major. If they don't have to take it, there is no reason for them to.",
                "No. By all means, try to avoid taking this course. Especially online. I had to take it for a major requirement and premed requirement and I honestly would have rather taken the course at another university for credit.",
                "Unless this is absolutely required, there is really no point in taking this class.",
                "If you need the course to satisfy a requirement, then take it. If not, I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you are really interested in chemistry.",
                "Yes if they need to take in for their major or pre-med requirement",
                "No. I would not take this course unless I had to. A lot of times, I felt like the course was set-up to make me fail, and to undermine my abilities as a student. Coming into the course, students are either mandated to take General Chemistry, or an advanced version of General Chemistry in which students are better equipped to succeed in Organic Chemistry. This literally sets up some students to succeed, and some to fail. I was the most stressed because of this course, poured in HOURS every-day outside of class to learn the material, and struggled with even learning the material then.",
                "Yes",
                "I would only recommend taking this course if it is required of you in one way or another.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn organic chemistry.",
                "Yes, it is a required course for further chemistry and biology courses.",
                "I would recommend this course; it provides a good structure for learning the processes of organic chemistry and sets up well for the second semester of organic chemistry.",
                "Unless it's required for you or you're a masochist, I really wouldn't recommend it. To be fair, organic chemistry really isn't as bad as people make it out to be, but that doesn't mean that this was an enjoyable class by any means. Personally I felt like I was doing pretty well in the class, but because of the rush to finish the content by the end of the semester and the amount of work and finals I had for other classes I felt like I had a pretty severe disadvantage to classmates who had lighter course loads and could thereby dedicate all their time during reading week to studying for the CHEM 220 final. Even though I was doing well all semester, I feel like I fell flat at the end because of poor course organization and I wouldn't be surprised if other students felt the same way. Just be prepared for a really rapid increase in pace in the last 2 weeks of this class, at least while Jorgenson is teaching, because otherwise, the final will not go well for you.",
                "No. If it is necessary for a student to take it, wait until this is over and you can learn in a class when the professor actually writes down the notes and can better grasp the speed and understanding of the class.",
                "Honestly, I really enjoyed the material, but do not take this course with Jorgensen.",
                "For anyone with this course as a prerequisite, then yes, take this course, it is difficult, but if you are diligent, it is completely manageable. HOWEVER, do NOT take this course if it is not a requirement for you! It is an incredibly challenging course, and some other science credit will probably suit you better!",
                "If this person needs to learn the basics in organic chemistry, this is the class for them.",
                "Only if you need to take it. If Dr. Jorgensen is teaching don't stress about the crazy biological molecules he covers in lecture. Honestly just look at sapling and if it makes no sense work with your TA.",
                "If you're doing pre-med, yes.",
                "It's probably a requirement anyways but it's overall okay. It's a good amount of work and the lectures aren't very engaging but the course is structured well.",
                "Yes, organic chemistry is a basic science and is a prerequisite for other advanced sciences so you can't avoid it.",
                "If they are premed or a chem major, I would recommend",
                "Many people take this because it fills some requirement, and for them, I think it's a good class. People taking this out of interest should know that it's a full class that will take a lot of work and time.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if that student is pre-med or a chemistry major.",
                "This is probably a prereq for you so obviously take it. Durning COVID times, I don't really recommend this course, especially how it's set up now: the prof just rambles through all of the stuff in the reading and cuts office hours short and you have to do all the learning on your own time. I'm sure under normal conditions it is much better.",
                "During the pandemic, probably not. I understand organic chemistry is generally a hard class but I felt like I really struggled and had less access to the resources I might have on campus.",
                "Obviously this course has to be taken for many premeds and other bio and chemistry majors, but if you do not have to take this course do not take it.",
                "Only if you're required to take the course",
                "Only if they need it",
                "HA! oh... you're serious... Listen, we both know that you're not taking this course recreationally or for it's intellectual value, presumably you have a requirement that you have to fulfill for your major. If this course is a prerequisite for your major then I do recommend it. You may not learn any chemistry, but that was never really the point was it? If you are considering taking this for fun you need to take a moment and seriously think about your life choices.",
                "Absolutely. Not only is it a requirement for many majors, its also extremely important to building a good idea of the world of Chemistry.",
                "Not unless you need it for a requirement. Although the curve was very generous, the grades were mainly based on the midterms and final (none of the midterms can be dropped). Even if you go to many office hours, the material is still very difficult to comprehend by the time the midterms come.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It is critical that a student takes this course if they are considering a career path in chemistry, biochemistry, or anything pre-med. This course covers many of the mechanisms needed for a fundamental and strong understanding of organic chemistry. However, I recommend that the student take advantage of the office hours of teaching fellows. This is something that I did not do, and I personally believe that having one-on-one time with a T.F. would have helped combat the disengagement that I felt during the larger lecture."
