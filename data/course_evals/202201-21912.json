                "I think that the transition from phylogenic relationships and synapomorphies to functional anatomy was a little abrupt, and I am not sure how that will be reflected in my grade. Overall, the course was enjoyable.",
                "Strengths - I liked how we went through the whole phylogeny and I liked the multiple choice questions on the exams. I also liked how willing Dr. Moyer was to answer any questions\r\nWeaknesses - A lot of material covered in a short amount of time",
                "This class covers a LOT of information. I think there could be a sense of slowing down as I feel the last 2 weeks of functional anatomy was too in dpeth and kind of shoved at the end.  I think the other information should be spread further along so that students have more time to grasp topics.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, good lectures, well-spaced/fair assignments and exams. \r\nWeaknesses: the pacing of the class was very far off from what I expected based on the syllabus. Also, Dr. Moyer is a character-- you either really like him or really don't.",
                "Strengths: \r\n-  The course moved at a really accessible course and Dr. Moyer was really considerate to answer all the questions that we had on more confusing topics. \r\n- The course felt well structured for student learning and I appreciated how we would review things like the phylogeny every lecture\r\n- There are opportunities to bounce back from a low grade, which helped make the course more accessible. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Not posting the full slides to Canvas made it really difficult to review or miss class\r\n- The functional anatomy content at the end was a bit harder to follow and didn't feel as cohesive",
                "The strengths were that it was a great mix of breadth and depth. It was cool to feel like we saw examples from across the entire phylogeny and learned a fair amount about all of the clades we touched on. The lectures were well-formatted and there was always ample time for questions. I think the last bit of the class that was more about functional anatomy was a bit jarring after the rest of the class; I wouldve preferred there had been a bit more depth in certain parts of the phylogeny instead of as much functional anatomy at the end.",
                "Strengths: Great level of detail and explanations of key anatomical traits; covered a lot of interesting material in case studies\r\nWeaknesses: We didn't quite get to finish the planned content for the semester due to the first two weeks being virtual, but I doubt this will be an issue in future years",
                "Strengths: Dr. Moyer grew on me a lot as the semester progressed since at first his self-deprocating and often corny jokes were a bit much. Eventually it just added to the charm. Moyer is patient and funny, the information is interesting for those interested in the subject, and it is at a very manageable pace.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the writing assignments are a waste of time and don't facilitate learning. As much as I appreciate Moyer's desire to answer every question until students have a full understanding, sometimes the pace of the class was very slow.",
                "Strengths: teaching team is all so helpful and passionate. This really made the class so engaging!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there is so much information that hen its time to study for an exam, it feels very overwhelming. Also the class is not curved, so this makes it easier to know your grade but also a bit difficult to end with a very high grade.",
                "I like how the course is structured as a lecture with occasional questions from Dr. Moyer to engage the class, but also that Dr. Moyer took time out of the lecture to answer each and every question that students had to make sure everyone was on the same page before moving onto another topic. He does not skip out on answering questions just to fit the lecture in the certain time frame of class, and I appreciate this as it allows for more engagement and a deeper understanding of the topics. I do not think there were any weaknesses."

                "If you have to take it, it's a good course. I took it as an elective and I'm not sure it was the right choice for me. It does give you a good understanding of the differences between vertebrate clades.",
                "Yes, it is a nice course, especially if you like animals! It is not super helpful if you are pre-med looking to gain insight into human anatomy, but its the closest thing to regular anatomy that Yale offers.",
                "Maybe, depending on your background and goals. If you've taken other courses that walk through the vertebrate phylogenetic tree (BIOL 104, E&EB 125, EPS 325, etc.), this course is nothing different and definitely does not live up to the \"developmental anatomy\" part of its title. It's a lot of memorization. I also found Dr. Moyer to be a somewhat frustrating professor (this class is NOT the famous Gunter Wagner comparative anatomy I'd been hearing about for years). That said, it's interesting, relevant/accessible, and not too challenging-- a solid E&EB elective. \r\n(P.S. if you do take this class, you definitely don't need the textbooks.)",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone in the E&EB major or with an interest in vertebrate life.",
                "Yes! Really interesting topics and well taught.",
                "Highly recommend to anyone who likes biology and wants to approach evolution and organisms from a higher level than cells or genetics or molecules, as we often end up doing these days. The course was very well taught and would be interesting to even people who aren't zoology enthusiasts",
                "Yes. I think Moyer is a lot of fun and the class is entertaining and interesting if you love species diversity and understanding how anatomy affects evolution.",
                "Yes if you have to take it. Its a lot of information and definitely not a class that you can easily cruise to an A in. That being said, you learn a lot of really cool information about the entire class of vertebrates. So, if you are interested, this might be a good class to credit/d/fail!",
                "Yes, especially for those looking into the EEB major but are still hesitant about which track to take. This course is one of few that can give you a general insight over what one of the tracks would look like. It is one of the biology courses that will help you distinguish what your interest is and provide general guidance towards its fields",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It may not be a gut, but Dr. Moyer makes the course so fun and engaging. I've retained so many new and unforgettable facts about different species because Dr. Moyer makes the information so fun to learn."
