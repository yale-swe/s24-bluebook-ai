The course packet has some really nice practice problems (though I wish we had the answer key with it) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think guided reading would have been really helpful. Sometimes we read by ourselves in pairs via breakout rooms, but I think having the professor read the passage so we could follow along would've been more helpful because I didn't know how to pronounce a lot of words and didn't learn how to through individual reading. More feedback in general in terms of pronunciation and speaking would have been great."

I mainly hate the workbook because the questions and problems you do for homework don't really help with the content that shows up on exams and quizzes. It helps a bit, but mainly feels like busy work."
