This course was super effective in teaching me how to read and write about architecture, how to identify monuments and characteristics of monuments, and how to place these structures in their respective times, places, and political environments.",

                "great course, professor is amazing",
                "I think the course moved quite quickly, which is somewhat necessary by its nature. I wish sometimes that each individual lecture emphasized more prominently core themes to latch on to - sometimes I felt lost moving from details of one building to another.",
                "Strengths: Professor Rizvi is lovely, the field trip to the Met and the creative assignment were awesome, and the paper topics were interesting (and preferable to having a final exam)\r\n\r\nWeakenesses: as a non-architecture student, I don't feel like I learned how to analyze buildings. I think it would be helpful to do a crash course in what to look for and how architecture works. Also, there were just too many buildings covered in the class. Especially in the second half of the course, we would only talk about a given building for a minute or two before moving on. As a result, lectures felt rushed, surface-level, and a bit dry.",
                "Strengths  Prof. Rizvi is brilliant, and I enjoyed her lectures. The assignment structure (2 short papers, a midterm, and a final paper) is fair. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  Way too much reading. Often over a hundred pages per week. Not what I wanted for a fifth class outside my major. Often skipped lots of it. My TF was also not super invested.",
                "Remove the midterm or don't require as much memorization for it",
                "you get a free trip to the met, learn a lot about architecture and history, and get to learn about cool stuff the entire time so a very good class overall",
                "This is a good introductory survey course, and it welcomes people from all across different majors. However, the downside of this was that I wished we could've delved deeper into certain topics.",
                "Strengths: Prof Rizvi and the teaching team were all so helpful when it came to explaining terms, assignments, and expectations. I also felt that discussion section was engaging and allowed us to delve deeper into lecture material. The midterm review session was also particularly productive in that we saw how we should format our responses.\r\nNo weaknesses come to mind.",
                "I honestly don't think I could name a weakness about this course -- it was fun, the workload was very reasonable, and the content was super interesting and was taught in a fantastic way, with lots of pictures and interesting anecdotes about the monuments and histories thanks to Prof. Kishwar.",
                "Wonderful lectures and an incredibly compassionate instructor. GREAT guest lectures by the TAs as well. I wish we had been able to spend more time on the modern era.",
                "Strengths: very interesting material, minimal but meaningful assignments, trip to the Met in New York was excellent\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes difficult to follow lecture, slides sometimes unlabeled",
                "Lecture could be more engaging",
                "I feel like I've learned so much about Islamic architecture in one semester, but the amount of information that we had to learn was certainly overwhelming (especially in the first half of the semester when we were learning about all the pre-modern\/early modern mosques and monuments). Might be helpful to distribute the material over two course offerings. That way, we could also cover each monument more in depth.",
                "Strengths: Professor Rizvi was incredibly engaging, understanding, and knowledgable. I really enjoyed the lecture portions and visits to the MET. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The midterm exam was very ID-heavy. The extreme range of countries, periods, plus the added language barrier made memorizing 60+ mosques quite difficult.",
                "Some of its strengths were the section discussions the visual presentations and the field trip to the met, which was one of the high points of my semester. I think it could be improved by making the readings and resources easier to find and access. I also think the slide ID section of the midterm was difficult to prepare for, and a different format might be better for the exam."

                "yes, as a STEM major I was able to do this class and really enjoyed it",
                "Certainly! Professor Rizvi is wonderful, and getting to know her this semester was an absolute treat. The questions the course raised for me in terms of Architecture past\/present also felt crucial. Its perhaps somewhat more modern-focused than you might expect going on, but on balance, it was fascinating.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in architecture and have some background -- it may not be super engaging otherwise. I was really excited for the course and in retrospect it wasn't really what I thought it would be. However, Islamic architecture itself is absolutely gorgeous.",
                "Yes but its not a gut.",
                "The class was cool but the midterm takes way more work than you expect. The midterm with the route memorization of things definitely ruined the class a little for me.",
                "Yes! Such a fascinating topic and interesting lecture!",
                "no reason to not take this class",
                "I definitely would recommend this course!!! You learn so much about Islamic architecture, which is so beautiful and rich in history. Whether you're an architecture or history of art major or not, this is an amazing course that is accessible to anyone, regardless of their academic background.",
                "I would recommend this course! The readings and essays were all accessible, and assistance was readily available, too. I think the course material might be especially interesting to students in MMES, NELC, ARCH, and HSAR majors, some knowledge of the Arabic language, major Muslim empires, and architectural language could be helpful too. Without these backgrounds, the beginning of the course might be difficult.",
                "I absolutely would! Rizvi is an amazing professor, and she really made the class super interesting, not to mention that the TFs were all fantastic. I'd recommend this to anyone, especially if you're interested in Islamic History or Islamic architecture, but even if you're not -- I'm a CS major and I gained a lot from this course! Putting Islamic monuments in a historical context, especially as someone who's been to a few of them, really adds so much to their sights. It's a fantastic thing to learn about, plus you get to look at so many pretty pictures of fancy buildings and who wouldn't enjoy that? Take this class!!",
                "Yes, recommend. If you have not taken an architecture or art history course before, speak with your TAs about the best study methods around visual analysis & memorization.",
                "lukewarm. The material is very interesting and I think it's important to be exposed to non-Eurocentric forms of art and architecture. The trip to the Met in New York was also great! However, at some points the course was disorganized and your TA is integral to your impression of the class.",
                "Yes",
                "Only if you have a specific interest in Architecture or Islamic culture... not for a gut.",
                "Not really, you have to memorize a lot of mosques and Professor Rizvi just goes through them very fast. I don't like how she teaches about 10 mosques in one setting, I feel like I can barely remember all of them, and I just don't feel like we went into depth into anything.",
                "Yes! I loved how this class was a nice blend of lecture style with seminar style in the sections. I learned a lot and the class was very engaging the whole time. I would totally recommend it to a friend."
