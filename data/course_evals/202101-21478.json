                "Strengths include informative and real-world lectures on current topics, especially, COVID-19 as well as guest lecturers pertaining to venture capital and patent law.",
                "Because different professors sometimes information gets repeated, but overall a great MCDB upper-level course",
                "I appreciated the many guest lecturers. They each had their own unique connection to the fields that they were teaching so I appreciated their enthusiasm and dedication.",

                "The course covers a wide range of topics and provides a great introduction to current areas in biotechnology. I particularly loved how we also we able to hear from guest speakers and about the industry side in terms of running a company. Th course could be improved by spending a little bit more time on some of the topics that we only covered for one week.",
                "I would say the grading on the quizzes is a bit harsh; if it was a better reflection of one's performance in the class, this would be a great MCDB course.",
                "Quizzes should not be so short (time-wise and number of questions); give us time to display what we really learned so that we are not just racing against the clock! Also if you forget one small thing from lecture and it shows up on the quiz you are basically done for because the quizzes are only two questions. Also many of the first lectures in the class were very introductory and gave very broad overviews of basic concepts in biotech; these lectures could have been condensed and more course content could have been devoted to more specific topics.",
                "Strength is definitely the guest speakers; Prof. Crews does a great job of curating great speakers (this year, we had people from venture capital, IP law, and biotech\/pharma start-ups.)"
