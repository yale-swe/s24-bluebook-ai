Having completed it, I feel much more comfortable reading through literature in the field of immunology, and understanding how many of the physiological processes in the body relate back to the immune system. Since my research is immunology-focused, I appreciate that I can now understand the work I am doing on a completely new level, and from completely new perspectives."

                "Strengths - interesting content, generally pretty good lectures by people who really know their shit\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes disorganized between lectures repeating information, some lecturers not so good",
                "This class was taught well, I think it was fine. The discussion sections should be optional as I never felt they were productive",
                "In the beginning of the class everything was jumbled in my head. I really had to sit down with the material for a few days and internalize everything to fully appreciate the class. The strengths are that you're being taught by leading immunologists but weaknesses are that the course format is a little disorganized since there are so many different teachers.",
                "The rotating faculty is a strength and a weakness. There were some professors who tried their best to engage with the students and conveyed the concepts really well (Schatz, Pereira, Ring, and Rothlin), and there were some professors who did not teach that well (Meffre, Cresswell, Lucas). I found the first half of the course to be challenging, intellectually stimulating, and very engaging. But the second half of the course was redundant and was mostly review of the principles we learned during first semester. \r\n \r\nStrengths: Reinforcement of material during lecture, discussion sections. Professors were always open to questions and answered them pretty well. The midterm and final were also fair (time wise and content wise). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really did not like the chalk talk format, as it was hard to review without any formal slides. Also, I think a lot of the students appreciate the recordings, but if possible, it would be better if the camera/audio quality was better. The recordings were super helpful for studying for exams, but a lot of the times it was hard to understand what the professor wrote on the board/what they were saying. I think the Poorvu center also records some classes, so that would make it easier on the TAs and provide a higher quality of recordings for the class.",
                "Strengths: each of the professors were very knowledgeable, information was generally presented in a clear and engaging manner, and the exams were fair. Weaknesses: not many, but sometimes professors would discuss topics that we did not learn fully until weeks later which could be confusing",
                "Excellent!",
                "The TA session can be improved. TAs detailedly prepared the session, but most of time during session is just repeating the lecture of professors. It will be much better if the more organized and refined knowledge can be shared during TA session",
                "Fantastic course, great material, very meaningful \r\n\r\nCould be better coordinated as course did seem a bit scattered on what topics were need-to-know. Also TFs could have communicated a bit more to prepare for the final.",
                "Even though the course teaches so much material, and offers such a good introduction to immunology, it is one of the most poorly organized courses I have taken at Yale. The fact that there are so many different professors teaching the course makes it hard for continuity to exist in between topics and lectures. It seems as if the instructors do not communicate with each other on the way that each one of them will be approaching the topics  they will be teaching, and in that way, the course ends up feeling disconnected. I appreciate that experts from each subfield of immunology are teaching on their own field of expertise, and offering their insights into the field, but I would appreciate more continuity  and cohesiveness in the course. Because of the lack of a centralized instructor figure, it is hard to know what are the expectations of the course, and what is expected of students to know for exams and homework. This vagueness that surrounds the course does not help students maximize what they take out of it."

It can be kind of disorganized with many lecturers, but it's nice that they kind of build around a few central themes. The information is really cool, and work during the semester is not that much although the heavy weighting on midterm and finals is kinda intense.",

                "Absolutely, a must take course for anyone interested in research or biotech. Knowledge base is incredibly applicable to many disease settings (oncology, neurology, etc.)",
                "I would recommend this course to any students interested in immunology as a field, and willing to take a course that lacks some of the traditional structures that are offered in typical Yale College courses. With each segment (sometimes even lecture) of the course being taught by a different instructor, the course may at times seem a bit segmented. Yet, it is undoubtedly a course that will teach all of the fundamental things you need to know within the field of immunology in great depth. It is extremely cool that we get to be taught by experts in each subfield of immunology."
