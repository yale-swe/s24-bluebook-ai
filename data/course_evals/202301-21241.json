Professor Lopez fostered a critical thinking environment that encouraged us to analyze diverse healthcare systems throughout North, Central, South America, and the Caribbean. The assigned readings enabled me to delve deeper into various health models. Additionally, this course helped me recognize the interrelationships between social issues and healthcare.",

It fostered cultural competency, knowledge of border health issues, and research skills to address these disparities. The course also emphasized health advocacy, intersectionality, and community engagement to drive positive change and improve Latinx health outcomes.",

Class discussion was a weakness of this course, because the professor would present incredible complex questions such as \"solve healthcare\" expecting students to give educated responses. Since these topics cannot be solved after a single reading, some discussions felt confusing and pointless.",
