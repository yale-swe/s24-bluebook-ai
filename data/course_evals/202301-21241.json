                "In Professor Lopez's class, I gained extensive knowledge about the historical aspects of health and disease within the Latino community, both in the United States and globally. Professor Lopez fostered a critical thinking environment that encouraged us to analyze diverse healthcare systems throughout North, Central, South America, and the Caribbean. The assigned readings enabled me to delve deeper into various health models. Additionally, this course helped me recognize the interrelationships between social issues and healthcare.",
                "The course \"Disease in the Latinx Borderland\" provided a comprehensive understanding of health disparities faced by Latinx populations in borderland regions. It fostered cultural competency, knowledge of border health issues, and research skills to address these disparities. The course also emphasized health advocacy, intersectionality, and community engagement to drive positive change and improve Latinx health outcomes.",

This class helps students better understand the history of heathcare in the US and proposes some solutions for the current crisis."

It fosters cultural competency, research skills, and an understanding of intersectionality and community engagement. The class is very clear and flexible and the course material is very engaging.",
                "The readings were a strength of this course. I found that they provided straightforward and understandable explanations about complex historical events. Class discussion was a weakness of this course, because the professor would present incredible complex questions such as \"solve healthcare\" expecting students to give educated responses. Since these topics cannot be solved after a single reading, some discussions felt confusing and pointless.",
