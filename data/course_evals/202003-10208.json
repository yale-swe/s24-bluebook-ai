I discovered a new approach to writing (and reading creative writing), and overall found so much love for the process.",
                "I developed a lot of creative writing skills more broadly, but workshopping skills in particular. The workshop format of this class was supplemented with a lot of in class writing tasks as well as outside readings, and I was able to see the more inner workings of writing, different techniques, models, and examples that I incorporated in my own work.",

                "Strengths: Professor Deming is very kind and funny, yet still tough enough to push you to improve. I also enjoyed our readings, and I especially loved getting to read and workshop my classmates' excellent work! The small class size made it feel like a tight-knit group, even though we were only seeing each other online. Weaknesses: Sometimes I wished Professor Deming would've talked a bit more about the conventions of different genres and styles before sending us off to write our own pieces, but I think there were also benefits to the openness of our assignments.",
                "There are many strengths to this courseits fluid structure was well suited to learning, as we read a diverse selection of writing, were given both broad creative freedom and specific challenges in our assignments, and had guest speakers come in to speak and give us different perspectives on the writing process. Class time was always engaging and exciting as I rarely knew what to expect coming into classsometimes we would be given a speed-writing challenge, or have an impromptu workshop. The course was structured in a way that our class discussions were always lively and interesting! Also, the feedback I received on my writing was super detailed and helpful. The weakness was that at times it was unclear what was expected of us, as the syllabus was often off.",
                "Strengths of this class definitely include the way that it is structured around workshopping and peer review, as well as the outside speakers! It's great being able to learn from writers who have a lot of experience, and be able to speak with them live. The class is fun and engaging, and I think discussions were well facilitated as well. I do wish there were more in class writing assignments, and sometimes the syllabus was a bit confusing on what amount should be read before a speaker came in, but these are minor things in an overall great class.",
                "The most helpful aspects of this course were interaction with other writers, professional and amateur. The insights gained from visiting professional writers helped me to focus my work and find new inspiration. Frequent workshops in class enabled students to give one another feedback on their work. During this time, each student was able to receive feedback on how their work was interpreted, and then source ideas on how to revise the work.",
                "An amazing course! I found all of the material to be really engaging. The syllabus wasn't always clear about what assignments are due vs what he told us in class, but Prof Deming was amazing with giving extensions\/accomodations so it wasn't a big deal.",
                "One of the strengths was definitely the guest speakers! It was wonderful to speak with published and acclaimed writers and hear their stories and approaches to writing."

                "I think this course went as well as it possibly could have, given the pandemic circumstances. The virtual seminar format actually felt quite similar to an in-person seminar, and I feel like I still got to know the professor and the class pretty well. All of our discussions were enjoyable and pretty engaging, even in spite of being on Zoom. It was a bit sad not to get the chance to interact much with my classmates directly the way we would have been able to before and after class in a normal semester, but I don't know that there's a way to replicate that onlinemaybe regular breakout rooms?",
                "I really appreciated the professor's use of the online format to open up additional opportunities to engageI especially enjoyed having the zoom chat as an additional tool for fun commentary, and the tradition of having students play music at the start and end of the class.",
                "I think that bringing in a speaker for each unit (poetry, fiction, and prose) was really beneficial to our learning and helped us see the real life displays of the forms we were studying."

I would recommend this course to anybody looking to explore creative writing, with the warning that it might be a little more challenging to those with little or no creative writing experience, since you do get sort of thrown in quickly with writing assignments. Still, the class is very much worth it for the connections you make with your classmates and the all-around solid introduction to the genres of fiction, poetry, and dramatic writing. Take this class!!",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in creative writing! There's so much creative flexibility and feedback offered that it has the potential to really improve your writing, and overall was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. Definitely take advantage of office hours!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wishes to get into creative writing at Yale, or an English major looking to take creative writing courses! It's a great introduction to many different kinds of creative writing with a good balance of writing and reading that can suit many students.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! If you'd like a general overview of different forms of creative writing and are interested in honing your skills\/exploring different forms, 100%! What I will say though, is you get as much out of it as you put in. My biggest regret taking this class is that I didn't invest as much time writing my poems, stories, and scenes as I did on psets for other classes  I would have gained a lot more from this class if I'd given it greater attention. A comment on coursetable made me initally a bit skeptical about taking this class as a bipoc, but i can safely say that I always felt completely comfortable sharing my feelings and thoughts. the class was incredibly diverse and prof deming was always receptive to hearing other people's stories. A plus was that all of the writers invited to speak to the class were bipoc, and they shared a lot of really unique insight.",
