By concentrating narrowly on a specific domain of Spanish, within the legal field, I was able to better prepare for my aspiring career as an attorney.

                "I think of the weaknesses of the course was that some of the writing assignments felt kind of pointless they were often just summaries of the information from the textbook. Besides that, I think the class had a lot of strengths. Going back to the writing assignments, they were very useful in improving my writing skills and Profesora Carreras gave individualized feedback on all of them. They also were not very time-consuming, which was nice. I also like how each class wasn't necessarily the same. It was a combination of lecturing, discussing questions, watching videos, etc.",
                "- sometimes we spent the entire class watching videos/TV shows in English. These felt like a waste of time, unfortunately.\r\n- I enjoyed the final paper and midterm presentation projects and the freedom we had in choosing topics",
                "Classes were pretty straightforward and engaging, with weekly writing assignments being fairly manageable.",
                "The syllabus/canvas assignments ended up being different from what was actually assigned which was confusing. The class was also very large and there was a noticiable divide between native speakers and non native speakers. Outside this, both the profesor and the coursework were very enjoyable and I learned a lot.",
                "Strengths: Weekly writing assignments with ample feedback allowed me to practice writing Spanish very effectively. The lectures were always accompanies with a great deal of classroom discussion that allowed students to share their stances on different topics of the legal system. \r\nWeakness: 9 am class... (though better times were available but filled)",
                "I think one major strength was the flexibility of the curriculum. Students were able to choose their own topic for the group presentation; which I found incredibly helpful in my own research in the class. The class also covered multiple facets of law in Spanish, which I appreciated. I can't think of a way it can be improved to be frank.",
                "This course is helpful for learning to write well in Spanish; Prof. Carreras provided very helpful feedback on all written assignments to help with grammar. Because the class size was larger than most seminar language courses, I found it was more challenging to practice speaking.",
                "The course is well-structured with a consistent, two assignments due each week. The canvas site and syllabus could be better organized to maintain accuracy with the class.",
                "strength is that weekly written responses help with writing\r\nweakness is that the classes are a little bit repetitive in the style, lacking engagement in simple textbook material review, doesn't help with vigorous language learning",
                "strengths: Professor Carreras is an excellent professor and thoroughly explains each idea so that it is easy to understand. She provides real world examples and complements them with real cases\r\n\r\nweakness: The class sometimes lacks discussion",
                "Strengths: Received lots of feedback on written assignments, very interesting class conversations and discussion prompts, lots of opportunities to participate, readings were at the right level of difficulty and were relevant to what we talked about in class. \r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "Professor Carreras does a good job of relating the content to current events. We watched interesting videos and discussed relevant topics within the context of the law we had learned about. At times, the course goes very deep into the specifics of the law and can get a bit tedious.",
                "This course was well-structured (readings, in-class discussions, writing assignments, and a presentation). I felt that I had the opportunity to learn from my peers from in-class discussions and the group presentation. The readings and writing assignments allowed me to explore the nuances of various legal systems. The videos helped me to learn more about class topics and improve my listening abilities. My Spanish also improved tremendously because of the detailed feedback I received on assignments. However, one weakness of this class was the size: not everyone in the class could participate in the discussions, and there were not enough seats at the discussion table so many people had to sit at chairs on the side. I think this could be easily remedied by making the class size smaller.",
                "I did not like reading and doing activities outlined in the textbook. They were very dry and oftentimes boring.",
                "Strengths: The professor does an excellent job at discussing the topics in a seminar-like fashion and offers students the opportunity to answer questions consistently. \r\nWeakness: The course could be improved with a more elaborate powerpoint presentations as the ones offered are quite bare and do not serve as very good note taking sources. Students would need to keep up with the professor's quick change in topic and tangents."

It's also not a high workload and Profesora Carreras is wonderful.",

                "If you are looking for a chill Spanish class or general overview of the legal systems, I'd recommend it. But this is not a class that focuses on the improvement in your Spanish language skills.",
                "Yes, it is a great course to learn and apply spanish skills in a relatively relaxed way. Professor Carreras is a great teacher and you learn a lot but it is not a stressful class.",
                "Yes! Very interesting content, Sra. Carreras is extremely nice, workload was quite reasonable. This class also really improved my understanding of the legal system from first principles, at least as it exists in Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries.",
                "If you're looking for an L5 class, this is a good option. It will help you practice and improve your written Spanish, and some of the material covered is very interesting. If you're looking to be challenged and really improve your spoken Spanish, this might not be the course for you.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I improved my Spanish speaking, writing, listening, and reading abilities. I also learned about a topic I did not know much about previously. I left the course feeling well-informed and excited to continue improving my Spanish.",
                "Yes! The professor is very understanding and the reading material (although sometimes difficult to understand immediately) is extremely interesting."
