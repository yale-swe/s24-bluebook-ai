   "comments": [
    "I learned to dance and to listen to my body. I learned to understand rhythm.",
    "I gained a theoretical understanding of African dance, and learned many different dances. In addition, I became comfortable with improvising within African rhythms.",
    "I learned so much about rhythm and how to see rhythm in my life, as well as various types of dances.",
    "You learn about west african dance through movement and literature. The dancing includes many different styles and the reading\/discussions allow you to understand the importance of dance in the general West African culture and context.",
    "Better understanding of dance. Confidence with body.",
    "I learnt a lot about West African Dance, and unexpectedly, about myself! I learnt patience, reliance and gained a greater appreciation of life and my environments as we explored the concept of rhythm.",
    "The course was a great change from typical Yale college.  Not only was the course educational in the traditions and culture of West Africa, but also was a great way to learn about dance, rhythm, and oneself.",
    "improved knowledge of my body & its movement, better ear for complex rhythms, attention to ensemble performance,",
    "Listening to my bod. Traditional African dance steps. Listening to the music to see the shape it creates. Listening to others to find a collective rhythm.",
    "I adored this class! I learned to breathe and be free and happy in an academic setting. I really bonded with the whole class and was able to feel included in the material by comparing and contrasting my own culture to the West African dance culture. I also learned to just feel the music and let go and live, because dancing is living. I loved this class."

   "comments": [
    "I loved the practice sessions. The class fosters a great community. The final showing was fun and exciting. Please do it if you get in!",
    "This class is primarily a dancing class.  If you're expecting a lot of intellectual engagement or challenge, this isn't quite the course.  However, you will spend so much time dancing which is so so fun.",
    "Strengths - This course is EVERYTHING if you like to dance! It was fun, insightful and chill. A great way to start the day with dance and exercise. \r\nWeaknesses - the class is almost 2 hours, which is pretty long. There are also barely any grades so if you want to know how you're doing in the class, you won't really be able to.",
    "The discussion portion of the course didnt feel like a valuable learning experience. The instructor failed to request for the books to be ordered by the Bookstore so every week it was a struggle to try and find the required course material. Even after doing the readings, the discussions did not seem very valuable and felt like much more of a formality even though there was some interesting subject matter. This portion of the course should be reformed or removed.\r\n\r\nAlso 18 pages for a writing assignment is way too much and it should be reduced to a more reasonable amount to like 10-12 pages maximum.",
    "Dancing in the class was a great way to get a greater understanding West African culture and the importance behind rhythm and letting yourself embody it.  I also think the class is good for new people who don't have much experience dancing.",
    "course is really amazing & i enjoyed how much time was spent dancing; maybe more structured seminar time?",
    "I was a non-intimidating approach to West African dance and everyone could feel welcome to the class, regardless of background. I wish it were offered in the Spring too since there is such high demand for it. I partly wish there was something a bit more challenging for people who got the steps quickly, although there is always room for improving on the basics, so it's fine the way it is too.",
    "strengths - well rounded material, variety of dances learned, super engaged, personal\/cultural\r\n\r\nweaknesses - lack of communication but prof was reasonable when we brought up confusion with due dates etc"

    "Yes!!!!!!",
    "Absolutely! It is so fun!",
    "Yes! A great way to spend the semester.",
    "YES!! YESS!!! YESSSSS!! Take this course if you want to have a great semester!! There's no need for further explanation.",
    "Absolutely! One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Every single class was enjoyable and filled with so much energy. You also get so close to the professor and classmates that you honestly forget it is a class. Absolute gem of a class.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend. This class was fun! It was a good time, and a great stress-reliever amidst all my other classes.",
    "I would highly recommend this course.  It is educational beyond textbook material.  It was the class I have enjoyed the most so far.  It's a good change from the typical sitting at a desk to learn.  Dancing was always fun and there was a great community between the classmates.",
    "literally anyone ever, regardless of dance background",
    "Yes. It's a fun class and you learn more about the intelligence of your entire body, not just your mind, which is a really refreshing experience to have at a school like Yale which can often feel over-intellectual.",
    "YES! Try it. Once in a lifetime experience."
