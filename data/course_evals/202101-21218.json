We read a lot of interesting pieces in our 5 units, and discussions in each class were a nice chance to unpack. More experience writing essays and getting feedback were great too."

                "This is a fantastic course. The readings are amazing, Professor Stuart was a joy to get to know, and the class size was perfect to facilitate a seminar. My favorite part of the class was the opportunities to peer-edit with my classmates, who were all such talented writers. Truly a class I won't forget.",
                "The discussion format and blogging are very helpful in assuring that there is never a pause or dull moment in class. Also, the reading was, for the most part, a huge plus, as they were engaging and interesting. One weakness of the course is the overly harsh grading. Oftentimes, there would only be one A per paper, with most of the papers falling in between 88-93 consistently.",
                "Strengths: The course was really engaging - we were all really close and always had nice conversations. The readings were good and Professor Stuart was really personable. \r\nWeaknesses: A few of the readings are on the longer side and turnover for a few of the essays is quick, but if you plan ahead a little or intentionally keep up you're fine."

                "Absolutely! I think that the skills from English 120 are applicable to a lot of areas. I found that the writing skills I picked up in this course helped me in other areas as well, and it was just overall a great course to take.  I can't recommend it enough.",
                "Yes, this course is very highly regarded for a reason. It is a great introduction to college writing and, if you take one English course at Yale, it should be this or 114.",
                "Yes - I felt my writing skills greatly improved after taking this course. I enjoyed doing the readings and discussing them during class. Even in a virtual setting, I still got a lot out of class discussion. Prof. Stuart was very helpful both during class and in office hours. The process of turning in a first draft, peer reviewing, and revising also helped be become a better writer. If you want to put in some effort to become a better writer, take this course.",
                "Yes!! This was a lovely, fun, interesting English course. This class was all of the discussion I hoped for in an personal essay seminar."
