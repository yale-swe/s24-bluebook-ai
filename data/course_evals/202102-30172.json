This course also further developed my research skills, by forcing me to look at original documents as opposed to just scholarly articles.

                "None to improve on!",

                "This course was structured well to promote independent learning. The course was relatively fluid and relied on student engagement to shape what topics we discussed and in what depth. The course would not have been very beneficial for students who did not participate.",
                "Strengths: very interesting subject matter, professor who is an expert in the field, great TAs\r\nWeaknesses: class environment could have been more cohesive and less intimidating",
                "Akhil Amar and his great TA's are the strength of this excellent course. \r\nThere are really no weaknesses, except perhaps the unstructured-ness of class discussions, but even then, the open format allows Amar to cover a much wider range of topics (the readings, discussion posts, student questions, current events, personal stories about important people in the judiciary today) than he might otherwise be able to.",
                "Professor Amar is incredibly knowledgeable, and you will be hard-pressed to find a Professor at the forefront of their field. However, his expertise leads discussions to essentially become lectures where Amar explains things for 3 hours. It can be hard to know what your classmates think or know any alternative interpretations.",
                "Strengths: Content, engagement, short but very informative lecture videos \r\nWeaknesses: Long discussions, hard to stay engaged the whole discussion period, Length of discussion posts. \r\nImprovements: 5-10 minute break during 2.5 hour discussions, shorter requirements for the discussion posts.",
                "More structure to class time. Many of the sessions were unorganized lectures from Professor Amar."

Those with more background expertise will likely find the level of challenge and information learned to be well balanced.",
                "I would! The class environment can be a bit intimidating, but overall the class is definitely worth it. I learned a lot, and Professor Amar certainly knows his stuff.",
                "Absolutely! Don't miss this opportunity to take a class with Akhil Amar as an undergraduate.",
                "Yes, but you need to a) really like America, b) be prepared to read a lot, and c) understand the limitations of the course. The class is very America-centric and while it does not shy away from discussing the shortcomings of the republic, the class will certainly glorify the US more than other Yale courses. Amar has students read three 500 page books and expects a detailed understanding of the arguments he raises throughout each text. The course only presents (in great detail) Amar's arguments. If you strongly disagree with a take, you can push back, but the course is not really interested in providing a well-rounded view of the Consitution.",
                "Yes I would. I think this course encompasses many important aspects of American democracy and turns them into one fluid learning mechanism. Thus, it allows a student to learn all about the the Constitution, American history and Law in one class."
