                "I think by far the greatest strength of this course was Itziar's approach to teaching. Unlike the other instructors I was exposed during review sessions, Itziar always came to class with a well-thought out, well-planned agenda for the day's lesson. But at the same time that she provided that structure, she pushed students to think for themselves by creating breakout rooms and asking us to solve difficult problems on our own before talking about them as a classa challenge that could be frustrating in the moment, but one that did a great job of preparing us for tests and getting us to really understand the material. The one big challenge of this course was waking up before 9:00 AM, especially as the semester dragged on, but that's neither here nor there.",
                "The instructors were good about releasing and returning our homework grades with comments for about the first month of the semester, but then that stopped. I had no idea how much my homework grade actually would be helping my overall grade. Outside of that, I have no complaints about how the course was run, especially considering the online format. I think I just didn't really like the content. \r\n\r\nOne thing I did really like was how my instructor in particular had guided notes we could fill in as we went through the lecture. I think it helped keep me engaged with the class being taught over Zoom.",
                "Strengths: teaches fairly useful mathematical skills, problem sets are effective at practicing material and not too time-consuming. \r\nWeaknesses: Different instructors have wildly varying teaching skills, midterms didn't always perfectly align with course material, latter third of the course jumps between unrelated subjects to teach elementary skills in parametric and polar functions.",
                "I think the breakout rooms during lecture worked really. They felt like a nice change of pace and allowed me to discuss and practice math with some of my classmates.",
                "Very fast paced. But good lectures.",
                "Strengths: my lecturer was very knowledgeable and explained concepts well. The peer tutoring was a great resource and the review sessions before tests were also very helpful. In terms of prepping for exams, the practice exams were also very valuable. The use of desmos was awesome for illustrating complex topics. \r\nWeaknesses: the exams were very conceptual so it would be nice to have more homework problems that were also more conceptual like those on the exam",
                "This course did the best it could given the virtual learning situation, no cons that I can think of. I like how the professor gave us note worksheets to follow along the lecture with.",
                "Strength - excellent professor (Itziar), fair grading policy\r\nWeaknesses - some of the questions on PSETs were irrelevant, convoluted or fuzzy",
                "Strengths: The schedule throughout the year was clear. The consistency of problem sets were nice and they helped to prepare for exams. The practice exams were also very helpful to prepare.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: n\/a",
                "Strengths: great exam prep material, well structured with lectures twice a week and a problem set due every week. The problem sets prepare you well for the exams. The breakout rooms were really great and really helped me to learn!\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes I felt that the lectures went too fast. It would have been nice for the notes to be available after lecture to fill in the gaps of what I managed to scrawl.",
                "The course was effective in focusing application and understanding of concepts rather than simply memorizing information. The instructor's lecture correlated well with the reading material. The course could have offered more resources for practice."
