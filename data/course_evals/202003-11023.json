The most enlightening part of the class was the exploration of attacks on classical foundationalism, which is how most people go about forming beliefs (have set of prior beliefs, justify all further beliefs using evidence that map to prior beliefs.) It made me realize that what we confine ourselves to believing is reasonable is in fact rather narrow and artificial, and pushed me to become more open-minded in ways I didn't expect.",

Now when I hear an argument, I am immediately thinking about what premises it is based on and considering whether it might be self-defeating. At the same time, I also learned that ones reading of a work should work to interpret it as favorably as possible."
