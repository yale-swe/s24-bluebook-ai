   "comments": [
    "This class, and the instructor herself, really pushed me to think harder and more creatively, draw connections between seemingly unconnected things, and work on structuring and streamlining my writing. I can confidently say that I truly learned how to write a paper in this class. I learned how to structure an argument and make a paper flow and move between ideas to bolster the argument. I also learned how to think critically about and engage with challenging material that raised ethical questions as well as question my liking for more familiar material.",
    "My essay writing skills have greatly improved throughout this course. It was very helpful for getting back into the swing of writing, especially regarding research papers.",
    "I learned a lot of unique perspectives on beauty which i had never thought about before. definitely the most interesting class i have taken at yale even though i don't really enjoy writing",
    "I learned how to analyze and have productive discussing regarding a variety of modern media. The class also allowed me to improve my style and technical precision when writing.",
    "I learned a great deal in this course about essay writing and just writing in general. More specifically, I feel like I was really able to improve on creating more concise arguments as well as more appealing writing. I know understand how to make more complex arguments and observations, and use evidence naturally to back them up. I also really enjoyed all of the reading in the course. I appreciated the range of material we covered. It helped me connect other real world interests to English, and I gained a lot of insight into the way appearance affects identity and society. Furthermore, this course taught me how to participate in college-level discussion for the first time. It definitely took a bit of learning to know how to take what we had been assigned and discuss it actively with other people.",
    "I learned how to apply styles of other authors into my own writing. Additionally, I learned how to efficiently analyze other works.",
    "I have become a better writer because of this course. I've also learnt to develop and defend arguments, think critically, carry out research regarding a topic and how to develop my writing voice\/style.",
    "I learned how to write more coherently, to weave pieces of research evidence into my work, and to incorporate feedback into my essays.",
    "I improved both my verbal analysis and communication skills as well as my essay writing.",
    "I received a lot of really good feedback on my writing in terms of style and content. I think the structure of the class (with the multiple drafts) and Sophies commitment to the students helped me to grow as a writer.",
    "I definitely improved my essay writing ability, with a clear difference between my first and last essay. I also deepened my close-reading and analysis skills.",
    "I developed my skills in essay writing and structuring. I also learned how to discuss a topic in an academic setting in Socratic seminar style and gained insights on beauty from people that had all different backgrounds.",
    "This class forced me to think critically about gender, beauty, and racial representation in the media. As an introduction to college-level writing, this class does a great job of integrating truly interesting pieces into class discussion and essays."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some strengths include the breadth of reading  we looked at readings from Plato\/Socrates to editorials to music videos (and subsequently meeting the music video creator)  and the depth with which we engaged with the readings. I do wish we had talked a bit more about our assignments outside of the actual instructions. What I mean by this is I wish we had gone over how to write a well-structured, well-argued paper before being assessed on our writing.  I did feel like I had to rely on seeing an outside tutor, which might be the nature of English classes here, but I wouldn't know since this one is my first. I also think we could've been assigned more readings  not to say this opinion would be the most popular in the class of course  but I did feel like we could've engaged with more material. I do appreciate, however, that the readings in this class were more about quality rather than quantity.",
    "This course is very well organized and methodical.",
    "don't be as tough graders and improve the P1 prompt",
    "A major strength of the course was inclusion of all students in discussion. Discussion was conducted fairly and productively and helped me understand the course material. The course organization also facilitated the improvement of my writing.",
    "The strengths of the course were the very open discussions we had in class and the immense feedback we received from the professor. By letting the class mostly be discussion among students with insightful prompts from the professor, it was never dull and allowed me to realize points I didn't think about on my own. I also liked how easy it was to get individual feedback from the professor, particularly because the office hours were consistent and I could look on a spreadsheet (which was very convenient). The professor also left a lot of comments on any submission which was great. In addition, I appreciated the course's connection to modern topics.\r\nOne weakness of the course was that sometimes I felt not enough time was spent on some materials in the course. I think the course could be consolidated with more time spent on less topics.",
    "Biggest strength of this course was the organization. I think there was a good amount of time allotted for each essay and I think the assigned works were perfect for the course.",
    "Strengths: Academic\/Creative freedom with assignments, Engaging intellectual discussions, Clear and constructive feedback on assignments, Safe space for open discussion, Friendly and encouraging instructor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussions were a bit confusing at times and weren't clearly structured.",
    "The feedback on essays was very thoughtful  definitely a strength!",
    "This course is very strong because the material we are taught deals with beauty and our own understandings of our personal relationship to beauty culture. I really appreciated the relevance of the material, and applying it to my own life. I wouldn't say there's anything to change.",
    "I felt like the readings we did and the class discussion we had were not always relevant.",
    "The videos and articles we used in class are very engaging and relate perfectly to the course material. Professor Richardson also gives clear feedback on how to improve one's writing, with many opportunities during office hours.",
    "My strengths in the course were discussion and class participation. My weaknesses were time management and accepting edits.",
    "The readings and class discussions were interesting and engaging throughout the semester. I can't think of any weaknesses."

    "yes because it was so interesting",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Although the course was a step out of my comfort zone, it was a good challenge and a good change of pace for me. From the perspective of course quality, I would rate it very highly. Especially considering the things I've heard about other ENGL 114 sections, I am very happy with the section I was put in.",
    "I would, simply because I think it was a great foundational course for other future college courses. I especially recommend it if another student had interests similar to mine and the focus of the course.",
    "Yes I would. The course was extremely interesting especially because the beauty ideal is so significant in todays culture. Additionally, Sophie Richardson is an excellent teacher.",

    "I would recommend this class to other students because it is taught by a passionate professor who gives clear feedback to help students improve. We also covered a lot of interesting videos and articles in class that were important to our study of \"beautiful people.\"",
