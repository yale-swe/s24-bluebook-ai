    "You will read lots of Shakespeare and become a better conversationalist at cocktail parties. More charitably, you'll understand the stories alluded to all across contemporary culture. This class, in that sense, is a primer on Western literature.",
    "This course exposed me to new ways to think about Shakespeare's work, and genre in general.",
    "\"If you don't read Shakespeare, your life is incomplete. Well, your life will be fine, but YOU will be emotionally stunted.\" \r\n-David Kastan \r\n\r\nYou will understand Shakespeare, yourself, and the human condition. And also be a better writer.",
    "I got a LOT better at reading Shakespeare, got a lot more out of reading Shakespeare, and my writing skills improved.",
    "I hadn't taken a Shakespeare course before, so I learned a lot about different opinions on his works as well as close readings of his words.",
    "We read 14 Shakespeare plays, so first off, I gained a lot of basic knowledge of these plays. More importantly, however, I learned how to interact with these plays  how to trust my ability to evaluate lines that seem off or interesting. I gained a level of comfort with these plays.",
    "I read 14 of Shakespeare's histories and tragedies, many of which I had never read before.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing and the best i've probably taken at Yale so far. I've learned an entirely different way to look at Shakespeare, and, frankly, I think I have a new lifelong passion.",
    "Lots about Shakespeare!",
    "Learnt to read Shakespeare in an entirely different way.",
    "This course introduced me to Shakespeare's histories and built upon my basic knowledge of his tragedies. I also learned how to read better and more deeply through assignments like the manic gloss along with a style of textual analysis, which I might perhaps call ethical, that is sometimes absent in other courses.",
    "SHAKESPEARE!! I hadn't read a lot of the plays before, and this course gave me a previously unknown appreciation of the complexities of Shakespeare's writing. As a Physics\/MCDB major, I didn't have a lot of experience with this type of English course, and I really enjoyed it. I learned to write interesting literary papers, something I'd never done before. You gain an understanding of just how incredibly cool and complex Shakespeare is - I wrote a 10+ page essay examining one 6 line passage, and thoroughly enjoyed myself. You will too, if you take this course. Plus, the reading responses are interesting and not like a typical english course."

   "comments": [
    "Weakness: lectures are uninspiring",
    "Strengths: very straightforward class, straightforward assignments, straightforward texts. Kastan is a great lecturer, a sharp mind and an interesting man.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a lot, lot, lot of reading. Very easy to fall behind. And, once behind, you will struggle mightily to make it back",
    "There was essentially no syllabus. Every deadline was changed. Nowhere did it say we were going to have a final and then we had a final. I wish it had been more structured.",
    "All strengths, no weaknesses.",
    "Great lectures!!!!!!",
    "Boring",
    "I can't think of much to complain about! Good lectures and discussions in section. I feel like there's only one sort of way to do this sort of course really.",
    "Listening to Kastan speak and hearing his takes on these plays was incredibly enjoyable and interesting. The section was much less enjoyable. I wish it was possible for this class to be a seminar but I understand that the interest is too high.",
    "A major weakness of this course was communication about assignments and assessments. For most of the assignments throughout the semester, the due date and nature of the assignment was unclear until what I would deem the last minute (compared to many other classes where you know the due dates at the start of the semester).  The worst example of this, though, was the final exam!! We weren't told until the last week of class what kind of final exam we were having, and many of us were told the wrong information, which was really frustrating.",
    "Strengths are just about everything prof kastan does. He is such a good lecturer, such a good reader, and makes all us of think so differently about Shakespeare.  If there were one weakness it would be that occasionally assignments had slightly confusing prompts. But thats it.",
    "Was pretty good.",
    "Professor Kastan's lectures are amazing and so engaging.",
    "Kastan is a highly engaging and charismatic lecturer, and classes were always fascinating. From accounts from friends, section was a little more hit and miss depending on TF.",
    "The lecture format of this course is perhaps its greatest strength. Hearing Professor Kastan speak about Shakespeare's plays for fifty minutes twice a week ensured that I took away from his class outweighed what I might have taken away from a seminar style class. His dynamic presentation style fits well with the plays that he selected.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this course is section. I don't think that it was that helpful in firming my grasp of Shakespeare even if we were able to cover passages that we overlooked or skimmed in lecture.\r\n\r\nThe only necessary improvement to this course that I can think of is to clarify the format of the final. Receiving multiple contradictory and unclear messages about the final during reading week generated unnecessary stress that could have been avoided. I think simply announcing what the final will be a few weeks beforehand would alleviate this stress.",
    "Strengths: You read a lot of Shakespeare, Kastan is an engaging lecturer and a very nice guy. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Pretty disorganized (didn't really know what to focus on for the final until the final was sitting in front of us), poor TA-professor communication it seemed."

   "comments": [
    "I am writing this in the hopes that others may avoid the mistake I made in enrolling in this course. Among all the student evaluations, there is almost unanimous consent that this course is so inspiring, life-changing, best course at Yale, etc. I found the opposite to be true. Among all the English classes I've taken, it was the worst. Yes, the plays are wonderful, and anyone who disagrees is simply not paying enough attention to the plays. The lectures, however, I found to be soulless and honestly depressing--it was shocking to me that someone who spent so much time studying Shakespeare seemed to be uninspired by them. Kastan's lectures engaged with the plays at a distance. He seemed to read them not as literature, but as artifacts. In lecture, this means that he said things along the lines of, \"Hamlet is somehow more interesting than the other characters, like you might actually want to date him\" (This is so obvious--YES, Hamlet is supremely interesting) or \"There is something terrible about revenge because of its imitative quality where you end up becoming your enemy.\" Everything is over-intellectualized, and nothing has intensity. Additionally, I really disliked my TF and always left section in a worse mood. I know that I am in the minority, and I'm sure that others have decent reasons for enjoying the class. For those of you who think that you might take this class just because, I advise that you be a little wary. Initially I thought this would be better than Nicholson's Comedies and Romances because Kastan seemed less inclined to perversely push forward politically progressive readings. Actually, Nicholson's is the better class because she puts her heart into her lectures. And John Rogers' Milton class is even better.",
    "Kastan is amazing. Take him up on his offers for coffee. Read the plays. Go to lecture. Pay attention (it's 50 minutes, you can do this!)",
    "Yes! Take for Kastan! Take for Shakespeare! What you see is what you get. This is a solid course",
    "I would recommend taking this course Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "Definitely. If you like Shakespeare, or even if you don't, Professor Kastan's lectures are brilliant and offer new ways to approach text, history and tragedy.",
    "Of course! \"If you don't read Shakespeare, your life is incomplete. Well, your life will be fine, but YOU will be emotionally stunted.\" \r\n-David Kastan \r\n\r\nYou will understand Shakespeare, yourself, and the human condition. And also be a better writer. Also be sure to read the guides that Prof. Kastan posts on Canvas.",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS!! Prof Kastan is a wonderful man, super fun lecturer and very engaged with everyone taking the class even though it was a lecture. Made himself super available to students for help, or just to chat. You don't have to be an English major or even someone who likes Shakespeare because Kastan will make you enjoy it",
    "Yes! Especially to someone like me who never got familiar with Shakespeare's plays.",
    "Yes. Its a class everyone should take.",
    "I would not recommend this course... I was looking forward to taking it, after taking Shakespeare's Comedies and Romances, but I found this course to be less interesting and more frustrating when it came to logistical issues of grading, due dates, final exam, etc. If you have a strong interest in Shakespeare and take it cr\/d\/fail, then maybe you would enjoy it more than I did. If not, though, I would recommend picking a different class.",
    "Yes. Yes. Yes. You will like shakespeare a whole lot more if you take this course, and Prof Kastan will never cease to amaze every single lecture, no matter the book.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student  the lectures are so interesting and engaging, and the plays are so worth reading and thinking about.",
    "I would recommend this course first for the reading list. Simply put, no one should go through college without encountering Shakespeare, and Professor Kastan's course is the perfect place for this encounter to arise. The other reason that I would recommend this course involves Professor Kastan himself. His passionate, yet satirical, manner of speaking, his deep knowledge of the plays that we read, and his commitment to drawing out real ethical ideas from Shakespeare ensure that lecture is a joy to attend.",
    "SHAKESPEARE!! I hadn't read a lot of the plays before, and this course gave me a previously unknown appreciation of the complexities of Shakespeare's writing. As a Physics\/MCDB major, I didn't have a lot of experience with this type of English course, and I really enjoyed it. I learned to write interesting literary papers, something I'd never done before. You gain an understanding of just how incredibly cool and complex Shakespeare is - I wrote a 10+ page essay examining one 6 line passage, and thoroughly enjoyed myself. You will too, if you take this course. Plus, the reading responses are interesting and not like a typical english course. It's roughly a play a week, and while you don't have to read all of them you probably should anyways. The final was three hours and pretty intense, but not unenjoyable. Make sure you understand your quote ID's!",
    "If you want to read a lot of Shakespeare but not get super in-depth into any particular play, this is the class for you. Kastan introduces in an interesting way of reading Shakespeare in general, but you're not gonna get super into any play, unless you write an essay on it. \r\n\r\nThe final exam has IDs, etc. and is tough."
