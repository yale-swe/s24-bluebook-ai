                "I learned about Latin Americas economic history, how the region has failed to live up to its potential and possible explanations on why that is",
                "This course provided a solid background in the economic history of Latin America. We took a deep look into development traps facing the region and delved into Latin America's convergence failure. It was interesting to look at case studies to compare and contrast the experiences of different Latin American countries and place them in the broader arc of regional development.",
                "I developed a good sense of the economic history of Latin America, together with the complex development challenges that these countries currently face. Taking this course with Professor Zedillo, himself one of the major figures in Latin American history, was a great privilege. His insights, often based on firsthand experiences, were wise and nuanced. Even though I didn't always agree with his opinions, I always appreciated them.\r\n\r\nFor the last month of classes, Professor Zedillo invited an all-star cast of development scholars (mostly via zoom) to present and debate their recent research. These sessions were highly stimulating and exposed us to cutting-edge research on rule of law, inequality, growth, and drug trafficking in Latin America."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Zedillo is a former world leader and is brilliant. It is a privilege to learn from him and many times he tells his personal accounts of what is being thought in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there is not feedback in the class",
                "This course introduces students to a substantial portion of the literature on economic development in Latin America and students read most all the leading experts on the topic. Additionally, the professor brought in experienced guest speakers to talk on a variety of topics, including drugs and violence in Latin America, and the pervasiveness of weak rule of law. However, I think the course could have been organized better, especially purporting to be a seminar. There were few opportunities to speak in class or discuss and debate material from our readings, with the bulk of time being devoted to student-led presentations. With almost two hours of class time I think the course could be much improved by integrating time for student reactions, discussion, debate, etc., with a leading role played by the instructor.",
                "- Strengths: Professor Zedillo's commentary was the highlight of this course for me. I always got excited when he shared a personal anecdote or added nuance to a reading. The assigned readings were comprehensive and thought-provoking. A different set of students was assigned to present during each class, which allowed us to develop a deep understanding of those week's readings and practice our communication skills.\r\n- Weaknesses: I thought the amount of weekly reading (about 200 pages on average) was a bit excessive. In my opinion, we could have benefitted from more focused, shorter readings. The class format was heavily skewed towards student presentations; although Professor Zedillo would preface these presentations with a short lecture and frequently commented on presenters' points, I wish we got to hear more from him. I also wish there were more opportunities for one-on-one time with Professor Zedillo, but I understand that he has an extremely busy schedule."

                "Yes, learned a ton regarding Latin American economics and developmental economics",
                "I would recommend this course to students that want to learn about the economic history of development in Latin America. However, it would likely be more suited to students who are strongly self-motivated to learn on their own and don't mind that the course doesn't allow for many opportunities for discussion. The professor himself was great and often pushed back on students' presentations and brought interesting evidence and personal experience to the topics covered by the course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this to anyone interested in Latin American history, development economics, or political science. Learning from a former president of Mexico is probably one of the most unique academic experiences at Yale."
