                "This. Purse is literally perfect",
                "I thought the way the course was taught was reasonable, but I believe that their grading methods are a bit flawed (when it comes to showing work). I believe that if a student gets the correct answer to a question without showing parts of their work, they should not be penalized. However, if they get the question wrong without showing their work, then the grader has the right to take off as many points as they seem fit. I believe this to be a fair tradeoff.",
                "taught very well by John hall. Extremely structured. Honestly have no improvements for the class.",
                "The material is structured in a way that gradually builds upon earlier knowledge, so if you keep up with the material being taught you should not feel completely lost when new topics are introduced. The course covers a good amount of material over a short period, so you need to review key concepts in your own time.",
                "super interesting (pro), super fast pace (con)",
                "Smaller sized sections helped a lot with learning because it felt more comfortable to ask questions and easier to follow along. Sometimes it felt as if teaching varied a little between sections so that when working with students from other sections, it would be hard to know how they were taught a subject or if they were on the same lesson as you, which could make working together on psets more difficult.",
                "I believe the online videos and textbook\r\nreadings are excellent aids in the course.\r\nSometimes classes were very similar to videos,\r\nwith quite a bit of overlap. Though problem\r\nsets were definitely beneficial, I felt sometimes\r\nthey had too many problems focused on the\r\nexact same material and demanded too much\r\ntime to complete thoroughly. Midterms were an appropriate level of difficulty, though the\r\nsecond midterm makeup (which I took) seemed significantly more difficult than the original second midterm.",
                "I personally found this course to be extremely poorly paced. While the content in the beginning was relatively light and easy to understand, as the course progressed, the content became increasingly difficult with fewer time to digest it. I also wish we had spent more time in understanding how different topics might relate to one another. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I found that if one did poorly on one examination, this might negatively impact their whole grade throughout the semester - given that this course is often an introductory math sequence course for first years, I would have hoped for some more leeway while adjusting to Yale.",
                "Wish homeworks and in class content were closer to each other in terms of time (we did homework on stuff we learned two or three weeks before). Also the homework questions were just too time consuming without teaching or reinforcing important concepts",
                "I appreciated the access to pre-class videos and the practice problems in class. I felt that this structure, with psets, gave me enough opportunity to understand and apply the topics. I was well-prepared for exams.",
                "I think this course was done very well, and that the student interaction and lectures by Professor Hall were really good. The only significant thing that I would change would be having no psets due the week of a midterm.",
                "Class time was used to reinforce material learned before class with the expectation that pre-class work had been completed. I feel that it should be the other way around for a class like multivariable calculus. Though it makes sense to have students have some background before heading into the classroom (so the pre-class work is useful in that way), it should not be the entire foundation of the course.",
                "The content material was well spread out, but I wished the lectures could be recorded.",
                "The course is well structured and communicates information well. It can sometimes be easy to fall behind with all the reading before every class but that feels like a personal issue that the teaching team is not responsible for. Overall, the course is very strong in giving a thorough understanding of the ideas it teaches and allowing students to be curious. I cant point out any significant weaknesses."

I personally am probably not interested in pursuing math further at Yale, and felt the workload of the course added significant stress to my semester without the joy that courses in my preferred topics provide. For a student looking to fulfill a math credit, I would recommend the class as long as they are willing to put in the effort to understand the material. Given the choice now, I would probably choose to take the course again, though the time commitment and stress would give me pause.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they a) have already taken multivariable calculus outside of Yale or 2) are considering majoring in math, physics, or engineering. As someone who was learning the content of the course for the first time, I found myself at a great disadvantage as a lot of my peers already had a preliminary understand of the content. Additionally, as someone considering the pre-med track, I found that this course did not align with my interests.",

However, I thought it was done very well, and was formatted in a way that was both interesting and fairly easy to understand if you put the work into it.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student that does not intend to pursue a major in mathematics. This is not the same as high school math and it requires a lot of analytical and critical thinking skills that go above and beyond what is taught in the classroom. (in other words the class doesn't teach you how to think in order to solve a problem, which is what you need to complete the problem sets).",
