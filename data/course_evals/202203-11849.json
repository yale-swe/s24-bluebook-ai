But that's about it, and under no circumstances would I recommend taking this course. Professor Broach is a very sweet woman, but incredibly unqualified to teach this class or anything else like it. She's a children's book author, which is cool, but she seemed to think that qualified her to teach 21-year-olds how to process and write about their own intensely personal, vulnerable childhood wounds -- it did not. In class discussions about the readings, it was evident that she hadn't put any time or care into learning about how to teach traumatic content like this, and she treated the material in a manner disrespectful both to the author and to the students -- her asking the class whether a nonfiction rape scene was described \"compellingly enough\" or whether an author's father's suicide method was \"on brand\" for his character (this was a real life human being in a memoir) were particular highlights. Despite receiving feedback about this issue, she never made a change. Class was a bizarre mix of simultaneously understimulating and triggering -- the first half of class would be a wildly elementary discussion of basic writing concepts that was mind-numbingly dull (picture a chalkboard with a pros and cons list of the personal essay as a form) and then the second half would be this deeply insensitive discussion of the reading that made it clear she thought the goal of anyone writing publicly about the most painful, traumatic moments of their lives was to make it as entertaining as possible for an audience. *Much* better classes about this topic exist at Yale, like Briallen Hopper's \"Writing About Family\" summer course -- please trust me and don't take this class."
