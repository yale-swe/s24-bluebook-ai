                "This course was absolutely phenomenal. The selected books were truly extraordinary, spanning many different Middle Eastern countries and research focuses. Among many other topics, we discussed recurring themes surrounding family and relationships, varying sociopolitical dynamics and notions of both identity and statehood. Much of the work was deeply moving, provoking larger conversations surrounding imperialism and indigenous sociopolitical movements in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nThis course teaches you to be productively critical of anthropologists' methodology, fieldwork and findings. We discussed -- at length -- the strengths and weaknesses of varying research strategies and settings.\r\n\r\nThis course further developed both my critical thinking and my writing skills in the context of ethnographic studies.",
                "I developed my close reading skills, understanding of the Middle East, and ability to compare and contrast texts.",
                "This course taught me how to readlike ACTUALLY read, with my brain firing on multiple cylinders, clocking both content and methodology, and learning to see what was under the text on the page.",
                "I learned how to read ethnographies, critically understand the viewpoints of anthropologists and how to comment on their works, and I learned a lot about the modern Middle East. Especially about their complicated social structures, the relationship between organizations/governments and individuals, and about activism in the Middle East from people and groups of various demographics. As a Computer Science student, I didn't think I'd learn as much, having like zero experience with ethnographies -- but I really enjoyed it!",
                "I learned to think about the intersection of state authority and personal identity and where they clash or mesh",
                "Diverse social/political/economic/cultural issues related to a wide range of countries/regions in the Middle East, which I would not have learnt had I not taken this course. In addition, through the course, I was able to learn how to profoundly engage with ethnographic materials/concepts, how to facilitate discussion on these materials by crearing a set of good questions, and how to write book reviews that condense the key points, strengths, and weaknesses of each material. Seminars in each weak was literally \"academic discussions.\""

                "Strengths: I can't speak highly enough of the selected books for this course -- truly excellent. For the most part, they are books that I think most people around the world must read. The book reviews are a really valuable (yet challenging!) exercise that all Yale students should learn how to do effectively. Also, Professor Inhorn is simply brilliant.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "I don't think there are any weaknesses with the course. Many of the strengths lie in the long seminars we have and the profound insight of Professor Inhorn and Dominic.",
                "A very well organized class. The scaffolding is thoughtful, the support is robust, and the expectations clear. If you have quibbles with the field of anthropology generally, this is not the place to raise them. Conversation on that subject isn't shut down, but it's not the main thrust of the course.",
                "The strength is really in the discussions -- the books were interesting on their own right, but discussing them with the other students, and especially with Marcia and Dominick, added so much to my understanding of the book. Plus, both of them working in the middle east for years added so much personal experience to each place and group of people we talked about. The only real weakness I can think of is that there isn't really a super smooth learning curve into reading ethnographies, but even though this class is intended not to be your first anthropology class (which it was for me), I learned how best to efficiently read the works we were given.",
                "This course was really great. My only concern is that it was so incredibly liberal/ progressive that there wasnt room for an opinion that didnt align with hard core liberal ideology",
                "The course allwed us to engage with the works of leading scholars/ethnographers, who delved into the mysteries of the lives of people in the Middle East in their own unique ways. We tend to too uncritically embrace stereotypes, biases, stigmas about the Middle East propagated by the West-leaning media, and the course, allowed us to challenge such stereotypes by learning the findings of leading scholars/ethnographers (including prof. Inhorn), appreciate the dignity, resilience, and humanity of people in the Middle East who manage to live in challenging situations. In addition, prof. Inhorn encouraged us to think about the positionality of both researchers and students/activists/mass media/general public in the West. Although we were encouraged to \"critically\" read each book, our discussion was not \"criticism for the sake of criticism,\" and we often were able to ponder what it means to learn about the Middle East as outsiders or readers in the US."

It's also a fantastic nuanced and thorough examination of many Middle Eastern countries. Any MMES major must (!!!!!) take this course.\r\nSeriously, take it. I can't recommend highly enough.",
                "I would recommend this course. It offers new perspectives on the Middle East and has changed my outlook on countries such as Iran and Turkey.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who's prepared to put in the work. You read a book a week, and you really do need to read itthe class runs on participation. Marcia knows how to offer background Information on the field of anthropology more broadly, which is especially helpful for students new to the field. Some general knowledge of Middle Eastern politics may be useful but isn't necessary provided you're down to do a little Googling. Also, not that this should sway you one way or another, but... Marcia baked for us every week.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Marcia, Dominick, and my fellow students created a wonderful environment to work in -- everyone brought their own skills and knowledge to the table and it was really cool to experience everyone's personal interpretations of what we read, and how it compared to my own personal view of what had happened in the book. I learned so much about the Middle East, about activism, and about life there! I'd highly recommend if you're even the least bit interested, or even if you're not -- the class was really well formulated and I gained a lot from what I put into the class.",
                "Yes. It hugely grew my knowledge base of virtually all things Middle East, from cultural to political matters.",
                "Yes definitely, even if you are completely new to anthropology or the Middle East, you should definitely take this course to get a glimpse of the real life challenges with which people in the Middle East are confronted with. Although the umbrella term \"Middle East\" might give an impression that the region is monolithic, this class will astonish you by disclosing how rich/diverse this region is, as well as what great resilience and ingenuity people in this region exert."
