                "I think trying to fit in three programming languages in one semester gives students a whiplash because we get no time to get used to one language before moving onto another",
                "Strengths: The course is very well structured and organized to facilitate learning. Dr. Bennett is a great professor, she covered topics in a way truly fit for beginners so that the material was understandable. Dr. Bennett was also very nice and made an effort to get to know us, as well as be understanding to students circumstances. There were also plenty of resources provided for to help like recorded lectures, sample codes, lecture slides, and peer tutor hours.",
                "It is very well structured.",
                "This was a well taught course, the expectations for learning were very clear as well as assignment instructions and help opportunities.",
                "The class covers a lot of material in a short time. Especially with C++. The biggest issue with the class is that office hours are often only staffed with one person so you end up waiting for an hour just to get 10 min of help which was not enjoyable",
                "Strengths are the structure of the class, and how readily available help is. The workload however is quite high, especially if you're a beginner.",
                "good class but a more involved lecture could be nice. office hour structure was weird",
                "psets are really helpful for learning and there are tons of office hrs",
                "I think that this course was very well structured. The help sessions were really stressful to get into during peak times, but other than that, the amount of support was great.",
                "The Professor is amazing ! Dr Bennet is great and I would recommend any class with her.\r\nThe MATLAB part of the course felt a bit rushed and tedious but all in all I have no major complaints.",
                "This is one of the most well-organized courses I have ever taken. The sheer number of drop-in office hours with Professor Bennett and the help sessions with the TAs and peer tutors are invaluable. As someone with no prior coding experience, I don't think I could have taken this class without that support, and I'm grateful for it. The optional small group discussion section was also helpful.",
                "Wile I really did like this course, the style of the exams is stressful and I feel that it doesn't do a good job of representing the programming skills of the students.",
                "This was a great course, extremely well organized, applicable, and lots of help available. Only weakness was that it is not as collaborative as other yale stem classes and all the office hours were on zoom which was annoying.",
                "This course was well taught, however, there weren't always enough ta's during office hours.",

                "better guidance on how to achieve maximum grade on psets",
                "The course slides are extremely helpful in addition to the sample codes. If you have any issues, they can easily be solves through one of those options or the regularly occurring office hours.",
                "Sometimes I found it difficult to focus in lectures, however, the slides and sample codes were my holy grail. Professor Bennett was extremely helpful in office hours as well. Overall, the course was very well organized and she really knew how to teach according to the students.",
                "Strengths: the teaching staff and everything to do with facilitating student learning. The feedback for every single assignment and exam was very clear and helpful. There was always somewhere to get help from and office hours were very productive. \r\nWeaknesses: workload.",
                "Amazing professor! Well-structured class and easy to follow!",
                "This course did very well at giving me clear feedback about how to get better at coding, and the homework always gave real world examples in how all of what we learn is useful.",

                "If you want to take a programming class go for it",

                "yes, its so well taught and prof beth anne bennett is the best",
                "I think that other coding classes would teach languages that are more applicable for everyday use, but as this course is required for many engineering majors, I recommend it for anybody in engineering, even if it isnt a requirement for ones specific discipline.",
                "Yes ! Especially if taught with Dr Bennett.",

                "I would recommend this course to other students pursuing a science or engineering degree because it gives you a good foundation in languages. While the problem sets and midterms were very challenging, it was possible to receive help very quickly.",
                "I would recommend this course as it is a great introduction to c and c++ with some basic skills taught in Matlab. It covers a wide base so you learn a lot. It is certainly easier with some prior experience however if you spend time on each problem set learning you will end up with a respectable grade regardless.",
                "Highly reccomend",
                "Yes. Great into to coding and Professor Bennett was a great professor.",
                "I would recommend if youre an engineer or want to learn applications of computer science.",
                "Definitely take this course if you want to learn C and C++.",
                "Yes! Programming skills are important in the real world, and even if not going into engineering or computer science, it's a fun course with an amazing teacher.",
