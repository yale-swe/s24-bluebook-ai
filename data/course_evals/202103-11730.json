                "Strengths: As a space for catharsis in the midst of the stress, difficulty, and often pain of writing a year-long senior essay, this course was incredibly successful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As a space for skill-building, the course didn't really provide me with any skills. It was mostly a space for emotional outpourings. Additionally, my biggest frustration with the EVST major is that the instructions for the B.S. thesis seem to be open-ended, but in reality the EVST department has clear expectations for the thesis. If the thesis does not meet those expectations, the department heads would rather force you to switch your track from the B.S. to the B.A. than adapt those INVISIBLE instructions. Is the entire difference between the BA and BS the differences in their senior essays? Or does the difference lie more in the classes that a student has taken? In my experience, it seems that the former is the truth of it, in which case the EVST department should make that clearer to students and should change the prerequisites for the B.S. degree.",
                "I feel like we shouldn't have to meet every week--it isn't always a helpful use of our time",
                "This course might be improved by making small groups that have more related topics (like, a lab science only group, an interview-based group, a climate group, something like that). \r\n\r\nmeeting at an earlier time would be cool.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is that I feel very supported and pushed to keep moving forward on my thesis. This will put me in a much better position than many students I know in different departments. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, the small-group meetings are helpful, but a lot of time was spent sharing out our work. Because everyone is working on very different projects, detailed sharing did not always seem necessary. I wonder if it would make more sense to alternate between weeks with more detailed sharing and weeks with open discussion, during which students can check in about what aspects of their projects are stuck / could use advising or collaboration."
