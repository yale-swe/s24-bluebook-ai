                "This course is a perfect way to engage in deep, intellectual conversations about important economic topics of a wide variety. Professor is such an intelligent and unique mind so engaging with him in this style of a course really gets you thinking deeply.",

Insights include generally having a better understanding of the complex forces at work and understanding things in a deeper way than introductory or even intermediate macro would get you. Also, lots of great people to meet in the course of the class.",
                "Applied macroeconomics! This course was basically one huge conversation about what's going on in the world and how economists study the events of the world. We talked about anything and everything since economics is intertwined in so much all around us."

More of a discussion would have been appreciated. Otherwise, this course might as well have just been a lecture.",
                "It is a discussion based class, and the course content builds on the professor's and everyone else's contributions. It is very engaging and interesting. Not much weaknesses.",
                "Strength: the format. The class felt like a discussion on interesting economics topics (and beyond), which I totally enjoyed!",
                "The strengths are Professor Tsyvinski and his facilitation of discussion and pushing everyone to participate without feeling singled out or humiliated for getting an answer wrong. Its also the professors ability to really push our thinking beyond the strict theory related to a topic. \r\n\r\nOne thing that some may consider a weakness that I personally did not find to be a weakness is that the course assignments were not extremely challenging and the course was not stressful.",
                "This course could maybe be improved by having more structure/some slides to follow, but in general flexibility was one of the great strengths and one of my favorite things about the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tsyvinski made sure to talk about timely topics so class was always interesting! I also appreciated that the assignments in the class were not overwhelming at all. There were just two paper assignments and we chose what we wanted to write about so it was interesting in that sense as well. Professor also encourages us to think about economics more philosophically, not just in terms of numbers. He tries to push us and the field of economics to think about marginalized people more as well as consider consequences on a more personal level instead of just the overarching \"we need to hurt some people for the greater good\" mindset. \r\nWeaknesses: Professor Tsyvinski frames things in a very quantitative sense which is helpful but not the whole story. We shouldn't always be considering the costs of things in terms of money -- that is a limited way of thinking. There are more qualitative costs to things as well and there are harmful systems in place that the field of economics perpetuates. Things aren't always conducive to numbers and I don't think this course, and economics in general, takes that into consideration enough."

Professor Tsyvinski makes the class approachable to people of all levels of knowledge of economics, and people from different fields of study could utilize their knowledge to contribute to the class.",
                "Absolutely. The course is very interesting and allows for cool and intellectual discussion while not being stressful at the same time. If you get in - definitely take it!",
                "Absolutely this is an especially good course for seniors or students who have taken many economics courses and are looking to be able to have deeper conversations with others who also have a good understanding of economics.",
                "Yes absolutely. I learned a lot in this seminar and classes are fun and engaging. Professor Tsyvinski is an amazing professor.",
                "Yes. I think you have an interest in global economy you should definitely take this course it's really fun and there's a lot to learn. Frankly, this class is also a lot less stressful than other ones which can allow you to learn the material at a rate which is good for you. It's also a great non-curved Econ credit.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students! I am in the ER&M major and still had a good time in this course as Professor Tsyvinski allowed all of us to bring our background knowledge and differing perspectives to class. There is not math involved in this course -- just talking -- and it's so enjoyable. It doesn't even feel like a course. It just feels like a group conversation every week. Professor Tsyvinski is so chill and so knowledgable about everything. He knows so much about ongoing and past economics research, always giving us interesting facts. He is also very understanding about our wellbeing. He always emphasizes that he doesn't want this course to be stressful for us, like other Yale courses are. He wants this course to be different and it is."
