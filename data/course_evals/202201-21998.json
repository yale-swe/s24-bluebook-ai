Given Della Rocca's somewhat distinctive emphasis on evaluating how explanatory demands, and failures to meet them, might undermine the coherence of philosophical theories, this course helped me better taxonomize theories in metaethics and action theory. I gained a fuller grasp on the significance of various internalist\/externalist divides, especially the internalist\/externalist divide in metaethics.",
                "Learned about some central issues involved in philosophy of action and metaethics through the lens of a couple of key questions: what is a reason, and what does is it to act for a reason?",
                "I learned a lot of philosophy of action and also ethics. Particularly, we examined notions of normativity that Micheal then proceeded to tear apart, which was actually pretty instructive.",

                "Not sure honestly. Perhaps a larger focus on undergraduate instruction. Often, graduate students would monopolize class discussion and ironically wouldn't have much meaningful stuff to contribute.",
                "This course was very programmatic, centered on defending Della Rocca's radical skepticism about the metaphysics allegedly undergirding experience. Although some students likely would not resonate with this approach, to me, this was one of the most attractive aspects of the course. Zeroing in on explanatory problems threatening theories in analytic metaethics and philosophy of action with an intensity most other courses in these fields would lack not only helped me better formulate my own views on subjects in these fields but also helped me taxonomize theories in terms of the problems they attempt to answer.",
                "It was cool to touch on so many different topics through the lens of a couple of specific questions (what is a reason, and what does is it to act for a reason?). It gave some stakes to a lot of these discussions, in the sense that it connected them to some overarching questions. The downside of the course was that, occasionally, these connections became a little obscured--I think it would have been better if it was made clear exactly how the topic we are currently talking about connects to the overarching questions. But I'm nitpicking, and this was overall a great class.",
                "The strengths were the Professor and the material was pretty interesting, especially when Micheal was explaining his own take about the topic. The weakness is it got repetitive at times because we were looking at the same issues just approached by different people.",
                "No weaknesses really. Classroom discussions were engaging. Office hours were helpful. Readings were useful.",
                "MDR is an incredible professor, and I learned so much from his instruction in and out of class. I think that the class is well-run, most of the time, and that the reading list was very informative.\r\nOne potential area of improvement is that certain students in the class tended to overrun the discussion a little bit; I think that it would be a bit more instructive to have a more moderated discourse at times.",
                "Many times, we would begin the session with a summary of either the text we had read that week or the main argumentative moves\/positions of the main views up until this point. I found this very helpful and ensured I remained engaged throughout the whole course, as I always knew where we were, where we came from, where we're probably going next, and where exactly a new position\/author starts and differs. I personally also found this very helpful as sometimes I can get lost in where we are in the overarching context, as a class progresses and sometimes gets lost in the weeds a little.\r\nHowever, I also found we spent almost every session doing this, and I think this slowed down the progression into the class material.\r\nSo I think this practice is very very helpful and necessary, and would still retain its effectiveness if done slightly less frequently (or moved through very quickly after ~2 more thorough reviews)."

                "Yes. MDR is awesome and helpful when you're trying to work out your ideas. Beware, though, that the class is pretty niche--you should have a real interest in the (Fairly abstract) topics discussed. If not, the various distinctions and arguments will become boring to you SO fast.",
                "Yes, Micheal Della Rocca is a fantastic Professor, so I would recommend taking any class with him. If you are more interested in applied ethics, this isnt for you. But, if youre more into meta ethics or want to talk about the theories themselves, this class is great. It made some difficult or abstract concepts accessible, and I definitely learned a lot in this course.",

                "I'd recommend categorically to all philosophy majors. May be inaccessible to others without philosophical background in ethics.",
                "I would -- MDR's teaching is excellent, the classes were incredibly instructive and the reading list\/discussion was very interesting. Especially recommended if you are interested in subjects of the sort.",
                "Yes, I would recommend mainly simply because the Professor has very good pedagogical practices."
