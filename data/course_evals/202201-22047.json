                "Though the material is definitely interesting, I think at times it was taught in a confusing manner. From the first few classes, we jumped right into the material without really going over basics of different cell types. I think this lack of foundation made the rest of the course difficult to understand. Some of the slideshows were also difficult to follow as they had many typos/were very wordy.",
                "- strengths: interesting material, I learned a lot\r\n- weaknesses: sometimes the slides in the presentations were a little busy",
                "Strengths: interdisciplinary subject matter. The visits to the med school and art museum, as well as the readings about history of diseases was fascinating. This does mean that the course isn't as tightly organized as if it was just learning the science, but that didn't matter too much to me. It is worth noting though that the course gets into much more detail in the science than the description implies.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures go by very fast especially for non-stem students who are trying to process a lot of unfamiliar technology. Given that there was usually time left over at the end of the class, I think going through the material more slowly would be helpful. The other weakness was the discussion session, particularly having students lead basically every session for the duration of it. Discussions were often surface-level and stilted: it was hard to get conversation going and sustain it for that long. The TAs were really incredible but since it was supposed to be student-led discussion we didn't get to hear from them as much as would have been helpful.",
                "strengths - very informative, covers a broad range of topics and information, very timely, appreciable information \r\nweaknesses - a bit dense/difficult to understand at times, a bit disorganized",
                "The lectures were very engaging and the professor is very nice",
                "Strengths: highly engaging, TAs/prof were really helpful and cared about the material\r\nWeaknesses: class moved really quickly sometimes, and it mightve been easier to understand the material had we had more time",
                "Prof. Kavathas is lovely! It was often far too technical for a non-STEM student like me.",
                "Strengths: Great content, good overview of the whole system and good attempts made at making all of it accessible to a non-STEM audience. Weaknesses: Lectures really were not that helpful and made it very difficult to get the material. Often way too fast, starting late and ending early. They were way too complex and very difficult to take notes on/understand comprehensively. Also the class went from being extremely biological to very social studies between the lectures and discussion sections, which was sometimes hard to catch up with. Also there was never any way to be graded on what we did in discussion sections, making it sometimes difficult to stay engaged. Overall a very good class, but a few challenges to having it be great.",
                "No weaknesses. Very well-thought structure, great organization and well-taught.",
                "The lectures go by really quickly and its easy to get lost.",
                "Being someone who took the course on account of it being a science credit yet not too complex in that field, I feel as though it delivered on that promise. I never felt as though it went too in depth into anything so as to convolute the topic, but everything was approached with enough detail so that nothing felt as though it was missing, and everything went together logically. The number of problem sets throughout the semester acted as good forms of periodic review without being overbearing or especially demanding form of work. I also thought that the readings were intriguing and pertinent to what we were learning, though I do feel as though, for the amount of reading we were doing some weeks, we failed to cover them in their entirety, making the effort put into them feel somewhat meaningless at some points. Perhaps more targeted readings would be better.",
                "Strengths include a variety of assessments (p-sets, presentation, exams, section participation), trips to the Yale Medical School and art museum, and engaging lecture topics.",
                "strengths: super broad and relevant concepts\r\nweaknesses: a little too in-depth and scientific to understand, too many words on slides, psets graded pretty harshly",
                "great class! sometimes lectures went a little fast, but lecture slides are posted and Professor Kavathas and the TAs were always available to explain something. PSETS also really helped with learning",
                "Lecture consists of just reading off of the slides, so if you are able to hold yourself accountable to reading and looking at the slides on your own I would just not go to class. Really liked that the class had a course booklet with everything that you needed to know and that we had access to it during the final exam.",
                "I think this course was a bit more science-y than I was expecting, which isn't necessarily an issue. However, I do think that it could be advertised a little differently. Also, the graders tend to be a bit harsher than I think is necessary. Again, this course is advertised as a science class for non-science majors, so the cruelty of the graders seems a bit over the top.",
                "The material of the course was extremely interesting.",
                "The organization of this class was very good. It started with general concepts first (eg lymphatic system and innate cells) before diving into specific case studies (coronaviruses, the flu, polio, AIDS, etc). Also, there was a  always historical lesson involved with each virus coupled with the more scientific lesson which really broadened my knowledge. \r\nI would say a weakness could be perhaps just the way concepts are written. The booklet with everything in it is a huge advantage but the style of writing may be confusing (sometimes the concepts explained, such as how viruses enter our cells, is explained with highly scientific vocabulary that theoretically we have discussed but in practice as mainly non-stem majors it has been still a little confusing). This could be improved through simply including a quick, simple explanation alongside the scientific explanation.",
                "As a non-STEM person, I think a huge strength of this course is how it integrates historical context and cultural works into our understanding of diseases. I also thought that it's well oriented towards teaching us about subjects that most people will likely encounter in the course of being in the world and wish they knew more about: HIV, the 1918 flu, HPV, cancer, immune disorders, and the mechanisms behind them. \r\n\r\nA challenge of this course was often figuring out what Prof. Kavathas and the TFs were looking for on psets and exams. The questions on both tended to be broad, without much indication of the level of detail needed to obtain full credit. I and other people in the class would often get marked off for something we thought we had answered in full detail, but it turns out the Prof/TFs were looking for something much more specific (that we wouldn't have been able to tell from the question). The grading felt hard to predict and I felt like the questions made it hard for me to fully express my understanding of the material.  I hope that this changes in future iterations of the course.",
                "Strengths: diversity topics covered, diversity of materials used (booklet, multiple books, articles, etc.), engaging lectures, helpful review sessions, super cool fieldtrips \r\nWeaknesses: office hours often not available between the time a problem set was released and when it was due, discussion sections only offered on one day which was somewhat of a scheduling strain for me personally",
                "Strengths: Professor Kavathas is THE BEST. The sweetest, kindest, fairest teacher. The entire course is very well-organized, with the curriculum revolving around a course packet that the professor wrote herself. This made expectations of knowledge for the exams so simple and clear, and it served as a great resource for PSETs and reinforcing lecture material. I also always found that the lectures flew by, unlike many other classes I take.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Weaknesses: lectures can be confusing at times, study guides etc. are not organized.\r\nStrengths: PSET and exam content is predictable but challenging, professor is clearly passionate, course content is interesting.",
                "Strengths: Paula was amazing both as a professor and a person in general. I can't stress this enough, she was awesome. \r\nWeakness: The class sometimes went into incredible detail about all the names of different proteins and subunits and occasionally it was hard to follow along/ know which molecules needed to be memorized.",
                "Good combination of science and historical/social contexts around infectious diseases, if you are interested in that! The lectures were focused on science, and in sections, the students took turns facilitating discussions on the books in the syllabus. A lot of readings - between lecture and discussion section, it sometimes feels like taking two light classes - but there is no penalty for not doing the readings for lecture, so you have some freedom to catch up on your own time. The problem sets are doable; I found the exams difficult, but the final is open-note, which takes some of the pressure off for memorization. I think prior knowledge of the subjects would help, but it is totally possible to take this class without much background. Prof. Kavathas is wonderful!",
                "I enjoyed the format of the course with the beginning forming a base of knowledge about the immune system at large then following up with case studies of specific diseases.",
                "Strengths: the readings were very interesting and the workload was manageable! Professor Kavathas is super kind and understanding"

                "If you like biology and have already done a lot of work in biology, this is an incredibly interesting course. Otherwise, I feel the sole prerequisite being high school biology is a bit misleading for the intellectual struggle of this class and can come as a shock to others as it did to myself",
                "Yes! It's a great science class for non-stem students because the material is so interesting and important to know in our pandemic times (with a very manageable workload). I would caution students that it does require you to engage with relatively detailed science -- this isn't entirely clear from the course description. I'm really glad I took the class and would definitely recommend it to anyone interested.",
                "Yes, I think having a baseline understanding of the human immune system and various pathologies is very beneficial, regardless of having an education in biology background or not.  This information has been very useful and beneficial to me.",

                "The class was really interesting and I learned a lot! Definitely was not a gut like I thought it would be - the pace is quick and theres a lot of memorization necessary. However, it was really engaging and I would recommend!",
                "This class isnt a gut. If you want to take on a challenge and learn something, go ahead! Prof. Kavathas is amazing.",
                "Yes as a good and very important class to take. However I would encourage them to be mindful of the challenge of self studying and also let them know their responsibility to stay up to date on the class and use resources outside the class period to make sure they really get an understanding of the material (external lectures/sources, office hours, etc.).",
                "Yes! Great course, very interesting approach to immunity and infectious diseases and makes you appreciate public health matters more.",
                "If you like biology, yes.",
                "Yes. For someone who took the class with no real interest of taking any real STEM-related courses in college, this class was perfect. It was enjoyable thanks to the TAs and professor Kavathas, and the material never seemed too overly complex for being advertised as a class for \"non-STEM majors.\" That being said, I think that anyone, STEM major or not, should take this class as it is all very pertinent to the current pandemic and the future with the possibility of reemerging and/or newly-emerging diseases.",
                "Yes! This class provides an interdisciplinary approach to immunology including scientific and historical facets.",
                "yeah, its a good science credit\r\nyou actually learn stuff and Paula is very sweet",
                "The class went into a little bit more detail than I thought it would, at times the explanations and lingo felt like it wasnt as accessible to non stem people as originally stated",
                "Absolutely! So interest and Professor Kavathas is the best! Really cares about her students!! Really wants everyone to learn and do their best",
                "I would recommend this class to everyone, no matter their affiliation with Yale. This is a vital class, especially considering current events, and a basic understanding of immunology and contagion is such an important part of being an educated citizen and consumer.",
                "Yes, but only if you have a strong background of biology. The course does teach fundamentals, but it moves at an extremely fast pace.",
                "To stem majors, no, because to them the course may be too simple/broad in its scope. However to non-stem majors who have a slight interest in microbiology, yes, I would recommend this course as while it is difficult in the moment in trying to understand and absorb the material, in the long term it is so interesting to look back and realize all that has been learned from the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to a non-STEM person looking for an approachable and relevant science credit (like myself)! I didn't feel like I breezed through all the material, but I got it well enough and it was about the time and effort that I wanted to put into a STEM class, with a subject that was decently interesting to me at first and gained more interest in going on.",
                "Definitely! I honk the course material is super engaging for a student of almost any discipline, but the information is also very relevant to better understanding the effect of epidemics and pandemics on society.",
                "12/10 recommend. Took this class for my science credit and it ended up becoming my favorite class of the year. Professor Kavathas is so cute, sweet and kind, and really cares about her students. So fair with her exam and general grading expectations. The class material itself was really interesting and, as someone with family members who have autoimmune illnesses, I have such an appreciation for the understanding I've developed. A great class",

                "Yes! A relevant topic, always.",
                "I would recommend it if you need another science credit or if you are very interested in the immune system. The workload was not too terrible as there were psets every other week and two exams plus a 10-minute presentation. At times there was a lot of information to know but the grading is not very harsh and studying for the exams several days before pays dividends.",
                "Yes, Prof. Kavathas and the TFs were amazing, super helpful, and worked to make the class accessible to non-STEM majors. The class has two field trips, which are both casual and interesting, one to the Yale Art Gallery and one to the Med School. Go to lectures, make friends, study together, and you'll be fine.",
