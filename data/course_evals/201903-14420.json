    "I learned about quantitative methods in studying gender in politics",
    "Was a great leminar style course that really dove into different aspects of gender inequality. The final paper was also really helpful in teaching us how to use large datasets and tests theories.",
    "I learned a lot about the nuisances of gender inequality and also improved my critical thinking and writing skills through different assignments.",
    "This course helped me develop greater sensitivity to the issue of gender inequality, especially with more factual awareness behind it.",
    "Developed a toolkit for looking at issues of Gender Inequality in a comparative context"

   "comments": [
    "Prof Khan is really smart and helpful. I did not enjoy walking through the articles we had already read.",
    "Professor Khan is so organized and clear in her teaching. The course is structured wonderfully and is really conducive to learning. It incorporates a lot of different types of literature that helps make it manageable. It would be nice to see additional courses that explore similar questions but in regions other than South Asia to help broaden our learnings.",
    "The readings were interesting for the most part but I think a few of them were a little repetitive. Also, some classes it felt like the class didn't need to be over an hour long because most of the material in each class time could've been covered in less time.",
    "The strengths of this course include a range of assignments including discussion responses, a book review, and a research paper w\/ quantitative analysis that allowed you to explore different forms of writing and research. Additionally, the readings were always interesting and came from various fields including anthropology, economics, and political science. While I enjoyed the heavy focus on South Asia, more readings or discussions to contextualize our learnings in other parts of the world would be beneficial. Additionally, some preliminary help or resources would be great for understanding quantitative analysis.",
    "Strengths - the discussion form of lectures was very interactive as well as the use of media throughout the curriculum made the course relatable and engaging\r\n\r\nWeakness - none",
    "Very difficult course - many of the readings felt inaccessible and dense - and grading was somewhat unforgiving - content really drove the positive attributes of the course however"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially students looking for an introduction to studying gender quantitatively",
    "Yes! Professor Khan is just lovely and cares so much about her students. Most of all, she's approachable which makes the entire course so much more fun.",
    "Yes, Professor Khan is awesome and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, it is important to understand how gender inequality manifests through various formats and this course was very conducive to showing this through various readings, media, and policy\/court briefs.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It was an enriching experience throughout the course to relate everyday happenings with respect to gender inequality with the structures of political economy.",
    "I would to a junior or senior but not to an underclassman",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE!!! I hesitated taking this course at first because the course focuses on South Asia and I knew nothing about the region--most polisci and WGSS courses I took at Yale before focused on the US with maybe a few readings from Western Europe. My worries were quickly assuaged because Prof Khan was great about supplementing the readings with lectures, articles, and videos, so even students with no background in the region could learn a lot out of class. Even if you are not necessarily passionate about gender inequality in India or Pakistan, this course will offer you valuable perspective on the economic\/political\/cultural roots of gender inequality, esp. in the context of developing countries--which is so important, especially if you have only ever learned about gender inequality and women's movements in the context of the Euro-American world. Prof Khan is an amazingly eloquent and engaging lecturer and provides a lot of help and feedback to students with the assignments. Speaking of assignments, all of the assignments in class (a book review and a final paper, which is like a mini original research) are very well designed and will enhance your learning rather than be just another paper to write."
