                "Classical Arabic grammar and syntax. By the end of the semester, you'll be reading a few surahs from the Qur'an.",
                "I learned how to conjugate sound verbs and irregular verbs, read Classical Arabic text, and a multitude of different grammar rules. I am now able to read the Quran with a little bit more understanding, as I am now more aware of the grammar rules and such.",

                "A major weakness was the heavy reliance on the textbook",
                "Lots of involvement from the students however the book was difficult to understand so I hope that thered be a more concise book",
                "The course had a strong emphasis on grammar, but we also practiced reading aloud. Sometimes we looked a hadith or a modified sura in addition. I appreciated the time we took on the grammatical elements of the language. I can't really think of any way to improve the course, though Thackston can be a bit dense.",
                "Miguel is an amazing instructor. He is both incredibly knowledgeable and very patient. I appreciated how available he made himself for office hours. Learned a lot in a very supportive environment.",
                "My strengths included participating in class, asking questions when I did not understand something, and picking up on the grammar rules and conjugation patterns. My weaknesses included not being able to memorize vocal efficiently enough and store it in my long-term memory as well as struggling to read and understand the textbook for the class.",
                "The information and grammar we learned was very useful and I found it very interesting. The book, however, was extremely difficult to learn from. In the future, this course should use a different book.",
                "I liked the pacing of the class towards the end and appreciated that the instructor's focus was on the students' improvement and not on a letter grade. However, I wish there was more transparency in regards to grading and that the class didn't hinge on the fact that students were already exposed to certain grammatical terms. Most of us taking this course had never taken a formal grammar class and a lot of the terms were brand new, but it was expected of us to already know and memorize it which hindered our learning later on."

                "Arabic is a beautiful language, so if you want to really understand its grammar, then you'll want to take this class. Take it with Miguel if you can--he always gave great insights that went beyond the textbook we used.",
                "I would recommend this class to a student who already has previous knowledge of old language and has experience reading complicated textbooks that were not written for someone just beginning Classical Arabic. As I was not one of these students, I struggled a lot with grasping the main, important concepts for some time.",
                "Yes if you would like to learn how to read classical texts like the Quran with a better intuition of how to translate and understand the text.",
                "I would recommend this class if you have a lot of time in your schedule to study the material outside of class. A lot of the content you really need to put time and effort into outside of class to fully grasp it."
