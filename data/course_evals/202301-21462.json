                "This class was a really fascinating dive into the origins and current status of the \"Culture Wars\" in the US right now. We analyzed where these issues have come from, various definitions of \"the Culture Wars\", and how they are playing out right now.",
                "I gained an incredible amount of knowledge in the way that different cultures have been pitted against each other throughout history. Through this I have been able to notice trends in behaviors that correspond to the framework provide, and have provided me with the vocabulary to be able to address these when I see them.",
                "This class truly exercised my ability to think critically about the political and historical roots of how society works today. Coming away from the course, I feel like I have learned to interpret large bodies of material in order to piece together a somewhat cohesive narrative of what is going on with the Culture Wars. I also feel much more comfortable with seminar-style discussions, and I feel very comfortable with giving presentations/public speaking.",
                "This course taught me how to critically and genuinely dissect the arguments, rhetoric and strategies used by those we disagree with in a meaningful way, rather than quickly dismissing or strawman-ing them as I think we often tend to do. I left this course with a much greater and more critical understanding of exactly what the culture wars were (something for which there is no one right answer), what people were fighting for and why, and how we ended up in our present day situation. The course taught me to meaningfully and constructively engage with the arguments of those I very passionately disagree with in a way that I think most other courses do not. The course also provided me with theoretical knowledge as well as actual substantive knowledge that has given me a better understanding of both what is happening and how to interpret it.",
                "This course somehow simultaneously made me feel more informed, more terrified, and more optimistic about the future. Take this course !!! TZB is the best professor anyone could ask for and the content is relevant and fascinating."

                "I loved this class so much! We dealt with really emotionally heavy and currently relevant content but were able to form a strong community. TZB is absolutely amazing and helped make me feel seen and pushed me to dive deeper into the content.",
                "The strength is absolutely the professor. Anyone can teach a course on conflicting cultures, but only TZB makes it the Culture Wars. TZB was able to provide incredibly engaging commentary while keeping the students immersed and contributing regularly. No weaknesses.",
                "I thought that the structure of this course was incredibly conducive to student learning and success. Each week, a different group put together a presentation on the class materials. Not only did this facilitate excellent discussion, but it also created an opportunity for students to practice productive teaching habits. I can't really think of any weaknesses other than that the material itself was very heavy and at times emotionally challenging to read. Nonetheless, I loved this course.",
                "Strengths: TZB is, without a doubt, the primary strength of this course. She is incredibly skilled at both ensuring that our discussions remain student-led and helping to guide the conversation as needed to ensure that we go beyond a superficial analysis of the issues at hand. The course is challenging while still being manageable in its workload, and, despite it often being difficult to talk about certain topics, TZBboth in the way she had designed the course and the way she runs the seminardoes a really great job of ensuring that we are able to talk about and thoroughly discuss very difficult topics in a way that does not totally drain us or leave us feeling helpless. The course is also designed very well, in that we begin with theories of the culture wars and then progress to specific subcomponents; it flows in a way that is logical and allows each week to build upon the other. The assignments and final encourage and require actual critical engagement with the material rather a simple regurgitation of what we have already learned. Finally, the course includes and centers the perspectives of real-life people on the front-lines of the culture wars via several panels throughout the semester; this allows one to actually understand and see the ways in which these issues are manifesting in real life and to hear from voices beyond those of the syllabus (which, by the way, was full of phenomenal and insightful readings and podcasts as well as sources that we critically analyzed in our discussion rather than blindly accepting). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are no weaknesses that I can think of. Readings can sometimes be dense, but are very manageable and are always discussed and explained in class to ensure that we understand. Sometimes the class presentations run over time, leaving less time for group-wide discussion, but this isn't something I would change as I think student-led discussions were so crucial to better understanding and engaging with the material,  building a supportive seminar community, and getting past a superficial analysis of the issues we were talking about.",
                "The course is structured in a really wonderful way  you get a solid understanding of both the current state of affairs (re culture wars) and also the context (how/why did we get here?). We had great classroom discussions/presentations and awesome guest speakers."

                "Absolutely! Everyone who can should take a class with TZB and especially this course (given our current struggles, we need as many people as possible to be thinking about what is happening and what we need to do).",
                "Absolutely. Take any class with TZB that you can. You absolutely won't regret it.",
                "Yes, great/interesting content, community, and professor!!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student, regardless if you are ed studies/in an affiliated department. It is especially informative for future educators to think about how we ended up in the education landscape we have today (and to begin to think through ideas about what we can do for the future), but I feel like everyone benefits from being knowledgable about the culture wars because it really permeates every aspect of American life.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The Culture Wars are incredibly relevant and impact our lives in more ways than we often know. As someone who is interested in going into education, this class gave me a necessary framework through which to interpret some of the most pertinent political issues impacting schools in America today.",
                "Yes! I 100% recommend this course if the topic even slightly interests you. This course has left me feeling challenged and with a completely new perspective on the culture wars that has totally shifted my understanding of these issues. The course is incredibly engaging and is challenging yet still manageable. TZB's ability to lead a seminar and support learning and critical engagement with difficult issues is unparalleled (speaking from my experience as a senior who has taken many, many seminars).",
                "YES!!! It was probably the best seminar Ive taken at Yale.",
                "For sure! tzb is an amazing prof and their class made me feel connected to the Education Studies community at Yale, made me aware of the threats facing public education, and introduced me to new friends."
