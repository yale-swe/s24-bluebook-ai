                "Strength: breadth and depth of the material, splendid syllabus, great discussions, freedom to write a 25-page paper at the end. Not a weakness per se, but this class demands a lot of work in order to get something tangible out of it.",
                "Strengths: I think the syllabus and Professor Shapiro's breadth and depth of knowledge on a range of historical and political issues made this course one of a kind. The cross-listed nature of the course also attracted an interesting cohort of students that made discussion challenging and worthwhile, from law students and PhD students and undergraduates of various majors. The readings were heavy (especially Habermas) but well chosen. \r\nWeaknesses: Discussion was sometimes difficult to keep going but that is likely a product of the unavoidable online format. Also, the course could have benefited from a more diverse syllabus, which is a problem less specific to this course and more a product of political philosophy in general."

                "This was not a normal semester, and Professor Shapiro seemed to understand that. The break at the halfway point in the seminar was an excellent idea that I hope other professors will adopt, and the class environment on Zoom seemed both relaxed and fairly organized. At the same time, this course was a lot of work - especially the weekly responses. They eventually ended up being helpful in the final paper, though, so not necessarily a drawback. This is good advice for all professors during COVID, but I think just having a sentence of acknowledgment on the syllabus about recognizing the difficult circumstances and doing what's possible to maintain an engaged and enjoyable class environment is always a plus."

                "Yes, but be aware that this class has a higher workload than the vast majority of political science classes at Yale. The class also demands a strong background in political theory -- i.e. beyond DS and intro-classes -- to be enjoyed fully; some background in philosophy of science is also useful, but not needed. \r\n\r\nFor those who have the background and are ready to put in the work, this is one of the very best political theory seminars at Yale -- and a must-take if you want to go to grad school.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone willing to do heavy lifting in political philosophy. The syllabus is a fantastic deep-dive into 20th-century political theory in particular, and left no stone unturned - in that respect, it felt a bit like a survey course, but in far more depth than any other political theory course that I've taken. This seems to be one of the only courses for Yale undergraduates that seems to cover legal theory (eg Ronald Dworkin) so if that interests you, take it. I also really enjoyed the wide-ranging perspectives that students from diverse backgrounds - law students, PhD students and undergraduates of various majors - and how they enriched our weekly conversations. By the end, the connections across weekly themes somehow made deep sense."
