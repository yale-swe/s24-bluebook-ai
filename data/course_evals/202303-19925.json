            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Cleary. The syllabus. The Canvas posts. The size (only 9 students). \r\n\r\nThoughts: W4, I think The Reality Effect deserves dedicated seminar time. W8, I am not sure Brooks fits into the week well. W12, the readings were difficult and may have been aided by previous reading of The Historical Novel earlier in the course.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- The canvas responses were invaluable to enabling us to realise our thoughts - sometimes the texts are so long there is no way you would remember the material for the next week without writing out the key points. Being 'forced' to talk about our engagement with the works was super helpful\r\n- The collaborative responses\/presentations made us close as a class, and this definitely manifested itself in the second half of the semester - I really loved our group \r\n- The material is soooo interesting and there are parallels to literally every English class (maybe not Old English classes but all the modern ones at least! In other classes I constantly found myself referencing this one)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- There are none! Just be prepared that the reading is a lot of work!",
                "The variety and depth of the readings felt very satisfying. Professor Cleary is very kind and knowledgeable, and a great seminar leader. I would have appreciated a smaller essay early in the semester to trial discussing literature in relation to theory, given that for many in the class, it may have been our first time doing so.",
                "This was a truly exceptional course, I hope that it is offered again and that more classes like it (classes more oriented around literary criticism\/theory than close reading) are offered at the undergraduate level in the future!\r\n\r\nThe original syllabus seemed more tightly organized around Wurthering Heights, Heart of Darkness, and in general 19th century literature than reflective of our overall discussion. The weeks with Wurthering Heights\/Heart of Darkness were a ton of reading and I wasn't able to keep up\/read them as closely as I might in a course on 19th century literature. I don't want to say that this course shouldn't have central books - I think it was really valuable at times to have common touch stones, but I ultimately think the course would do fine without them. Maybe just one additional novel which would engage a lot of weeks (both Wurthering heights\/Heart of darkness alone would do this very well, but I'd also love to see \"to the lighthouse\"!), instead of two?\r\n\r\nOne thing which this course did really well was create a rich discussion about lots of different novels that the class hadn't necessarily all read together. Some people had read romance, some people had done DS, some people liked sci-fi, some people didn't, and so on - this didn't bog the class down, quite the opposite - it forced the students to learn how to gloss books quickly and accessibly to add to the theoretical discussion. I think as a class we got dramatically better at this as the semester went on. It's a really, really useful\/important skill that I don't think I've gotten to practice in really any other undergraduate course. \r\n\r\nI think in the last few weeks we got a little broad, jumping from one genre to the next, and the course felt more like a survey. It counterbalanced very nicely with the theoretical rigor of the first half of the course. This survey approached worked well in some weeks, and less well in others - I wonder if in future iterations of the course the end of the course could be a little more thematically\/temporally cohesive? There's so many ways to do this, I don't have any one idea in particular. This could be one way of thematically grouping those survey weeks - e.g., answering one of the questions 1) what is the state of the form of the novel today, as seen in all these different genres, 2) what is the material\/political life of the novel today, etc.\r\n\r\nI would also love to have some more literature \/ maybe a whole week on the publishing industry over time? \/ slightly more Marxism, the commodity of the novel (Adorno, more Jameson, more Moretti etc.). I would also love a week on climate fiction! These are all personal preferences - this would be a lot, but it would be cool to have some built in flexibility to the syllabus in the final weeks and build around the students' interests",
                "The material in this class is so fascinating and Professor Cleary is wonderful as a facilitator. The discussions began flowing more later into the semester, and those were delightful too. The class's major weakness is the weakness of the subject matter and the theoretical work that we readno one seems to quite have read the same novels! I think instead of reading Heart of Darkness and Wuthering Heights, which were great but didn't do a whole lot in the curriculum, the first ~3 weeks should be dedicated to reading, say, parts of Don Quixote\/Gargantua and Pantagruel\/Fanny Burney\/Daniel Defoe\/Samuel Richardson or some such assortment, and having students try to answer the question: what is the novel? based on these readings before launching into more theory. This would mean cutting some of the theory at the end of the course about specific genres, but the trade-off is worth it."

                "Yes. This class was very heavy on reading and analysis, which may be overwhelming to people who are not familiar with the kind of reading on the syllabus. However, if you decide to commit to doing the reading, it becomes really fun and interesting, especially as the semester progresses and everyone becomes more comfortable. This was not the easiest class that I have ever taken but I feel like I am a better critical reader and my understanding of the texts I engaged with has been expanded tremendously.",
                "Try to take the course if you have the opportunity. Theory can be incredibly difficult, but this is a rare offering at Yale, and the work is incredibly rewarding.",
                "This class is amazing. I came into it very hesitant as English and Comp Lit classes I had taken had only ever touched on theory for a week or two. The first few seminars were very challenging and the readings took hours and hours, but it was so worth it to finally 'get it' when we discussed them in class. Everyone in the seminar had their own niche and enjoyed different seminars more - feminist, queer, the spy novel etc. The fact that we covered different genres and angles of literary criticism also kept the class refreshing. By the end, I was much more confident reading dense literary criticism. Also, I learnt how to pace, write and research a 25 page research paper on a topic that fascinated me. Wuthering Heights and Heart of Darkness were great novels to read alongside the texts, but I'm sure Prof Cleary could also find others that would work well - it was grounding to have texts to keep coming back to. Overall - TAKE THIS CLASS - it will transform you as an English student!!!!!",
                "If you are interested in theory at all, then definitely. It deepened my understanding of many of the texts we study at the university level, and applied a level of critical thinking to our study of these texts that I appreciated. Professor Cleary is a great seminar leader who will ensure you stay engaged in the discussion.",
                "Would absolutely recommend this course. But if you're going to take it, you really have to commit, or else you won't gain from it and you won't enjoy it. This is a class where you actually need to do the readings.\r\n\r\nIt was probably (definitely) the most demanding course I've taken at Yale, but it was also perhaps the most rewarding. I seriously loved it---the whole class did.\r\n\r\nAnd Professor Cleary is amazing. If youre considering taking this course because you want to take something with him, thats reason enough.",
                "Yes absolutely! This was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. If you love prose \/ novels, a must take!\r\n\r\nBe prepared for a lot of work! This is effectively a graduate course (120-200 pages\/week of dense theory, long (300,400+ word) weekly responses, 20-25 page final paper). It is more than worth it!",
                "Absolutely! If you're ready to do the reading carefully every week and are interested in literary theory, it will really be worth your while. Joe is very warm and knowledgeable and, critically, knows how to keep the conversation moving."
