                "There is a lot to cover in this topic so its not surprising that there is a lot we still dont know. I think this class could be better as a lecture, though, just because there is so much to cover that I feel like Im still catching up to learn.",
                "Strengths- Prof. Sussman definitely cares about students and is very understanding of challenges faced during the pandemic.  She also provides EXCELLENT and very thoughtful feedback on all assignments, which is greatly appreciated.  She does a very good job of laying out what she expects from you in each assignment and structuring the course in a way that spreads out the work across the semester, which is very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- The course structure was spread out across many platforms, which could be confusing at times.  We had a course website, our normal Canvas page, Edmodo, Padlet, Sutori, regular email announcements, and more.  It became confusing at times when trying to remember where to submit an assignment when we used so many different platforms.  It was also difficult to keep track of announcements and easy to miss one when they came across different modes of contact.  \r\n\r\nProf. Sussman was receptive to student feedback on the format, and condensed it a bit during the semester, but I think a restructuring would be greatly beneficial in the future.",
                "Professor Sussman cultivated such a positive and constructive learning environment. It was a joy to attend class and discuss the readings with people who truly cared about the subject matter. I would not say this is a weakness, but the workload is rather high. There are many assignments to do each week  (especially many small written assignments-- there were at least 2 a week, sometimes more), and while this helped students stay engaged, it was difficult to keep track of what there was to do. This was ameliorated later in the semester. I wish we got feedback on assignments sooner, in some cases.",
                "The strengths were that the course was built to encourage student learning. The final was broken up into many manageable steps. The contract for an A- created a stress-free environment. The small group discussions were an effective way to understand and reflect on the readings. The weaknesses were that there was often too much reading to allow for everyone to discuss a concept or event in depth. Also, there were too many small assignments during the week.",
                "The course material is really interesting and relevant, but sometimes the reading was too heavy and it was a bit difficult to keep track of all the different learning platforms we used.",
                "Overly ambitious yet lacked much cohesion."

                "Naomi did a great job accommodating students and student learning in this class! I appreciated the shortened seminar and varied options for the final assignment.\r\n\r\nOne thing I found difficult was how much mental commitment I had to give to the class across the week, between scheduling meetings every week for the small groups, to the small assignments that only opened on Friday, to waiting for certain lectures to be uploaded. Spacing out the classroom work made it so I was doing work for the class almost every day of the week for a semester that met once a week. I felt that there was never an extended amount of time to mentally step away from the class.",
                "The small group discussions were successful because it allowed for us to connect with peers and shortened the length of the seminar. I think that the number of small assignments in a week could've been reduced.",
                "I really liked how the seminar was shortened to one hour and that that it was substituted with the weekly small group discussion each week. This format helped me to talk about the material thoroughly throughout the week, get to know my peers, and overall I felt prepared for the seminar meeting each week because of it. I think the organization was the best it could have been given the circumstances and the novelty of this situation to all of us, but in the future the virtual practices could be improved by consolidating the number of platforms used and making the small group discussions consistent throughout the weeks."

                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning about the Southwest's Indigenous history.  It is a somewhat niche subject area, but an important one nonetheless.  I would have preferred to learn more about the interactions between Indigenous and Colonial histories a bit more, as I think this could have been valuable, but the course sticks to a very Indigenous-centric history.",
                "Yes!",

It was an incredibly empowering course which called upon every student to create a meaningful project. Professor Sussman is so kind, generous, and extremely knowledgable. It was a lot of work, but worth it if you are passionate about the subject matter.",
