At times, the workload can be manageable, while other times it may not. It depends on the student and their ability to juggle the workload between all classes.  Another strength would be the 4/1. The 4/1 is to be in class four times a week and have Asynch work on Friday. This gives the student time to work alone and solve problems through hardships."

Alongside the constant feedback, the student would know what part of the language needs to be worked on and what they're doing great on."
