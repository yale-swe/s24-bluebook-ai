                "I am an older student. 55 to be exact and this course was a \"call to action\" of sorts. Professor Fotos is an incredible teacher.  He engaged us with so many great writers and their ideas regarding the way our government does and does not work. We were given readings from all sides of the political spectrum and I learned much. Additionally, watching my classmates and listening to them in the seminar made me proud to be an American and a Yalie.",
                "Genuinely, I don't think I learned a single piece of useful information other than how to participate in a round table discussion (which was already a theme in many previous classes). This class was not structured in a way to meaningfully teach new concepts.",
                "I learned about the theoretical foundations for American institutions, strategies for constitutional choice, and practical implications of those strategies.",
                "We explored the Constitution in depth and well as a multitude on other sources to inform the function of democracy.",
                "This class encouraged me to think on a deeper level about American politics and the institutions that fuel our political landscape. I considered the concepts of democracy, representation, fairness, equity, and objectivity and learned more about both those ideas and my own thought processes along the way. I also learned to write a political theory paper that I could be proud of.",
                "This course provided me with insights into the covenantal nature of America's founding as well as the proper tools needed to examine various theories of constitutional and social change over time. Most practically, this class taught me how to concisely put \"different authors into conversation\" with one another concerning a given subject, a skill which has proved increasingly beneficial for my writing.",
                "Maybe some vocabulary? The entire course was a hope and kindness-centered approach to fixing American politics. Not particularly insightful.",
                "None. This was the worst experience I have had at Yale. I can't believe this class is allowed to continue on. Random awful grading and guessing which tangents we'll go on for two hours straight. DO. NOT. TAKE."

                "Strengths: The students that take this course are generally very interested in the topics and are really great assets in your Yale experience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Literally everything else about this course. There was far too much information per week that was never explained. The professor did not offer any meaningful support. The assignments were not set up to help students succeed, and there as almost no support to help students improve.",
                "Honestly, this course is very weird. A lot of dense theoretical readings in the beginning didn't seem to have a clear purpose\/ take intuitive ideas and make them difficult. The practical element of the course was a bit better, but readings still weren't illuminating. I feel like everyone walked out of that class, definitely having learned important things about the American system, but unsure of what was really going on. If someone asked me the main takeaways of the course, I don't know if I would be able to answer. Not a great sign.",
                "Professor was an expert on the class material and class discussion was very engaging.",
                "This course is a great opportunity to learn and discuss the political theory of American democratic institutions in a respectful, relatively laid back environment. You will also learn how to write well with brevity and clarity, which is absolutely a skill worth having. However, if you take this class you should expect to participate fully if you want to get anything out of it. The readings were a bit overwhelming most weeks, but I was taking five classes so that definitely contributed.",
                "I originally took this course because the syllabus contained readings very different from other classes I've taken at Yale. The course content is very interesting. I'm not the biggest fan of discussion post format, but it was alright. The workload is relatively light.",
                "A strength of this course is the ability to dramatically improve your writing style by learning from others' writing styles. This is because students have several opportunities to peer review other students' writing, an exercise which is mutualistically beneficial to both the reviewer and the writer. The only weakness of this course involved the group exercises we would do in class. As someone who is rather shy, I found it quite difficult to be included in these conversations among groups of four or five, and think I would have got more out of these group sessions if they were smaller in size.",
                "Strengths: the professor has a good system of getting students to talk and keeping the seminar flowing. Weaknesses: the content is lackluster and the grading is not representative of the work that you put into the class",
                "Awful subjective random bad grades. If u want grad school, avoid this class and professor."

                "No, definitely not. Only if you have a profound interest in academia. Professor, and the readings he selected, LOVED to take intuitive ideas about politics\/democratic engagement and stuff them full of buzzwords to the point where everyone was confused. Way too much work for the benefit.",
                "Yes- it was extremely discussion based and it was very interesting to hear others' opinions on the current government.,",
                "This class embodies \"tough love.\" It is a good community, but it is far from easy by any definition. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject matter, but I would recommend it much more enthusiastically for someone who will be taking fewer than five classes. The readings are heavy and the grade inflation is light, but the subject matter is engaging and Professor Fotos is kind and fun to be around. If you are interested in this class, absolutely take it, but be prepared to work hard!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students hailing from any major. This course offers the opportunity to better understand moments of social and constitution change not only in America, but throughout the world. As for practical reasons to take this course, you will come out of it a better writer. Trust me.",
                "No. This class is the epitome of why over-intellectualization is a problem at Yale. I found its approach to politics to be incredibly performative, self-indulgent, and jaded. Readings were unnecessarily lengthy while containing little substance, conversations in seminar were shallow, and instruction from the professor was typically filled with irrelevant axioms and immaterial anecdotes. On top of all that, the grading was punitive, and it was incredibly difficult to express an opinion different from the professors without receiving backlash. Anytime I came to his office hours looking for clarity, he failed to provide definitive guidance and would instead recommend 500 pages of extra reading for me to find the answer. I would give anything to have spent my time and tuition money on a different course.",
