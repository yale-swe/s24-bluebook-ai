                "How to critically analyze poems and write essays about them.",
                "I learned how to do critical literary analysis, to read closely, and learned a lot about modern poetry and poets.",
                "I gained an improved ability to read poetry, both closely in terms of formal features and from a distance as part of a poet's larger body of work. I was familiarized with work from the 17th-21st centuries (both representative and atypical!).",
                "I have a better understanding of the poetic canon and how to approach reading a poem carefully. The course made me think a lot about the role of poetry in academics and life; and I'm grateful to have been able to spend so much time with poetry.",

I really, really appreciate Prof North's feedback on improving your writing - he spent an entire lecture getting us to think really critically how we use our language. I also don't think I've ever had a professor go so in-depth in their essay comments\r\nweaknesses: could've spent more time on 70's\/80's and contemporary poets",
                "Strengths: Professor North, enjoyable list of readings\/authors, engaging essays with extraordinarily helpful feedback",
                "strengths: vigorous classroom discussion, detailed essay feedback\r\nweaknesses: essay feedback and prompts given too late",
                "Strengths: great seminar discussions, good essay feedback, interesting poems, great professor. Weaknesses: sometimes I wished that we would get more essay help but often i just went to OH for this",
                "The reading list is excellent, and the writing assignments build upon skills developed in class discussions. I wish more of the readings could have been covered in class discussions and that perhaps more time was dedicated to a wider ranging view of the poets and poetry in general (perhaps aided through more literary criticism readings) rather than close reading.",

                "Yes - even if you are hesitant about poetry (which I was) you learn so much and realize that single words can mean a lot in context. I have developed a new appreciation for poetry after taking this class and my writing has improved a lot, too.",
