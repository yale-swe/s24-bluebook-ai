                "I know that the themes for this class change every year, but I think you can't go wrong, no matter when you take this class. For this iteration, you learn to decentralize biological kinship, that nothing is \"pre-political\" (especially not kinship and the family), that anthropology's responsibility is to create fissures in hegemonic understandings of gender\/kinship\/literally everything. You learn about \"studying up,\" about how the family is an issue of the state, and more.",
                "Was able to engage a variety of ethnographies on various topics and consider ideas of kinship, community, and the state",
                "I learned how to read ethnography and write about it as well as developed a faster reading pace. I learned about the history of kinship ethnography and feminist and queer interventions in it. We troubled ideas of authenticity surrounding marriage and family and considered how kinship isn't a natural category as we often think about it.",
                "ethnographic vocabulary, anthropology analysis, feeling equal in scholarship",
                "As a student who hadn't learned a lot about ethnographies, I learned a lottt about ethnographies and the practice of feminist anthropology! Some skills included extensive reading (about a full-length ~300 page book a week), and understanding theory via class discussion. The theme for this class this year was family, community, and nation so a major insight was about how notions of kinship can be influenced by nationalist agendas. The class really had just gaining knowledge about the specific terminology surrounding kinship studies and ethnographic work-- interlocutors, praxis, agency, \"studying up\" and more.",
                "This course is like no other offered at Yale. Its the kind of course that shifts your worldview in a meaningful and enduring way. This rendition of the course explored topics that I found to be seminal for constructing a robust feminist intellectual genealogy to build from in future work. Reading an ethnography a week is as challenging as it is rewarding and Prof. Pepis faith in our ability to do so turned out to be well placed. This course will positively challenge you in all the right ways, I cant recommend it enough. \r\n\r\nProf. Pepi is brilliant and has curated the syllabus so thoughtfully and meticulously. She fosters a classroom environment where asking questions and being honest about your points of confusion is welcome. She is also the most compassionate instructor Ive had at Yale. She prioritised our health and well-being above all while ensuring that we all got a lot out of the class.",
                "I gained a much better understanding of different modes and understandings of kinship, as well as the challenges and rewards of ethnography as a medium. Because the readings were so diverse, I feel like I really got a look at the complexities of a lot of other issues that intersect with kinship as well (religion, colonialism, the relationship between the state and domestic life, gender, race, sexuality, etc.)."

                "Strengths: ethnographies chosen were interesting and diverse geographically, which made for fun reads. the books at the beginning of the class are harder to get through but serve as a necessary foundation. The rest were much easier to read.\r\nWeakness: Discussions were sometimes a bit difficult to get through.",
                "Strengths: Eda is an incredible professor. It's a gift to hear her talk about these topics. You learn so much. The ethnographies are mostly very engaging and offer different lenses and analyses (so you're learning something new each week). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The book-a-week structure can be a strength. Just be ready for a lot of reading.",
                "Strengths- Professor Pepi is extremely knowledgeable, and assigns interesting reading. In general, she is flexible per student needs and cares a great deal about how you're doing.\r\nWeaknesses- The one book a week pacing is intense, and the expectation that you will have read it thoroughly enough to explain any chapter is difficult to meet, especially during busy weeks of the semester. There is little feedback about the assignments during the class.",
                "Strengths included the interaction with authors. We got to speak with the authors of around half of our books. It is a fast paced course with a lot of reading however if you commit to completing it, it is really rewarding. Each week's reading builds off the previous week's really well. By the end of the course you have read about 11 books which is amazing! The course could be improved by more selective readings sometimes though because the amount was a lot. Maybe some weeks students could be assigned chapters or excerpts of importance.",
                "The workload of the class if both a strength and weakness. Strength because reading ethnography books in its entirety gives a complete picture of each author's ethnographic work and hence a better understanding of the communities written about. Weakness because reading one book per week can be quite taxing. \r\nAnother strength: the syllabus of this class is fantastic! I like how Professor Pepi sequences the books and puts them into three parts: starting from epistemologies, then etiologies, and finally methodologies. This sequencing makes it clearer what to look out for in each book as well.",
                "Professor Pepi!! An amazing teacher that will challenge you on everything you thought to be true. I am walking away excited about an area of this class that makes me want to do more research, read more, and explore more. This class will make you feel so many things  in the best way possible. No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: the structuring of the seminar, guest visits, having \"themed\" weeks, each week's theme building on the last\r\nI wonder if it'd be possible for this course to include more student opinions in the selection of each week's work? Most book selections were insightful but there were times when I felt like we could spend more class time (and time preparing outside of class) to find and discuss works that challenge our thinking.",
                "We already spent time walking through the syllabus with prof. Pepi and discussing which ethnographies should be shortened or replaced so Im confident that the next rendition of this course will feature student feedback that will improve their experience.",
                "Reading an ethnography a week is very difficult but very rewarding. It's an intense class but so, so worth it."

Reading one book a week can be really difficult, especially if you have a heavier class load, so I would suggest this class to someone who has the time. The course itself is really great and the books can be really interesting, but sometimes long.",
                "Yes!!! First off, take any class you can with Eda. She's an incredible teacher, really inspiring to listen to. And take this class, especially. The ethnographies you read are very engaging, and you'll learn a ton. It's a lot of work, but a book a week can be very rewarding.",
                "Would recommend if you're up for the book a week pacing, or good at skimming and retaining content.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Pepi is an incredible professor and the course exposes you to a lot of topics and readings you otherwise wouldn't read.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course. It was a challenging class for me, especially the epistemologies section where it is more theoretical. However, it was also an extremely insightful class about kinship and interpreting ethnographies through the lenses of feminist and queer theories.",
                "Absolutely.  It was interesting, engaging, but approachable.",
                "Generally, yes. Ethnography itself is a complicated field but I felt that Professor Pepi does a pretty good job at making its complications more comprehensible. And I recommend all students to take a class in the WGSS department-- feminist and queer ethnographies will show you how we've grown to overlook so many of the things and practices of daily life.",
                "YES! I wish I could take it again. (low-key i might if Prof. Pepi lets me)",
                "YES, 100000%. Take anything you can with Eda Pepi - she's one of the most intelligent professors (and people more generally) that I've ever met. Just listening to her speak would make my brain feel like it was exploding sometimes with how thoughtful, smart, and nuanced she is. You get so much out of this class, and I genuinely feel like my worldview feels so much bigger and less black-and-white than it was going in. If you want to understand people (in whatever capacity), take this class!",
                "I took this course credit\/d and still found it rewarding\/enriching! Im in an interdisciplinary major (WGSS) and this course helped me to understand the method of ethnography. I would recommend it to anyone who would like an introduction to anthropology or who is looking to understanding ethnography as a method and to inform their own practice\/scholarship."
