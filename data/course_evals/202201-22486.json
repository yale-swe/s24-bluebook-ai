                "This course was better than PHYS 205L, but PHYS 205L was the worst class I have ever taken in my life, so it is a low bar. \r\nThe experiments in this class were for the most part educational, illuminating, and fun. The lab guides were well-written and very helpful. \r\nIt is a complete joke to label this class a 0.5 credit with no writing distributional credit. Each week we write a lab report from 7-20 pages. The analysis alone has taken over 10 hours. I have lost points in the grading for my writing style, despite it being a Physics lab without a writing distribution. \r\nMy suggestion for this class is to only assign the analysis for most of the labs, rather than the full report. For maybe 2-3 labs over the semester, have the students write a full writeup. For all the other labs, only assign the analysis and maybe some of the discussion. Writing an introduction, procedure, abstract, and conclusion for every lab was a tremendous amount of work and really not educational enough for the effort. Instead, have the students only do this 2-3 times over the semester. \r\nIt is also ridiculous to tell people to do all of the analysis and writeup separately. This is not realistic at all for a lab environment. I agree that people should not be able to put all the work on their partner, but the suggestion that people don't work together for the analysis is insane for a class that is this much work.",
                "The course gives students a wide choice of experiments to run, which lets them choose which areas of the physical sciences they are more interested in and gain exposure to techniques and theory they might not get from lecture courses. Lab time is structured efficiently, with more than enough time to complete most experiments with high quality data, and letting students immediately start on their experiments once they get to class is very convenient. Support with the experiment and apparatus was also immediately available to students. The experiment guides handed out were also very helpful and contained the right amount of information.\r\nHowever, the workload for this course was by no means commensurate with 0.5 credits as it consistently took more time outside of lab to prepare the lab report than it did to run the experiment. Having to prepare a full lab report for each experiment added on a large workload overhead to the course but was not particularly educational because: a) feedback was only provided once at midterm so it was hard to learn from mistakes; b) many experiments did not warrant a full-fledged report format, e.g. there wasn't much new theory for introductions, the apparatus was too simple for a Methods section, or in general there wasn't enough to say to need an abstract and a conclusion; c) there wasn't much left for students to learn about scientific writing after about the fourth report, and the remaining five did not really develop any new writing skills. In addition, the amount of time needed for data analysis varied wildly between experiments (e.g. Nuclear Reactions and Momentum Conservation took maybe triple the time required for Digital Logic, Electric Fields, and Planck's Constant). \r\nIn my opinion, either the credit value of this course should be increased (i.e. to 1 credit and\/or grant a Writing credit), or the workload of writing reports should be decreased, e.g. just the quantitative analysis and presentation of data with a discussion and error analysis writeup for most experiments, and two to four full-format reports per semester.",
                "This is probably the worst course I have taken at Yale so far, followed closely by 205L. Both courses should be completely revamped in order for students to get something meaningful out of them. Many parts of the experiments are mind-numbing and students should not be required to report on that. Further, requiring students to format reports in a particular way or expecting them to write nonsensical stuff just to fill space because the TF otherwise grades down a lot is laughable. 2500 words per week in lab reports is a massive time sink that is definitely not conducive to learning how to operate physics lab instrumentation. If it were for me, labs should be pass\/fail--I don't see the point of grading lab reports that are not discovering anything new or interesting. Maybe changing the lab report to a form and not expecting unreasonable things would be a good change? I also did not receive feedback for most of my reports until the end of the semester.",
                "The experiments are very interesting and fun to do. On the other hand, writing the lab reports is often painful, but what can you do.",
                "You get a lot of freedom with which labs you do, which is really great.",
                "Strengths: The experiments are actually really interesting, and you will learn a lot of interesting physics. The instructions are usually pretty clear. Weaknesses: The workload of this class can become sizable especially if you save the weekly lab reports until the last minute. It is less busywork that Physics 205L, but still a fair amount of work.",
                "Strengths: This class is a lot more fun than Physics 205L. Some of the experiments are very cool. You get to replicate some of the seminal experiments in physics, such as the Millikan Oil Drop and Charge-to-Mass ratio, and experiment with some very cool phenomena like nuclear reactions and superconductivity. You work very closely and independently with your lab partner over the course of the semester. Weaknesses: the lab reports for this class take a long time to write. There is little to no guidance on the labs beyond the lab guide, and the topics are often ones that have not been covered in lecture.",
                "The experiments are cool. Not all of them are fun though.",
                "This class is a ton of work, but it's more rewarding than 205 was. Where grading in 205 is based on pre-labs and notebooks, 206 is based only on your lab reports, which is a big strength. The grading seemed much clearer. Another huge strength was getting to choose our own experiments. The biggest strengths, though, were Dr. Irons and our TA, Joy. They were amazing and always so helpful. Unlike 205 where it felt like the goal was always to push through, the goal of 206 seemed like it was for us to really learn. The weaknesses are older experiment guides that were hard to understand or had outdated information.",
                "A great selection of labs. I enjoyed all of them except for electric field plotting which was so boring I wish it was not even a possibility. The weakness is that I couldn't do all of the labs. Really a great course.",
                "The topics of the labs were very interesting and the workload was not too much.",
                "Revised experiment guides, many of them are lengthy and try to teach extensive theory in an experimental lab. Some interesting subjects offered however.",
                "Great! I think its perfect.",
                "The strengths of this course were the experiments and the lab reports. The experiments were designed very well and encouraged intellectual engagement from the students. In addition, students had the choice to choose the experiments that they wanted to conduct, which made it so that students were more interested in the work that they were doing. As a result, I think that the learning was increased and as was the fun aspect of the course. Moreover, experiments were conducted in pairs of two, which I think also fostered engagement and learning through the discussions. As for the lab reports, while they were occasionally heavy in terms of workload, they helped to solidify the learning from the experiments. The reports were also really helpful in teaching students ways to analyze their data and the feedback that was received was also really helpful in making improvements. I did not come across any particular ways the course could be improved.",
                "I really enjoyed the fact that we got to pick our labs from a list; I was able to do the experiments I was more interested in and learn more about the things I care about."

                "I mean if you're looking at this you probably have to take it. I have strongly mixed feelings about this class in the sense that I loved doing most of the experiments, especially the Nuclear Reactions and Rutherford Scattering ones, but writing up the lab reports afterwards was a lot of work (sometimes took ~ 10 hours).",
                "Yes!!! The labs are very fun and you feel like you're doing real physics (unlike in 205L)!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student for whom it is required for their major or who is extremely interested in experimental physics. If one is just looking for a fun lab class, the workload of this course might make it less ideal.",
                "I would recommend this course only to a student who is highly interested in physics. You get to do some highly interesting labs, but that is at the cost of spending 6+ hours per week writing lab reports. Your experience is really determined by the labs that you choose. Superconductivity and charge-to-mass ratio are both relatively simple and very cool. Also definitely do either Rutherford scattering or nuclear reactions, which make use of the particle accelerator. The particle accelerator is very cool and Paul Noel (who runs the accelerator) is great. Would also recommend finding someone you know in your section to be your lab partner ahead of time. You will work very closely together on all of the labs throughout your semester.",
                "Definitely! PHYS206L is more workload compared to PHYS166L, but you have the chance of doing so many interesting experiments and you learn so much. It is totally worth it and I really recommend it for people who want to learn more about physics.",
                "Yes. If one's into cool tabletop experiments, this is the way to go.",
                "Never thought I'd say this about a lab course, but yes. If you got through 205, take 206 for your second semester of lab! While it could be stressful (and more than half a credit of work), most weeks' work didn't feel unbearable. I'd recommend digital logic, electric field plotting, Planck's constant, and charge matter ratio. Superconductivity, applications of interferometry, and Rutherford scattering are some of the coolest ones, but can be harder to understand. Momentum conservation and x-ray diffraction were a little brutal. Overall, the stuff you get to do is really cool, and it's much better than 205.",
                "absolutely. Great class and way easier than 205. The labs are all excellent, except maybe electric field plotting which was quite boring. Highly recommended.",
                "I would recommend this course because the students have the flexible to choose the topics of the labs they want to complete.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. If you can take a different lab, I would do that. This seemed like an unnecessary amount of work the lab reports were always my least favorite part of my week.",
                "Of course take it if you have to. Its better than 205 in that the reports arent horribly tedious to write up. Not the best use of time though, better off taking just the advanced lab if you can and devoting the spare time to independent research.",
                "You get to choose from a variety of different labs. Felt they were more engaging than 205L. There is a particle accelerator one which is pretty interesting.  You probably have to take this if you are any kind of physics\/engineering major.",
                "The 205\/206 lab sequence is not for the faint of heart. It is much more challenging both in work and intellectual engagement than 165\/166. That being said, for a student with interest in experimentation, python data analysis, modern physical experiments, and formal scientific writing, 206 provides a thorough and satisfying introduction to these topics. While 206 was a bit more intellectually challenging than 205L (more difficult analyses with much less python code given to you, more complicated physics with less handholding in terms of procedure), the overall workload was less if managed well (especially if you have some experience with python). You only have to turn in a final lab report instead of an annotated notebook + summary. \r\n\r\nI think the skills taught in this course are tantamount for any engineer or experimental physicist. The experiments were also super cool for anyone interesting in physics- the highlight being two experiments in the Yale particle accelerator- one of the only particle accelerators dedicated to undergraduate teaching in the world. \r\n\r\nOverall would recommend, but be prepared for this half credit to take more time than some full credit classes.",
                "Honestly, unless this class is required for your major, I would avoid it.  If you are stuck taking this course, it is less work and much more interesting than 205L.  The experiments are cool and you get to pick your own, but the lab reports are tedious.",
                "If you are to take a physics lab, yes! Choosing which labs you wanted to do was very enjoyable, and I learned a lot each week.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course is a great opportunity to learn about conducting experiments and analyzing data, and the experiments are designed in a way that is challenging but also engaging and fun.",
