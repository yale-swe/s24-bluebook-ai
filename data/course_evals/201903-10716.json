   "comments": [
    "So much knowledge about new modes of thinking within philosophy. Had never really read any kind of philosophical work going in and I leave feeling excited by the discipline of philosophy in a way i didn't think I would",
    "This class was my introduction to philosophy as a prospective philosophy major, and it certainly provided me insights to direct my future courses. The essays were diverse in style, from a close breakdown of a passage to explaining how a philosopher would respond to a complex situation. It helped introduce me to philosophy structure, as well as how it differs from close reading literature.",
    "I learned how to think deeper and more clearly, how to develop and analyze an argument, and about the path of philosophic thought from Plato to Aquinas.",
    "In this class, I gained much knowledge about ancient philosophy. Philosophy was something I had never encountered before and this class challenged me to think deeper about each topic.",
    "Though I've never studied philosophy before, the class is so compelling that I'm fascinated by all the philosophers that we've encountered throughout the semester. We read works that make up the cornerstone of western philosophy, studying each philosopher carefully and putting them into conversation with each other. An absolutely amazing class worth attending.",
    "-how to read, think, and speak about philosophical concepts in a critical way \r\n-how to write a philosophy paper",
    "reading, writing, how to work with material that is extremely difficult to understand, note taking skills, a basic understanding of the major philosophical movements from this time period",
    "I learned how to deconstruct philosophical arguments and how to write philosophical analyses."

   "question_id": "YC403-YCWR",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses- especially in philosophy, the sheer amount of works makes it so difficult to grasp the key themes each week without getting burned out. Strengths- I learned a lot and I improved my philosophical writing.",
    "The class offers an exploration of old Western philosophers that spans a large range of authors and time periods. I feel prepared to discuss philosophers in casual conversations now, though our pace made us unable to deeply explore each ideology we explored. It is a philosophical history class more than a philosophical exploration, and that isn't a bad thing. Professor Inwood understood that everyone is new to the subject and demanded our attention and interest more than our competence. As a result, I do not feel as if any of our readings completely went over my head. My only piece of constructive criticism is that I wish Aristotle was handled with more caution. Our Aristotle readings were early in the semester,",
    "Strengths: Professor Inwood is insightful, super smart, funny, and great at bringing arguments together. Paper prompts were challenging and felt worthwhile. I loved the vast majority of the reading, and it genuinely has challenged how I look at the world. I will carry the thoughts I engaged with this semester for a long time, I am sure.\r\nWeaknesses: I was not impressed by most lectures. Seminar discussion fell flat often. Not sure if that was a problem with the individuals in the room, but maybe Professor Inwood could've found ways to stimulate discussion more.",
    "I think more guidance at the beginning, when were first learning what exactly a philosophy class is, wouldve been helpful.",
    "The course is very organized, chooses some of the most worth-read and classical works of ancient philosophy. Lectures are totally highlights of the semester.",
    "-the material all fits together in a very cohesive and interesting way \r\n-sometimes there is so much material that it is hard\/impossible to read and understand all of it in a meaningful way",
    "would have helped to had more tips on how to read these difficult materials and absorb the information",
    "The instruction was fantastic. I learned a lot about different schools of thought. Occasionally, however, the seminars could feel a bit like a lecture."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would, with the caveat that they must accept DS's emphasis on breadth over depth.",
    "Yes, I went back and forth on philosophy, but by the end of this course I recognized and appreciated it a lot.",
    "Yes. This course allows students to learn about ancient philosophy. It is very interesting to see the ideas that the ancient philosophers possesses and how they implemented them.",
    "Definitely. This class teaches philosophy in such a plain way that no previous knowledge in philosophy is necessary.",
    "Yes! It was well worth the challenge, and it has changed my ways of thinking in a very rewarding way",
    "Yes absolutely. Philosophy is fascinating and this course gives a fantastic foundation.",
    "This course is great to gain basic understanding of Greek and Roman philosophy (and a little bit of Arabic and Jewish philosophy too). \r\nThere is slightly less reading than in other DS courses but the reading is a lot more dense and requires greater attention and focus. \r\nAlso note that the first semester only covers more ancient philosophy-"
