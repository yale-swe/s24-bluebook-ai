Likewise, consider removing the in-class discussion of case materials (which felt repetitive) and replacing it with an alternative (e.g., a one page response to someone else's policy recommendation).",

If you aren't interested in central banking or have a very busy schedule, read the syllabus, go to the first class, and make a careful decision. I loved this course, but I could see how someone would not."
