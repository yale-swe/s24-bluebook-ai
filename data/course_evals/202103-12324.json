                "Everything in the course was interesting. Could have more thematic coherence (directly on the theme of the intellectual), as each week seemed to focus primarily on the thought of different thinkers rather than their contributions to the theme of the intellectual.",
                "The course material was fascinating, while not having too many readings so it was perfect in sustaining interest.\r\nThe assessment were also fair and interesting to do, standard presentations and essays of a leminar.\r\nThe seminar itself though could have been more structured, in that participation was largely based on speaking and being responded to by the professor and organic discussion was minimal. The discussion itself was also unstructured at times, with it depending on professor's questions.",
                "strength: Prof. Renaud's curation of reading assignments and the organization of them by themes--it's so interesting and fruitful to read about the works of prominent intellectuals and had them in conversation with one another through the angles Prof. Renaud presented to us; Prof. Renaud is also one of the BEST history instructors at Yale. He cared a lot about the materials, about teaching and about his students, and I enjoyed and appreciated his input in class discussions--it elevated and deepened the conversations so much. \r\n\r\nweakness: none",
                "Prof. Renaud's teaching style in seminar is very rewarding. His comments and his way of organizing the class not only allow us to develop new ideas in response to other students, but he also provides new sources and readings in response of what people say in class to allow for further learning. People in this class come from across the political spectrum so it was very interesting to hear a wide range of ideas.",
                "The professor was super kind, caring, and committed to students. It was cool that the readings were from a wide range of thinkers. Also loved the open-ended final project.",
                "Good instructor; interesting sources; good balance of work; weakness: quality of class discussion was mixed -- sometimes instructor had to talk a lot to fill the apparent dearth of student engagement"
