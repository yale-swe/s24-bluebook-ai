Weaknesses: I think that (judging from some of my friends' sections) the workload is a bit heavier than other sections of 114. The readings are sometimes long and difficult to comprehend, and having to write blog posts twice every week isn't ideal. But overall a great class.",

Moving on...\" My thinking in this class, as in most of my small-group classes, was not required to be sharp because there was seldom a possibility of dissent."
