    "I think the success of a senior thesis has a lot to do with the adviser. My adviser was very involved, we met weekly, and he provided careful and lengthy feedback at every step. Because of Professor Winklers involvement I got so much more out of my thesis than I could have anticipated."

    "I would absolutely recommend taking this route to fulfill the senior philosophy requirement if you have a specific interest that cant quite be explored in the regular seminar offerings in the department.",
    "Absolutely. Writing a senior thesis is the most rewarding experience Ive had at Yale.",
    "Very much so."
