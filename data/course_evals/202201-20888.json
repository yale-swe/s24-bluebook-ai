            "comments": [
                "This course is genuinely one of the best courses I have taken so far at Yale, even though it was VERY high workload and challenging topics wise towards the beginning to the point that I was considering dropping the class (and the chemistry major itself too). I went into the course thinking it was just something I would have to get through for my major but ended up loving it so much that I am reconsidering what type of research I might be interested in doing in the future and also what type of classes I want to take going forward. What kept me going though the initial hardship was the teaching staff who really was so so supportive. Somebody was always there to help you with your questions and furthermore, all of them were also very approachable; they were always eager to help and welcoming, so I never had to worry about being a nuisance or asking \"stupid\" questions. One of the biggest strengths was also the biggest weakness. What I'm referring to is the grading and assignment system. Even though the 85% threshold and 3 tries system for psets was absolutely pain in terms of workload but also for morale (when you keep getting back failing grades for psets you put a lot of effort into, then that doesn't necessarily make you joyous about taking the course), then I must admit that the system did do what it was set out to do, which is make sure that you really(!) do know the material. I can say with complete confidence that the content for this class is solidified in my brain so well solely because of the sheer amount of practice that I was required to do to pass the psets. So I have a very love-hate relationship with that system. I guess if just one of your classes has that system, then it is great, however, I cannot imagine doing that for multiple classes at the same time.",
                "The course itself was not very well-organized and seemed to be developed as it actually progressed. It was also difficult to adapt to in terms of teaching style as it was a flipped classroom.",
                "Strengths: The specification grading Dr. Holland employs helped me to strive for mastery of the material. It also meant there was less competition between classmates since we were not graded on a curve against each other. The number of psets we had also gave us more than enough problems to practice for exams and know how to apply what we learned in class. The explanations were clear.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some group activities felt superfluous while others felt way too hard.",
                "Strengths are the multiple tries for everything. Weaknesses are the grade specification grading.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Holland was a very kind professor, and he genuinely tried to correct the course based on student feedback. I felt like I learned much about inorganic chemistry in the class, and based on previous Coursetable reviews, this class was probably better than previous iterations. Also, the psets were very reasonable length.\r\nWeaknesses: The re-take exam policy takes a lot of time, if you end up needing to re-take an exam. Also, the paper review assignment takes some time. I think Prof. Holland did not really understand the time commitment of the class initially, but it got better. Also, I felt that some lectures could be much more organized. But that also improved over the semester. It is truly much better when pre-reading is not necessary before class time.",
                "This course did a good job allowing for students to make mistakes while not being punished, though these redos often lead to a heavy workload which could impact future work.",
                "This course is tailored very well for learning (especially considering that this was its first iteration). The ability to have multiple attempts on PSETs was a great way to identify and understand mistakes. However, having multiple PSETs can become overwhelming at times.",
                "Pat was a really nice professor and tried hard to make the class fun/get us to learn. It was nice that we were encouraged to collaborate so much in class/in discussion. I thought the class environment was overall really friendly and welcoming. What I didn't enjoy so much was the grading scheme and lecture organization for this course. The lectures sometimes felt a bit scattered and the slides weren't always super thorough, but we did a lot of group activities in class which might be why it was thought that the slides didn't need to be so instructive on their own. In terms of grading, I like the idea of specification grading (giving students three chances on all homework and exams to master the material) as it relieves some stress if you were having a bad day on a homework or exam...but it sometimes felt like the thresholds were a bit strict and we ended up having large time commitments if we decided to go to all the exam retakes. It was a bit stressful to me that some of our exams were out of a small number of points (around 30), meaning that we could only lose a couple points to be over a 90% for the A-grade specification. I understand that I should be able to score nearly perfectly if I truly get the material, but I find that even on my best of days, I am still capable of missing a few questions just by a stupid math error or coming across a concept that I somehow missed in studying (after all, we do have multiple other classes besides this one and can't expect to thoroughly cover every subtlety that might come up). In the future, maybe the exams could be out of more points (50-100) to allow some more flexibility (though I understand that this might be slightly more time-consuming for TAs to grade). Or, when we do the exam retakes, maybe we could just re-do the types of questions that we missed on previous attempts in order to minimize TA grading/extensive studying (students could just focus on the material that they didn't get to study as thoroughly before). Maybe there could also be a study guide/review sheet before each exam that very explicitly lists the things we need to know (e.g. key acids/bases, model crystal structures, ligands, etc.) so that we can prepare most efficiently to hopefully reach the pre-determined threshold for grade boundaries.",
                "The course was well structured in my opinion. There were lots of connections between topics that allowed me to see \"the bigger picture\". There were plenty of opportunities both in class, in section, and on the problem sets for us to master the content we learned. Additionally, Professor Holland's shorter supplemental lectures and review were all quite helpful.",
                "Course was initially perhaps too much work with having to redo all psets in which we received less than 85% in their entirety. Prof. Holland was very receptive to our feedback about specification grading and the psets and final exam to make the course more manageable for us. Lots of office hours available to discuss material and ask questions. I appreciated the extra videos Prof. Holland posted on topics that were more challenging. Course follows the textbook very closely so it's easy to use that as an extra resource. Specification grading wasn't my favorite initially but I grew to like it more and it definitely has its pedagogical merits",
                "I am a fan of the active learning model, and I think it is perfect for the content of this course. I think the execution of it could be changed a bit. More workshops would be great, but I'm thinking more of the 5 minute ones would be better as opposed to those that ended up taking the majority of the class. The specifications grading seemed weird at first, but you get used to it and it's very reasonable. I also thought there were plenty of opportunities to get help.",
                "A big strength of the course (and Dr. Holland) was the receptivity to feedback and usage of the feedback to better the course organization as it was still happening. Because of this, a number of aspects about the course that would have normally been considered \"weaknesses\" quickly became strengths, including: consistent problem set due dates, a better proportion of lecture-to-workshop material, a more effective mechanism for the determination of the final exam grade specification. Another big strength of the course was each problem set and exam having multiple attempts. Having multiple attempts took a lot of pressure off of getting things right the first time and helped students clearly identify points of misunderstanding with regards to the material, all in all making more effective learning. Another big strength of the course was the specifications grading system. The specifications grading made it so that a student knew exactly what they needed to do to achieve their desired grade in the class. This took a lot of the focus away from the getting the highest grade possible and rather put the focus on hitting certain grade thresholds for every problem set or exam, which I found to be very helpful because it helped model and set expectations for myself in the class.",
                "I think that the structure of the course was both a strength and a weakness. It was hard to take five out of six possible exams, but it was nice to have multiple chances to show that you've mastered the content. It took the pressure off of each exam, but also made the workload higher. I think that was a trend with the problem sets as well. I probably did more work for this class than any other, but was less stressed about each assignment.\r\n\r\nI do think that another strength was how not grading on a curve made the class environment a lot nicer and more supportive."

                "YES!!! Please take this course if you have any interest at all in chemistry; it doesn't even have to be an interest in inorganic chemistry. You will learn to see chemistry from such an interesting perspective. The things you learn are not only applicable to inorganic chemistry but to all the other subfields of chemistry as well.",
                "I would not recommend this course to any student who is not required to take it. I understand that this course was designed to make the idea of grades less stressful, but ultimately made grading a very difficult and convoluted conversation to have between students and lecturer. The idea of having multiple retakes for exams and problem sets seems to be stress-relieving, but can ultimately cause greater stress due to the sheer amount of work and effort that goes into taking these resits and redoes.",
                "If you're a chem major, you're probably required to take this class. If you're not, I would still highly recommend it if you're curious about metal complexes and crystals.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes. This is a great introductory course for those interested in the subject and willing to work hard.",
                "Yes, \r\nThis is great course for students interested in delving into more chemistry whether or not you are a chemistry major",
                "I think the material of this class was overall pretty interesting, but I think that the way the class was run (specification grading, some confusion with what we truly needed to know, etc.) made the class pretty stressful to me overall. While it was nice knowing that we had 3 \"tries\" for everything in the class, it was very time consuming to continue studying intensely for an exam almost every other week, especially because I knew I could only miss a couple questions to hit the threshold for the grade I wanted. I think it's an overall good system to give people additional chances for things, but I felt that harsh boundaries for grades (especially when the homework/exams had so few points available overall) took away from the relief that I originally felt when I saw that we could take an exam multiple times--it seemed like even if I knew the material very well after studying/taking exams multiple times, there was still a fairly good chance that I'd make a couple mistakes and already be below the pre-determined A threshold. With that being said, I know grades don't have to be the main focus of a class, so I'll say that I learned a lot in the last few weeks of the semester in preparing for the final assignments/exams.",
                "Yes, I absolutely would! Not only is it a required class from chemistry majors, it is also a very interesting survey of inorganic chemistry that really builds your chemical intuition and reasoning skills. Prof. Holland also emphasized the importance of communication in science, and I believe I benefited from that focus.",
                "Yes! Great introduction to inorganic chemistry not only for chem majors. Prof. Holland worked to weave in some bioinorganic material throughout the semester since there were a significant number of MB&B majors in the course. With Prof. Holland, inorganic won't be the easy, no-workload course inorganic typically is (or at least that's how everyone usually makes it out to be) but this way you definitely learn a lot and come out of it feeling very accomplished. I found the material we covered interesting and am left wanting to take higher level courses in the field",
                "I would, but it's important to understand how this class was structured. The way that Prof. Holland ran the class is specification-based grading, meaning that there was no cumulative grade. Instead, one had to get a certain grade or above on midterms, problem sets, the final, and a paper-review assignment. Everything except the last two had three tries, problem sets could be redone by doing new problems akin to those missed on the first try and the midterms were full retakes. Answers were posted after the originals of each assignment were due. Having said that, I think the structure worked really well. It was conducive to actually learning everything in the class, and the multiple tries took a lot of the stress out of things. At first, we had to redo the entire problem set if we didn't hit the mark, but after that was changed things became even more manageable. \r\nAs for the teaching itself, I'd say it was generally good but that it could sometimes be hit or miss. Some classes we would walk out gushing, some we would walk out having no idea what just happened. I think the class hit its stride halfway through the year and things started to come together and make sense--and the structure of the class became more regular then as well. It was also Prof. Holland's first time teaching the class, and I think it will get tighter and better as time goes on.",
                "Yes! I had to take this class as a chemistry major, but plenty of people outside of it also were enrolled and I get the impression even they got a lot out of it too.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking for an introduction and a survey to the field of inorganic chemistry. I would also recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about how symmetry is important in chemistry. However, this course does not go particularly in-depth into any one topic, so I would not recommend this course to anyone who is looking for a deep dive into any one subset of inorganic chemistry."
