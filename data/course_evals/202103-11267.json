                "I learned about different approaches to the discipline of history; It helped me reach my own understanding of what history should teach. Generally made me a stronger and more critical historian.",
                "Writing and argumentative skills. I also felt more confident about my public speaking skills.",
                "This course could be appropriately subtitled what wisdom Professor John Lewis Gaddis, having read many books and both studied and taught many leaders, thinks that you should keep in mind as a student trying to understand the world. Professor Gaddis teaches some other courses  one on biography, one on foxes and hedgehogs (leadership), one on time travel, and of course Grand Strategy  that are more focused on a specific subject. This seminar seems to draw bits from all of them to impart a broad but complex sense of his worldview. It bounces back and forth between the specific and the general. It brings you into a world of \"big thinking\" that isn't pedantic or bound by discipline  a world in which the ancient Greek wars and chaos theory and ballroom dancing are all connected  and leaves you with a deep understanding of the importance of that kind of intellectualism, and of course history's place at the center of it all. The course has improved my writing in similar ways: Professor Gaddis himself is one of the most elegant writers I've ever read, and he instills that value in students as well. I've learned the power of simplicity and conversational, vivid clarity even in the most academic writing, which is something you don't always get in the (social) sciences. This probably all sounds extremely vague and abstract, which is certainly true at times; I'd be hard-pressed to say what hard facts I learned in this course. But I feel far more educated than before when the semester began.",
                "Taking this course allowed me to alter my perspective and outlook on the discipline of history. The broad nature of discussion topics has also allowed me to think about other disciplines with regards to the lessons learnt not necessarily by history itself but by the way in which it is studied. Skill wise, I've become more confident to share my thoughts in discussion and to be vulnerable through my writing which I was not expecting.",
                "This course taught me methods of analysis and critical thinking that I had not realized could be applied to history. It also brought out certain skills in philosophy and in science, which I was pleasantly surprised to learn about.",
                "Hard to nominate but a wide range of very high level thinking in areas more than history (eg. morality, prediction, science, what history teaches)As STEM major I have got a lot of insights in history, science, and their relationship.",
                "This course taught me to consider so much about history that I previously took for granted. I learned to think about how history is developed, how it impacts us today, and what it means for the future.",
                "How to make takeaways from long chunks of reading, how to read non-fiction and article reviews, how to be creative after being very serious in high school",
                "I developed key insights on a range of important topics, debates, and polarities that are relevant to the practice of history. I also improved my ability to assess sources (anything from historical archives to fiction) and decide on what they might be telling us and how certain we can be about the conclusions we draw.",
                "This course changed the way I think about the study of history. I had thought the course would be about taking lessons from events of the past and applying them to our present situation, but, in reality, this course was much more about examining how we look at history and the effectiveness of the study of history. This course is very intellectually challenging and discusses a lot of existential questions about time, humanity, and knowledge. The writing assignments force you to be creative and commit to an idea, although many of them seem very intimidating at first! Overall, this course will push you to think critically about the study of history and its contradictions, complexities, and unanswerable questions.",
                "The class really completely changes your frame of mind on history and how you view it. It teaches you to critically analyze history and what the value of history really is."

            "comments": [
                "Less reading. Every reading that the professor assigned was interesting and insightful, but often, because so much of it was assigned, we could not fully discuss every reading in the Seminar. Moreover, the reading was so extensive that many students, including myself, struggled to complete all of it. Assigning fewer readings would allow students to spend more time per reading.\r\n\r\nThe professor struck an excellent balance between leading the discussion and allowing students to contribute.",
                "- Readings were long but excellently chosen (would not necessarily change the length)\r\n- Professor Gaddis' insights and short lectures and stories are the true highlight.\r\n- Discussions during the latter half of the semester were really strong.\r\n\r\n- The first few class discussions felt frustrating - not much of a discussion and many students trying to prove their worth.",
                "Strengths: the content, the professor, and the class size.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the workload was significant.",
                "The course got better and better as the semester progressed. Initially, there were often days when I left class wondering what exactly I had actually learned  class time was taken up with students throwing out their ideas often without too much connection to others points, and the topics from one class to the next didnt always feel clearly connected. But then there was a point about halfway through the course when everything began to click, both in terms of the connections between the material and the cohesiveness of the students. Everything we had talked about and were talking about began to come together, and what had seemed like disorder before suddenly seemed like a very consciously assembled pathway. It was immensely rewarding when I started noticing references in our later readings to things we had read earlier -- or better yet, making my own theoretical connections. The end of the course (especially the touchingly personal last class!) was truly bittersweet and left me feeling both satisfied and yet sad that there wasnt something more. Professor Gaddis clearly loves the classroom, and is someone who really believes in learning from his students, even after (or perhaps because of) over fifty years of teaching.\r\n\r\nIts hard to judge something that felt more like an experience than a normal course on mundane things like workload. But as for that: Its simultaneously difficult and easy. The reading load, as others will undoubtedly mention, is very heavy (think a full 500-page book in five days, and of course the entirety of War and Peace over the semester). The upside is that youll never fear a big reading load again. And its not like youre tested or graded on memorizing exactly what happens  Professor Gaddis just wants you to gain insight from, and I think sincerely enjoy, the things youre assigned (its clear that some of the books on the syllabus are mostly there, or at least there in full rather than as excerpts, because he liked reading them, they influenced him, and thinks you should read them too). Besides the reading, though, the writing isn't onerous at all: the only graded assignments are a few short papers, all of which are on extremely broad/open-ended topics (being told simply to \"write a classic\" as the first assignment was, to be sure, a bit frightening) and all of which encourage creativity. Professor Gaddis is not only amenable to but also encouraging of outside-the-box thinking, which made the writing actually a lot of fun.",
                "One major strength of the course is its ability to invoke self-reflection and reflection on the world around a student. The readings consist of many books and articles that I think should be read by anyone during their lifetime, and the discussions are some that I think everyone should experience. Although the direction of the discussions in the first few weeks may not be clear, the course comes full circle towards the end in a very enlightening way. Additionally, I think the writing assignments are quite enjoyable! The prompts are creative and fun while still seriously engaging us with the course material which I really loved.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course likely include the massive workload especially in terms of readings. I'd say it is possible to complete the course without completing all them all, they really are very enriching and the discussions flow based on them and so I'd encourage anyone taking the class to come into it ready to dedicate many hours a day reading for the class. Another potential weakness is the fast-paced of discussion that while quite exciting can sometimes leave the quieter students, who do want to share, feeling unable to do so.",
                "This course was very strong in that it encouraged student contributions and engagement with the material. I don't see many ways how it could be improved without impacting the core lessons of the class.",
                "I like the format right now",
                "This course was very interesting and class discussions were often quite lively. I enjoyed examining history from so many unique lenses. The primary weakness of the course was the disparity between homework and class itself; the reading load for this class often felt excessive in light of class discussions, which typically only engaged with the homework texts at a birds-eye level that made the hours upon hours of reading feel a bit fruitless. Additionally, class discussions occasionally became so abstract that I had difficulty following certain trains of thought, which made it difficult for me to participate confidently and productively.",
                "Strengths were the variety of readings and student engagement - loved the class environment. However, at the end of each class, it would be useful to have a quick summary of main points covered in class or at beginning of next class outline the goals so that while we had a lot of personal takeaways, we had formal class wide learnings as well.  More feedback on writing would be useful.",
                "The course is amazing overall, and even though the discussion was less smooth in the first few weeks, I think that is often the case for seminars.",
                "intellectually, this course is fascinating. it definitely pushed me to think differently, and the things you learn in this course are super applicable to so many other subjects (and just the way you interact w the world). the readings can definitely be a lot, and sometimes you have only one class to discuss two whole books, so it can sometimes feel like the readings aren't totally worthwhile. that being said, doing the readings makes class much more engaging. sometimes it feels like the class discussions lack structure, but if you just embrace that and stay present in class, the discussions will be super interesting and meaningful. you get out what you put in in terms of class participation. our class definitely got more comfortable as the semester progressed, and our the depth of our discussions reflected that progression."

It's the kind of course that makes you feel like youve developed as a person  not because youve gained a new academic interest, or learned cool new techniques, but because you see the world with completely new eyes. Im truly not sure Ill ever have another course in college so formative, meaningful, and moving as this one, which is something I cant write lightly as a first-year. If you get in: take it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The opportunity to learn in a small group setting from such a distinguished professor is unmatched. I felt after this course like I had learnt what I'd hoped to coming to Yale. I think it is one of those courses that makes any student more prepared for life at and after Yale. It helps guide anyone's direction, as the discipline of history is more applicable to our lives than one might anticipate. The material taught in this course is truly unique and I don't think it could be taught by any other means or by any form of replication.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student; Professor Gaddis helps students to understand the importance of history and he also teaches new methods on how to analyze and interpret it.",
                "Yes for everyone if you get the lottery",
                "Yes, absolutely. This course teaches you to look at history in new and often confounding ways, and I think students would enjoy and take much away from  class discussions with Professor Gaddis.",
                "Yes - it is great for getting adjusted to yale, making friends, and reading texts that change how you think about history (even though you may realize it only later how cool they were).",
                "This course is a great precursor to basically any of the studies you will be interested in at Yale, so I would recommend taking it, especially if you are not intimidated by the amount of reading.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! If you're looking to jump into intense intellectual challenge right when you get to Yale, this course is definitely for you. This course is definitely challenging, but after the first month or so, I felt like our class settled in and felt much more comfortable. Once you get into the groove of the course, it's much easier to manage. That being said, definitely take advantage of office hours meetings with Professor Gaddis. A lot of the paper topics are somewhat vague and require a decent amount of creativity, and Prof. Gaddis is super helpful and gives great writing guidance. With this course, you get out what you put in -- doing your readings, participating in class discussion, and meeting with Prof. Gaddis outside of class will make the class much more meaningful and worthwhile. Absolutely take this course, but be prepared to give it your all!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student if willing to handle the reading load. It's an opportunity you shouldn't pass up, and it will really push you to think more critically and change your view of history."
