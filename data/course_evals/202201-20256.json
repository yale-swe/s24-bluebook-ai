I came in thinking I was going to learn technical jargon and complex sentence construction like I saw in the judicial opinions Id read. Instead, we learned to write simply and elegantly. I would strongly recommend this class for someone at the beginning of their Yale career. I wish I had taken it earlier.",
                "I learned how to write clearly and concisely --- this class has helped me become a better writer and thinker more than any other class I've taken at Yale. I also learned about how to think like a lawyer and the many questions the law raises.",
                "This course taught me so many skills that will carry me well beyond school. This course has made me a better writer (duh), thinker, opinion-maker, peer. It has made me engage more enthusiastically and creatively with school than I ever have before.",
                "I learned how to think about the law, evaluate legal arguments, and make legal arguments.",
                "This course is named perfectly. First, I developed the ability to think critically about issues using a legal framework. And second, I can now skillfully edit my own writing and craft clear, sharp sentences. Professor Ehrgood did an amazing job teaching us a simple writing style that is clear and principled. I've never been taught writing in such a structured way and it felt like I was being taught how to ride a bike for the first time. Although the legalistic writing style he taught us isn't suited for all types of writing (may not work as well for creative fiction / non fiction), it is an incredibly useful toolbox that I can now always lean on.",
                "This class teaches you the important skill of thinking critically about each word that you write.",
                "The feedback structure in English 121 was fantastic. You have one-on-one meetings with Professor Ehrgood where he gives extensive feedback on your writing style and structure. The class also provides feedback on your second paper, which was less helpful, but also entertaining to look through. This was the most I've ever learned in an English class at Yale. If you enjoyed English 114, take this class; you will have a blast.",

                "Honestly, this course was amazing. Professor Ehrgood is so dedicated and the assignments were engaging and rewarding. Its a lot of work for the first few weeks but its worth it. Some of my favorite parts of the class were the one-on-one meetings and the in-class workshops. Going in, I was hoping to read more actual judicial opinions, but I dont think it would be worth taking time away from anything the class is doing now.",
                "Strengths: Professor Ehrgood is literally the best, most involved professor I've ever had. He goes out of his way to help you succeed in the class. He provides such detailed written and verbal feedback which really helps you become a better writer. The tutorials after Spring Break were fun and productive, as well as a nice break from the weekly assignments. I liked focusing on the Spelunkers case throughout the semester and came away with a more nuanced understanding of the law. Weaknesses: maybe a bit more clarity on how we're doing in the class grade-wise but otherwise none.",
                "Strengths: this course taught me how to say things that sound powerful and to make people listen to me. Well organized course, difficult but eased up at the end. \r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This course was fantastic. Even though there was a lot of work in the first half of the semester, it all felt worthwhile; everything we did had a purpose and helped further my understanding of the law.",
                "The course structure is amazing. Although it was challenging the first 8 weeks, I enjoyed how clear all pset-style writing assignments were. I always felt like I was learning or developing either my writing or critical thinking skills every week. I also enjoyed how often Professor Ehrgood would give us feedback on our writing (we had to schedule five one on ones with him throughout the semester). \r\n\r\nIn all honesty, I can't think of any weaknesses that don't feel nitpicky. The only possible one is that I wish we had more opportunities to practice the writing style we were taught in the first eight weeks of the semester. Otherwise, everything was great!",
                "Strengths: This class is extremely structured, and the feedback is thorough and clear.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I went through the whole semester not really knowing how I was doing in the course.",
                "Strengths: This course was extremely engaging. The essay prompts are a blast and class discussions were always interesting. Professor Ehrgood's feedback was very helpful and the one-on-one meetings he had with students were informative.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The deadlines for papers were a little confusing, although they were available (you just have to dig for them). This was a very minor issue, and otherwise I found no weaknesses with the course.",
                "This course is one of the best courses offered at Yale. The readings were engaging, I received so many comments on my writing from Professor Ehrgood and my classmates. My only suggestion would be to make the coursework/courseload more consistent throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: Professor Ehrgood cares so very much, though I dont believe he will be teaching the course again. The course content is highly captivating and will challenge you to write concisely and precisely.\r\nWeaknesses: Its difficult, and theres a fair bit of work, if you consider that a weakness."

                "YES. Im not sure if this class is being taught by professor Ehrgood again, but if it is you should absolutely take it. I would recommend this class to anyone willing to do the work. I think no matter your major or plans for life you will get something valuable out of it. Not only do you get to learn how to write better, you also get to express yourself and do deep work on writing pieces. Its really not like any other class Ive taken at this school.",
                "Definitely! This was probably the best course I've taken at Yale so far. I became a better writer because this class allowed me to pinpoint the qualities that make writing good (or not). It was a good balance of style work and the law, and I looked forward to coming to class every week. The papers were engaging and intellectually stimulating, and Professor Ehrgood did a great job of facilitating the seminar. Professor Ehrgood was the best part of the course. I have never had a professor dedicate so much time to helping us. He met with each of us four times outside of class officially for 45+ min to discuss our assignments and feedback (in which he would include pages and pages of constructive feedback and praise) and was always available for additional meetings on short notice. Through his teaching I learned so much about writing and the law. Take this class regardless if you want to go to law school!",
                "10000 times over. Take this course. I had no legal background or interest going into this course, but that doesnt matter. My writing skills were sharpened like a knife.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Anyone even considering law school should take this course. Even students  not directly interested in law will improve their writing and argumentation skills.",
                "Yes! Take this course if you want to hone your critical thinking and develop a clearer writing style you can use everywhere. This course is a serious time commitment though, so only take it if you can properly fit it into your schedule. On average, I spent about seven to eight serious hours on the weekly homework and know classmates that spent less and more time. As with any course, you will get the most out of this class if you can spend the time to appreciate and immerse yourself in the material. Luckily, the last four weeks of the semester are relatively light, but if you anticipate having a heavy workload in the first eight weeks of the semester, I'd think seriously if you have the time.",
                "Yes, this is a great class to hone important writing principles.",
                "Absolutely. This course was a highlight of my semester. If you have a chance to take a class with Professor Ehrgood, do it. It won't just be Ehrgood, it will be Ehrgreat.",
                "Absolutely! The two classes I would recommend all Yale students take at some point are ENGL 120 and ENGL 121. Both classes are challenging and will help you become a better writer.",
                "Take this course and plan on it being your number 1 course for the semester. Take any course with Professor Ehrgood. For every bit of effort you put into working with him, you will be rewarded tenfold with improvements in your thinking and writing.",
                "Absolutely, regardless of your interest in the law, but especially so if youre interested in the law. This is among my favorite two courses at Yale.",
                "Yes. Especially students who are interested in the law, and want to improve their writing."
