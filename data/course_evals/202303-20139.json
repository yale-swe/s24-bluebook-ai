            "comments": [
                "Professor is clearly very knowledgeable and the readings are well curated. One primary weakness is the method of discussion, which was initially polarizing (the Professor would reject any interpretation incongruous with his own as lacking textual basis).",
                "The course was interesting to be in because of how intelligent the instructor is. He seems to be very invested in the texts that he gave us, which did help me surmount other issues I had with the readings and course. One such issue is that the course is a little bit more of a literature course than a philosophy course  I had imagined the latter when I read the title. I often found myself yearning for discussions of the politics of Voltaire's writings, which are so fascinatingly fraught. The instructor did not seem happy to indulge those interests and avoided those topics during the course, which developed into a culture of avoiding any of the aspects of Voltaire's texts that are problematic or polemic for today's reader. Discussing what was problematic for Voltaire's time, while a very standard approach, did sometimes feel hard to invest in.\r\n\r\nThe instructor is a very intelligent teacher who is clearly invested in the texts he is assigning and does his best to question his students and draw more out of their arguments in class. I feel that feedback on writing is where this course could most improve: more feedback and more specific comments along with action items (where specifically students can improve) would have helped me perform better.",
                "By reading only one author, this course feels somewhat repetitive. Voltaire often tends to reiterate his opinions making some books feel unoriginal. This course could be improved by diversifying the text list.",
                "Prof. Saint-Amand is very knowledgeable and passionate. However, the structure of the class is lacking as there is not much cohesion between the different readings, and the readings mainly feel very disjoint. The class would have benefited if there was some more reflection on the greater role of Voltaire's writings. While Prof is extremely kind, his passion for the material is sometimes intimidating, as if you say something that he may not agree with, an extremely long discussion will occur. He is also a slightly tough grader, but if you are used to writing papers about philosophy it should be fine."

                "Yes, for anyone who loves Voltaire!",
                "I would recommend this course to those students that are interested in reading Voltaire from a literary and somewhat philosophical paradigm. I encourage such a student to consider whether they are prepared to read only Voltaire during the course (although you should reflect on this just by reading the course title, it is worth clarifying that you really are just reading Voltaire and no/few other commentaries/background texts, etc).",
                "If youre really interested in Voltairan philosophy or French literature, this is the course for you, but dont expect it to completely change your mind if youre not that.",
                "This is a really good class if you want to greatly increase your reading and discussion skills in French. The texts are not too challenging, but require time to sit down and read. The discussion largely depends on the group of people in your class - unfortunately, my class this semester was a little bit hostile which made conversation stale more than once during the semester. But I loved the readings and professor Amand is extremely knowledgeable and a great professor!",
                "If you want to read voltaire, then yes. However, there are more interesting French L5 classes that feel more cohesive as opposed to this course which feels like just reading one book after another and discussing them with little connection to each other. Pierre is extremely nice and knowledgable though."
