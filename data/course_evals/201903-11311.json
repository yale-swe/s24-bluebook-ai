   "comments": [
    "Lectures\/structure were a good introduction to conducting research if you've never done so before--practicing skills like presenting your research to others, writing about it and figure-making, etc.",
    "The course taught by Joran was particularly helpful, we learned proper techniques for designing and presenting a slide show, how to properly write and format written engineering reports, and how to best read technical articles.",
    "How to present and write technical reports.",
    "This was the capstone project for my Mech E BA degree.  I learned how to do a research project that utilized the information I've learned in my engineering classes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the greatest improvement would be differentiating between students conducting research for the first time and those who are more experienced and are working at their own pace within their lab but looking to get credit for it. A great introductory class though; the lectures surveyed a lot of useful tools or practices necessary when doing research.",
    "I hated my actual research, it was kind of the worst part of my semester, but this class itself was very strong. Not too demanding, but very useful.",
    "This course was fine, the deadlines were good to make sure everyone was on track.",
    "I thought the class deliverables (three speeches, a couple midterm reports) were well organized to help you learn skills beyond just research.  I thought the class seminar meetings were sometimes not that useful and could've probably been covered in less time.  My main complaint about the class, however, was that I did not receive any grades at all throughout the entire semester.  I had no idea whether the work I was doing was in line with my professor's expectations.",
    "The strength of this course is that it allows you to receive credit for independent research. I think this course would be improved if its focus was shifted away from skills like presenting, writing and reading and towards getting us to understand different career paths in mechanical engineering. Perhaps bring in speakers from a variety of fields to talk about their experiences?"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I did an independent design project, which was highly engaging, so the semester was pleasant. You meet weekly with a small group of peers and with Professor Booth, discussing a variety of topics; how to present effectively, how to write a final report, etc. The lectures with Professor Booth are useful to the assigned work of the class, but intuitively not to your personal project or research. As such, they can feel a bit disconnected from your true work. Nevertheless, if you're reading this, you probably have to take the course. So choose your research or independent topic thoughtfully, and it'll be a great semester.",
    "If you want to do research for credit it's pretty good and overall not a *ton* of extra work, but I do think you need to be very personally-driven if working on an independent project or driven by the professor\/collaborator you are working with. The class is very much a supplement to that.",
    "I would only take this course if you have a research topic\/project that you are very invested in or interested in and if you already have an established relationship with your advisor so that you know they will not be difficult or unreasonable.",
    "Yes if you would like some practice with pitching, presenting, etc...",
    "Sure, I mean you probably need to take this class if you're a senior Mech E who is not ABET.  I think the key is finding a project you're really interested in rather than just asking around once the semester has already started.  Start your research early."
