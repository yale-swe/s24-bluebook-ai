                "It is not often that you get to study Women Filmmakers across all the Film and Media Studies course offerings here, so this was a welcome opportunity! We got to watch and analyze film, read and digest relevant theory, and learn the uncelebrated histories of many women who contributed to the development of modern cinema.",
                "I enjoyed our class discussions and filmmaker presentations. Could be helpful to space out presentations more evenly (had a lot at the end).",
                "I think this course was great, I really enjoyed putting together my personal presentation on a director for the whole class to see.",
                "No weaknesses. Only strengths: Prof, readings, she is an amazing discussion leader.",
                "Professor is excellent, discussions are interesting, film selection is nigh perfect, course structure for homework is good (discussion posts on weekly films, one presentation during the semester, a blog post, and a final essay). The course boosted engagement through really interesting and relevant discussions around the films we watched. Theres a nice emphasis on comparing films across the course which is really appreciated.\r\n\r\nAnother huge strength is that Professor Chefranova has very interesting, talented, and successful filmmaker friends who came into class to speak to us about their work, life and process. This is invaluable to anyone interested in film or the creative arts, and is what Ill remember most about the course.\r\n\r\nThe readings were always interesting, with a fairly reasonable length, although the quantity varied a little too much from week to week. On top of the 2-3 required screenings, there was pretty much no time at all to do the optional additional work.\r\n\r\nThe presentations were another favorite part of the course as students were given free reign to go all in on a filmmaker of their choice, and Chefranova always made it exciting to listen to those at the beginning of class.\r\n\r\nThe discussion format of the class was great for students who engaged but many people in the class just sat there in silence on their laptops doing nothing. The Professor might consider finding ways to engage students newer to film studies by reviewing some fundamental analytic skills, or just including them more, to encourage those students to participate.",
                "We would have a lot of films and readings each week and never have time to get through all of them. The class was also more lecture-like than seminar. Having more concentrated topics each week and encouraging students to lead discussions could help address this. \r\nI did love the guest speakers and the content itself."

I would try to take a foundational film analysis class first, but that's just a preference; this class is accessible to anyone.",
                "YESSSSSSSSSSSS!",
                "This course will help you learn that there is a wonderful world of women filmmakers with important things to say that extends far beyond Barbie and the mainstream. Thanks to an amazing professor and syllabus, anyone can get something great out of this course if they put in the reasonable amount of work required to get through.\r\nIf you are looking for a great film credit and have some experience with literary\/film criticism take this one now. If you havent taken a film class at all yet, I would consider taking close analysis before this one, as some of the students newer to film theory struggled to engage (but some also engaged well!)",
                "good class content",
                "Yes, absolutely. Whether you are an amateur film student or have more experience, you can learn a lot from this class."
