                "More learning into ASL grammar and conversation",
                "ASL 130 continues to teach about Deaf history and Deaf culture while expanding vocabulary to increase descriptive ability. More conversational vocab was also introduced. After this class, you can use ASL to chat about the weekend, describe your home or dorm, know the signs for many many cities and countries, understand more terminology about Deaf culture, and give more detailed descriptions of things in general (color, texture, shape, size, orientation, etc). Lots of the lectures covered the history of Deaf Art and Deaf Media, including theatre, publications, etc.",
                "I gained further knowledge and skills in ASL and Deaf Culture. After three semesters, I can confidently say ASL 130 taught me the most about issues that the Deaf community faces. I feel like this last semester touched a lot more on the history of the Deaf community which I enjoyed a lot.",

            "comments": [
                "The course is very well designed to have a reasonable workload while also covering a lot of content. The service projects could be more refined because at times they felt really up in the air/unclear, but overall the course ran smoothly. Dr. Conlin could also give more timely feedback to improve the course.",
                "ASL 3 was an extremely engaging course. The build up to our service project throughout the semester felt like the perfect way to put all that we'd learned over the semester into practice. Prof. Conlin also always makes class an engaging, exciting experience; this can be pretty difficult for a course meeting everyday. \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue I had with the course was the amount of work it demanded outside of class, especially considering the work outside of class does not have a great effect on our grade. Our service project, which takes up a great chunk of time throughout the semester, ends up only being about 15% of the class grade. For future iterations of the course I would recommend putting more academic weight towards the service project as opposed to quizzes and homework considering this is where majority of our energy is delegated.",
                "I think that this course was very interactive and required active participation, which I appreciated. Instructors were very patient and understanding of student circumstances. However, one qualm I had were that I felt like exams were not well coordinated between instructors. I felt that exam prompts from Andrew were oftentimes beyond the depth between what I was used to from Professor Conlins classes.",
                "Meeting daily and reviewing the topics from the previous class helps dramatically with acquisition and retention. Therefore the basic structure of the class is a major strength in itself. However, at least for the early sections, attendance can be spotty, and as it isn't very enforced, you can fall behind if you miss too many classes. That's the case in any class, though, so it can't really be said to be a weakness. In fact, I can't think of any particular weaknesses! The class environment is extremely friendly and welcoming; the topics are modern and interesting. I really appreciated how modern vocabulary was introduced in the course this semester (e.g., the gender-neutral sign for \"parents,\" rather than the old sign that combined the signs for \"mom\" and \"dad\";  the signs for \"partner\" or \"nonbinary\" were also taught).",
                "The strengths of this class is the service projects, small classroom settings, and the professors. These three components are the most impactful on the education of students on the topic of Deaf culture and without them, the class wouldn't have been as enjoyable. There really weren't any weakness for me.",
                "Everyday you are immersed in the language which leads to a great level of comfort signing. It can be difficult to engage with the language outside of class."

I felt like I hit my stride a bit in this course. You bond more with your classmates and learn more applicable terminology. You really start to feel like you understand some Sign Language! It's a good time!",
                "I would recommend this course. Not only is it a language class so it helps with distributional requirements, it really educates you beyond that and makes you face parts of history that is often overlooked. Learning about Deaf culture and the history of the Deaf community has been such an irreplaceable experience during my time at Yale and truly changed my way of thinking.",
                "I think ASL is a great option for student's language credit especially if people are looking for a language that they may not have as much of a background. The visual aspect of the language is very different than anything else and it works your brain in a different way."
