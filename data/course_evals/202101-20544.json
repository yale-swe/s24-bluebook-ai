                "I became familiar with a large amount of Federico Garca Lorca's completed works, learned quite a bit about his own importance in the culture of Spanish literature and the history of Spain, and got to practice my academic writing in Spanish.",
                "I learned lot about Federico Garca Lorca, honed my Spanish skills, and improved my poetry and prose critique. For me, the Spanish reading and speaking was most helpful, as I enjoy having a course that helps me keep up my skills, but the historical information and general literature critiquing skills were an excellent bonus.",
                "I learned a lot about the history surrounding Lorca's life and death. I also developed how I read his works and Spanish literature in general.",
                "I learned a lot about how to critically analyze poetry and write coherently in Spanish, as well as forming an argument.",
                "By taking this course I developed an appreciation for the work of the Spanish poet Federico Garca Lorca. In addition my proficiency in Spanish was improved.",
                "I learned about Lorca: as a person, as a poet, as a playwright, as part of a broader historical and literary context, as an iconic figure. I also improved my Spanish speaking, reading, listening, and writing skills.",
                "I gained knowledge and insight into the literary world of Lorca. I reflected on topics such as mystery, desire, social norms, oppression, life and death, and the marginalized. I also learned a bit of 20th century Spanish history, since we discussed the Spanish Civi War and Franco's regime. Additionally, I gained significant practice in my reading and writing skills in Spanish.",
                "I feel like my writing in Spanish improved greatly throughout the semester.",
                "Lots of insights into the artistic culture leading up to the Spanish civil war. Practice speaking Spanish, understanding, and writing in Spanish.",
                "I developed my close reading and literature analysis skills by a great deal, as well as my Spanish skills.",
                "This course taught me how to think deeply and carefully about the content that I am reading.",
                "I gained an even deeper appreciation for Spanish literature and culture, something for which I will always be grateful! Of course, I also sharpened my skills as a critical thinker and writer.",
                "I come away from this course with a great appreciation for Lorca's works. Professor Valis imbues the class with such enthusiasm that it's easy to also be entralled. Another takeaway from this course has to be poetry analysis in Spanish. I have taken other courses in the department, but none really allows students to develop this skill in quite the same way.",
                "We focused on Lorcas works, as well as others work written about him. Though the class seems a bit one dimensional, in that it is very concentrated, the skills we learn can be applied to other fields of literature, in other languages.",
                "The course helped to sharpen my Spanish writing skills, and my ability to analyze poetry and literature in Spanish.",
                "My Spanish vocabulary and academic writing skills improved immensely in this class, as well as my skills at analyzing poetry. This course encouraged me to read closely and draw connections throughout the works of a singular author.",
                "I learned about Federico Garcia Lorcas life, history and some of his most important works. This was mainly a literature class, so we learned many plays, poems and articles written or about Lorda.",
                "This course did a good job in improving my analysis skills. I struggled with analyzing certain works of literature like poetry, but after taking Professor Valis class I feel as though I improved.",
                "Knowledge of Spanish culture, knowledge of Lorca (the poet) and his works. Did not really improve my writing or speaking skills for Spanish.",
                "I feel I learned how to engage with material in a new way through this course. I have taken a few seminar style literature courses but given the virtual format and large class size I was forced to push myself to engage with the text on my own more and I really enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the opportunity to hear Prof. Valis lecture on a topic that she is incredibly passionate about that she might not have had the opportunity to do in a seminar setting.",
                "This course aided me in improving my Spanish and helped me gain skills in analyzing poetry in Spanish. It challenged my understanding through pushing it to metaphorical and symbolic levels.",

            "comments": [
                "The content itself was very interesting, but the format should have been planned to better accommodate the amount of students. It seemed like it wanted to be a seminar, but did not have enough avenues of engagement for all the students. There was very little incentive to be engaged. Additionally, the participation was weighed extremely heavily in the final grade even though the class format would have made it impossible for everyone to participate in each class. This happened because the midterm had to be eliminated because the professor did not have the bandwidth to grade all of them.",
                "I think that this course might be improved if it were cappedwhile there were nearly 40 students in the class, only 8-10 participated on a regular basis, which I think might have been improved if there were fewer people overall in the course. However, I thought that this was an overall excellent course! It was well taught and well curated for student learning. I appreciated how the poetry and plays were intermixed throughout the syllabus, and was glad that I was able to revisit poetry critique after a semester of learning more about Lorca and his writing.",
                "The course would be better if it were either capped, because it is supposed to be a seminar. It mostly felt like just a lecture. Didn't get to discuss with students very much at all. It was mostly the Professor talking at us and then allowing us to speak a bit.\r\n\r\nThe material is interesting. I think it was great that the readings were all available on canvas. The professor is also very fast with responding with emails.",
                "Professor Valis is very engaged, which helps promote an appreciation for the content. However, it might help if the class were smaller because seminars of this size can be overwhelming.",
                "Strenghts- professora valis is AMAZING! it was such a privilege to be in this course. Weakness- sometimes it's hard to understand exactly what profesora is looking for in the essays. A sample would have been helpful/",
                "I think the course might have been more engaging if there were a limit on the number of students. That said, I was really impressed by how \"seminar-like\" the course felt despite its size. The readings were interesting and logically chosen, and there was a good mix of work by Lorca, work by other authors, and scholarly work about Lorca. Professor Valis was a great lecturer, and I was never bored.",
                "The class is well structured and explores a variety of literary works from Lorca. I really enjoyed having a mix of poetry, play, and critical analysis essays. I also really enjoyed discussing images, paintings, news article headlines, and short-films related to the topic of the day. This was a great way to give context to the literary pieces we were reading. One way to improve the class would be to add more breakout sessions, since it makes it easier to interact with and learn from others.",
                "The course was very well taught",
                "Over zoom, the weakness was being able to hide behind the computer, and not practicing my speaking as much as in person. In person, I cant imagine there would be any weaknesses. Professor Valis was phenomenal, kind, and so excited about teaching this class.",
                "The strength of this course was really the material, all of the works we read in class were phenomenal and Professor Valis curated them along with secondary readings very well.",
                "Something that could be improved from the course is spending more time on how to write a literary analysis, or at least have the option to turn in a non-grades rough draft before our final draft. Something that I thought the course did well is not assigning too much work, which, in turn, made me enjoy the readings more.",
                "This class is absolutely fantastic!! The only weakness that I can think of (and it is inevitable given that this is a seminar) is that I would love to be able to hear more from Prof. Valis! While I love the seminar format, the times in which she would share her insights about some aspect of a particular work were incredibly helpful and thought-provoking!",
                "The professor is great at keeping the class engaging through videos and images, which is a huge strength. I think the guidance on papers could be improved however, given that very little information is given about them other than what is on the syllabus. Overall, an amazing course though.",
                "It's perfect!!",
                "Strengths: Professor Valis is a strength in the sense that she imbues the class with her appreciation of Lorca's works. The syllabus includes works by Lorca in several mediums, including poetry and plays (as the title would suggest), but also an essay. There are also secondary commentaries, as well as other works relating to Lorca's works or commenting on Lorca himself (including short films like Buuel's Un perro andaluz). These works provide additional perspective on what we read and I think were carefully-chosen. Professor Valis also makes herself available to students and is happy to meet and discuss the works. The major assignments included three short (2-3 page) and a final paper. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Participation was uneven (with some students speaking often each class and others almost not at all the whole semester). I'm not sure if this was because the class was large (though I'm really, really glad the class wasn't capped; everyone should get the opportunity to study these works if they'd like) or if it was a function of being on Zoom. There were some instances that enabled participation, including assigning stanzas to students and having each student speak, as well as breakout rooms. Additionally, I'd add that there weren't many moments that involved critique of Lorca (for example, Romancero gitano centers partly on the Romani people, but as an aesthetic and thematic element. We briefly touched on this, as a student brought it up in discussion, but otherwise, I don't think we would have commented on it). The syllabus was strong, but sometimes we weren't able to discuss some of the works we read.",
                "Professor Valis is a strength of the course as she is very passionate about Lorca and very knowledgeable on topics related to him. The emphasis on discussion even within the larger setting also helps keep engagement higher throughout the class though I'd suggest breaking up discussions with periods of lecture. Readings were great for the most part.",
                "The readings are interesting and manageable, the conversations in class went well. I enjoyed reading the poetry and plays--maybe the course could be enhanced by either mandatory or optional viewings of performances of the plays.",
                "Strength: Professor Valis is a passionate and knowledgeable professor who poses great discussion questions and provides detailed feedback on work. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The class was quite large (>40 students), which made it hard to participate regularly and get to know other students.",
                "Profesora Valis is very passionate about the course material and was probably the biggest strength of this class. The largest downside was that the class was WAY too large to be a seminar. Many people ended up going through the full semester without saying a single thing during live sections.",
                "THE only weakness to this course was that it was not recorded. There were times I wanted to go back and rewatch the class discussions but was unable to. Besides that, I do think that the class was organized well and that the works chosen for our readings were carefully curated.",
                "Overall this course was really well taught. Given that it was Prof. Valis' first semester teaching on Zoom I was incredibly impressed. If we are to continue in a virtual setting a bit more use of breakout rooms would help to facilitate a bit more group discussion, but overall it was a very well taught course.",
                "This class was very well taught, Profesora Valis does an incredible job. The content is interesting and actively pushes students to a different level of Spanish fluency.",
                "The course was very engaging and the material covered was thoroughly discussed throughout the course. The class discussions and papers facilitated learning and collaboration."

                "This course did not adapt well to Zoom given its low incentive for engagement and trouble dealing with so many students, Zoom made it even easier to turn off our cameras and not engage, which was the case for at least half the class by a couple of weeks into the semester.",
                "I think that a large seminar is quite difficult on ZoomI was able to participate and felt comfortable speaking up in class, but a large portion of the class never or rarely participated, which I think may have been a product of the large class and Zoom format.",
                "It was supposed to be a seminar, but just the nature of zoom made it essentially a lecture where students could occasionally chime in. A smaller class might have made that better, or else a seminar with groups split up more where we could discuss with each other.",
                "The lectures were very engaging. I don't have any improvements.",
                "Professor Valis often shared her screen to show us images or works of art, which I found to be an effective strategy for virtual learning. She also strongly encouraged (but did not require) students to turn on their cameras, which contributed to the seminar \"feel.\" Finally, she used breakout rooms to divide questions between students and to encourage smaller group discussions. (This is not a specific criticism of Professor Valis's course, but I continue to feel ambivalent about how effective breakout rooms are as a pedagogical tool. Awkward silence is much more common than lively discussion when students are randomly assigned to smaller rooms and given a question to explore.)",
                "It was very difficult to have the class online. For some, participation may have been easier, but for me it required a little more effort to speak up. Some helpful practices were breakout sessions. These made it easier to participate and to engage with other students. Another thing that was helpful was assigning groups of students a set of questions before class. We had the opportunity to discuss in small groups and then to participate with the entire class.",

                "I believe the seminar format of the class was changed to include a higher enrollment cap. While it's great that the course was available to more students, it would have been better to keep the course in a smaller seminar style class as I believe it is normally held.",
                "Perhaps something that could help is to have every lecture recorded for students to reference back when writing their papers. However, I appreciated how, as mentioned above, we were encouraged to participate in a discussion but not forced to.",

                "I wouldn't ask for anything else. Professor Valis worked so hard to create a vibrant intellectual atmosphere!",
                "I think that it was challenging for some folks to speak up, which I think partially was a challenge born from Zoom. A couple practices were attempted to spawn engagement (including breakout rooms and one lecture where everyone was assigned a section and we one by one shared thoughts on it). Honestly, I'm not sure what would be the best way to make people feel more comfortable sharing on Zoom would be.",
                "Breakout rooms were not utilized to the best of their ability I feel like.",
                "The adaptation to Zoom was very successful. It was clear towards the end of the semester the level of student engagement started to decline although this is a phenomenon not unique to this semester nor to this class. The use of breakout rooms and screen sharing was very successful and Prof Valis was able to lecture very well virtually.",

                "If you need a Spanish class at this level, then yeah. I'm sure it's better in person, it was just okay on zoom. You won't have much of a chance to practice speaking spanish, it's easier to follow her lecturing if you know spanish well, but a bit more difficult if you aren't a native speaker that actually knows spanish well or if you weren't a student that's taken many L5s. If you're a heritage speaker but you know you aren't that good even though you are know L5/placed into L5, it'll be a bit more difficult. If you're not a heritage speaker I would wait until after taking another L5 class before taking this one.\r\n\r\nIt's also not capped, so it's a very big seminar, but it's essentially a lecture where the Professor just talks at you, there isn't very much time to participate even though participation is graded.

                "Yes, especially if you enjoy poetry and plays - the work of Lorca is very well suited to in depth study.",
                "Yes - assuming, of course, the student speaks Spanish and wants to learn about Lorca. Don't take it just to satisfy the L5 requirement; take it because you want to.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! I had never read (or hear of) Lorca before, so I had little idea of what to expect. After finishing the class, I can say that it is very worth it! His literary works have never failed to leave me pondering about life. The class has been very rewarding and has expanded my knowledge of 20th century Spanish works and history.",
                "Yes it was very interesting",
                "Absolutely. If youre interested in literature, poetry, history, or even just themes such as life/death, gender, mystery, desire, and more, this course will not disappoint.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants an interesting Spanish L5 for sure. The material itself is very good and enjoyable to read on its own. I'd be ready to do some in depth literature analysis, but those skills can be developed throughout the semester (as mine were).",
                "If students have a rudimentary knowledge of who Lorca is and are eager to learn more about him (and are pretty comfortable with Spanish), then I would recommend that they give the course a shot.",
                "Absolutely take this course! Prof. Valis is amazing and so invested in students learning! If youre not already in love with Lorca when you start this course, you will be by the end!",
                "Yes, of course! I could not have chosen a better course to take in my final semester as an undergraduate. I have already recommended this seminar to many students.",
                "Yes, I would this course to someone that is interested in Lorca, Lorca's works, or in poetry and plays more generally. The short papers are a great way to get practice with close analysis of the texts and the final essay gives you a lot of freedom to focus on the elements of the course that you found most interesting. Professor Valis is so enthusiastic and really imbues her enthusiasm for Lorca into the course. I also really enjoyed getting the chance to do some poetry analysis in Spanish. I also think the reading is broken down into really digestable chunks that lets you think about it more deeply. I think full-class participation in discussion wasn't quite there (but I think that's mostly due to Zoom).",
                "I think this class is a great L5 for students seeking to explore poetry and other forms of literature in Spanish. This class was particularly exciting for me because of its emphasis on plays - people interested in theatre will find the course very interesting. Professor Valis is also very kind, understanding, and knowledgeable.",
                "Absolutely. The course offers a wonderful introduction to Lorca's incredible works, Professor Valis is a lovely person and passionate educator, and my Spanish definitely improved through the readings and writing assignments.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is passionate about poetry or theater or who is looking to fulfill their L5 language requirement. However, if youre looking to practice speaking Spanish I would recommend a conversation class or a class with a smaller size.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student looking for a chill language credit. The workload is very manageable.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student, especially a student looking to take an L5 class. I feel as though I did benefit from being in this class, and in addition, the engagement in the Spanish department is unmatched.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in Spanish literature. Although a higher numerical course in the Spanish department this course is not necessarily for high level students and anyone past L4 would be very comfortable. On the other hand, there is an immense amount to be gleaned from the texts presented and even advanced literature or Spanish students would be very interested in this class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Federico Garca Lorca's works are fascinating and overall the course is very well taught.",
                "I would definitely recommend taking this course! You become a Lorca expert and greatly improve your Spanish through the assigned essays and class discussions."
