    "I learned about Yale history, traditions, and cultural impact",
    "This class was a big disappointment.  Lots of anecdotes about the professor's Yale days, without a deep sense of the larger significance . We learned some Yale history, without a great deal of connection to what was going on in the country as a whole.  If you want to learn old Yale cheers, band formations, stories about famous rich Yalies, this one's for you.",
    "Get a super close look at Yale history with so many great stories about people and places associated with the school",
    "You get to learn a lot about the history of Yale and relate it to current day issues. I think this is helpful for anyone wanting to understand why things are the way they have come to be and reflect on what circumstances will change the university today. Lots of cool history, but you need to be into Yale!",
    "I became a better writer and I also became better at participating in seminars.",
    "Yale has an incredible amount of history!",
    "I learned a lot about how to write a history paper.",
    "How to research and write long(er) papers, whether that be from archives or other primary sources.",
    "Obviously I learned plenty about Yale's history, which provided a fresh lens through which to analyze social and cultural trends in American history more generally, but perhaps the most important takeaways from the course related to the practice of history itself. Gitlin is a passionate historian, and in his teaching of Yale-American history he aims to do more than weave a compelling historical narrative, although he certainly does that--he also aims to show the methods by which such a narrative is weaved and the stakes of the weaving. Gitlin, in other words, does his best to make us historians as skilled as we are ethical, as effective as we are introspective. To be proficient is to be profound."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Prof G makes this class worth it, so much fun\r\nWeaknesses: The mini assignments are pretty time-consuming, and there are too many handouts (environmental impact)",
    "Professor Gitlin is FUN. He will make the classroom FUN. You're never going to say 'goddamit, I have to go to class with Professor Gitlin.' He's really FUN. And he picks a real mix of people for the seminar so there are good discussions.",
    "The day our teacher played piano, and we each performed our own versiono of a Cole Porter song, was memorable.",
    "Cannot think of a weakness!",
    "A must-take at Yale! Though it's advertised as a seminar, Professor Gitlin spends most of the class period talking. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as his stories, facts, and insights about Yale are fascinating and keep you engaged!",
    "The guest speakers and 'field trips' around campus were super fun and engaging! I think that there could be a little more discussion-based sessions within class, but overall, you get what you sign up for.",
    "Strengths - Professor Gitlin and the rich history of Yale.",
    "Strength is he subject matter weakness is there is so much to cover",
    "I think this course is great! Super interesting. No suggestions here.",
    "Professor Gitlin's enthusiasm is the biggest strength of this class - he is absolutely amazing! Also amazing material and readings.",
    "Brilliant professor, engaging source material, fun but educational class traditions--fittingly for a class about Yale, the ideal Yale seminar. Students who prefer more discussion-based seminars might not enjoy Gitlin's more lecture-y style, but I didn't personally find this to be an issue."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's a gem and Prof G fills the class with really diverse and interesting classmates",
    "YES! If you get in, take it. It's not much work besides the final paper and is a very nice way to spend your Thursday afternoons. The class is never dry (literally, we drink wine) and there are times we go outside the classroom and perform Cole Porter songs or spend time in the graveyard (spooky!). It's worth it, even as a sixth credit.",
    "No. Unless you want a very easy class, and nothing more.",
    "Absolutely, best class at Yale. There is great value in learning about this institution and Professor Gitlin is truly a one of a kind professor.",
    "Yes! If you're questioning your own place at Yale or are a senior who is very unsure about what comes next, I recommend this course! You go over valuable history and truly get to reconsider what your presence here means for yourself and for Yale.",
    "Absolutely -- its different from many of Yale's standard history classes but much more rewarding.",
    "Yes!",
    "This course is a great way of understanding Yale on a much better level. It is very enlightening to be able to learn about the Yales of days before while experiencing contemporary Yale. Wish I had taken it earlier in my Yale career.",
    "Highly recommend! Wonderful class!",
    "LOVE THIS CLASS",
    "Yes, it's the bona fide best class at Yale.",
    "Yes! Especially as a senior. It's great knowing about the history of your institution.",
    "Absolutely 100%",
    "Gitlin would greet us at the start of every class with a blackboard buried in white chalk. Scribbled across the the dark surface would be a sprawling, dizzying array of historical figures, dates, places, and themes splattered about with no identifiable rhyme or reason. As class that day progressed, however, the enigmatic words comprising the blackboard's cauldron of chaos would slowly coalesce into a thematically cohesive narrative. I think that blackboard is a good metaphor for Gitlin's course, which is a wild ride that is still manages to be perfectly grounded and coherent. Prepare to learn about the synergy between Yale and American sociocultural history by composing songs, performing dance routines, and touring cemeteries. There are presentations and papers, of course, but the material is so compelling--no doubt in part because it's admittedly a bit narcissistic--that they turn out to be greatly enjoyable. Gitlin himself is a treasure, the sort of professor who completes the Yale experience. You can't graduate without enjoying him for at least a semester. His love for the material is simply infectious, his sheer energy ensures the class's ceaseless momentum, and he's just as eager to learn from his students as he is to teach them. \r\n\r\nOverall, highly recommended. You won't necessarily love every class session, but you will love the course. I can't think of a more fitting swan song of a class for one's Yale career. It'll help you appreciate Yale more, for sure, but it will also help you better appreciate what it means for yourself to have attended and lived this university. For all the wild fun, the course is ultimately deeply introspective. It's a great experience."
