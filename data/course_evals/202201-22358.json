Sometimes, the activities for asynchronous days take a while (definitely more than the 50 minutes of class time). I thought having required LinguaMeetings was very helpful as it allowed me to practice speaking in Spanish in a low-pressure environment, but with constructive feedback. The tests were at times challenging and unpredictable.",
                "This course teaches you a lot in a very short amount of time. I think that more feedback on the asynchronous assignments would be very helpful. I got nearly the same grade on every asynchronous assignment throughout the semester but never really knew how to improve. The course honestly had an ungodly amount of work  so much so that I felt like it hindered my learning progress. We shouldn't have to do online activities, an asynchronous activity, a weekly language meeting and study for an exam all at once.",
                "Weaknesses: the course is very fast paced, there is an overwhelming amount of daily homework\r\nStrengths: The material is engaging",
                "Strengths were many, particularly the group projects and constant class engagement. I would suggest that midterm participation feedback should be handed back sooner in the year. It was handed back very late with not much time to improve.",
