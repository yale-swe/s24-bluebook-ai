                "I loved the course format, particularly its situation around guests. College in prison and prison more broadly are one of those things that can only truly be understood by those that have experienced them, and having guests, many of which were formerly imprisoned or wrote extensively on the subject, was absolutely invaluable for our understanding of the subject matter. Apart from that, I really liked the discussion setup and general orientation of the course. That said, I think there were times the syllabus/course material got a bit repetitive.",
                "Having Zelda, Marcus, Shawn, Clyde, and Carl around made every class something to look forward to. The guest speakers were always really interesting since they had different backgrounds but all had experience with CIP programs. The trajectory of topics was well laid out, starting out with contexts and histories and building up to larger institutional questions as we got further along in the semester.",

                "I would! College in prison can only be truly understood by those who have experienced it, and this course's embeddedness within the college in prison system makes it fascinating. You learn from previously incarcerated people about the nature of education, its impacts on them, and broader philosophical takes on incarceration. If you are at all interested in mass incarceration, i highly recommend this class.",
