We touched on very important metaethical issues, and its helpful to think about them not only in philosophical contexts but also in general. Steve is also one of the most engaging instructors Ive had at Yale. I genuine looked forward to attending the class every week because of how interesting this stuff is and how much fun we had while learning. Do yourself a favor and take a class with Steve.",
