You will learn how to close read texts, how to put them in conversation with one another and have frank conversations about the most pressing issues, which may be rooted in theory, but have have very real implications."

                "Professor Lewis is fantastic. She is so so smart and knowledgeable about the topics of the class, this makes for incredibly enriching and layered class discussion. The downside of this is that some people might be intimidated by her command of the concepts and limit participation as a result. The content of this class is great, but you really do need full class participation to take it to the next level. Professor Lewis is so so welcoming and accommodating of all students, so people really should feel comfortable participating no matter what!! Perhaps it would also be good to move the course to earlier in the afternoon, it seemed like a lot of people also just hit a wall halfway through class bc of afternoon exhaustion!",
                "This class's main strength was Professor Lewis and the group of students who were committed to the material and each other. The reading load was fairly light with two 10-45 pg readings per week, but they are expertly chosen and grouped into themes. As a senior, these were some of the best readings I've done at Yale College. Professor Lewis is an absolute gem. The class could be improved by varying the conversation approach more regularly, rather than just looking at the content of each reading. That being said, to an extent, I appreciated this approach in that I had a better sense of what each reading was saying."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Gail Lewis is an amazing instructor. Any one who is able to take a course with her in the future should.",
                "Absolutely! If you are a black woman, or interested in this subject at all, I think that is so helpful to read the work of women around the world who are thinking through the same challenges as you. Definitely be ready to participate and form a class community as well, because I think that makes the learning experience all the better.",
                "Absolutely. This was without a doubt one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Although Professor Lewis probably won't be teaching again, it will likely still be illuminating and rewarding. If Professor Lewis does end up sticking around, please take a class with her."
