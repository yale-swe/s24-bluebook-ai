Students have to write a 25-page biography after discussing strengths and flaws of various biographies we read in class, which is rewarding and, for lack of a better term, cool. However, this class is a lot of work on a week-to-week basis, making it extremely hard to dedicate lots of time to the final project until near the end of the course.",

                "Yes, absolutely. It was the type of course I've always wanted to have as an undergraduate: very engaging and taught by a fantastic professor. Reading a full biography every week was quite a bit of work, but if you're able to give full effort it's also very rewarding.",
                "This course is what you make of it. If you engage with the material and the assignments, you will learn a lot. If you don't, it will be a long slog of boring work.",
                "Yes! Professor Gaddis has taught through many iterations of this course, so he knows which biographies to read and what questions to ask for effective discussion and learning. This course also provides an opportunity for doing original research at the Beinecke. It is a time consuming class, but one that is worth it for the class discussion and final project.",
                "Yes, without reservation.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "I strongly recommend this class. It is easily one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It is challenging, but incredibly rewarding. If you do the readings, which is a book a week, and putting in the work going through the archives and writing the paper, which I spent about 100 hours doing,  you will have a new perspective on memory and how to properly retell a life. The variety of biographies in the class, ranging from novels to more traditional works, were revelatory and fun to read. The final paper takes time but the work feels urgent."
