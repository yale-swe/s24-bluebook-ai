                "Knowledge of relativity and astronomical phenomena",
                "I learned so much about astronomy and black holes in this course that is genuinely interesting to me as a social sciences major! I enjoyed the bits of the course on the politics, history, and philosophy sides of astrophysics, and I learned quite a bit from the more mathematical sides of the course as well. I had no idea how much wider the world of physics was than the Newtonian physics you learn in high school, and I found it fun to think about the intricacies of the universe in a way I never had before.",
                "This course explored the fundamentals of special and general relativity, and relativistic astrophysics. It also taught about the philosophy of science.",
                "I learned so much about special relativity and general relativity and exciting stuff in space.",
                "I learned quite a bit about special relativity, general relativity, black holes, and the foundational basics of astronomy.",
                "The concepts and history of special relativity, general relativity, and black hole research; philosophy of science.",
                "I've never taken a class that really pushed my understanding this much before. I am not a STEM kid by any means, but I think the conceptual\/mathematical dual nature of this class was particularly intellectually challenging. I learned a lot about how to approach problems as well as a broad history of astronomy in the US.",
                "Great course for non-science majors who are ok at math. Not only do you learn the basics of relativistic physics, but throughout the class Professor Bailyn covers issues concerning the philosophy of science and how science interacts with politics and society. So its far more useful and interesting than most science gut you might be considering. A great practice of mathematical reasoning and understanding some intuition of equations generally. Also learning about space is cool because space is cool. As a pre-law, being able to describes scenes from interstellar and understand all of the astrophysics that makes it to the NYTs was about all I could ask of a science class at Yale. So 10\/10",
                "I understand concepts I never understood before!",
                "I learned the basic principles of Special and General Relativity, and well as some important concepts related to scientific philosophy and black holes.",
                "This class fundamentally altered my perception of the Universe and the laws that govern it. The class was not particularly useful for gaining skills in academic science, but it was incredibly informative and inspiring. I had a vague understanding of special relativity and black holes before this class, but I am now much better informed and understand the topics on an entirely new level. We also delved into scientific epistemology and discussed how scientific ideas are formed with examples from the history of astronomy.",
                "Learn about special and general relativity, black holes, and summaries of key developments in astronomy\/astrophysics during the last 200 years.",
                "This course gave me basic literacy in the concepts of special and general relativity and contemporary study of black holes. This has been really cool in that now I'm able to understand the implications of new developments in the astrophysics field. I also had to refresh on basic math skills and quantitative thinking (as someone who hasn't taken a math class in several years).",
                "I learned how to question the reality around me.",
                "Good intro knowledge of astronomy and relativity. Great stimulating science credit",
                "I enjoyed learning about modern science and applying scientific theories to current news",
                "I appreciated the balance that Professor Bailyn provided between historical context and scientific approaches to relativity for non-stem majors.",
                "A good understanding of the principles behind relativity and its applications",
                "I learned about special relativity, general relativity, black holes, and the history of astrophysics.",
                "I learned a lot about how to analyze and understand the development of various scientific frameworks, specifically through the lens of relativity. It was honestly really cool to go on a journey through how our thinking about space and time has evolved.",
                "I learned so much about the history of the development of theories of relativity, and space time, and how we understand stars\/black holes\/the universe! I also learned those concepts, and the math and computational skills to really get inside and understand the concepts.",
                "Learned a ton about astrophysics! Great class overall.",
                "I learned a lot about the general theories of relativity and their development, as well as various other scientific breakthroughs and methods of analyzing this data",
                "I developed the ability to critically think in an interdisciplinary fashion. The course regularly required me to place the material in conversation with the history, philosophy, and other humanities-related subjects to which scientific discovery is inextricably linked. This was an invaluable skill to learn; oftentimes, classes will singularly focus on the relevance of their subject matters within their specific field of study, but this course broadened my perspective on the ways in which the sciences and humanities regularly interact . The course challenged me to think about astronomy, relativity, and more generally, the sciences, as concepts that cannot be considered in isolation, but draw on the humanities in order to progress. More broadly, then, the course provided a wonderful example of what it means to undertake a liberal arts education by placing difficult scientific concepts in the context of their interactions with other fields. It also encouraged non-STEM majors to intermarry their \"humanities\" skills (creativity, writing, etc.) with the sciences in order to establish a better understanding of the content; to me, science is now much more accessible and can be understood through several different lenses, rather than a strictly methodical or experimental point of view."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: very straightforward class structure, clear instructions for homework, tests, etc. and many opportunities to earn points toward final grade. Lots of review and homework help available\r\nWeakness: Highly challenging concepts which largely require individual conversation in order to understand. Questions on psets and tests often worded ambiguously. Widely disparate levels of engagement\/foreknowledge in the class left many students bored while others struggled intensely.",
                "I think the structure of this course is a huge strength if you're willing to put in the workit's a video for every lecture, and you're meant to submit a question after every video that Prof. Bailyn may answer in lecture the next day. Sometimes I forgot to ask questions, but there was some leniency in points so it didn't hurt my grade. Another huge strength of this class is that we're encouraged to work together on problem sets; I think collaborative learning is very valuable, and I learned so much through the insights of my study group. I think the biggest weakness of the course was how little time we spent on any particular calculation; you would do an average of one problem before seeing it on a test. I felt much more comfortable going into the tests that we had practice problems for than the ones that we didn't just because I had more repetition in on those concepts, so I think having practice problems for each test would be a huge improvement.",
                "The slides are really good, and there is a lot of video material to reinforce what you learn in class if you need it. Participation is really high, anonymous questions are requested before every class so that if you are unsure about something it can get addressed.",
                "This was a super cool class and I think it was executed really well.",
                "Strengths: PSET review sessions, in-class exercises\r\nWeaknesses: Exam structure, lack of clear lecture slides",
                "Strengths: Hella interesting course content. Professor Bailyn is an icon. Relatively low-ish workload, though this class is definitely not a gut (you'll need to put in the work and actually care about the topic to do well here). Weaknesses: Communication around office hours and review sessions (like about where and when they're held) is unclear at best and nonexistent at worst. One of the midterms asked things not yet covered or practiced at all in class.",
                "Strengths: it's really, really structured to allow you to do well. Showing up to class and submitting questions the night before gets you huge participation points. You can drop a pset. You can take a third, optional test that completely replaces one of the first two if you didn't do well. You can meet with Prof. Bailyn and get points for that. It's truly set up to give you every opportunity to get a good grade. \r\nWeaknesses: I thought the problem sets were the hardest part of the course. You get a little bit of practice doing problems during in-class exercises, but the scope of the problems on the p-sets was far beyond that. Each question had multiple parts and often really small differences would result in lost points. (Even p-sets where all my work was correct would inevitably lose a few points for not mentioning some effect or some piece of history.)",
                "Legit so many strengths. Professor Bailyn has set up the course to be very conducive to learning, even if youve never taken a physics course. The grading is very fair, pretty generous, and clearly laid out in the syllabus. The lectures are fun for occurring at 9:25 in the morning. Lectures are kind of like listening to a huge nerd talk to you about how much he loves sci-fi ideas, his excitement is infectious, but at least 60% of the class wants to be asleep so, its worth it, and will be great if youre a morning person. He also runs sessions on Sunday where you can just sit down and do the PSET and then ask him anything when you get stuck, very helpful. And the PSETs are very relevant to the test so it doesnt feel like you are ever just filling time and assignments.",
                "I thought it was pretty much a perfect course for the purpose it (predominantly) serves (science\/math credit for humanities majors)",
                "The recorded lectures allowed me to digest the advanced physics concepts at my own pace, and the discussion sessions in class gave me the chance to clarify material from the lectures.",
                "Strengths: the pre-class videos were incredibly helpful in getting the bulk of the material across, and the in-class exercises are a good way to test your own knowledge in a low-stakes and collaborative environment. I also really liked the \"detours\" we made to discuss astronomical history and theories of scientific epistemology. \r\nWeaknesses: lectures sometimes felt a little disjointed, and some of the TFs really did not know the material very well. I went to a review session before one of the exams, and the TF was looking up answers to the questions I was asking on Google.",
                "Often times it was hard to understand exactly how all of the concepts interacted as we went along. The concept maps at the end made it easier, but I would have appreciate some reference points along the way!",
                "The course was generally well-organized and their were ample opportunities to make up for mistakes.",
                "I felt like Professor Bailyn made the content of the class incredibly accessible to people who are not strong in physics. I especially appreciated that he approached a lot of the content from a history of science perspective; it was a lot easier to understand the concepts at hand when I was following along with how certain discoveries were made that furthered the field. There was also a lot of built-in forgiveness in the grading system, with an optional test to replace one of the midterms, lowest p-set dropped, etc. There were occasionally instances where he didn't fully explain something for a p-set, but then he was always followed up in class to correct his mistake or elaborate further, so I'd really say that there weren't any major weaknesses in the class.",
                "This course tries to cover a lot, and fails to dive deeply into many of its concepts. Thus I was unable to fully comprehend and internalize much of the material.",
                "Liked the nightly videos and prof. Bailyn is great. The only weakness might be that it was bad for my schedule to have psets due on Monday. That might just be a me problem though.",
                "I think this class did a really good job of keeping the students engaged despite size, fostered a very collaborative environment, and the professors and TFs were very flexible and helpful",
                "The class lectures felt incredibly difficult to keep up with. There was rarely enough time spent on a single topic\/subtopic to formulate and articulate a question during class. Despite having prepared with the pre-class videos, these in-person lectures were difficult to engage with.",
                "Strengths are the interesting subject material, and the fact that Bailyn is a very good professor. The first third of the class is the best--the Ladder Paradox and Twin Paradox are particularly interesting. Weakness is that it is a bit scattered--I don't love when things get too math-y when the concepts could be taught alone. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that it is a QR credit.",
                "Professor Bailyn is a great lecturer. He keeps you engaged and is always supportive of repeating concepts and questions to help students get a better grasp of concepts. The material of the class is generally harder to understand, so I think it requires more attention and effort on the students part to fully understand what is going on.",
                "Many strengths: Professor Bailyn is really committed and passionate. The required conversations, and having to submit a question the day before each lecture are great ways to make sure no one falls behind (especially if you're not necessarily confident enough to outspokenly ask for help in a Science class).",
                "This class was AWESOME. It was the exact perfect mix of history, concepts and math, where I really felt like I developed a thorough understanding of very complicated concepts about our everyday realities and how the universe works. It was extremely well organized, the professor put a LOT of effort into supporting us and helping us understanding how all the course material synthesizes and relates to each other. A perfect course. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is that the prof lectures using pre-made slides and things often moved very fast, and I wish he'd sometimes work things out on a chalkboard for us to see.",
                "Good teacher, good lectures. Problem sets were overly long and difficult though.",
                "The workload was higher than my other courses and at times became overwhelming, but Professor Bailyn and the TFs always provided support during office hours and review sessions."

                "I would recommend this course to a student who has experience in physics but does not want to pursue mathematically intensive studies in relativity. In spite of the low math requirement, the concepts involved in the course are difficult to grasp without a developed intuition for phenomena like the speed of light and gravitational potential fields.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student under one of two conditions: either a) they had a friend or friends to take it with OR b) they had a strong background in physics and\/or conceptual math from high school or other courses. The material of the course was fascinating, and I'm glad I took it; it's a wonderful course for people who are interested in astronomy and with looking at the universe through a new lens but who don't want to take an intensive physics class. However, due to the fast pace of the class, my friends and I often had to learn the material together through the problem sets. I honestly think this class would have been a major stressor for me if I was trying to complete the problem sets and study for the tests alone, but since I had a supportive study group working with me on the more concept-math pieces of the course it was relatively easy and enjoyable for me. This course is by no means a gut, but it's totally worth the effort if you have people to work through it with!",
                "I would recommend this course - it isn't a pushover, but it also isn't too much work. Well organized with lots of office hours, and the topics are really cool.",
                "I HIGHLY recommend this class to anyone looking for a fun elective or needing the credit. It is super cool subject matter and Professor Bailyn is really good at explaining the weirder relativity concepts to make them make sense.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The content taught in this course, though not meant for physics or astronomy majors, helps give everyone a basic understanding of the universe. Furthermore, you engage with scientific concepts that seem difficult, but in reality can be eye-opening. The best part of this course is that it changes the way in which you see the universe, highlighting that Newton's laws don't apply to every scenario.",
                "Don't take this if you're looking for a total gut. While the workload is low-ish, the class is seriously intellectually rigorous. Not an easy A (though arguably an easy A- or B+). The material is insanely interesting, but you should still take this class only if you have friends also taking the class so you can do problem sets together.",
                "I think I would if you need a Sc credit. It's really well structured to allow you to get a good grade and if you put in the time, it gets really interesting and allows for connections across the whole course. It's definitely not a gut (lots of time invested, videos every night before lecture, need to go to lecture, psets every week, 2-3 tests before the final) but you can totally get an A\/A- if you put in the time. I'd say if you're taking it for a QR credit, there's probably math classes that won't require nearly as much understanding and time .",
                "Absolutely! Bailyn is a great professor and he has really thought about how to make this a good class for non-science majors, and it shows! This class is not a gut, but its not very difficult either. As someone who kinda dreaded having to take science credits when I have so many humanities classes that I would rather spend my time and money on, Professor Bailyn made the distributional requirement worth my time. Very appreciated",
                "Absolutely, it was super interesting and the class\/Professor really wants to help \r\n you learn",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone fascinated by Relativity or physics in general but has a limited background in math or hard sciences.",
                "I would enthusiastically recommend this class to literally anyone who is not already familiar with the material discussed in it. Not only is the material fascinating and occasionally astonishing, but the class is a perfect portal into the world of science at its most rational. If you are not a science person and want a genuinely interesting class to teach you about science and inspire you about the capacity for human achievement, take this class. Just note that you will have to put in some work for a good grade, but it will be worth it.",

                "I would highly recommend this class. I found the content fascinating and completely accessible as a non-STEM person. I really enjoyed getting a basic understanding of relativity and black holes, such that now when advances are made in the field I understand the basics of what's going on. It was also really fun to think in a different way than a lot of my classes ask of me. Professor Bailyn was also incredibly kind, accessible, and willing to answer questions.",

                "I would recommend this class if you want a science credit that is not a gut. If you want to learn something interesting, are fine with learning something not very applicable to daily life, and are willing to put in more work, then this class is definitely a good choice.",
                "I would HIGHLY recommend this course to any non-STEM major who's interested in learning in-depth about a really cool topic and is willing to put the work in! This course is not a gut, but it's not a gut in the sense that you'll work hard and gain a really great working knowledge of a fascinating topic and feel satisfied and proud in the process. I found it to be the exact right level of challenge, and it was incredibly rewarding.",

                "The course provided a wonderful introduction to astronomy in a compelling and encouraging fashion, regardless of your background. Professor Bailyn made clear from the start that it was acceptable to not immediately understand the material, but was sure to provide the support necessary to guide you in the right direction as long as you are willing to ask questions and thoughtfully engage with the work. I would especially recommend this course to non-STEM majors. It helps you critically think and explore new concepts in a way that you may never have experienced before; while difficult at times, the course challenges you to stretch your mind in ways you would never have thought possible!"
