    "By taking this course, I learned different statistical tests that I know will be useful in the future. There were so many different applications in the real world where this wasn't just any other math class. I've already heard or learned in some capacity the first half of intro stats up to t - tests. However, the second half made use of all the techniques learned to do problems involving multiple regression, ANOVA, etc.",
    "Basic statistics, fluency in Minitab",
    "Basic statistics knowledge with good depth.  Everything from mean, median, and mode to ANOVA and hypothesis tests.",
    "I learned how to use data to make statistical inferences and how to use MiniTab",
    "My first time taking a stats course - it was very good for knowing what statistical tool to use in different situations with different types of data. Very useful and high quality intro stats course!",
    "I gained an understanding of statistics which allowed me to treat it as an internally consistent mathematical discipline with rules and understandable proofs rather than as a black box into which numbers are thrown and p-values are extracted.",
    "I learned how to interpret data and use minitab",
    "Definitely gained a solid basic understanding of statistics, having come in with absolutely no experience or idea what statistics was. I think one of the best parts about the course is that it teaches you to start to think like a statistician, something that I believe can prove invaluable in many careers.",
    "Not only a knowledge of basic statistics but also a skill set to begin to practice and understand statistics outside of this course",
    "This course primarily covered an introduction to statistical tests, ways of collecting data, and how to form and test hypotheses about your data set.",
    "Developed a thorough understanding of the basics of statistics.",
    "I gained basic knowledge on statistics and how to use the programming software, Minitab.",
    "A really good overview of statistical techniques. I also learned how to process various types of data, which will be super useful.",
    "This course gave a very strong foundation in introductory statistical theory as well as software.",
    "data analysis, \r\nmethods for conducting surveys \r\na sense of rationality and precision in dealing with real life problems",
    "I learned basic and advanced statistical processes and techniques to use in a variety of situations and with various datasets.",

   "comments": [
    "JDRS is an amazing professor and I think that he explains the material extremely well, especially if you ask him any questions during office hours.",
    "The main strength of this course was the structure and organization of the content. It was very easy to navigate through the files and find the necessary lecture slides. The videos were very clear and the examples provided were thorough. A lot of office hours gave flexibility on when one can find help for a particular question. One weakness that I thought was that there wasn't any clear rubric for the homework. Maybe this offers an open ended response, but sometimes I would lose points on a homework because the question was a bit vague and my answer did not encompass the entire answer because it wasn't clear where the rubric was grading from.",
    "The asynchronous mode of the class made it easy to fall behind. I think it would be better if the quizzes had hard deadlines.",
    "Strengths:  Prof. JDRS is amazing.  He is great at actually teaching the material.  Great teachers can be very hard to find at Yale, especially at the Intro level but JDRS is awesome.\r\n\r\nThe TFs are also very helpful and the amount of office hours available is incredible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  The course moves crazy fast, but that was expected with summer session.",
    "I really liked how it was taught with asynchronous lectures and lots of office hours. It let me watch the lectures at my own pace and get live help if necessary.",
    "The class being taught asynchronously was awesome! Whenever I had extra time in my day I could get ahead in the course which was very good for planning out the workload and never being overwhelmed. Biggest strength is the sheer number of TA office hours available -- absolutely critical. I have nothing negative to say about the course. Professor is a funny guy as well. \"Zero! Says Aileen.\" -- classic!",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer's lecturing style is excellent for the video format, and I never felt that I was unable to get help and have my questions resolved. However, the total asynchronicity of the class left me feeling often as though I were less taking a class and learning the material as a student and more as though I were struggling to wrap my head around the concepts alone, as if I were teaching myself for fun. This was not necessarily undesirable, at least until graded assignments entered the picture, after which point I felt a strange disconnect between the lectures and the work.",
    "In general, I would say that this is a strong introductory statistics course. The professor and TFs scheduled numerous office hours so students could request help. The pre-recorded lectures allowed students to learn asynchronously, so that those outside of the East Coast could learn at a time that was right for them. Although I normally prefer to have more face-to-face contact with professors and other students, I thought the asynchronous set-up was a good fit for this class, especially in the COVID era. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I sometimes struggled with was the pace of the course. The course moves very fast; missing even one day of class could set me behind for several days.",
    "This course could be improved with live zoom sessions. There should be more supplemental material to help students studying. I found it very difficult to study for the tests without any old material or practice problems.",
    "I think that the professor was definitely a strength. He made watching pre-recorded lectures a lot more interesting than I believe they could have been... The material also is reasonably easy to grasp if you are willing to put in time \/ work. There were also lots and lots of office hours every day, making it easy to get help in a very fast moving class. Obviously the pace is not something that I generally prefer, but given the circumstances I think that Intro Stats is sort of a perfect class to take online.",
    "Strengths: office hours! Weaknesses: The course moved so quickly, which I understood as it was a summer session, but I wished the schedule would have allowed for more of a breather on days of exams\/the day after exams. I was very tired after studying for and taking exams that it was sometimes hard having around 2 hours of lectures to watch on the same day along with a PSET due the next day or so.",
    "The TAs are a huge asset to this course, especially because all the lectures were pre-recorded. It was always helpful to have a concept explained again to make sure we fully understood it. Certain TAs would laugh at certain questions we would ask or not explain questions that they may have thought were too easy or unnecessary, which is something I think could be improved. Personally, I had never taken any form of statistics prior to this class, so if I was asking a question, it was because I was genuinely confused.",
    "Strengths- lots of office hours, great professor, helpful TAs, engaging video lectures. Would have been nice if the professors office hours had been at different times because I always had a conflict at his time.",
    "Strengths: There was office hours everyday, which was helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: There was no real class time to learn the material from the professor; all the material was self-taught through watching video lectures and reading note slides. This was not super conducive for my learning.",
    "A major strength of the class is Prof. Scherer. He's super engaging and makes everything really approachable and easy to understand. Another strength is the office hours, TAs are super helpful.",
    "Strength: JDRS is a great lecturer, lots of office hours, and TAs are helpful\r\nWeaknesses: a little big of gap between lecture materials and quizzes\/homework. Sometimes there'll be a question on the quiz\/homework that isn't addressed in detail until a lecture later in the week. This just means that you'll have to watch all of that week's lectures before getting started on hw\/taking quizzes.",
    "The course could be improved by teaching over Zoom rather than asynchronously. At times it was difficult to stay on track with the course and make sure I was up to date with lectures and quizzes.",
    "strengths: very organized, every assignment and exam are clarified well\r\nweakness: a bit too fast-paced, sometimes hard to digest all materials within such a short time",
    "The strength of the course is that it is asynchronous, allowing for flexibility with workload, and the immense amount of TA hours available.",
    "Good TAs and Good Instructure. No weaknesses",
    "JDRS is a quirky professor, so his teaching makes the lectures more interesting.",
    "It's a good course, if a little dry",
    "Strengths - lecture videos were clear and helpful, TA's and instructor were easily reachable and provided accessible office hours",
    "It was a very fast paced course. This came with the strength of learning a lot of information. I appreciated the accessibility of the course as there were always TFs available to talk to. However, I felt as if the workload for the course was way to high. The description for YSS said the courses should average around 15-20 hours per week but I found myself consistently spending around 35. I think the course could have benefited from some leniency on some of the assignments because at times, they were overwhelming.",
    "It honestly was a very good course all around."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course for anyone looking to get a basic introduction to statistics. It does go really fast because it's a summer session course, and things can get to be a lot if you start to fall behind. In my opinion, as long as you keep up with the lectures and go to office hours to get help on PSETS\/before tests, you should be fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The level  of difficulty and coursework were very manageable and is a great introduction to statistics. There were countless hours of help and assistance when it comes to questions, problems with the homework, etc. The professor and the TA's all helped with any questions you had and guided you towards gaining more statistical knowledge.",
    "Yes, gives a good introduction of basic statistics.",
    "Absolutely, the course is geared towards making sure you learn the information taught in class, as opposed to courses that have exams be extremely difficult on things that were never covered.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.  I had no previous statistics experience prior to taking the course and found it very interesting and at times even enjoyable.  Because of its nature as a summer session class, however, it moves FAST.  I started a little behind due to some overlap with final assignments in my first summer session classes and did not catch up until week 4.  Staying on top of things is key so you can utilize office hours (which you should go to for every assignment if you want to get the most out of the course and good grades).",
    "Absolutely recommend to another student. Well, because it is an Intro Course, it didn't teach R which is used in many fields. There is another intensive intro stats course that uses R, so I can't really blame this course for using Minitab.",
    "This class's speed can be daunting, especially when compared to other, more normally paced classes. However if you're capable of staying on top of your work it's very manageable, and if you're capable of working ahead it becomes trivially easy to learn the material and turn in the work. If you're prone to lag behind, however, it might be better to wait for the proper semester to take this class, as no amount of office hours can compensate for the experience of having a few days as a breather between lectures.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. There is a lot of support for any students who have questions or are struggling with the material. This course would be a good fit for students who want to try out statistics before studying the subject in greater depth and for students who want to take a QR course but do not otherwise enjoy math.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would probably recommend this course. I don't know if it will be offered in this format again - (4 weeks, all online)... but I found the material interesting and the workload manageable if you give yourself enough time. That being said, it is definitely easy to fall behind quickly, so I strongly recommend staying on top of the course load and getting help as soon as you need it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking for an introduction to a wide variety of future statistics that they could take. I think this is a good option to take online during the summer.",
    "Yes absolutely. This is a great way to get a QR or be introduced to S&DS at Yale.",
    "Yes, I think the material learned in this class would be helpful information to know for a variety of fields and subject areas.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend, for any non-stats major. its a pretty easy class and its a great overview with a great professor.",
    "Yes. It was terrific in teaching introductory statistic techniques and theories in a clear manner.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as it is very flexible and is very in depth in its teaching of statistics.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this class. It is a great introduction to statistics. It's a very straightforward class, as long as you don't fall behind. This class made me want to take more statistics classes at Yale.",
    "Yes because it is a good intro to statistics",
    "It is a great class to begin learning Statistics with. It moves quite quickly, so don't fall behind.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn basic statistics or need to fulfill a requirement.",
    "I needed to knock out a QR credit and this did just that.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student that needs an EASY QR! The teacher seems genuinely so nice, he's entertaining.",
    "Yes, this course is engaging, the assignments helped improve understanding of the topics, tests were fair",
    "I would recommend this course in general but not for summer session unless you do not have any other engagements. The material moves every quickly and it is easy to fall behind in the 5 week period.",
    "YES.",
    "I would. I think everyone should at least take this course, especially over the summer, because you learn a lot of important information that is widely applicable. Also, I found it kind of fun.",
    "Absolutely!!!"
