In a very emotionally challenging semester given the state of the world, Professor Grewal created a space where we were able to talk freely about our thoughts and feelings in a comfortable and safe manner. She helped us work through very challenging emotions in a way that allowed us to grow in our understanding of Islam, media, war, society, and more. I can't emphasize enough how grateful I was to have this class and Professor Grewal to turn to throughout the semester."

While the readings for the class may be a higher workload than other classes you've taken, they were all full of interesting/engaging content that made the long reads feel worthwhile. The professor makes this course, she teaches/lectures in a very engaging way and offers room for thoughtful discussion with students. Definitely take this class if you can manage the workload and have an interest in the topic!"
