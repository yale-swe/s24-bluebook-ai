I also gained a greater appreciation for and ability to read Arabic literature through the different excerpts that we read from the Middle East region. I was also able to develop my translation skills in Arabic through the final project, which is something that we have not done in courses prior to this.",

                "I enjoyed the literature we read, and in general I thought the assignments were good.  I felt very good to have read a whole novel in Arabic (The Travels of Ibn Fattuma).  The course was taught on zoom, which was it's greatest weakness - learning a language remotely is very difficult and not as fun as in person.",
                "Strength: interesting topics and content\r\nWeakness: can feel a little repetitive every week",
                "The strengths of this course are that it is organized well and there is a clear schedule that is followed throughout the semester. Every week, we would read a story, present on the news, and then watch educational videos in Arabic about a variety of topics and answer questions about them. The conversations in the breakouts rooms and the writing assignments were helpful to understanding the stories each week. The professor also provided helpful feedback on our writing assignments, which helped me improve my writing skills in Arabic. I would have liked to continue learning Arabic grammar and improving my vocabulary. Although this is an L5 course, I think that reviewing grammatical concepts or learning new ones that show up in the literature that we read would be very helpful and is very important. There is a big jump from L4 and L5 and sometimes it feels as though there is a knowledge gap and it can be difficult to read the literature because of it. I think it would be helpful to have quizzes every once in a while on vocabulary and grammar concepts. I also felt that sometimes this course was a little bit repetitive because we did similar activities every week.",
                "I enjoyed the Wednesday session of this course, where students presented on recent news articles and asked one another questions about their presentations. This was a good way to practice speaking and listening skills (and also, through presentation preparation, reading skills). I also liked some of the readings we did, and I really enjoyed the final translation project (thought it was a bit difficultmore guidance on some parts would have been helpful). I am proud to say I have now read a book in Arabic (Rihlat Ibn Fattouma, which we read for the midterm essay) and completed my first translation! I found the Monday session a bit less engaging, as our reading discussions rarely got past comprehension to reach analysis\/complex discussion. Many of us, of course, struggled with comprehension, but I think this could have been partially addressed by giving vocabulary listseach reading had words that were new to much of the class.",
                "Overall, the course's major strength was that it kept me consistently engaged with the Arabic language throughout the week, whether through reading, writing, or speaking. At most, however, it may be improved with perhaps a few refreshers on advanced Arabic grammar and a more structured way of studying Arabic expressions and idioms."

                "I think that the asynchronous Friday activity was helpful, but I think that it would be better to do it every other week because sometimes it was a bit repetitive and it would be more helpful to do something together as a class with either grammar or new vocabulary.",

I would recommend it at as a way to continue staying somewhat engaged with Arabic, but be aware that it will not be unlike most of Yales Arabic classes (if you took L1-L4, you know what I am saying; if not, ask someone who has). I hope Yale hires an additional Arabic professor soon (the lower level classes, especially, would benefit from this) and also encourages classes that engage students with speaking and listening!",
