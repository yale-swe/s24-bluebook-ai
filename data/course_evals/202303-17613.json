This course included both more conventional historical texts as well as more legally-oriented readings (eg law review articles).",

                "I learned to read legal documents and make sense of a lot of the jargon. I also was able to figure out how to articulate what certain laws and policies were saying and how they would and did impact different communities.",
                "I gained an excellent survey of federal Indian law. I learned a great deal and the materials we read were enriching.",
                "I know have a better grasp on the foundation of federal Indian law and how it has evolved. I have developed my analytical and critical thinking skills through our coursework, especially the essay that required us to understand how legal doctrines like the Doctrine of Discovery influenced certain contemporary Supreme Court cases."

            "comments": [
                "My favorite reading was our first book, Charles Wilkinson's Blood Struggle. The content in this book alone could have been an entire course. And I actually wished we had spent a lot more time moving more slowly through the book and its contents, which I feel covered the core of federal Indian legal history. Instead, much of the course wound up focusing on narrow and more contemporary issues that we learned about through law review articles, which was also interesting -- I just felt that, as an undergraduate history course, the class might have been more unique and interesting if we engaged more with historical scholarship.",
                "strengths - the topic (which is FASCINATING and very little taught), the syllabus (targeted readings providing both breadth and depth on specific topics), the assignments, which didn't feel like busy work & allowed us to explore areas of personal interest. Blackhawk also provides very detailed writing feedback without docking grades too much\r\n\r\nweaknesses - the class meetings themselves were extremely disorganized",
                "I think the strength of this course is the readings and the class discussions. It was very helpful to have Professor Blackhawk provide context and explanation to the difficult readings. I found myself very engaged during these time periods. We only met once a week, which I liked but that meant you had to be fully focused for those 2 hours so if you zoned out for a second or missed a class, you missed a ton of really important information.",
                "Each lecture in this class was engaging but could be improved by incorporating more small group work, conversations and presentations. I appreciated the group presentations on Echo-Hawks 10 Worst Supreme Court Cases and think that style of learning could be used in other parts of the course."

                "Yes, I would! The content is really interesting and has made me rethink a lot of what I thought I knew/believed in regarding U.S. law and history. Also, Professor Blackhawk is a wonderful person and cares deeply about his students.",
                "Maybe. Cool to learn from Blackhawk who is a leading historian in this field. That said, he seems unsure if this course is a lecture or a seminar and so sometimes classes meandered in odd ways.",
                "YES! Everyone should know this stuff. never had more fun writing essays or doing readings at yale.",
                "Absolutely. I think anyone interested in going to law school should be required to take this course. It is extremely interesting and important, and too many professionals in the field don't know anything about American Indian Law and Policy.",
                "Yes, without hesitation. The class is so interesting and the Professor is fantastic.",
                "I would highly recommend this class; it is essential for any student interested in law or history more broadly. This class facilitates learning and discussions about lesser known topics of Indian law and its history in an approachable and easily understandable way.",
                "YES! This course was transformative for me. I learned so much through readings, presentations, guest speakers, and essay assignments. Professor Blackhawk does an amazing job of always making class engaging and connecting the class's themes to current issues. Anyone interested in law or history should seriously consider taking this course!"
