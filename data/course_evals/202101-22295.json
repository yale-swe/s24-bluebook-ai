                "This course was useful in thinking about many broad questions, such as: how do we read? how do we understand things? what is beauty? To my knowledge, previous iterations of this class functioned as a book club of sorts, so it was interesting to look at reading from a philosophical viewpoint.\r\nThat being said, I was under the impression that this was a seminar...but he ended up lecturing most of the time, with students asking questions from time to time. The students themselves did not really have a discussion amongst themselves. Hagglund's lecture format worked here because the concepts themselves were pretty tough to make sense of by yourself, but I would have appreciated less intense theory for more discussion among students.\r\nAdditionally, a great source of stress for me this semester was the fact that the final paper is 80% --yes, 80% -- of your grade. This can be difficult because you have no way of knowing how Hagglund grades because you haven't submitted anything written that he's given feedback on. So, just keep in mind that the fate of your grade is in limbo.",
                "There are no assignments throughout the term, which could be useful for developing our literary theorist's intuition",
                "Prof. Hagglund was a great teacher, and the class discussion was always interesting. I think the course could use more structure, though. I would have liked to read more works of literature and maybe had assignments spaced out throughout the semester so it wasn't all riding on one final paper.",
                "The material was fascinating, and the professor was very knowledgeable and engaging. I really enjoyed coming to class and discussing the readings with everyone.",
                "The material was very interesting and the instructor was super engaging, but I hope we had more opportunities to receive feedback.",
                "Strengths: the wide range of topics we covered was really insightful for someone like me who has never seriously read any philosophical texts before. If I was ever intimidated by the readings, I always found the lectures to be really clarifying-- Professor Hgglund is so great at explaining concepts concisely and giving examples grounded in real life. \r\n\r\nIt might have been nice to have at least one other assignment factoring into our grade. Maybe a midterm paper or discussion posts? I would have been willing to do the latter since this class only meets once a week. Especially also as class time seems better used for clarifying lecture content, rather than bringing up any specific parts from the readings. It could also have been helpful to have some very general guidelines about the paper posted to canvas or emailed to us a bit earlier in the term. Since we only had that one assignment, I think that would have reminded me to start brainstorming earlier."
