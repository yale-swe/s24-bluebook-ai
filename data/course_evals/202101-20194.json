If you've already taking a screenwriting class at Yale, this will feel very redundant.\r\n\r\nMost of the work came from reading scripts/watching films and writing beat sheets. This was helpful in breaking down and understanding films. However, we didn't analyze the structure of narratives extensively, which felt like a waste of that process.",

                "Strengths- Prof. Margulies is clearly an accomplished writer who is willing to offer individualized attention if you seek it out. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Especially in the second half of the semester, an overwhelming majority of class time was spent reading peers' scripts. I understand the merits of a workshop, but ours got pretty boring pretty fast, and I would have much preferred to spend that time letting Prof. Margulies lead the class in a more thorough analysis of style or technique or really anything. \r\n\r\nFor a class on adaptation, we didn't talk much about choosing what to adapt or how to go about the process of transforming literature into a story for the screen. In addition to that, we were told to choose stories early on in the class. Be careful with this decision. I didn't love my choice but was saddled with it for the remainder of the semester",
                "The course was interesting and it was really fun to write my own screenplay and read everyone else's, but the class itself was very long, especially for over zoom, which made it hard to stay engaged during the seminar.",
                "I think the films and scripts were chosen well and I liked that we got to workshop everyone's script. I came into this class with no past screenwriting experience, so I think a basic lesson about those conventions would have been helpful. Furthermore, the workshop feedback from classmates was sometimes sparse and I think would have been more productive if we were more familiar with the pieces others were adapting."
