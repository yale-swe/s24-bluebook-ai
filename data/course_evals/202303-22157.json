                "I learned an incredible amount about the analysis of history and historical thought itself. I gained new perspectives on what history is and its importance, as well as the many different ways the author's style and individual style can influence how a text is interpreted.",
                "The ability to compose a close analysis paper based on very focused passages. Meta interpretation of historical and political texts across the western canon and conduct quick logical and critical thinking in tackling certain parts of the text in discussion seminars inspired by other's ideas. Knowing that history is a subjective concept that is not one long coherent conversation as I had imagined it to be, but with a variety of complexion that makes all that it encompasses and obliterates even more enticing.",

                "This class can sometimes feel a little disjointed just because there is so so much information to cover and not enough time. It's really what your classmates make itsome discussions will be amazing and others will feel a little silly. Overall though, this class is a great introduction to political theory and college-level history. Especially with Professor Almeida Nevin, the questions posed are really thought provoking and by the end of the semester you are able to see common threads and themes through all the texts you've read.",
                "I loved the lecture-discussion structure of the class. We were able to bring our own interests to discussion and build off big themes covered in the lecture, which created a very engaged, vivid, and welcoming atmosphere in class. I understand this is the nature of DS, but it did sometimes feel like we weren't able to go enough in depth into some of the books as others. It felt shallow and rushed at times, but I know there is a lot of material to cover and only so much time.",
                "Strength: a pungent potpourri of the ancient political and historical texts. A lot of modern connections that could be forged and such a collection of vibrant people that makes all our discussions so interesting.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Common to all DS classes. All of the texts could be food for thought enough for an entire semester but we dapple through them with only a week or so. H&P also has the additional burden to take on parts of philosophy for the sake of its discussion of politics.",
                "The course did a good job covering a wide array of ideas. As with all DS courses it had the issue of having a ton to cover, which often meant ridiculously long readings and not much time to discuss them. At various points it was unclear to me exactly what the thrust of this class was supposed to be, and it sort of felt like H+P was walking a weird line between being a history course (i.e., wanting us to actually know Greek/Roman history) and being what it describes itself as, which is a course about how people think about history/politics. Obviously the two are intertwined, but I think my confusion came from the structure of the readings: we were assigned hundreds and hundreds of pages of people just describing events that happened, then we'd ignore most of that and talk about a few lines in the preface or maybe scattered through the text where the author lays out their view on why studying history matters, or how fate drives history, etc. When we did discuss the actual episodes they chronicled, we would often get bogged down into details (how should we understand x conflict between the plebs and the patricians?) which clearly matter for some reason or another, but we rarely tied these details back to the big questions we were meant to be asking, especially with the Roman historians. The quality of our class discussions seemed to depend heavily on what kind of reading we'd been assigned (history-heavy vs. political philosophy). Though there might be some way of structuring the class to avoid these issues, it seemed to me like most of these were just tensions within the H+P track itself. Ultimately, when we were in the realm of big questions answered via small details (writing papers; preparing for and writing the final), I found the class to be extremely engaging, but for a lot of the authors we were assigned, it was unclear how we were meant to do that."

Professor Almeida Nevin is amazing and cares about her students so deeplyit's really meaningful to have such a caring professor in first semester of freshman year. The class environment is great, and the discussions really do vary from section to section so you are able to bring your own ideas to class and discuss them.",
                "Definitely, I feel I've come out of this class with a new understanding of historical thought and the way that people approach history. Analyzing books not just for their content but also the historians who write them was fun and engaging and something that I'd rarely done before.",
                "DS is a whole package and no in-betweens. It's like driving the car for the first time and choosing to start with Manhattan. I mean sure, bruises and bumps and weird discouraging shouts from people triple your age with accents from all over the world are bound to follow you, but hell, you get to see times square and Hudson river and all the hits.",
