                "I learned about how children's literature has evolved in response to perceptions of childhood changing throughout history. Through this course, my analytical writing also improved a lot. This course helped me better structure my essays so that my argument develops clearly from beginning to end.",
                "As an incoming freshman still comfortable with the \"testing\" style of English I learned in high school, this course was very much different and pushed me to become a better writer. In this course I developed improved knowledge and skill in making critical analysis with a text and secondary sources. Furthermore, I learned about the in depth process of revising one's work."

                "I enjoyed the class structure with weekly readings and in-class discussions. The semester was broken down into units with corresponding readings and topics to unpack and discuss. My only complaint about the course is that the fourth unit felt extremely rushed and not as thoroughly discussed as the first unit.",
                "The class is discussion-based and there's discussion postings as well, which allows us to see what other people think about the same readings. The readings are initially really interesting, and I love rereading children books with a fresh new perspective. However, when we get to the coral island \/ lord of the flies \/ damselfly unit, the readings seem to be a little repetitive. Although the books developed really differently, it gets a little boring as someone not really interested in island survival books. Other than this minor point, we receive a lot of feedbacks and the class is really enjoyable and insightful.",
                "One of the many strengths of this course was the assigned readings. The selection of books was so varied, always enjoyable, and led to deep discussions about many different interesting and important topics. Another strength of this course was the draft and revision process for each of the papers. I really appreciated the structure of submitting essay drafts, then receiving feedback and meeting with my professor, and then submitting a revised version. It helped me improve my analytical writing a lot over the course of the semester. Yet another strength was the opportunity to visit the Beinecke (which was amazing) and to have a joint class with middle schoolers and discuss books with them.",
                "A strength of the course is the well organized thematic units that allowed for creative and intellectual progression over the term."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course as it is a great introductory writing course at Yale that goes over beloved books from your childhood.",
                "Yes. Jill Campbell gives really thorough feedbacks that allows you to really improve your writings. However, in order to do so, you must put in the work for revision and thinking about your arguments, so the improvements definitely comes with work.",
                "Yes 100%!!! This class was amazing - firstly, because of the material we read. It was such a nostalgic experience to read books from my own childhood like \"Charlotte's Web\" and \"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\" so many years later. I also loved learning about how children's literature and even our perception of childhood itself have evolved throughout history. Our class was even able to take a trip to the Beinecke Library and flip through children's books from centuries ago, which was an incredible experience. I cannot recommend this class enough, especially to those who are interested in working with kids. We had a joint class one day with eighth grade students from a local middle school during which we discussed books with them. There were so many special things about this class - it was definitely my favorite course this semester. Plus, Professor Campbell is AMAZING!! She led interesting discussions every class, and she's also incredibly supportive during the writing process. Talking with her about my papers was so helpful - I always came away from our meetings feeling less lost and knowing what direction to take in my writing. She's not the most lenient grader, but I appreciated that, as it pushed me to continue making improvements. Our writing assignments also allowed me to explore topics that interest me personally and to conduct research that I cared a lot about. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
                "Yes, I would 100% recommend this course to another student. I would especially recommend this course if you enjoy diving into a thematic topic and are open to exploring multiple lenses and perspectives on what this subject could mean. All of the readings in this course were especially well organized and enjoyable to read and discuss in depth during class."
