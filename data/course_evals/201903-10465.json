    "Crash course in many different disciplines, tied together in the area of tissue engineering. Biomechanics, immunobio, congenital heart defects, nanoparticles.",
    "Different approaches to solving a medical problem ( congenital heart defects )",
    "Such an interesting overview of heart conditions and the different branches of science that are involved in the treatment!",
    "I always left this class learning something fascinating or new. The breadth of the course material and exposure to many fields in BME (from understanding cardiovascular anatomy to nanoparticles, machanobiology and simvascular) the class so enriching and felt so directly applicable!",
    "A variety of fields necessary to tackle vascular problems.",
    "This course gave me a lot of insight into the highly interdisciplinary nature of solving a medical problem. I gained exposure to the many fields which are required to approach medical issues, including (but not limited to) biomedical engineering, immunobiology, computer science, physics, math, and medicine.",
    "I learned how to run computation modeling simulations in SimVascular for hemodynamic performance. \r\nI learned how to run nanoparticle protocols and how to passage cells in the lab. \r\nI learned how to think about one very specific medical issue (congenital heart defects) through many different lenses (immunbiology, mechanobiology, nanotechnology, hemodynamics, tissue engineering)",
    "A lot about congenital heart disease and BME!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "very well taught, with thoughtful homework assignments and interesting lab modules.",
    "Strengths: focus was on solving actual real-world problem, rather than cramming in material\r\nweaknesses: given the nature of the course it was sometimes hard to see the structure",
    "Really cool to learn about one problem and the corresponding treatment from the perspective of a variety of different fields. Newly interested in biomedical research as a result of this class.",
    "Strengths: Prof Humphrey is one of the most passionate and committed professors at Yale! He brought us homemade zucchini bread and donuts one day for breakfast! The actual course materials is also so interesting - you don't have to be a BME student (like me) to enjoy learning about tissue engineering or targeted alpha radiation or any pioneering drug discovery field! You also learn a bit of programming and 3d modeling and get exposure to cell culturing in the lab!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes course material felt a bit unrelated. We also delved very deeply into the biomechanics and math (so having a strong math background is certainly helpful!)",
    "Engaging teaching, which made it a 9 AM I always went to! The labs were also a good experience.",
    "I think this course is a really fun and engaging way to be exposed to engineering because we are learning about it through the lens of a real-world problem. We jump around a lot which I appreciate because it is truly a survey course. I think people from many different academic backgrounds can appreciate this course and find a topic on the syllabus that genuinely sparks their interest. I found a lot of interesting parallels between this class and my other science\/QR classes, which goes to show how much diverse material it covers. I think the course could be improved by giving groups more time to think about and flesh out their final project ideas. Because of Thanksgiving break, things felt rushed at the end. Perhaps the final project could be introduced a week or two earlier while material is still being taught, just so we at least have more time to meet as a group and mull over possible ideas.",
    "Strengths Professor Humphrey is an incredible teacher who really cares about helping undergraduates learn and understand difficult topics. He always made himself available to help students after class. Even though office hours were \"by appointment\" (and that sometimes seems to discourage students from attending), Professor Humphrey always found a way to answer my questions in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nStrength: This course does not have a textbook, so I found that Professor Humphrey was really intentional about what he taught and how he taught it. I found his teaching method to be particularly effective and clear.",
    "I like how we covered a wide variety of topics and got to be in the lab some classes. I think maybe the sections were not as helpful to my success on the homeworks\/midterm\/final."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Most people who took it were not BME",
    "Yes, if they are interested in getting a tangible sense of what they are learning about\/for and solving medical problems",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. If you are at all interested in medicine, biochemistry, biomedical engineering, and the like, then this is a wonderful course to take. However, be sure that you have a strong foundation in mathematics, as you will be expected to be able to produce derivations of equations both for homework and on tests.",
    "Absolutely. One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. The information is really interesting and well taught and it culminates with using the knowledge from the semester to suggest a new\/improved treatment for a heart condition. It's a great way to synthesize everything we've learned.",
    "Absolutely! Take this course (especially with Prof Humphrey - he is the best!)",
    "As a non biomedical engineering student, some things were difficult, however overall I would still recommend the course.",
    "Yes! Please take this course if you are scientifically inclined at all (not just engineeringpeople from all majors take this course! In my year we had EEB, MCDB, BME, and totally undecided just to name a few). It makes you realize just how intersectional science is and thats really exciting. Professor Humphrey is a PHENOMENAL professor and its lovely to get to know him. The workload was not too heavy at all, and the homework assignments are varied (not just a regular PSet every week) which keeps things interesting. Take this class!! It is sure to inspire you in some way.",
    "I would recommend this course because I found it really interesting how Professor Humphrey could break down topics that might appear to be super-complicated into more manageable pieces. If you are interested in medicine, any type of medical research, or even in engineering, this is a great course. This is also (in my opinion) a great course for someone who does not have a specific interest in those fields, but is looking for an engaging, but also real, science credit.",
    "Yes! Especially, if you are a non-BME major and just interested in the material! Professor Humphrey was very understanding of people from different majors and backgrounds.",
    "Yes! While open and accessible to students of a variety of majors\/years, the course was also a great exercise in putting together all the interdisciplinary concepts taught throughout the biomedical engineering track. It consolidated, broadened, and applied student knowledge towards an impactful medical problem."
