   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class structure is pretty miserable. The labs themselves are long and dull, much like the lab reports which are slightly ridiculous.",
    "The expectations for the lab reports are very clear, so it was relatively easy to complete these assignments successfully. However, I felt that the expectations for the quizzes were not as clear, and consequently, the quizzes were extremely challenging, even when I thought that I had studied the correct material.",
    "Fix the quizzes, having them weekly was better for they were more relevant with the material in the lab. Would also have the labs reports every week rather than the longer ones every couple weeks that cover multiple labs.",
    "In off sequence chem lab, Dr. Mioy Huynh teaches instead of Dr. G. Mioy is a wonderful person and a great teacher. He made what can be a very tedious and long process actually fly by. Take chem lab off sequence!",
    "I liked the grading of the labs, and the content was fair.",
    "Lab reports very time consuming, but good resources available to get help.",
    "Having the example lab reports at the beginning of the semester was really helpful.  I also liked the change to bi-weekly lab reports.",
    "The course could be improved by making it more clear what information would be tested on the quizzes.",
    "I think these reactions are required so I honestly don't know if there is anything to change there.\r\nOne thing though is I thought that I would like the less frequent quizzes, but I wish now that they were every week but maybe fewer questions like what were the reagents you used 2 weeks ago, and more just straight up chemistry questions- because that is easier to study for. \r\nMioy is amazing so everybody had about as good of a time in this class that I think was possible.",
    "Strengths: Mioy",
    "This course was almost entirely built as a hindrance to pre-med students. In other words, it is certainly a 'weed-out' course filled to the brim with useless requirements and preposterous grading schemes. The course is in no way designed to accommodate students coming from less privileged backgrounds, such as those who are FGLI students or come from a rural area. While some aspects of the course were changed this semester with the intention of making the work more manageable, the class still ended up having a ridiculous workload. The labs are often very long and can be unnecessarily complicated, while the lab manual is riddled with useless information that only serves to confuse students. The reports require a high level of experience with Excel that is unreasonable to expect from every single student, once again playing into educational inequality. The quizzes were perhaps the most ridiculous aspect of the course. While labs get easier over time with practice and guidance from the TA (Mioy), the quizzes are always absurdly difficult. It is unfair to students who do well in the actual lab-based portion of the class that they also have to jump through the hoop of studying for quizzes. These quizzes are over material that should've been covered in the general chemistry course, and thus shouldn't have to be retested in this laboratory based class. If quizzes absolutely must be done, maybe they should be on the actual lab techniques used or results obtained as opposed to tangentially related problems.",
    "The strength of this course is that it reinforces concepts we learn in lecture.\r\nThe weakness is that it takes so much time spent in lab and working on the lab reports for a half credit class. It greatly limits the other classes we can take, especially since it is a required course for pre meds, and it makes it difficult to fulfill other credit requirements when this class is only half a credit.",
    "The lab reports and quizzes require more work than a half credit should. The experiments also aren't always explained in a way that I understand exactly why we are doing what we are doing. The strength of the class was Mioy Huynh, because he was great at explaining concepts and being available to help students"

   "comments": [
    "Unless someone had to take this class, I would absolutely advise them against taking this course.",
    "Generally, no one takes this course for fun, but if you need to take a lab, this one isn't bad especially if you have Mioy as you TA. He's awesome and very helpful with everything in the course.",
    "Yes, if you take it off sequence with Dr. Huynh. I also think Dr. G was helpful, but I took off sequence, so he wasn't super involved in Gen  Chem II lab.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to student who is interested in chemistry courses.",
    "I think most people taking this course need to for pre-med\/their major, so I'm going to take this question as would I recommend the off sequence gen chem lab, and to that I would say there are enough major perks of taking it off sequence that I would recommend thinking about it seriously. The class size is significantly smaller (but still graded on the curve of the larger class I think, which takes away this weird competitive \"I won't help others\" attitude that those curves can accidentally cultivate) and I genuinely learned in this class. That was mainly a product of Mioy and also my classmates, so I hope that continues in future years, but I actually had a not unpleasant experience in lab, and besides some of the necessary annoying stress of lab reports and quizzes, enjoyed the class.\r\nAlso, Mioy is a godsend, so there is that. (thank you mioy)",
    "No, unless you were required to take it. If a student were ever taking Chem lab, they should take it with Mioy.",
    "Absolutely not, but if you're considering this course you probably have to take it anyways for your major or pre-med. Just get through the year and you'll be fine. If you can, take it off-sequence in a smaller class and with Mioy as your TA. Seek help far in advance and you'll stay afloat.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have to take it for a requirement.",
    "Only take it if you have to"
