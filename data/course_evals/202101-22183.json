The books we read were really great and I enjoyed that he went over how to write an essay in great depth. It was also nice we spent time getting to know eachother in the first few classes it made online school a lot more fun.",

                "Yes, take a class with Prof Blackhawk. Especially if you are not an indigenous student. There are so few courses at Yale focusing on indigenous studies, and Prof Blackhawk's encouragement towards research and scholarly work positively affected all students. I am not an indigenous student, but I found it very educational not only in terms of coursework but also about being a student at Yale. As a first year seminar, Prof Blackhawk is a supportive figure for first year students.",
                "I would absolutely reccomend this class in fact I think everyone at Yale should have to take a class that relates to indigenous culture or history. It is so important and was a great class in general.",
                "Definitely! It's a great privilege to take a course with Professor Blackhawk and learn from his firsthand perspectives. Additionally our class was very small, which made it a fun little community where we got to learn about each other and our individual backgrounds. The course material is very interesting and extremely pertinent, and most people have little to no knowledge of the full extent of contemporary Native history so its very worthwhile. For Native students I especially recommend this course as you may learn some additional knowledge on top of what you already knew while engaging with Professor Blackhawk and other Native students in a unique environment that doesn't really exist in any other courses in Yale College. The workload of this course is very manageable and the readings are interesting. The final project is intensive but very open-ended and fun, and it was definitely the highlight of this course for me. Overall if you want to take a first year seminar this is a great option, especially for anyone interested in Native studies and a smaller class community!",
                "I would 100% recommend this course. The topics covered are very interesting for any student who is open to learning about Native American history, culture, and education in the US. The readings are not of great difficulty and can be interpreted by all students. You are always invited to share any thoughts and ideas on the topics of the discussion. Professor Blackhawk does a great job at including everyone in the discussion and accommodating dating to different needs. It is an amazing course with an amazing professor."
