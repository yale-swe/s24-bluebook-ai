This is also an interesting course in terms of skills because the assessments are largely creative, so you read and discuss a lot of history for class but then use that knowledge to write something speculative.",

                "Strengths: best and kindest professor ever who is so invested in the course, interesting assignments and materials \r\nWeaknesses: maybe more structure to the course/ syllabus or greater focus on dystopia",
                "I really enjoyed the class. Strengths were student engagement and discussions; no immediate recommendations come to mind",
                "Strengths: A very wide range of readings that gives you the opportunity to engage (or re-engage) with some of the \"Western canon\" (whatever that may be) in addition to other perspectives and texts. The readings are varied and interesting, spanning historical texts, literary texts, political texts, fiction (Fahrenheit 451), and even an STS reading. There should be something in there for everyone. Maria is a wonderful and kind instructor who is personable and compassionate! She makes sure to engage with your contributions in class discussion and on the Canvas discussion board. \r\nWeaknesses: Be prepared for the assessments to have very little structure or strict guidelines. This is good in the sense that it gives you a lot of flexibility, but possibly problematic if you are the sort of person who feels like they need some kind of guide to figure out what is expected of them. Also, the class structure is very student-driven, with each class consisting of a student-facilitated presentation on the readings and the readings' history. This means that the class dynamic and energy levels will probably depend a lot on who you get in the class.",
                "This course could use an additional text that generalizes the concept and history of utopia Searching for Utopia: The History of an Idea by Gregory Claeys. This would help reinforce the more specific readings and discussions in the class. It sometimes felt as though from week to week there were big jumps from one concept to another or between historical periods.\r\n\r\nThe biggest strength was class participation through discussions and presentations. An additional strength was tieing the historical learnings to present-day issues that society is struggling with. This helped frame the content of the course to real-world issues and solutions.",
                "Many interesting readings and fun discussion, professor could be a bit more organized by being clear with us about deadlines earlier on"

                "Yes, this class is engaging and interesting; Prof. Jordan facilitates good discussions and I learned a lot - from the class, readings and discussion.",
                "I would recommend this class for anyone who is interested in reading history to understand how we think about or imagine the present and future from a philosophical or conceptual standpoint. A lot of the readings are primary texts that reflect different ideologies that shape how societies are organized, which is not what I expected but ended up being very interesting. But make sure you read the syllabus and check that you are into the readings. Some of the historical readings can be a little dry, although the student presentations often help make them more accessible and engaging. Additionally, because the class structure is so student-driven, your mileage may vary depending on the make-up of your class. Shop the class first and see whether you vibe with the other people there!",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. It helps give a different perspective on history and generates questions about our society today through a unique lens of the past. The content and readings are also engaging and the student presentations allow you to better engage with classmates.",
