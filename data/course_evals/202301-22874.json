            "comments": [
                "Strengths: great readings and class discussions; Prof Berry is wonderful and carefully curates the reading list to give you the most out of the class; enjoyable class due to diversity in topics related to food\r\nWeaknesses: harsher than average grading on papers; not sure if I improved my writing by much",
                "Strengths: small lecture class allowed for student engagement, interesting course material\r\nWeaknesses: grading was harsh, went to peer essay tutoring before every essay was turned in, talked to the instructor, went to office hours, and still continuously received poor grades despite changing essay as per instructor feedback. I stressed a lot over this and had higher expectations for flexibility and aid in terms of my first Yale English course. Course description said intended for STEM majors, so I was initially under the impression that the grading would be more lenient than a course intended for humanities majors. I would turn in an essay thinking it was one of the best essays I've ever written and receive disappointing grades.",
                "Strengths: Andie was incredible and kind, and the sources were interesting and varied at times to keep things fresh and engaging. The feedback I received throughout helped me both improve each paper and become a better writer overall.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "The course was very well organized and the assigned reading was very manageable. It was also very helpful to receive feedback on the essay as well as the built in teacher conferences to help guide your writing. It encouraged me build in time to work on my writing.",
                "I wish it had more interesting content about food culture like the beginning. Recipes, cookbook readings did not engage me very much. Our professor only grades and gives advice on essay structure and putting together ideas. I wish I received much more feedback on syntax, sentence structure and how to make writing more readable and engaging. I wish the workload was more evenly distributed too. At the beginning, we were writing very sluggishly but at the end many assignments just come day by day.",
                "I really liked the overall structure of this course. The readings were well chosen and well distributed throughout the semester to make smooth but clear transitions between the different units. I also really liked how discussion based it was - I felt that I always had the chance to share my opinion and  enjoyed learning from my classmates' insights and worldviews. I wish that we were given more time for the first essay, as it is due pretty much only a week after classes start, and this turnaround time is really difficult for most students. I also wish that there was more standardization of grading between different sections, as some ENGL 114 professors are very lenient and others are very difficult graders, and it feels unfair that your performance may be judged completely differently if you had just so happened to pick a different section. Overall, though, I liked and enjoyed this course",
                "The pacing of the class was the biggest strength, as students did not feel overwhelmed by deadlines or readings all at once. Additionally, there was a balance between student commentary and professor input in class discussions.",
                "I think the strengths of this course are that its meant to be an intro writing course so the guidance around writing is very strong. The writing does get to be a lot of work.",
                "Strengths: The content is very interesting. Andie moderates discussions well; ideas were really bouncing between different students. Andie is also very approachable through emails and office hours. Weaknesses: I hope I could discuss writing more. I felt like most of what I learned about writing didnt really have an impact on my writing.",
                "Strengths: This course is beautifully designed. The first paper is quick but allows you to get early feedback on your writing and a good starting place. Then, I really appreciated how the biggest assignment of the course was before the end of the semester since it really nicely balanced my workload with my other classes. The readings were all well-chosen and reasonably long. Additionally, I really liked how we had a guest speaker and got to eat food together on the last day. Andie was a great professor, and I really enjoyed how she would lead class discussions.\r\nWeaknesses: Very few. I would have liked to see more detailed feedback on my actual writing (argument structure, sentence structure, etc.) since a lot of the feedback I received was on my content. Still, this was a great class overall."

                "Yes, if you need a writing credit. I took this class because I was a second-semester sophomore and didn't have a writing credit yet. I enjoyed the structure and topic of this course, and overall had a really good time. But, I think there are other writing credit courses that are less difficult with grading, require less time outside of class, etc. If you like English classes, this is a great choice. If you're just looking for something to fill your schedule, this might not be what you're looking for.",

                "Yes if youre interested in food and want a writing credit!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if you need to build your basic writing skills. I had not had much practice with academic writing before and loved how this class provided the basics, but this class might be too low-level if you have done writing before. Additionally, learning about food was a lot of fun and I really enjoyed the subject matter."
