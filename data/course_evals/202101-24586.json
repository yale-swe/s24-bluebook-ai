I think class worked best when Professor Maggen briefly summarized the main threads of our discussion and asked related questions that we hadn't thought of or answered.",

It gives you a really helpful foundation in theories of crime and punishment and in the relationship between legal and social realms, which you can then apply to the incredibly interesting issues that will occupy our legal systems for decades to come: deep fakes, AI culpability, platform liability, virtual crimes.....this class really does pique your interests and imagination. I'd recommend it. Professor Maggen is also very available to help sharpen your ideas and discuss issues with you outside of class.",
