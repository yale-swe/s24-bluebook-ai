                "Strengths: great feedback from the instructor, great structure and organization which improved engagement.\r\nWeaknesses: overuse of breakout rooms - I wish we had spent more time in the main room discussing as a group which would have felt more like real classroom seminar discussions and less isolating.",
                "I found it a bit intense in terms of the amount of texts we were expected to get through. I thought the work load wasn't very well spread out because in some weeks we had multiple assessments on top of regular class work -- in my opinion the regular class work should just be to prepare for these assessments in such weeks, and particularly so because we were not given a timeline for the semester at any stage so it was a total surprise when lots of extra assignments just appeared on the schedule for the next week with no warning. As a graduate student taking the class, I found it frustrating that there were so many small bits and pieces of work all over the place, rather than any longer assignments where we had the opportunity to reflect in detail on issues or texts. In particular the final exam was disappointing in this regard since the format made it very difficult to show grammatical finesse as well as a good grasp of idiomatic French -- I sent my TA a detailed email outlining the issues I had with this form of assessment.\r\n\r\nHowever, I enjoyed the small class format, and the regular breakout rooms for one-to-one discussion were a highlight given the way in which the Covid pandemic has decimated such interactions with classmates. I also enjoyed that there was a mixture of films, books and plays, even if I didn't enjoy all of the picks and thought there were too many of them in total.",
                "Strengths include: the literature chosen, topics covered, among other things. This course had grammar lessons that could become repetitive but other than that I found the grammar also helpful.",
                "This course was great with improving oral communication skills because of the emphasis put on us to participate in class. I think this course could improve by having fewer break-out rooms allowing for more group class time.",
                "The strengths lie in its ability to foster good discussion between students about the text. The texts are engaging and difficult. One weakness is that there is a lack of emphasis on teaching during the classes and more on students using the knowledge they acquired during the homework. I prefer a class centered around teaching the material rather than reviewing it, but thats a preference."

                "I thought that the class worked very well virtually in general.\r\n\r\nI think that participation grades should have been relaxed somewhat given that this semester was pretty difficult for students. Due to the pressures of the semester and the work-load issues I mentioned above, I ended up having to take some unexcused absences which were not my fault and were directly a product of stress. It was a bit disappointing to me that these would be penalised with point deductions, since I think there should have been more wiggle room allowed. I sensed that my TA was surprised that I would still want\/need to miss the odd class after knowing that marks would be deducted for it, and honestly, as a TA myself, I found it irritating that a reasonable excuse such as not being able to complete all the work for a unreasonably heavy-duty week would be required to be penalised under the course rubric. This was especially surprising to me given that there was both a pandemic and general election this semester, and I must add that my TA was supportive on the personal level even if having to deduct points because of the rubric.",

One will be able to improve skills in all major areas of focus when learning a language: reading, writing, speaking. The course work proves to be the perfect level of challenging and  interesting allowing one to significantly improve in the language, while also keeping one engaged in the material.",
