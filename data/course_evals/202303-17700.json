                "I never thought I could learn a language, but after taking this course I believe I can.",

                "The main strength of this course is that it meets four days a week, including an asynchronous day. I greatly enjoyed that structure because we would spend those four days in class learning new material, and the asynchronous activity provided a low-stakes graded assignment to apply the knowledge from the week. Many of these activities had us engaging with Italian culture, which I greatly enjoyed. It could be improved upon by doing more grammar learning in class, as much of it is through keeping up with the textbook and VHL activities outside of the class.",
                "This class is a great beginner learning environment. The assignments are usually a lot of fun and classes are engaging. The only weakness, or drawback, is the frequency of assignments. There are six unit tests, a final presentation, and a final exam. Just something to keep in mind.",
                "Good at immersing us in the language, but not the best at helping me fully understand what I was learning or answering y questions.",
                "The frequency of classes was a strength. However, I believe that the class being based around the textbook seems slightly outdated.",
                "The absolute strongest part of the course was the instructor, who was incredibly committed to helping us learn and make the class varied and more interesting.\r\n\r\nOne major weakness of the course was the different levels of engagement of the students: some students were very involved, but for some students, I was really puzzled why they were even taking the class, given how little they seemed to be putting into the class. This would have been solved, I think, by offering an intensive version of the course in the fall, since I imagine the more motivated students would have filtered into that. The other major weakness was the textbook, which does not offer great explanations for grammar and is generally annoying to use."

                "Yes!! This course helped build a quick Italian knowledge that has already allowed me to engage in Italian conversation after only one semester. It is a great introduction course to a beautiful language!",
                "If you're at all interested in learning Italian, yes! This is a great beginner course that covers a lot of ground and will leave you with a level of basic fluency.",
                "No, because I found it difficult to get the grades I wanted with the knowledge I was given. It was a fun class, but you have to put in a lot of work.",
                "I would recommend this class for someone looking to learn Italian. It is very facilitative of students who have no prior knowledge.",
                "This is a great way to learn some Italiantheres nothing like going to a class four times a week to jump start your knowledge. Classes were sufficiently varied so that it felt at least somewhat different each time, and our instructor was incredibly dedicated. More than most classes, this is the kind of class where you get out of it what you put into it, so if youre willing to put in the work you can come out at the end of the semester with a good grasp of the language."
