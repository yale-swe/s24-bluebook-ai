Also I feel like I came out of it with a really good understanding of the material. And the quantum physics stuff was superrrr interesting and really well explained. This class is one of those that just ... expanded my brain",

The rest of Maxwell's Equations (magnetostatics, inductance, EM waves).\r\n3. Relativity (special relativity and how it transforms electromagnetism).\r\n4. Quantum mechanics (Stern-Gerlach experiment, Bloch spheres, entanglement, Bell's Theorem).\r\n\r\nThere was also a fair amount of calculus and vector calculus, although nothing crazy.\r\n\r\nTopics that are covered in 181 but not in 261: circuits, permanent magnets, optics.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The course is taught largely by Prof. Harris walking through powerpoints during each lecture, and then those powerpoints are posted to canvas. This means that you have access to all of the contents of the course at all times, which definitely comes in handy when studying for tests. Weaknesses: The PSETs for this class can be really challenging. They largely get easier as the course continues but some of the advanced electricity and magnetism in the beginning of the semester makes the work really difficult.",
                "Strengths: Organization. The lecture slides were incredibly detailed, so I would print them out before class, and then I could focus on the content instead of trying to frantically write everything down. The problem sets and exams were very reasonable extensions of the course material, and we followed the textbook enough that it was helpful for studying for exams. In lectures, Prof. Harris did a good job of stopping for questions and answering them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we'd done more quantum mechanics. The course was taught with the assumption that we would all eventually learn quantum mechanics in more depth in our 400-level physics courses, but as someone who isn't likely to take more physics courses, I was disappointed not to have learned more here. On the other hand, I don't think there was any way to do the rest of the course faster, so I don't know how this would be fixed.",
                "Strengths: We got to see cool topics beyond typical EM, such as how electric and magnetic fields work in special relativity and the basics of quantum mechanics. Frequent office hours/TA hours/peer tutor hours. Weaknesses: The course failed to effectively teach most of its content. For example, I know of no one who could answer either of the first 2 (out of 8) questions on the final exam. I believe this was mostly due the professor's teaching style.",
                "Strengths: the material is interestingspecial relativity and quantum mechanics are objectively very cool. The TAs were lovely. \r\nWeaknesses: For a course this difficult and inflexible with deadlines, there were not enough resources. There were serious mistakes on slides regularly, and the lectures were never recorded.",
                "Harris did a great job of answering questions during lectures. However, course content wasnt very linear - it was pretty common for him to say oh, I noticed you guys didnt really understand something from two lectures ago, so well spend today going over that again. This led to some rushed content and some content not making sense as well as it wouldve if presented in a straight line.",
                "This class covered electricity and magnetism, special relativity, and quantum mechanics in an efficient manner while building a foundation for each of the three fields beforehand. The class would be improved if more practice problems or sources of practice problems were provided, because since all of the textbook problems are very difficult, I often had trouble practicing and learning new topics initially. Having an in-person peer tutor hour session would also help greatly, as since they were all online it was hard to collaborate with others on problems and ask for solutions.",
                "The midterms and psets seemed to be graded very arbitrarily, and we rarely knew what we actually got marked off for. Mistakes in the slides and pset answer keys made it difficult to learn the material. The midterms felt unreasonably long, to the point where it felt more like a test on how fast we could compute a difficult integral instead of the physics itself. Special relativity was taught in PHYS 260, so if that is always the case, more time with the E&M concepts would have been appreciated.",
                "The course, in my opinion, could add a bit more rigor in the treatment of electromagnetism.",
                "Quantum mechanics part was too short and incomplete. Required large leaps in logic... might be worth removing.",
                "Good course",
                "Strengths: interesting material, professor is kind and available for questions reliably\r\nWeaknesses: e&m was a lot of material, and the lectures were very intense. Exams were far too many hard questions in too little time.",
                "Strengths: teaches the material, which is generally interesting. Griffiths is a really wonderful textbook.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Harris's choices on how to allocate time sometimes seemed suboptimal. We would spend a long time reviewing steps in mathematical reasoning which made sense almost immediately, and then gloss over (or even just not cover) other, more complex steps in solving the same problems. This lead to my having an understanding of the beginnings and ends of problems, as well as formulas to use, but not getting an intuition for how and why the beginnings connect to the ends.",
                "Strengths: Well-prepared lectures slides with lots of helpful diagrams\r\nWeaknesses: Errors on lecture slides (particularly in the quantum mechanics section of the course); because information has already been typed up and consolidated, we go through material sometimes too quickly",
                "Strengths: awesome textbook, some good homework qs\r\nWeaknesses: Jack Harris, lecture slides were cluttered and confusing",
                "Prof. Harris is a great lecturer, and he really knows how to explain a topic from the ground up.",
                "The last month when we learned about quantum mechanics, the material did not seem very well organized. However, I think the part of the course when we learned about electrodynamics was much better organized and was taught well."

                "I would recommend this course to a student if they are genuinely really interested in physics, and have had a significant amount of physics experience before hand (such as up to AP Physics C E&M in high school). If the student is interested in physics, they will really enjoy a lot of the content of this course which is quite interesting and exciting. They would likely want a significant amount of experience with physics however, because otherwise, the psets would become quite overwhelming.",
                "Yes definitely. It's really hard, probably the hardest class I've ever taken, but the material was fascinating and I feel like I improved my problem solving skills as well as my understanding of physics immensely. Prof. Harris is such a great teacher.",
                "Definitely. It's more difficult than 181 or 201, but not excessively so, and Prof. Harris teaches it well. I think it's worth it to learn the material in more depth, like seeing how Maxwell's laws lead to special relativity, and then how special relativity affects electric and magnetic fields.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'll say is that if you're taking 261 largely to get to the quantum mechanics at the end, it's not worth it. We spent the majority of the semester on E&M, so if you're interested in quantum mechanics, you'll want to take a full-semester quantum class at some point.",
                "I would not recommend this course to anyone at all, mainly due to how it was taught. Some illustrative moments from the semester: 1) We spent about fifteen minutes of one lecture manipulating a complicated integral by hand, only to plug it into a numerical calculator after all since it was impossible to solve any other way. The professor was aware of this all along. 2) Upon realizing most of the class didn't understand how probabilities worked when doing calculations with qubits, we spent a whole lecture repeating material from the previous week. It was explained in exactly the same way the second time; I don't think it helped. 3) One person got a high A on an exam despite getting just one question correct on it. This reflected a pattern of lenient grading masking a class-wide lack of understanding. 4) During our discussion of Bell's theorem, the professor used the same variables to represent similar but actually subtly, crucially different values. That attempt to simplify the proof backfired to make it more confusing. 5) When one student was asking questions after class, the instructor began to pack up to nonverbally signal that he needed to go. The student kept asking questions, and the professor never said, \"Sorry, I need to go, see me at office hours\"; instead, he kept answering the questions more and more tersely, then began saying \"That question is outside the scope of the course,\" instead of answering properly. It seemed like he either didn't know the answers to the questions and was trying to hide the fact; or he wasn't really listening to the questions; or he truly believed his job as a teacher was merely to \"teach to the test\". Either way, his attitude quashed curiosity. I was saddened that a Yale professor's behavior could be so antithetical to Yale's project of higher education. 6) There's more I could mention, but the point is: don't take this class with this professor.",
                "If you survived 260, youll survive this class, but it was harder and less organized. Honestly, still recommend just for the small community.",
                "I think its a great class to investigate whether you want to be a physics major (it showed me that I didnt). Take it for that purpose - wouldnt recommend it if you just need a year of physics, but you probably already know that.",
                "I would only recommend this course for prospective Physics majors. The content is extremely difficult and unnecessary for engineering students or other majors who require physics.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this class. I feel you don't get much out of it that you wouldn't get out of one of the other introductory physics courses. You could save yourself a lot of work and have a better support system in one of those classes.",
                "Probably not. I havent heard great things about PHYS 200 this semester either, so I suppose it depends on the level of preparation. If Harris is not teaching, then I would say yes, because the content has the potential to be interesting. With Harris, the grading felt arbitrary and the slides often had incorrect information on them. The answer keys were often incomplete or didnt match up with the problems they were supposed to be answering. The midterms felt impossible to complete within the allotted time frame.",
                "Yes! Great introduction into the power of Maxwell's equations.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in physics.",
                "Presumably this student needs to take introductory physics (otherwise, I would not recommend the class). I have no idea how 261 compares to other courses on the same material (e.g. physics 201), but if there were an alternative I would recommend at least shopping it. This said, if the student is already familiar with electricity and magnetism, or is willing to read the textbook, and do extra problems (this is a lot of work, but will be rewarding), the class will teach electricity and magnetism, and the quantum bit at the end is really, really interesting and fairly well-taught.",
                "Yes, as long as you have a good foundation in basic electricity and magnetism -- it is assumed you have a good grasp of the content covered in, say, AP Physics, and the course touches very little upon circuits.",
                "Yes, but with different prof.",
                "Yes! This course is quite intellectually challenging but is also very rewarding.  You get a solid foundational understanding of Maxwell's equations and basic knowledge of special relativity and quantum physics, and Prof. Harris teaches the class very well.  Both the problem sets and tests are difficult (a tip - the PSET questions that aren't from the textbook are indicative of what test questions will look like.), but the grading isn't particularly harsh.",
                "Definitely, even for non-majors if you enjoy physics and have the time. You get a great introduction to many topics (e&m, relativity, quantum).",
                "If you really enjoy physics, this is a great course. If you just need a physics pre-requisite, take a lower level course."
