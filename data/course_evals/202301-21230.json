Its one of the first (and only) classes where everyone is a major, and its also a great way to meet faculty in the department. At least in this iteration of the course, it was a great time to sharpen skills in analytic writing with the weekly reading responses.",

                "Truly fantastic course! The highlight was definitely the self-directed final project. There was a lot of flexibility in how we could do it, and I think it was nice to have an assignment not strictly centered on something academic. It was also great to meet your peers in the major. Professor Vora was also kind and knowledgeable; she definitely brought a fresh perspective to the readings.",
                "The readings gave us such a broad range and were also really interesting. Class discussions were super fruitful and well organized. I think slightly shorter reading responses would make the courseload more manageable because it was a bit difficult to keep up since readings tended to be heavy too."

                "I would! Aside from it being required for ER&M majors, it was a really strong synthesis of a lot of the themes present in other ER&M and related courses, helping us build a more cohesive understanding of the field."
