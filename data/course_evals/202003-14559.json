                "I learned how to study an author's body of work and interrogate how his ideas might have shifted. This course gave me the opportunity to consider historical factors and the influence of time on a body of writing. It also allowed me to analyze the relationship between Baldwin's fiction and essays. This was a very engaging and thought-provoking course and provided ample opportunity to think critically and receive feedback about my ideas. I also learned how to use Yale's archives successfully and how to make a podcast, giving me skills that will help me be a more successful english major in the future.",
                "I gained a really in-depth knowledge about James Baldwin's writings. This course explored his fiction, his non-fiction, and his surrounding cultural impact.",
                "The most valuable insight was that generated through our class discussions. During such a strange and disorienting semester, the course was an anchor to do critical thinking with a cohort of equally passionate students. We not only read Baldwin, we read Baldwin, talked about him with each other, and after amounting knowledge about him and his writing, tried to understand him, the history he lived, and the racial injustice he witnessed. Our discussion revolved around connecting Baldwin's works together, parsing through his writing in context with his lived circumstances, comparing his fiction and non-fiction, and often applying his insight to our modern lives. Prof. Goldsby allowed us to think together and by ourselves, and the projects assigned to us (a mid-term paper and a longer final paper with the option of doing a podcast or story map) only helped us further extend the practices we developed in class."

                "This course was extremely well done. The professor was so involved and excited by the course material, and that made all of the students even more excited about the syllabus as well.",
                "If James Baldwin's works weren't already important enough and genuinely interesting to read, Prof. Goldsby managed to structure the readings in such a way that truly allowed us to form a mental image of the man and a map of his works. Prof. Goldsby was also the highlight of the semester -- she is so knowledgeable, genuinely cares about our growth during the course, and as a result, made class such a joy to be in. The option to explore some other multimedia formats greatly helped during a semester of online courses, where typing so many papers on a laptop we already spend so much time staring at can only get more and more stale. There really are no weaknesses to this course - take this class!"

I have no suggestions for how to make it better.",

                "Though discussion seminars generally take a hit from the virtual format, this course remained incredibly engaging -- and I think this was due to Prof. Goldsby's ability to facilitate discussion and detect general sentiment from the students in the class. Rather than concrete practices, I think the most essential part of making any seminar work, and especially a virtual seminar during a pandemic, is being able to sympathize and work together -- professor and students -- and this course definitely accomplished that."

                "Yes. Professor Goldsby led an engaging and thought-provoking class throughout the entirety of an online semester. The coursework helped me learn how to engage with a body of an author's work and think critically about the relationship between literature and history and culture. It also taught me how to do archive research and make a podcast. I feel like I learned so much about James Baldwin and the role of literature in our society. By far, a phenomenal course, even in a novel semester.",
                "Yes- definitely! If you are at all curious about James Baldwin's writings (or if you have never read him at all) then this is the class for you. His writing is really timely and so wonderful, and this class is a really great way to engage with just one author.",
                "One hundred times yes - the readings are incredible, Prof. Goldsby is a joy to learn from and think together with, and she approaches such a seemingly daunting author with an infectious passion and curiosity that makes us all want to work and contribute."
