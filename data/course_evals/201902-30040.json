    "I learned alot about the structure and elements of myths and their functions in ancient societies.  I also was able to read many of the greek and roman tragedies, the epics.  I learned about pantheon of gods in literature.  It enables me to read with more insight and clarity of any kind of literature and focus on themes, motifs, character development, purpose, etc.",
    "I feel like I learned to read critically and extrapolate classics and other historical documents to modern issues.",
    "I learned more about classical mythology and how it relates to the modern world: From popular culture to modern literature to societal norms, mythology can be used to analyze and understand how different societies behaved and what they believed.",
    "I learned about how we can learn about a culture from its stories."

    "I love this course and Prof. Kraus was very convincing, knowledgeable and accessible during the class and other times.  The only weakness was that I didnt get to take it over the course of a regular semester.  \r\nThe only weakness is the classroom itself.  I would have preferred a more modern one.",
    "Honestly it was structured so well !! Maybe breaking up the class time more concretely? 3 hours is just a really long time in general.",
    "- The biggest strength was the material we covered, as we read a wide variety of materials seen. From various epics to scholarly articles and even an artistic dance, this course clearly showed many different ways to interpret mythology.\r\n\r\n- Another strength was the way the class was structured, as it was almost entirely based on discussion amongst the group. \r\n\r\n- In some occasions, I felt like the workload was too high",
    "It could be incredibly boring at times simply because the class is three hours long."

    "YES. A great introduction to Classical literature--it makes such a difference to have a professor guiding you through the material who is both brilliant and deeply at home in the texts AND their treatment in history\/academia\/religion\/culture. Be aware that it's not a gut, but it's also not overwhelming! There's enough reading to keep you busy, but the assigned work (really, discussions and quizzes) is super reasonable. If you have even a passing interest in the subject, you'll have a blast.",
    "Yes, I loved this course for its content, its professor and the overall experience.",
    "A great summer course taught by an even better professor thats enjoyable but also stimulating.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. You learn a lot about how classical myths influence modern society."
