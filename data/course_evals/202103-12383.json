                "strength: the content is extremely useful and almost everyone can benefit from taking this course. The class is also approachable for people at all levels and all majors, and is extremely welcoming.\r\nWeakness: there could be more discussion between students during class",
                "Strength: Journals were great way to connect class to observations\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes was more of a lecture instead of a discussion seminar",
                "Strengths: The content was phenomenal. If you are even vaguely interested in teaching or education, I would highly recommend this class. We got to do (masked and outdoor) observations at various daycares and it was an amazing experience. I only wished that I had taken this class during non-COVID times so that I could observe inside the classroom. I also enjoyed my individual child observations, although it was a bit difficult because I chose to observe a child over Zoom. If you can, I suggest finding a child to observe in-person. Weaknesses: I felt like the expectations for the journal assignments\/final presentation were unclear, which made these assignments anxiety-producing to complete. I never knew if I was on the right track, and I'm not sure that the feedback from the first journal helps in writing the second one. However, I did enjoy writing about the child observations. I also felt like sometimes the reading became a bit repetitive, and some of it was not as engaging. I also wish that we had had more discussion time; the class was more like a lecture.",
                "1) I wish the class had more discussion and cross-talk. The structure of the course is lecture-heavy, even though the class size is small. 2) Furthermore, I would have appreciated more support in finding and interacting with the children we were observing one-on-one this semester. I got a lot of value out of having my child observations be in-person rather than virtual. 3) I wanted to see more data during the class. That's what I'm used to in my psychology classes. It seemed like a lot of what we were learning was based on expert intuition, rather than peer-reviewed articles.",
                "It would be helpful to have more discussions and this was a very lecture-heavy seminar. \r\nProfs were great and all lectures were engaging. \r\nMore clarity on the assignments would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: Open discussion with students, challenge students to observe and communicate extensive detail, guest speakers, high level of collaboration with child care professionals, real world case study examples.",
                "Strengths are the classmates. Would have liked more seminar style classes though",
                "The course was awesome and I have no recommendations except perhaps some more structure within the canvas system and our weekly application through guiding questions.",
                "Strengths: Lecture\/Discussion format of the class, class-size, manageable weekly readings, manageable assignments, diversity in teaching, multiple opportunities for child observation\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough discussion time after lectures, certain students would repeatedly dominate conversations"

It always felt like refresh every time I was in the class and I'll miss that a lot.",

                "Yes- really interesting if youre at all fascinated by child psychology.",
                "Yes valuable lessons not only in the field of psychology but also life. Genuine care for students and our questions and insights shown by instructors.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the topic",
                "Yes! Childhood development is an essentially important subject to everyone who is considering becoming a parent, educator, policy maker, or simply is concerned with people's future well being in general.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student seeking a career\/profession working WITH or FOR children. This course was especially powerful for those wishing to learn more about early childhood\/education policy and so a more general audience of students that wish to know more about the childcare landscape would also benefit from this course."
