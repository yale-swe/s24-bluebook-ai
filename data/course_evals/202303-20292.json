One weakness of the course was the slight disconnect between the prerequisites for the course and what we were expected to be familiar with in class -- the course only requires PHYS 181, but some of the material we sped through during the semester covered topics found in higher physics courses.",
                "The course is a super unique way to learn about the material covered, you really don't get the chance to have this combination of science and its history in many other classes. The class could lean into this even more than it did with a greater focus on the historical aspects.  You learn a lot of physics in this class which is mostly a strength, but at times it maybe moved through concepts a bit too quickly."

                "Yes! If you enjoy physics and need a physics elective, this class was very fun -- both to learn more about Einstein as a person, but also as a great review of stat mech and relativity.",
                "I would recommend this class for someone who has some physics background and wants to engage with the history of science more than the typical class. It is a really great class if you meet those criteria, but if you don't have the physics background you will struggle and if you don't have the interest in the historical and philosophical parts of the course you won't really get as much out of it as a more conventional class."
