   "comments": [
    "It teaches a lot which is very useful I think.\r\nIt is all taught very fast so it sometimes difficult to distinguish what you need to do when eg what integral you need to do or what rule you need to apply etc.",
    "Strengths - there are Ximera modules that supplement the course that really aid with studying, Sudesh and his review sessions are amazing, it can be fun if you enjoy the material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - different sections get different levels of teaching and oftentimes it seems \"unfair\"",
    "i felt that there wasnt enough support for people who are needing help succeeding in the class.",
    "Its strength is its clarity and uniformity across the sections in presenting material. I don't know how it could be improved.",
    "Sections have really high variability",
    "Interesting materials, but need a little more time to be taught. Also, 3 days a week is a better model than only twice.",
    "The courses strength was mainly day to day organization and a very clear sense of direction as well as general explanations of the material. Its only weakness is organization on the individual problem level.",
    "Not all of the professors are equal and it definitely shows",
    "Less group work, perhaps smaller class size to make the experience more personal and intimate.",
    "Weaknesses: There is so much variability in the instructors. If you get a good instructor, the class is much easier but if not, you have to put in a lot more time outside of class. My instructor was new so there were many times in class when he couldn't solve examples and he left them for us to figure out on our own. Strengths: There is a lot of help available. Your own prof has office hours and another professor I reached out to let me come to his as well. There are also peer tutors that have several hours a week, as well as the residential college tutors. The Ximera modules, practice problem sessions, and review sessions are also an amazing resource that if taken advantage of, should make the class really doable.",
    "Strength: straightforward albeit confusing (at times) content and coursework (just PSETs)\r\nWeakenesses: student engagement (could be greater), very detached from real-world problems involving this kind of math\r\n\r\nAlso, (detailed) solutions to all\/most problems in the lecture notes should absolutely be included on Canvas, but they were not.",
    "The design of this course was very organized and provided each student with the resources to do well, especially the Ximera modules.",
    "The class is poorly taught and poorly organized.",
    "The difficulty of the material and subpar instruction in this course meant that any student that wanted to do well had to put in significant time outside of class to teach themselves the material."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is very helpful in improving calculus skills, so if someone wants to do a math related major or something, this course will be very helpful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because the material was fun\/interesting and studying for it is not too bad if you use the resources provided to you.",
    "i would not unless they feel very prepared because this class was very difficult for me and i felt it was too fast paced with not enough support to facilitate my success",
    "Yes I would. It was interesting and the right level of challenge but also not too demanding. The instructors and resources were good, too.",
    "This is a tough course in that there is no curve and that many students in this class have previously taken multivariable calculus.  However, you also do learn a lot of math very quickly if you put in the work.",
    "No, not in the fall at least.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who appreciates the beauty and\/or function of calculus.",
    "i would recommend it if they got a good professor",
    "Not really, because I think the overall structure of the class makes it difficult to learn unless you are extremely outgoing and put in a lot of effort.",
    "I shopped both this and ENAS 151 and I think that this course has much more help available, and the homeworks and ximera modules are great preparation for the exams, whereas for ENAS 151 I've heard the exams are wilder. I would recommend this over ENAS 151 but again, only if you have to take multi.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because teaches you fundamentals that are needed in higher courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to take on the next level of mathematics after calculus. But be prepared for some 10+ page psets, especially towards the end of the semester when examples take up multiple chalkboards. Also be prepared to do a lot of comprehension outside of the classroom, since it is a very fast moving course.",
    "Seeing as this course is a prerequisite for most other fields in science and mathematics, I would recommend this course to another student. In the same breath however, this course requires the student to largely teach themselves the material as most of the instructors, besides the program coordinator himself, cannot intuitively teach the material past running through practice problems."
