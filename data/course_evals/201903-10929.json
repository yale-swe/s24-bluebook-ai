    "In this course I learned so much about early poetry, from Canterbury Tales to Paradise Lost. I had little to no background in the poets\/poems covered throughout the course, except for a handful of Shakespearean sonnets and a few other Renaissance poems, and I learned a great deal about poetic styles and generally how to read and interpret poetry at a high level.",
    "I learned how to sift through poetry and close read in a way that I've never done before. I learned how in-depth I really need to go on papers in order to succeed in my future English courses.",
    "I learned about poetry and how to read it and interpret it beyond the basics."

    "I would strongly recommend this course! At first glance the subject matter may seem rather dull and rigid, as it is poetry by mainly privileged dead white men, but this course gives a strong foundation in poetry and literature in general - you learn how to actually read, interpret, and discuss poetry. Every time I thought that a poem was not for me, I learned so much from Prof. Manley that made me change my mind and come to appreciate the artistry of the many poets we studied.",
    "Yes, it gave me a great fundamental understanding of English Poetry and what is necessary for understanding in a college-level English class.",
    "If you need to take it for the major, then sure."
