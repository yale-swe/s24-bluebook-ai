                "This course introduces you to the writings of Marx and Lenin to begin study of communism. Then the course examines Stalin's Soviet Union and communism in practice. The course closes the study of communism with selected readings from former communists describing their journey to disenchantment. Similarly, the course began the study of fascism with academic papers attempting to do just that. You will find that it is difficult to define fascism. From there, you will study Hitler's personal ideology which shaped his brand of fascism. The key insight this course provides is an extension to modern day via discussion of the legacy of Hitler and Stalin in the 2010s.",

                "I've learnt about 20th century history before, but Snyder's take on things is totally different to what you might have learnt in high school.  You learn to absorb a lot of material quickly and think critically about what you're learning constantly because of the intensive writing component.",
                "The weekly assignments were helpful to strengthen analytical\/writing skills.  The topics and historical concepts discussed in lecture and in the readings were new and at times challenging.  In addition to material about Hitler and Stalin, this course focused on broader approaches to and applications of history.",
                "I learned about the ideology behind Nazism and Stalinism and how they apply both in history and today.",
                "Writing\/Editing skills through the 12 essays and 6 revised essays assignments; understanding of the legacies of empire and colonialism in Europe, Russia, and America; historical perspective\r\nStrengths: extremely engaging course; the readings usually felt relevant to the course; plenty of opportunities for feedback",
                "I think I became better at handling heavy writing tasks, as well as at editing my own work. I learned so much about the connections between Stalin and Hitler, in addition to many universal themes in history that are applicable to other historical periods.",
                "I learned to synthesize primary and secondary sources to make weekly historical arguments. I learned extensively about the regimes of Hitler and Stalin, and why those regimes matter for today. I learned what it means to think and write like a historian.",
                "In this course I gained an understanding of both fascism as defined by Hitler, and communism defined by Stalin, how the ideologies were related, and how each played out in practice across the Eurasian continent in the early to mid-20th century.",
                "I learned a great deal about the history and rise of the Soviet Union. In particular, this included learning about the continuity and change from Marxism to Leninism, and eventually Stalinism. A key theme of the course, the rise and fall of empire, was a fascinating way to confront the rise of Hitler and Stalin.",
                "In this course, we were required to produce weekly essays based on primary and secondary sources, which was a challenging but rewarding exercise in itself. I learned to synthesize ideas from different sources and produce nuanced historical analysis.",
                "I learned an enormous amount about the experience of eastern Europe in WWII. My writing improved dramatically. I was given a very powerful insight into how history is essential to us in the modern day as a tool to counteract memory politics employed by populist movements.",
                "This class was wonderful. I learned how to become a better writer and critical thinker. I learned how to address difficult subject matter in a objective way. I dealt with very difficult subject matter but was able to handle it pretty effectively because of the teacher and the class itself. I was provided with clear feedback and was very in-tune with the topic. I learned about the true impact of Hitler and Stalin as well."

            "comments": [
                "The main strength of this course, besides Prof. Snyder himself, is the syllabus. From the beginning of the semester, it is sufficiently clear what is expected of the students. The course description sets out with a very specific goal and it meets it. If you do all the readings, you will leave this class with a strong understanding of fascism, communism, and the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. This course could be improved by requiring essays less frequently. Although the essays are not very long, the fact that there is one due every week feels like a bit much at times.",
                "Prof. Snyder is incredibly engaging -- his lectures are interesting, thorough, and answer questions you don't even realize are important until he's addressed them. In addition, section is a useful time for placing the ideas covered in lecture in context and understanding their places in history.  The weaknesses of this course are mainly in the workload -- there is a ton of reading and writing throughout, meaning that I was always thinking about and working for this class. This was rewarded with a relatively low-effort final project, though.",
                "too much work-- just an actually impossible amount. the lectures were phenomenal though, as were the readings. 12 essays is just a few too many and it got in the way of my ability to do all the reading.",
                "Very interesting course material. Exposed me to a different part of history that I had no knowledge of.",
                "The course design with recorded lectures, weekly writing assignments and section is extremely engaging as you cannot take a week off and allows you to work consistently on your writing without putting too much stress on any assignment like a midterm or final. The problem with this setup is that at some points you will feel like you need a week off and it may be hard to keep up engagement over the entire term.",
                "The structure of the course was too much. The weekly assignments were an overload during the pandemic and made it difficult for anyone who was mildly struggling to succeed in the course.",
                "The strengths of the course are its content and the TAs and professor. The class is hard work but you definitely leave the semester having learned so much more than you'd expect. Prof. Snyder's lectures are quite clear and straightforward and my TA was quite helpful. A weakness may be perhaps just the breadth of readings every week, especially given that some of the readings are sometimes almost word for word material that is mentioned in the lecture. Perhaps streamlining this to avoid the repetition would improve the class in the long-run.",
                "Strengths: extremely engaging course; readings usually felt very relevant & were from thinkers I hadn't read before; revision process was painless\r\nWeaknesses: occasionally essay prompts could feel repetitive; would have been a better class if there had been a built-in rest week midway through the semester where there was no essay due (on top of having the lowest score dropped); section discussion focused more on writing the essays, which was frustrating because it was the only opportunity to have face-to-face interactions on course material (which rarely happened in my section); more standardized section discussions would have made this a much stronger course",
                "I enjoyed all the reading selections and appreciated the variety of sources we were directed to for our weekly writing assignments. It was refreshing and humbling to engage with audio testimonies, newly published memoirs, and primary sources from WWII. This was also the first history course I've taken where I actively return to read the feedback and think about what edits I want to make. I would have hoped for a little bit more guidance on the prompts and for the lectures to be released earlier than they were (a few were posted 24 hours before the writing assignment for the same week was due).",
                "I loved the way Prof. Snyder adapted to the pandemic by removing the screens as much as possible. The podcast format and handwritten essay component was much appreciated. I needed a break from Zoom! Prof. Snyder's lectures were incredible, as usual, but I don't need to say that. His success as a historian says it all. It's incredible how often we read his own books. He is a gifted instructor and writer. I would have liked to see a live talk-back session component to supplement the recorded podcasts, that way some sort of face-to-face contact with him would be possible. That's the only weakness I can think of; this course was excellent!",
                "I thought the general premise of this course, as well as most of the readings, were fascinating. I liked how Prof. Snyder made a point of doing an audio-only lecture; it was refreshing compared to other courses.\r\nI also liked the layout of the course. Even though the workload was larger than average with a 1000 word paper due each week, it was nice that we were able to revise some of those papers at the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: very informative and in-depth, knowledgable (genius?) professor, and excellent readings\r\nWeaknesses: overwhelming amount of work at an extremely fast pace with limited lenience, no live lecture with limited office hours the only possibility to meet the professor",
                "I found the weekly essays to decrease in value as the semester went on. In the beginning I felt like they helped me engage with the course, but by the end it seemed like a busy-work assignment. This was particularly the case with the Fortunoff assignments. I found the idea of diving in and just picking a random Holocaust testimony to write about seemed rather disingenuous. I think the source assignments could have done a better job relating to each other, and I think this would improve the course. At points it felt as though each week were it's own course and that there was little continuity -  this was cemented by the fact that the final dossier was 6 one off assignments glued together with seemingly no relation.",
                "Strengths: Professor Snyder's lectures were the best part of this course. TF's gave timely feedback on papers and the class was overall very well-organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes Professor Snyder can get pretty abstract, and it would feel like he was simply throwing out big, general claims without supporting\/justifying them with historical evidence. I would have appreciated more robust empirical evidence for those general claims.\r\nTowards the end of the semester I also felt fatigued with essay writing, to the point where I had written so much that I couldn't really tell if I was convinced by my own arguments or not. \r\nI can't stress this enough: we should receive a writing credit for this course!",
                "Professor Snyder is an amazing lecturer and hes seriously intelligent. He will open your eyes to a completely new and exciting way of doing history. Hes not only concerned with fact but with philosophy - not only what happened but what it means for that thing to have happened, and how that impacts us today.",
                "strenghts:  the podcast format works well and sections were very helpful. I enjoyed that sections focused on how to write rather than reviewing that taught in lecture. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: one paper a week was way too much. although I enjoyed writing and surely learned a lot, i could have done more reading if i didn't have to spend hours each week on a paper. a big writing load is certainly good, but maybe once every two weeks is better.",
                "The class was almost perfect in my book, so I am just going to talk about the few weaknesses. At the end of the course, I felt like we strayed from Hitler and Stalin to a more broad sweeping claim about Trump, and I did not enjoy bringing modern politics into the class. The class moved at a very rapid pace; therefore, it would have been nice for a slight break one week in the semester. But, I did love the weekly rhythm of the class, and it kept me very organized. Some of the readings were not needed for some of the essays, so it was easy not to do the reading for some weeks. I feel like that defeats the purpose of the class though."

                "Successes: minimal zoom time (only time spent on zoom was 50-minute section); heavy structure (scanned lecture notes, reading notes, essay outlines, & weekly essays) did not stress me out & was helpful with remaining engaged; emphasis on primary sources; emphasis on 3 categories that make for good history practices (memory, engagement, and the individual)\r\nImprovement: More contact with Professor Snyder (besides office hours)- I have never seen his face- could have done mandatory small group meetings at some point; an essay each week was good for engagement, but by the midway point, I desperately needed a week without one- we had an essay due the day after election day (& had to ask for an extension) and an essay due over Thanksgiving break (our only break in the semester)- I think this weakness could have been improved with a bit more compassion when crafting the syllabus. Obviously there was quite a bit of thought that went into structuring this course; I wish there would have been better foresight in recognizing that we had to survive an 1) election year, 2) a semester with 0 breaks until week 11, and 3) a pandemic and that each of these factors on its own would mandate having a week with no required writing. However, I still will look back on this class as my favorite at Yale, so this criticism only comes from a place of appreciation.",
                "The sections felt tight-knit and well-structured, so discussions were always fruitful. I think Professor Snyder perhaps could have invited all students to his office hours at some point in the semester to meet each of us.",
                "The instructors did everything great given the pandemic. The change I'd like to see does not need to come from them, but from the university. The only way to make this class better is to offer it in person again.",

The weekly source assignment structure was quite difficult to keep up with, although I did enjoy the opportunity to get consistent feedback on my writing. Maybe in future semesters a source assignment every other week would be more appropriate, but overall grading was reasonable and TFs were flexible.",
                "the podcast format works well and sections were very helpful. I enjoyed that sections focused on how to write rather than reviewing that taught in lecture.  office hours were very available.",
                "The class was great in this regards. Very little time spent on the computer. A lot of time spent dealing with the materials in person, not through the computer. I felt like I was actually learning instead of just memorizing like I did for many of my other classes. The weekly rhythm kept me in check, and the essays always kept me interested. And the discussion was always very strong. I wish I would have met the professor or at least a live zoom. The podcasts created a disparity between a voice and a personable face."

With that said, it is 100% worth the investment if you have the time in your schedule and are interested in the subject matter. The grading of the essays is absolutely pain-free as long as you have something to say. I would imagine this depends on your TA, though. I am not personally a fan of the fact that we had to submit reading and lecture notes, but it kept me on my toes so I guess it served its purpose. If you can, take this class and sign up for Orel's section!",
                "This class was an excellent introductory level history class, and I loved every lecture and section, even if I wasn't a history student or particularly interested in Eastern Europe before enrolling. I learned something meaningful every week and gained new, nuanced perspectives over the course of the semester. However, this class is definitely high-workload, and it will become a dominant force in your semester. I would definitely recommend this class to an underclassman, but it might be a bit much to balance with writing a thesis, applying to jobs, and finishing other major requirements for someone closer to the end of their time at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. I learned more than I have in any other yale course and have never before been able to retain that much information about history. All the info was presented in such an engaging and compelling way. I LOVED this course!!! it will make you smarter",
                "Yes, the class is very well organized and it is a different history course than I have ever taken.",
                "If you have any interest in the Holocaust, Soviet Union or Eastern Europe, you will love this class. I also highly recommend it to anybody interested in intellectual history, oral history, or exploring the nature of historical work and why it matters.",
                "I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn a lot and finds 20th century history interesting.  But only if you're willing to do the high workload.",
                "No, because the weekly workload was too much. For an individual who struggles with persistent deadlines dependent on hours of reading and listening to recorded lectures, this course is not for you.",
                "I definitely would. The subject matter is so important to remember and to consider when looking at world governments today.",
                "Yes. I don't think this course will ever be offered again (in this particular way), but if I had to do it over again I would. Obviously, it is an extremely high workload, and I think more consideration could have gone into the structure considering there was a pandemic, election year, & an 11-week\/no break semester. However, I have never learned so much in a single semester from any other course at Yale and think that I got everything I was hoping to get out of this class, which has rarely happened in my time here.",
                "Yes. After taking this course, I've realized how important it is to learn about Hitler and Stalin's regimes in the 20th century. Something I've personally grappled with is how to extract from primary sources and make historical arguments while being mindful of the trauma and pain experienced by their authors.",
                "Absolutely. It teaches history in a different way than other Yale courses. You will learn to synthesize primary and secondary sources in a way like never before. You will learn what it means to think and write like a historian. And the material, despite being so dark, is so relevant to today. These were men whose regimes changed the world. You need to learn about them.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The subject matter can be pretty bleak, but it is an incredibly important topic, and Prof. Snyder approaches the themes in a way that feels like you are learning it anew.",
                "I'd recommend this course to another student if they were willing to put in a lot of work. There is a heavy amount of writing and reading in the course , and if students are only lightly interested in the topic I think this is not the right course for them.",
                "Yes, but expect a very heavy workload -- 100+ pages of reading plus twelve 1000-word essays. If you feel ready to engage with the heavy material and heavy workload, you will learn a ton from Professor Snyder's brilliant lectures.",
                "Yes! This was a tremendous history lecture: urgent, relevant, challenging, provocative, humanity-stretching. You may not entirely agree with all of Snyder's core arguments, but you will grow significantly as a writer and thinker. I struggle to coherently reflect upon the class because it was so uniquely ambitious in scope. HIST232 was a course about empire and race; about politics and ideology; about truth and fiction; about subjects and objects; about time and space; about memory and testimony; about thinking and living historically; about what it means (what it has meant and what it could mean) to be human. If the syllabus even remotely intrigues you, please shop the class!",
                "Absolutely, one million percent yes. This is the best kind of history class: a deep window into the past combined with a lesson for our present and future. Professor Snyder will always keep this class deeply relevant to current affairs. If you properly work, do the reading, listen to the lectures etc this will be your favourite class this semester.",
                "yes. be prepared to do a lot of work, but the lectures, readings, and sections teach you so much.",
                "Yes, it is extremely wonderful and was crafted for the pandemic very well. It could be one of my favorite classes I have ever taken, and it gave me the momentum to do my other work as well."
