I think that in addition to acquiring knowledge on the general history of psychiatry, this course is also structured to have students engage in the skills needed for historical analysis and research. I think it's an incredibly necessary course for any student hoping to work in the discipline of medicine or psychiatry because it forces us to really reconsider the relationships we have with the patient-client dynamic.",

            "comments": [
                "This course is well structured in terms of the readings/concepts covered. It definitely challenges you to think about your own relation to mental health and the healthcare system as well. The beginning does spend a bit much time on asylums, and I think I was slightly more interested in modern day psychiatric institutionalization and practice. Profe is very receptive to student feedback regarding course framework though and does take into consideration student input.",
                "The class was all strengths! The professor was an amazing lecturer--her explanations were very clear, she started lecture with a summary of the previous class, she bounced ideas off of students and the class was a very collaborative space of brainstorming ideas. I also enjoyed the assignments for the class including the student presentations and asylum essay. The professor was also so open to feedback and gave really great feedback in our assignments.",
                "The course covers many topics and does so very well. The history laid out is very easy to follow.",
                "Professor Carrillo is such a thoughtful instructor, and carefully curates the assignments and readings so we learn in a very clear way. I do wish we spent some time on cultural-specific treatments of mental health and not just colonial treatments, I know there is less literature on this but I am much more interested in it, and expected more of that based on the title of the course",
                "I think that the course is incredibly interesting but the only real weakness is that it's an incredibly heavy reading load, which makes it really difficult to keep up and engage fruitfully. I think that there are a lot of ways that you can make a heavy reading load result in a productive conversation, which I think Professor really worked to try to experiment with! I think that that is the biggest thing about this course that made it really worth staying in is that Professor really wants to know how to improve the course and really wants to hear from students. She's incredibly passionate about the subject and wants to talk about it with students, so she tries a lot of different techniques to try to facilitate student engagement. I appreciated that we had several assignments spaced out throughout the semester and her suggestions for the assignments were incredibly helpful to get us started on them ahead of time. She invests a lot of class time into catching students up when she sees we might be struggling and is such an engaging professor that this course is certainly worth the time for. I think some ways that the heavy reading load could be made successful without reducing the reading load would be by assigning sections to groups in the class or highlighting particular sections she might want us to close read for discussion. I think she really tried to facilitate this by posting key terms before each discussion for us to consider during our read through. However, it was a little bit difficult to tell what the structure of the week was going to look like; I got a sense that this course had originally been formatted to be a once-a-week course because it was hard to tell when we were expected to have the readings finished by (ex. first or second day of the week that we would be coming into class).",
                "Strengths: Professor Lopez-Carillo is beyond amazing - easily the best Professor I have ever had during my time at Yale. The material of the course can be challenging to understand but she makes such clear connections with the readings and is able to lay out the arguments, making it easy to understand if you didn't have time to read or just skimmed. The workload is not too much and is manageable so long as you plan ahead of time with other courses. The readings also offer a wide spectrum of viewpoints. Weaknesses: There is honestly no real weakness that I can say about the course. The one thing I will say is that the reading workload can sometimes be a lot, however, Professor Lopez-Carillo started to release key term guides after we had voiced this and that is one thing that I think can help alleviate some of the stress and would be helpful in future teachings of this course.",
                "super great class with fantastic discussion. The professor was great about creating charts, timelines, and diagrams to visually aid discussion. Only weakness is that the readings were a lot each week--it was often difficult to read everything.",
                "The strengths are definitely Professor Lopez Carrillo. She is very passionate about the course and it comes through with how she engages with students, leads discussions, and holds her office hours. The class was also very structured and organized, including discussions.",
                "The material was interesting but got a bit repetitive by the second half of the course.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is the seminar format that allowed for student to open about their own experiences and ideas that have shaped their perspective of the modern mental healthcare institution. I also loved how the course facilitated in-depth discussions about the philosophy behind mental healthcare.\r\n\r\nOne of the weaknesses of the course is the extensive readings that were, at times, a bit too difficult to conceptualize.",
                "Strengths: the professor!!!!\r\n\r\nWeakness: a smaller class size may better facilitate discussion"

                "Yes, 100%! I think that Professor is really open to changing the course according to student needs and I can certainly see that some of the challenges we faced this semester (like incredibly heavy reading loads) would be adjusted in the future iterations of the course. I think that if you're going into any sort of healthcare field, whether that is specifically mental health or not, this is one of those courses that you should take at some point because the content is incredibly necessary if you're going to be a practitioner. Professor: fantastic. Content: fantastic. Structure: experimental, on its way to being fantastic!",
                "Yes, if you have the time for it. This class is absolutely incredible only if you are able to dedicate the time to it that it deserves.",
                "Yes!!! Professor Lopez-Carillo is such a great professor and this course is so different from many of the ER&M courses that are offered. Learning about the history of mental health & diagnoses is especially interesting too.",
                "Yes. Super great for psych/pre-med students looking to become more aware of the historically racialized/biased medical practices. Leminar style so skimming the readings can be sufficient to contribute to class discussion",
                "Absolutely! As a person that has mental illness, I appreciate so much to have learned about how our current mental health system is constructed. It contextualizes a lot of the odd and uncomfortable things that I have noticed while being treated. I also enjoyed the readings a lot, Professor Lopez Carrillo is amazing, and our discussions were always put into a context where they had relevance. Thus, facilitating the process of how are making connections about how these histories inform us today.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student with genuine interest in the material, but I would warn them that it is certainly not a gut, so they should only take it if they can commit to fully engaging with the material.",
                "Of course, I love Professor Lopez Carrillo and she has so much knowledge to share about this topic! She also does a wonderful job of connecting the ideas learned in this class with the broader themes discussed in Ethnicity, Race, and Migration.",
