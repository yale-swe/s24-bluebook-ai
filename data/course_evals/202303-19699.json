                "Nakamura Sensei gave a lot of valuable and interesting insight into Japanese culture and mannerisms, which was really fun to learn about. We covered Lessons 13-17 in Tobira II over the semester (though L17 was not fully completed), and grammar wise, we studied structures that helped me convey more complex thought (eg \"I intend to...\", connecting sentences fluidly, and passive/causative forms specifically). The in-class exercises do help a lot with becoming familiar with the material in each lesson and practicing speaking with it too."

                "I want to start by saying that while many people will say that this class is not fair grading wise or too difficult to get an A in, I completely disagree---Nakamura will tell you what will exactly be on the test, including which passages we read from class or what topics we will have to write about (comprising about 50% of your lesson test score). Once you get used to practicing these topics in advance, the tests are not too hard to do well on if you review the grammar structures the night before and actively engage with them. Kanji test wise it is mainly muscle memory and the worksheets she gives are almost exactly what you will see on the test. \r\n\r\nThe biggest flaws with this class however is that it is very disorganized in terms of grading, there is a lack of feedback from the professor, and there is no transparent schedule for the semester. It bothered me that I wouldn't know my homework or test grades for most of the semester, leaving you in the dark to know if you are even doing well. When it comes to oral tests or speech drafts, the professor also doesn't give feedback---even though she said she would. She will give feedback on the daily writing we do in class, but these are very basic in the support required for learning a difficult language like Japanese. In the future, I hope she improves on these things, as well as providing students with a tentative schedule of lesson test dates as well as a schedule of what we study week-by-week. There were many times that Nakamura would throw a lesson test at us out of nowhere during midterm weeks, which really put a lot of stress on me and other students.\r\n\r\nNakamura Sensei is an amazingly nice and sweet person, but she just needs to play around with the structure of her class a little more to find the right groove :)"
