                "Both professors are great lecturers-- Prof. Ogbunu's lecturing style was definitely the highlight of this class. The class had a very strong overall structure where every class/week was a discrete topic and we stayed on track, so I feel we learned a lot/covered a lot of topics even though the class was not a very large time commitment. Another strength was the grading system for the first half of class: psets were optional, but helpful to learn the material and counted as bonus points for the first exam, so if you felt confident on a topic you could skip a pset with no consequences, but if you wanted practice you could earn a few extra points. The exams were challenging, but fair. \r\nThe only weakness of the class was that I felt discussion section was often unnecessary, especially for the second half of the class (and it got cancelled all the time on short notice). I think either this class should have more consistent homework so we could have something to talk about in section, or have section be completely optional and more of an open office hour with the TFs.",
                "It was a little difficult to switch instructors halfway through the course; both instructors are good teachers and taught their material well, but their styles and expectations were completely different, which was just a bit tough to adjust to.",
                "One of the weaknesses was that it was a 2hr long class once a week, I think it might have benefitted from being a 50 min class twice a week. \r\nOne of the strengths was that the instructors were very knowledgeable and took time to explain concepts well. \r\n\r\nThe biggest strength was the ability to revise homework problems, given that we explained why we got something wrong and showed greater understanding."

                "Definitely! It's a great fifth class-- it's not a big time commitment (meets once a week and minimal work outside of class), but it's super interesting and comprehensive. Going to Prof. Ogbunu's lectures felt like a treat rather than a class meeting. Don't be scared away by the math in the first week or two-- most of it is conceptual, so if you understand what is happening in the biology it's really not too bad.",
