I understand there is more focus on Chinese companies in China in the second half of the course, but since most students only take one semester, it would have been nice to learn more about \"chinese\" companies in china and abroad.",
                "Very clear/organized/well-taught",
                "Strengths: learn about a lot of very interesting and relevant topics! and Chen Laoshi is very kind and cares about individual growth. You don't have to memorize how to write everything - there is only a short content quiz and dictation that she posts ahead of time for each unit. \r\nWeaknesses: Hard to work within a classroom with a huge range of Chinese levels. We had non-native speakers to native speakers where Mandarin is their first language. Ended up that for most supplemental articles that covered more difficult vocab and topics, native/more fluent speakers would participate more.",
                "Strength: Genuinely interesting context (from learning about KFC and Starbucks to IKEA and P&G), as well as Chen Laoshi herselfwho always tries to make class engaging and fun for all of us. No weaknesses I can think of at the moment."

                "I would recommend because of the topics/vocab you learn and to have a class with Chen Laoshi. But would just warn that there will probably be native speakers who speak extremely fast and fluently.",
