I also learned about the current critical discourse about the museum, its problematic history, and what current movements are being led by Indigenous scholars and activists to dismantle the current institution of the museum.",

                "very manageable reading/workload, but we almost never got any feedback on assignments. everything has been pretty great until the final project, which involves a group collaborative project, and the prof provided absolutely no guidance whatsoever about what the project was supposed to be. we were supposed to develop it as a group, apparently. i wish she could have just acted like a professor and given us an assignment with meaningful parameters so we would actually know what we were supposed to do, instead of tossing meaningless ideas back and forth and never landing anywhere.",
                "Strengths-- Professor Ramalingam is an amazing professor, and I loved taking this course with her. She is very reflexive to student need, and has an in-depth knowledge of current issues in museums. Assigned interesting and varying readings which meant that we were able to engage very interdisciplinary approaches to issues of display, knowledge production, and object repatriation. \r\nWeaknesses- the reading load was slightly higher than was helpful, and often meant we could not discuss all of them in class.",
                "The course had really great readings and Prof. Ramalingham facilitated class discussion perfectly, knowing when to step back and when to push for more. Prof. Ramalingham was also very available to talk further and help push me to think harder on course topics. The only thing Id call a weakness is that it would be better to shorten the amount of readings because throughout the weeks we were consistently not fully talking about at least one of the weeks reading.",
                "I liked the style of the course in which each class meeting per week was split up with a discussion of readings on the first class meeting and then a more interactive session such as museum site visits on the second class meeting. I think it would be cool in the future to include museums outside of Yale for students to visit. Additionally, while the final project had a collaborative aspect, I wish that rather than individual student projects being compiled together that students actually work together to make one big project ie curating a new exhibit together rather than a collection of reimagined exhibits to make it feel more collaborative. I would have appreciated being able to know what my grades were on assignments throughout the course, so I knew how I was doing in the course.",
                "Strengths - trips to museums were amazing!!!!!!!!! and in class we had structured group work that was very helpful in my overall learning\r\nWeaknesses - could really use a list of guiding questions for readings because often they are quite long and we don't really address all that's in them, the final project was a real struggle because it was difficult to have 8 people writing together (some of my stuff was literally just deleted) and some ideas were just disregarded when choosing the final project structure"
