                "I think my biggest issue with this course is that it is the intro general ecology which seems like it should focus on a general review of topics in ecology which it does somewhat, but it spends a lot of time on the math underlying many quantitative approaches which is interesting to me, but felt like it didn't belong much in this course especially because the models are kinda halfway discussed and definitely aren't necessary to understand the concepts or major outcomes they describe which seems like it should be more of the focus of a general ecology course. I would gladly take a separate quantitative ecology course, but A) the place for that is not this class, and B) most people taking this class are decidedly not interested in this aspect, and C) this is the part of the course that causes the most stress for students when it's the least relevant to the main topics of the course.",
                "Strengths: Professors are very good, lots of support for students\r\nWeaknesses: Live lecture format was unnecessary, lab assignments are very long for no reason",
                "More assistance with Excel - such as a basic crash course in how to use Excel - at the beginning of the semester would have been helpful for many of the students in the course, I think.",
                "A strength is that there is a focus on ecological studies, and we were exposed to many different studies as well as taught about how to design them. Also, most of our projects revolved around us coming up with ideas on what to study and how. I think this was very valuable for me as I am considering going into research. A weakness of the class is that many topics were covered very quickly. For the first half of class where there was a large amount of math and equations, taking more time to go through that probably would have really helped me.",
                "This course was very difficult for absolutely no reason in my opinion. The concepts were very interesting and not complicated but the assignments and exams were so poorly designed that it made the class very difficult and took up a great deal of time. The course could be improved by giving clear instructions on assignments, assigning way less busy work, and eliminating the exams which were unnecessarily confusing.",
                "The lectures were very quickly paced.",
                "This course was very well taught, and both Professor Post and Professor Vasseur were wonderful. I think the way exams were structured could be improved, but this was difficult due to the online format of the class.",
                "The content of the course was interesting, but I often felt underprepared despite the amount of engagement I put in and regardless of the amount of time I spent reviewing the material. I struggled a bit with the application of the concepts we covered in the lecture to the exam questions.  I think there could be more support for the exam preparation with review sessions and more practice exams.",
                "The strengths of the course is that material and the textbook. The content was very engaging. It was also nice to have two professors with different specialities in ecology, since the field itself is so varied. Weaknesses stemmed from a lack of communication on assignments, particularly exams. Often times the homework, readings, and material in lecture did not match up, or perhaps there was no space provided in the course to synthesize these ideas. Discussion sections often seemed very stagnant, and left me more confused on topics that were asked for more clarification. Because of this, there was an overall lack of support from the teaching staff in helping us understand more conceptual topics.",
                "I understood everything from the course in depth (I have always wanted to be a biologist, so this course really \"rhymed\" with my interests).  However, my biggest weakness was that, although I knew exactly what I wanted to say, I often did not use the terminology (e.g. on one assessment, I gave an in depth description of what happened if another species was introduced to a system when all I had to say was \"competitive exclusion\").  I have been getting better at that though :-).",
                "The strength of this course was the breadth and depth of the material we coveredthe class offered a broad but also rigorous and specific overview of many important topics in ecology, and lectures were engaging. The weakness was that often the pace was too fast, as lectures sometimes went so quickly that we didn't have time to take notes and lecture slides were recited with no elaboration and barely enough time to process the information. Additionally, there was a disconnect between lecture material, discussion sections, and problem sets, making the course at times confusing and disjunct.",
                "I think one major weakness of the course was, broadly speaking, that the majority of it consisted of lectures. There was rather minimal student engagement and often so much content was covered in each lecture that there was little to no time to ask questions. I also think that the professors could have incorporated student feedback more. In terms of the assignments and assessments, I do believe that the problem sets should have been explained in more detail - often times the assignments were rather unclear and covered material that was not well discussed in lectures or in discussion sections. Although both exams weren't particularly well executed, the first exam in particular was in a rather difficult format with a very short time limit relative to the questions. This was brought up by students but it seems as though it was not discussed or at least not taken into account. I understand that the virtual format was challenging for instructors across the board, but this class in particular did a fairly poor job of making the class accessible particularly in the context of a virtual semester amid a pandemic. Greater flexibility within assessments and communication of expectations for assignments - rubrics, detailed point breakdowns, etc.- as well as more leeway for the challenging circumstances of the semester (a better curve, for one) would have improved the class significantly. I also think that the discussion sections were not at all engaging and did very little to help students - answers to questions were very vague, assignments were only briefly introduced with minimal explanation, and there was almost no \"discussion\" meaningfully facilitated about the content of the class. It was pretty clear to me that there was very, very little in terms of thought-out structure put into the discussion sections, and they generally added nothing to the class as a whole."

                "The aspect of learning during the COVID-19 pandemic assignment I appreciated most was the ability to rewatch lectures with closed captions. Once I learned of that option, that was helpful in understanding the material. The online lab seemed very straightforward and clear, especially with the Cornell lab system. I also thought the Symbio assignments were a good alternative to do, especially with a study group. The adaptations made from the first exam to the second exam was good, however the communication of what was being changed varied from professor to TA, and also changed as we got closer to the exam, which is not ideal. \r\n\r\nThe discussion sections seemed to be the most affected and least helpful in the course. The TA was not helpful in clarifying topics gone over in lecture, and the demonstrations done in section were not very active for the students, causing myself to become disengaged.",
                "I liked the system the teachers and TA had for this class: the lectures were done at a reasonable pace, the readings were straight-forward, and the discussion section was always helpful.  One thing though was that, around the exam periods, there was always additional pressure because the deadlines for assignments coincided with some of my other assignments and assessments for other classes (the teachers were very nice to push the deadlines back a bit in those instances).  However, I know that the teachers did the best they could, and they did indeed give a lot of support throughout this course.",
                "The breakout rooms were a good attempt at engaging students during synchronous classes, but the format of presenting summaries of papers was not very engaging - I think it would have been more effective\/engaging to have given everyone the papers to read, with guiding annotations \/ a high-level summary and then to use the breakout rooms to actually discuss key concepts or questions. Presenting a slide or several to the rest of the class, while mildly helpful in synthesizing the content of the papers, doesn't actually facilitate conversations between students in the breakout rooms - everyone will merely write bullet points on a slide or two and no real engagement with the content beyond typing on a shared slides presentation takes place. Especially since this class was a pretty small lecture, full-class discussions could have been a better way to allow students to ask questions and bring up important ideas\/concepts in a way that actively engages with the class rather than doing tiny (and often redundant \/ repeated) book reports."

However, definitely form a support group with your section, as often deadlines and content were unclear (multiple times, our class petitioned for a deadline extension)!",
                "To be completely honest, no! If you are not required to take this class, it would probably be in your best interests to look elsewhere for an interesting E&EB course or science\/QR credit. Theoretical ecology took up a major portion of the class, which, while worthwhile in E&EB as a discipline, was presented in such a way that it was very difficult to engage with & connect to useful\/interesting applications. I also think that this class suffered from the virtual format and attempts to reconcile it were overall unsuccessful. Lectures were not very engaging and the pacing was poor - often covering an unnecessarily broad range of topics in a short time, leaving no time for questions or for digging deep into an ecosystem\/process\/etc. Also, to be brutally honest, lectures were pretty boring - and I love ecology! Quite a feat to make such an interesting field of study lose its interest."
