            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Interesting content.\r\nWeaknesses: could get very boring. I often found the readings much more engaging than the lectures. The lecture slides also seemed about a million years old, and the color schemes were wacky. This course needs some updating.",
                "It is not a difficult course but the readings are incredibly dense and usually unhelpful. The lectures are disorganized and there is no consistent talk of law or politics throughout the course. The exams were fair and the final paper was a good way to assess learning.",
                "I liked how the class was more of a broad overview introducing many topics to us so that we could continue to research them on our own if we were interested.",
                "Strengths: relevant topic, good balance in the workload\r\nWeaknesses: too much reading, made it feel somewhat disorganized",
                "Strengths:\r\nA strength of this course is the sampling of issues covered and Professor Wargo's accessible knowledge. Also key to the course's success is his ability to quantify some of the lesser known issues involved in a given environmental issue, as well as some of the regulatory responses (or lack thereof). And Green Intelligence\r\nWeakness:\r\nThe readings (other than Wargo's book) were sometimes not congruous with the lectures. At other times they were very difficult to read.",
                "The biggest strength of this course, I'd say, is that the topics considered are genuinely interesting, and learning about them feels very relevant. In fact, after leaving lectures most days, I would marvel at the fact that I had known so little about some of these topics, even though they're ostensibly so relevant to modern life. Some of the readings were another of this course's strengths; I particularly enjoyed those taken from Professor Wargo's book, though by contrast other of the readings were, I'd say, it's weaknessthe readings filled with legalese, for instance, I often struggled to read and sometimes gave up on. The other weakness to this course, I'd say, was that sometimes the lectures (and indeed the general course outline too) didn't follow a very clear progression, but rather felt more like Professor Wargo's stream of consciousness at times.",
                "I thought the course was ran alright. I think that the readings were way too long to reasonably complete each week, but besides that it was a well structured course.",
                "strengths: environmentally focussed, relevant to current issues\r\nweaknesses: very boring, very intuitive, no nuance",
                "The content was really good, just needs some better organization",
                "Strength: Great introduction to a wide range of environmental topics, section helped me learn a lot as well, workload was reasonable.\r\nWeakness: Lectures could have been more engaging.",
                "strength: I liked how the lectures were organized and each topic segweyed into the next. I also enjoyed the readings that complimented lecture as they were personally really interesting and also super helpful to learn from. I thought the content was really interesting, but I would have liked to learn more about modern-day advocacy coalitions that focus on environmental clean up.\r\nweakness: I think the final exam could have been narrowed down a bit more (I think many of us were under the assumption it would be a similar model to the midterm, so a little more of a heads up would have been nice). I also think the lecture itself was a little too vanilla, and maybe could have benefitted from TA presentations or videos of Professor Wargo himself being an environmental advocate.",
                "Good course content. Lectures were dry",
                "The material is very interesting and everyone should learn about these pollution issues, especially those in the United States who are exposed to pollution in ways that they would not expect. The lectures were straight-forward, but I didn't think it was a problem because the information was interesting and clearly presented.",
                "i think new lecture slides that are more succinct could be useful- often felt overwhemed with the amount of info",
                "i thought it was really good to cover many different topics to fully understand what can impacts the environment",
                "I think the lecture slides were very unorganized. It was very difficult to know what would come next and they had so much material that it was easy to get lost or figure out what was important to remember. After the midterm, it became more clear what Professor Wargo was hoping we would learn\/identify: things like burden of proof, effects, relative laws, etc. However, before that (and even after) it felt like we were given a lot of random information with a lot of jumping around in lecture.",
                "Strengths: the material is interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course is not well organized. Despite covering interested material, there tends to be a lack or any sort of structure that makes following the classes and then preparing for the midterm and final painfully difficult. Better organization and structure would do wonders for this course.",
                "Strengths: wide array of material with a lot of good sources to draw from\r\nWeaknesses: information was poorly presented, lectures did not promote engagement at all",
                "The content of this course is so interesting, but it is just presented in such a dull way. I would zone out during lecture despite discussing everything that I care about.",
                "Wide variety of topics, was able to understand a lot of info in just one class.",
                "strengths: interesting topic material\r\nweaknesses: lectures were not very engaging and section could have been better poised to think critically about the material",
                "Strengths: Well organized, interesting topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were a bit dry",
                "i think it could be a bit more paper\/writing heavy and less exam heavy. the material just translated better that way. and the exams are basically just big essays",
                "Great section Instuctors",
                "This course has great content but is poorly presented. The prevalence of of environmental politics is minimal to nonexistent. The lecture could be boring and monotone and seemed to be read off of a script.",
                "The course really needs to be updated. The most recent material is from at least 10 years ago. The lectures are also quite dry.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of topics covered and introduction to so many environmental regulations, as well as the term paper, were great.",
                "This class is still stuck in the past. All of the slides and research explained in class is from 10 years ago. I wish it would have been more current. Also, the readings were not up to date. Towards the end of the semester, you are just bombarded with work. I wish they would have spread it out more throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: content. Incredibly interesting topics, very relevant, and instructor was clearly passionate about it. In some cases it could be slightly biased towards the instructors opinion. Another strength was hands-off approach: students had all the responsibility to keep up with readings, go to lectures, and you could choose to do as you pleased, at your own pace. \r\nWeaknesses: lectures were not very engaging. Clearer slides and a clearer place to find them is needed. Also highlighting the key parts of readings or takeaway concepts would be very helpful because there is so much and it can be hard to synthesize. Also, more connection between the readings and the lectures: sometimes they did not rely on each other at all, and you didn't have to really do the readings.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, lectures were well organized\r\nWeaknesses: not engaging, lectures always started late and ran over time",
                "This course could be improved through a stronger focus on the impacts of the issues discussed upon the non-human environment, to balance out its heavy focus on impacts upon human health.",
                "Helpful having section with TF to discuss readings and ask questions about the material. A weakness is not having the lectures recorded.",
                "I think there's a lot of information. I think that maybe more time for discussions around the material could be useful. This class would make an excellent seminar. It's a good lecture at the moment.",
                "Strengths: section was really lowkey and interesting. Very low workload, but having the final midterm so close the the final paper deadline felt unnecessary. I liked that we had to submit updates on our term paper throughout the semester, so we got continuous feedback. Weaknesses: the lectures were sometimes hard to follow especially in terms of how they were organized. There was also not much discussion about actual environmental law.",
                "not very organized",
                "The subject material of this course is extremely pressing and intellectually interesting and I did feel that I came away with a better sense of the environmental law landscape. I also liked the way in which the course was broken into case studies, as well as the use of videos in-class. With that being said, I think the course could be improved in a few key ways:\r\n-As nearly all students came in with no law background, the class would benefit from a few days spent covering the legal theory behind environmental regulations. The overview of legal strategies and the political landscape in the last class was extremely helpful and would have been great in the first week\r\n-Many of the slides were extremely data heavy. These portions lost student attention (and a lot of the data seemed very outdated- from the early 2000s or even the 90s)\r\n-The course description should be updated to reflect the heavy focus on environmental health. (Nearly all topics were covered from a human health perspective, with limited consideration for climate, wilderness, and biodiversity impacts)\r\n-The class felt incomplete without a full topic on climate\/emissions policy",
                "Loved the topics because I felt they were very relevant, but wished we got to go deeper into each one.",
                "The course is well designed and structured overall, and the subject material is important. However, the lecture slides aren't structured very well to facilitate review, and they are often just a long list of overarching points. I think a little more clearly outlined structure in both lectures and slides would help.",
                "lecture slides could be easier to reference after class for review and studying purposes",
                "The lecture in this course was not very engaging and difficult to pay attention to. Since the content is largely historical and many of the topics are touched on in other EVST courses, I found it difficult to pick up on the new perspectives offered by this course since the lecture was so dry.",
                "It used to be Global Food Challenges but while it has different title, the emphasis on food remains. It seems like the content should be updated to match the name \"Environmental Law\" as we spent an entire day on parmesan cheese. While generally interesting topics, I wish we spent more time on other topics rather than just food topics as the class is no longer called Global Food Challenges.",

                "I recommend this course if you need a low commitment course with only three graded assignments (midterm, final, term paper). The content is really interesting, I just never went to lecture because I found it much more beneficial to read through the readings and lecture slides on my own.",

                "I actually would, because though it certainly wasn't a perfect course, I think that the topics covered are really essentially to get you to thinking critically about the way we live in this day and age. I doubt I wouldn't have taken this course if it wasn't required for my major (EVST), particularly because I have absolutely no interest in law or politics, but looking back, I'd urge other students to take it whether they're really interested in either the environment or legal studies.",
                "I would if they think they might be interested in EVST. It's a great way to test the waters and see if you're interested in taking more classes. If it turns out it isn't your thing (as it wasn't for me) its not all that difficult to sit back and enjoy.",
                "No! I am extremely interested in the environmental\/policy intersection and thought this class would be just that, but instead it just focusses on whether certain environmental aspects are good or bad for the environment. There is very little talk of politics or law",

                "Yes. The topics covered are super interesting and the readings give such high quality, detailed, fascinating information. The class itself is quite easy and you don't have to put a lot of effort in to do well.",
                "If you have a general interest in environmental studies, this class would be good to take. I would not recommend this class to someone looking for an in-depth course.",
                "Yes I would, it is good to know about the laws pertaining the environment and having knowledge of all the dangers to the environment.",
                "Yes. It is a great way to learn about several relevant environmental topics: nuclear development, agriculture, plastics etc.",
                "Yes",
                "It depends what youre looking for. Its low workload, but thats because theres only a midterm, final, and final paper which puts a lot of weight on those assignments. The course is much more focused on topics in environmental law than the law itself. Its a good introduction to some major environmental issues and topics. Prof. Wargo is incredibly kind and knowledgeable.",
                "Yes, I thought the professor was very insightful and passionate about the topics he chose to teach",
                "Generally no. The material is interesting and important, but the lectures aren't very engaging and can be difficult to follow\/review.",
                "yes",
                "Only for EVST major credit.",
