                "As a huge fan of hip hop for many years, I came into this class thinking I already knew a great deal about the genre - I was wrong. This class taught me about the origins of hip hop as well as those individuals who were a major part of this musical beginning. Furthermore, the course also discussed the intersection of cultural phenomenal and this genre, an aspect which I found fascinating. It was incredibly fulfilling to learn about the genre's development to see how it progressed into hip hop as existing today.",
                "I learned so much about the origins of hip hop and loved this course so much because I grew up in Brooklyn surrounded by the hip hop culture.",
                "I learned about hip hop history, music, graffiti, break dancing, and sampling. As I was not very knowledgeable about hip hop when I started the class, I also learned about various artists, music videos, and songs.",

                "I absolutely loved this course and learned all about the history of hip hop which I had no knowledge on prior to this course. I also learned how hip hop expands to beyond the music, where an entire culture surrounds it: art, clothing, etc.",
                "I learned new details about the historical and cultural background/evolution of hip hop music and culture, as well as gaining new insights into how hip hop has touched other aspects of contemporary culture and my peers at Yale."

                "The main strength is Nick -- he is the kindest professor and best listener I've ever encountered, and made this semester so so wonderful. I genuinely looked forward to this class every week because of him!",
                "A major strength of this course was Professor Conway's teaching. Prof. Conway is an absolute fountain of hip hop knowledge and exemplifies a clear love of the genre.",
                "I loved everything about this course and the way it was taught. I love how calm but also educational the structure and lessons were. We learned so much and most of us came out as good friends because of the very interpersonal structure of the course.",
                "This class is so easy and fun! I have never taken a class with so little work and so much good energy. We spent a lot of time watching and discussing hip hop music videos, and also a fair amount of time getting to know each other. The two assignments in the class were a \"review\" essay, which was very open-ended, and a \"creative project,\" which was even more open-ended. Both were very low-stakes and very fun! \r\n\r\nI would say the only downside was that I wished we had learned more in the class. I really enjoyed watching the three documentaries we talked about at the beginning of the semester, and I think a documentary a week would have been a good amount. I also think it would have been good to talk more about the problematic sides of hip hop culture as well. I personally felt kind of uncomfortable during some of the music videos that we watched in class because of the sexism and objectification of women, and I would have liked to discuss the complexities of this topic.",
                "The strengths of this course was that it gave so much room for students to explore facets of hip hop that they were passionate about. Instead of the assignments being prescribed to us, they were open ended, enabling me to go down rabbit holes of research and topics that I love - enabling me to produce my best work.",
                "The course provides a great overview of hip-hop music and culture, and was exceptionally fun and flexible to be in. The instructor's wealth of stories and knowledge on hip-hop and ability to tie in student's experiences made for an engaging class time. Although the course certainly achieved its goal of elevating consciousness of hip-hop history and culture, while keeping the workload extremely low, it would have been great to incorporate more readings and optional readings and structured in class discussions in small groups. I think more group projects, given the medium-size seminar, could have been effective and fun too!"

                "Absolutely. This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime, cant-believe-im-here type of things that you hear about and don't believe are real. Absolutely changed my outline on life and learning.",
                "YES! If you can take this class, move around everything in your schedule to take it. Our section was on Fridays from 3:30-5:20 -- probably among the worst time slots on campus, but I looked forward to it every week and was SO excited to have class. Nick is one of the best people -- not just professors -- that I've ever come across. He remembers the most ridiculously minute things about us and supports all of our activities on campus. He is wonderful and the most important reason to take this class! It's also just a great way to meet other people who love hip-hop or music in general and get acquainted with your creative side. I wish I could take this class again and again.",
                "Yes, without a single doubt. Even if you don't listen to much hip hop, you will still find this class incredibly interesting. The story of the origin of hip hop and its subsequent development is inspiring and if you get the chance to learn more about it, you should seize the opportunity.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is something that anyone can like, whether or not you are an avid hip hop listener. The course is very fluid and will appeal to anyone.",
                "Yes!!! Take this class, it is so fun and relaxing! Nick is really good at creating a nice and open environment in class, so don't worry if you don't know anything about hip hop.",
                "A must take course at Yale.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is excited when discussing music and exploring different facets of music.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about hip-hop. Casual, comprehensive, and fun, it was a rare experience in Yale's saturated ecosystem of highly demanding and academic courses. I do hope the course will eventually become more structured, but at the same time, I hope it \"can't stop, won't stop\" its free approach to hip hop culture.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. Beyond learning hip-hop in terms of music and culture, the professor was able to tie in famous historical events that shaped the genre and that the genre shaped, which gave the material a kind of concreteness and relatability."
