Without DS I don't think I would be able to fully appreciate the beauty and deep philosophy in Don Quixote, Paradise Lost, Faust, Omeros and so on. It really teaches you how to read. I also got lots of chance to do creative writing which greatly helps me to understand how form and style shape a story.",
                "How to read and discuss",
                "I have developed much of my close reading, comprehension and analytical skills. I have learnt to read a text closely and pose questions to aid in my understanding of the text and to interpret the author on their work and style. I have learnt to engage with the texts studied in a classroom environment, practicing listening and participating in argumentative discussion in a non-dominating and respectful manner. The assigned essays have allowed me to work on my literature writing skills and challenge myself, exploring new and different styles. I have especially challenged myself in regards to my essay style and working on constructing an effective and thorough thesis.",

                "Strength: really really amazing syllabus!!!!! every book enlightens me in some way and the discussion was so so inspiring. only suggestion? kick out Hadji Murat and replaces it with Notes from the Underground. Professor Mitchell is extremely kind and funny and understanding and inspiring! I learned a lot from him and will strongly recommend singing up for his office hour.\r\nWeakness: not really a weakness but would be great if we have more time to read and discuss",
                "More feedback and better directed discussions",
                "Strengths:\r\n- covers a broad range of literary works from the western canon \r\n- gives a substantial platform for reading and studying literature further\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- sometimes the speed at which the course is covered sacrifices depth for breadth \r\n- despite the broad syllabus, certain writers felt skipped or quickly brushed over",
                "Integrated with the other two DS tracks, lectures accompanied by two discussion sections, breadth.",
                "The syllabus for this course is excellent, and discussions were consistently thought-provoking. One of the things that I think should be incorporated more into DS is writing instruction, and it seems reasonable to have some time (perhaps as part of the literature curriculum) to learn a bit more about how to write a DS (or college, in general) paper.",
                "Strengths: the spring literature syllabus is phenomenal. Reading 20th century novels is such a refreshing change from the first semester classics. But those classics are also essential to understanding the novels. Spring literature is a major reward for completing first semester! For the most part, seminar discussions were great. A couple of the lectures were mind-blowing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings can feel overwhelming. Reading all of Don Quixote, for example, is no small feat. Sometimes discussions felt unstructured, and some weeks it was clear that most students had not finished the assigned reading, which meant class discussions were limited to the first half or so of the texts. Literature lectures in particular were hit-or-miss; some lectures lacked structure and continuity."

I thoroughly enjoyed DS, but I would only recommend it to a student wishing to take all three disciplines. Taking Directed Studies and combining them in this way is very particular and does demand a slightly different degree of motivation and interest.",
                "If you have a chance to take Prof. Mitchell, take him (with some qualifications.) An absolute gem of a prof - the type who really cares, both about the subject material and, more importantly, about the students under his care. Yes, you might be confused at first when you suggest \"is it X or Y\" and he invariably responds \"why not both?\" but eventually come to develop an appreciation for the phenomenal pedagogy that underlies every careful, measured response that he tenders. Prof. Mitchell is incredibly versatile and knowledgeable about topics diverse as 16th century art history, music theory, the ante-Nicene fathers, etc. and treats class like a jazz improvisation - it's not for everyone: he allows the students to steer the conversation, and provides framing and deliciously-open questions to chow down on, to the point that a few of our classmates would complain \"I want to hear what HE thinks!\" (I sympathize with this sentiment and say - go to office hours! DRST discussion sections imho are for the discussion, and this is the best of the best of that!!) A last point to consider is whether or not you absolutely need your essays with written comments back on time (or at all.) EM is a transplant from a more chivalrous and simple age into the modern world. His ante-Luddite soul leads him to recoil from the internet, email, etc. and channel his writing exclusively through the medium of pen and paper. Thus while incredibly responsive in person - go to office hours to discuss the essays at length/suggestions for further improvement on them! - emails with marked papers are not as forthcoming.",
                "Yes, but its extremely fast paced.",
                "I would! It was a wonderful course that renewed my interest in literature.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. At the very least the books you read over the course of the semester are enriching, but the intensity of the discussion (and the paper writing) is ultimately very fulfilling as well. There is also something to be said about the community that DS fosters through directed study of the same texts.",
                "Yes!!! Second semester lit has some of the best texts of all the DS classes. Woolf, Proust, and Flaubert are phenomenal. There is a lot of reading, and unlike other DS courses (eg. second semester philosophy), you will need to do the majority of the reading to get enough out of the course. Know that you will need to dedicate a good amount of time to getting through some of the longer texts (Don Quixote, Swann's Way, etc). But the time is 100% worth it. In my opinion, second semester literature is one of the greatest rewards of DS. This course singlehandedly made me realize that the program is not a means to some end, but really an end in itself. It is a privilege and a joy to read these texts. If you did first semester DS, do yourself a huge favor and continue with the program. You won't regret it!"
