There were readings about students of color, LGBTQ+ students, students with disabilities, low-income and first-generation students, and more. I developed a better understanding of the challenges I have faced and other students face that often go unnoticed. I also learned how to begin to combat some of these barriers."

                "This course was heavily focused on a discussion of diversity. While this is a super important topic I felt like the class was an echo chamber at times, because everyone already had the same general opinions.",
                "I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the class and the professors. Also the project was fun and interesting.",
                "Strengths: light workload, interesting conversations, lots of time to dedicate to the final project. Weaknesses: would have liked to see more diversity amongst the instructor team, or invite guest speakers from different backgrounds.",
                "I thought the strength of the course was it's multi-professor format. I appreciated our candid discussions but wish the class focused even more on discussion. I also thought that sometimes it was difficult to express a different opinion for fear of reprisal.",
                "The readings are amazing, but at times it felt like they were a bit too long. Especially when the semester ramped up, despite wanting to engage with the readings, it was difficult, as there was a lot to read.",
                "I think a strength is the opportunity given to students to explore topics they care about such as the Other Voices project where students pick topics and get to create a 30 minute lesson plan. This genuinely gave an opportunity to learn about topics we never really discuss such as the difficulties of undocumented students in education/STEM, traditional ecological knowledge from indigenous people, imposter syndrome in grad school etc. Another strength is the head professors who really cared. I also enjoyed learning how to write an Op-Ed. The weaknesses is the overlap between a lot of assignments. We had weekly comments/reading, reflections, along with essay deadlines, other voices deadlines, and the group project deadlines that would fall on the same day. In the future, it would be nice to decrease the weekly comments/readings. I would also recommend eliminating the reflections altogether. It just feels like busy work and doesn't actually improve knowledge or thinking. It's purpose was stated to be to have people think in advance for class discussion but it really doesn't help as all you do is regurgitate what you read 5 minutes ago and forget after.",
                "This class lead to excellent discussions and addressed a broad range of issues in a holistic, sensitive, and open-minded way. The only problem I found with this class were the reflections after each and every assignment, even if we just completed a huge project and gave a presentation, we would have to repeat everything we said in a reflection. These reflections might be useful for the professors, but I thought they were sometimes unnecessary busywork.",
                "Discussion is at the core of this course, and as a result the time allotted for discussion was a strength. We got to discuss the papers at our own rate with students and professors alike. After the introducing questions the class just focused on discussing the interesting aspects of the papers which I enjoyed. A weakness could be needing more support for the project that we take on in the second half of the semester. It was a lot more work than we were led to believe at first, but the projects did differ in time commitment and that wasn't so clear."

However, one thing I disliked is the lack of divide between class and non-class hours where we would get surprise emails about discussion section etc. outside of class hours which would be another thing for us to think about/do. It isn't that what we were asked to do is super hard, it's about the fact it would usually have to do with group work which then meant we had to meet or discuss as a group to get consensus which isn't easy with our weird schedules during COVID. In the future, I would just recommend delaying it to the next time you actually see the class.",

                "The platform we used for readings was new to the course and it is called Perusall. Students would annotate and comment on the readings and those notes were accessible to the entire class which I thought was a neat feature that came from having to be a virtual course.

If you already have a background in this subject, some of the information may be a bit redundant -- but the discussions are still great, and you really get to know your classmates!",
                "Yes! I think this should be a required class for STEM majors. It's so important to make an effort to understand others' experiences, especially in regards to big systemic issues.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially to STEM students although it shouldn't be limited to that demographic. This course covered content that explains why STEM looks and operates the way it does right now which is fundamentally inaccessible. This knowledge is important to learn if you plan to be in STEM. The course was also not a huge time commitment although the workload does pick up a bit toward the end of the semester. Please take it!"
