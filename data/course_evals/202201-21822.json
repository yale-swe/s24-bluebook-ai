                "This course really taught me to think like an economist. We learned about a wide range of economic models including game theoretic models in addition to traditional utility or profit maximization. We also learned a lot about problems in development economics and how social networks play an important role in development.",
                "This course taught me a lot about the most recent work being done in the field of developmental economics. It also presented the fundamental models that exist in this field. It covered a variety of topics from networks to social norms and presented formal frameworks to think about the world and about the different stages an economy might be at.",
                "I learned how to read economic papers and understand the basic principles of economic development (social networks, mutual insurance, biological adaptation, etc.).",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Prof. Munshi is extremely knowledgeable and presents the lectures in a very interesting and clear way. Takes very complex things and makes them understandable. \r\nWeaknesses: expectations were unclear for assignments, midterm was very difficult but grades were adjusted based on class performance. Exam information was only given ~2 days before the exam.",
                "Weakness: Professor Munshi expected people to have a great understanding of reading regression tables. I knew how to do this, but not everyone did which made the class harder for others and slowed us down\r\n\r\nStrengths: I loved that the class was focused around current and real economics research. It made it feel like all of the grinding I have done in the econ core classes and theory I learned was actually being used and helped me understand the concepts. I also think that developmental economics is just so cool and interesting.",
                "Very detailed and holistic design of course\r\nBut maybe some theoretical background would be also helpful",
                "Strength: Prof. Munshi is such an amazing person. He is always enthusiastic, smart, and rigorous when doing research. The papers we have read in class give insights about how to do our own research in the future.\r\nWeakness: I hope there will be more lectures taught by Prof. Munshi, since the level of engagement from student presentations are less compared to Profs lectures.",
                "Strengths: broad range of interesting papers, Munshi very passionate and Pedro amazing helpful TF. Cool to see underpinnings of research/models and how they can explain observed phenomena \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes quite confusing, papers could be hard to follow. Also I think a lot of us didnt know what to expect for the first exam",
                "Professor Munshi's lectures were amazing. I especially loved how he challenged the class to think things through in real time. This helped me understand economic reasoning much better. I did think that the student presentations were a bit of a weakness. Although many of them were great, few were as good as Professor Munshi! Doing the presentation helped me learn a lot, but with a larger class than expected, I felt like there were too many presentations.",
                "This course was great because it covered a lot of topics and established a good basis for thinking about developmental economics. Some weaknesses of the course might be the psets and the work required from the students. I feel like the psets could be made more clear and more example problems should be worked out during class or office hours. This would help students be better prepared to not only understand the material but begin to form their own ideas about developmental models.",
                "Strengths: interesting material and content. Weaknesses: the course is not always engaging, and there aren't a lot of materials for students to study the content outside of lectures.",
                "Strengths: the paper-based format meant all the material was very applicable.\r\nWeaknesses: the exam format didn't closely mirror the psets.",
                "Strengths: \r\n* The models and papers introduced in the lectures are very interesting\r\n* The professor's passion for economic research \r\nWeaknesses: \r\n* Often the papers would be too complicated to understand through lectures\r\n* Exam content is hard to predict so it is hard to study for it",
                "The course had three major shortcomings:\r\n1) The introduction to building economic models was not nearly as robust as was expected during assessments. There ought to have been a concerted effort to ensure that everyone has a robust understanding of how to build an economic model from scratch and there should have been dedicated opportunities to practice (through problem sheets and in office hour sessions). Its such a fundamental skill that yale econ core classes fail at teaching us and this is a wonderful opportunity to bridge that gap but it cant be an afterthought if its going to be tested at a high level. \r\n\r\n2) The assignments and tests were very asymmetrical. The first problem set and the midterm were longer and much more demanding than the rest of the assignments and the final. There was more anxiety than necessary surrounding grading and testing and I think that better communication and structuring can avert this \r\n\r\n3) COVID - this was obviously beyond the instructors but half the class was down bad half the time. The instructors did their best to be accommodating so that was appreciated."

Not that much work, which is a good thing but also a bad thing because if you do not stay on top of what we are learning and what you need to understand you will fall behind and become lost.\r\n\r\nProfessor Munshi is such an amazing professor and the topic is so interesting. You feel like a real economist.",

                "If you are curious about how to conduct empirical economic research, take the course!",

                "Yes! Definitely! This is my favorite economic class at Yale. Besides reading papers, the mindset of how to do research is rarely shared by other professors when they teach. But Prof Munshi showed us how he proceeded from one section to another, and why certain parts were needed in those papers.",
                "Yes. Great easy econ class.",

This course really teaches you to think like an economist and apply economic thinking and models to complex problems in order to understand what is really going on. I also learned a lot about how to write and read economics tables. Even just learning how to read regression tabels is super helpful.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who wants an introduction into the world of developmental economics. This course touches the surface of many different topics without having too high of a workload. Overall, it was a good course but there is much more to be learned about this field.",
                "Yes. Very interesting course that teaches you how to think like an economist. Not a lot of work. But the exams are difficult.",
                "Yes, I thought it was interesting and the workload was kind of low.",
                "Yes, Munshi is awesome and the class teaches some really fascinating papers on economic development in India.",
                "Yes 100%",
                "If they are looking for exposure to economic research that uses both models and empirical analysis, they should take this course.",
                "Yes, the topics of instruction are super interesting and Kaivan is brilliant. Id prepare to do a lot of work on your own catching up if you arent already an expert in building economic models."
