                "Everything was good. The only suggestion I'd have would be to have the last part of the class more planned out, but we were all really tired, so I didn't mind.",
                "Strengths: Though the class was technically a lecture, students were strongly encouraged to participate. Wasnt fully a seminar but Professor Adam asked the class plenty of open questions and was more than happy to allow students to chime in with their own knowledge or to let them steer the discussion a little.\r\nWeaknesses: Not necessarily a weakness for everyone, but you should definitely feel very comfortable with your listening skills (identifying meter, chords/progressions etc) immediately on the spot in order to get the most from the class.",
                "I love the fact that it was not particularly rigid in structure and length itself well to interesting and enjoyable discussions. However this was some thing of a double edged sword because some structure may have been slightly more useful for those with less musical experience.",
                "I almost wish the class met three times per week instead of two, or if there were slightly more small assignments.",
                "I really can't think of any clear weaknesses - it was engaging at all times, the content was interesting, the faculty and TA always were looking for suggestions and input from students, and the final paper/project was fun and incorporated many aspects of the course! I would say maybe make the reading components fit more with the course (just to approach it from an academic perspective so we're ready for the final paper)?",
                "We listened to a lot of different music from the course to illustrate different theoretical points which I thoroughly enjoyed - \"pop\" is so broad that so much music can fall into this category. I would have enjoyed more practice with melodic/harmonic/rhythmic transcription but great class overall.",

It can be a little boring at times if you already know a lot of theory, but applying theory is really fun. I'd recommend having taken/taking ear training if you don't have perfect pitch, it'd make parts of the course easier to engage with.",
