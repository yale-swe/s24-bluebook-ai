                "Introductory Japanese speaking, listening, writing and reading skills",
                "Through this course, I developed writing, conversational, and listening skills for the Japanese Language. In terms of writing skills, the writing assignments we were given helped us practice Japanese. For each class, we would practice our conversational skills with our partners. In terms of listening, we would listen to audio in Japanese that were included in the textbook, as well as during exams.",
                "I learned a lot of Japanese. I guess I also learned more about what it means to take a langage from the beginning, something j havent done since I was in first grade.",
                "This course led me to enter the area of a new language.",
                "This Japanese class has taught me well with teaching me basic expressions, sayings, knowing how to say time and date, etc. The skills I've learned in this class, if honed well, will most definitely help me with Japanese II.",
                "I learned hiragana, katakana, and am in the process of learning more and more Kanji. Listening, writing, reading are all things that have improved tremendously throughout the semester. I also got to pick up a bunch of little fun facts about the culture and norms in Japan. I really interactive piece."

                "For the homework and every test (written & oral), I received clear feedback that greatly improved my learning. This is literally the best course I had at Yale.",
                "Strengths: The high intensity and constant test-taking helps me retain all the characters and words.  We speak a lot in Japanese in class, which improves my oral skills.\r\n\r\nWeakness:  Because we have at least a test a week, the class can be very stressful at times.",
                "Love the focus on in class speaking practice. Awesome way to teach a language in a classroom setting.",
                "The strengths of this course is that students are constantly engaging with the Japanese language, in and out of the classroom. In the classroom, the language is practiced through conversation, while outside it is through homework and through the videos provided on Japanese grammar rules. In terms of weaknesses, I believe explaining more about intonation would be helpful.",
                "A very well-designed and well-structured challenging class. Nothing in particular that I would change.",
                "I think the course actually moves kind of slowly. I felt like we could have covered more ground in the same time  obviously repetition is important, but sometimes I felt like it could have been less, the same conversational exercises over and over again. Other than that, it is a strong course.",
                "Strength: conversation practices in class and homework help us get familiar with the new language.\r\nWeakness: little listening practice.",
                "This course engaged me really well for a class that was every day since something new was taught and there was homework daily.",
                "I honestly see no weakness in the course. This was my favorite course this semester and will probably be my favorite subject this year."

                "Highly recommended. \r\nStever-sensei is a warm and helpful teacher who guides you patiently. She respects her students, and her class is truly inviting and fantastic. If you don't know much about Japanese language before, never worry about the grade, since the attendance and daily assignments comprise a large proportion of the overall grade vis-a-vis the lesson tests, dictations, and oral tests for only 10~20% of the total respectivelyif you don't do well in some tests, it's okay and you'll have many other chances to \"remedy.\" \r\nDespite the daily homework, the workload is not great, taking you perhaps 30~40 mins per day. Before lesson and oral tests, there's no homework.\r\nAlso, if you're a grad student in the Humanities Department (like me), this language course is definitely worth trying as you're able to get access to a language and the culture behind it through this course.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning Japanese.  If the student just wants to fulfill their language credit, I would not recommend Japanese because there is too much work.",
                "Take Japanese if you want to. The classes are good.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because of its emphasis on constantly practicing Japanese. Through the classroom dialogues, homework, videos, and Japanese clinics, one begins to learn Japanese.",
                "Absolutely! I feel that out of the foreign languages I've dabbled in at Yale, this one has the best understanding of the structure and pace necessary to maximize student learning.",
                "I think so. If someone wants to learn Japanese, they should take the class.",
                "Yes. If you want to learn an Asian language, Japanese is a good choice.",
                "If you really want to learn how to speak and understand Japanese, then I suggest taking this class as it is a very good introductory course for it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students if they are interested in learning Japanese. The department does a great job of making sure students are focused on the various aspects of learning a new language: writing, reading, and speaking."
