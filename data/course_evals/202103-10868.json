                "I learned a lot about how the intricacies of chemistry affect the visual presentation, flavor, and texture of food. The variety of different chemical reactions and phenomena presented in this course really deepened the way I look at food while cooking today. Learning about the maillard reaction or tenderization of meats, for example, are vital to understanding what happens at the molecular level while cooking.",

                "There's a lot of assignments in the course so one bad thing does not really matter. The weakness was that the lectures were normally boring and hard to pay attention to. With the inclass quizzes on lectures, it was sometimes hard to understand them if you didn't completely digest the material taught that day.",
                "This course is really really easy but super boring. I didn't really learn anything.",
                "I loved the experiments/demonstrations we had in class. Having more of these would make the class better.",
                "I think the strengths involved the demonstrations and youtube videos that were chosen in class. \r\n\r\nI think the weaknesses involved the in-class quizzes. It is cool that you could work in groups but the minimum group size requirement added nothing and was consistently not fun.",
                "They tried to make sections mandatory and would punish students who didn't go (ex: not releasing answers for practice exams, going over pset answers). Very unorganized and there were many times the TAs seemed like they didn't know what they were talking about or teaching. There were a couple of times that they gave answers to something or told us how to do a problem and it was actually wrong.",
                "In class group assignments were at times difficult to follow. They may have been helpful with only groups of 2-3. The unit about coronavirus was particularly unhelpful. Problem sets were challenging, but helpful in preparation for exams.",
                "A strength is the course format - the in class assignments foster class attendance and collaboration. They made me engage with the course material, which helped me understand all of the material and ask questions about what I didn't completely understand yet. Also, the research project was very interesting and made me interact with a lot of different ideas from many different classmates (which most larger classes don't do!)",
                "This class is on a very interesting topic and overall was taught very well. However, the material was also taught very fast.",
                "I discovered a love for chemistry through this course and expanded my knowledge exponentially. The main weakness was the limited number of demonstrations related specifically to food/cooking. It's much less of a food science gut and more of a standard chemistry lecture-based class that happens to mention food here and there.",
                "The course had a lot of content and moved relatively fast. That being said I learned a lot and the teaching style was great but did not have too much time to reflect on what I just learned.",
                "It was split into modules that helped the learning process. It was hard to hear sometimes.",
                "Strengths: Easy to follow instructions and complete assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are often a bit disorganized and hard to follow since no mic was used in a lecture setting so listening was often difficult.",
                "This course was very disorganized. It was difficult to know what we were going to be assessed on. There were also many little assignments every week that seemed to come out of nowhere at unexpected intervals.",
                "I thought there could have been more demos and in person real life experiments to make the class more interesting",
                "interesting subject, not enough cooking",
                "This course was organized effectively but could have engaged the students more with hands on activities. I wish there were more demos, especially involving food.",
                "The lectures can become boring and the professor was very hard to hear.  It was easy to zone out.  To improve the course I would add more in class experiments or demos.  A strength was the in class exercises, because they forced everyone to attend class."
