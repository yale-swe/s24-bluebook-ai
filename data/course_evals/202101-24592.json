                "I thoroughly enjoyed the course. I thought the reading load was spot on and the readings were informative. I valued discussion in class.",
                "I loved how many themes and topics this course covered! Listening to the different real-world applications and experiences that they had was very engaging too.",
                "Strengths - The material was super interesting and the lectures were amazing. I loved learning about the various features of a great city and what steps people are taking to make cities better. I also appreciated that we had a historical perspective as well, and the extent to which we examined the relationship between the city and the suburbs. \r\nWeaknesses - Sometimes, I felt the professors assumed we had more urban design background than we did, and as a result, students got very quiet during discussion because we werent sure how to approach their questions.",
                "Strengths: the topics are super interesting, and Mat and Manasvi are super chill and just great. The papers are graded super fairly and the workload is manageable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings are pretty dense, long and boring, even though the topics themselves and the class discussion is interesting. If youre good at skimming, youll be fine!",
                "The course was fascinating and the topics were really great. I do think that the course could have been a bit more interactive for people with experiences beyond just the Global North. Even though I consistently did the readings to the best of my ability, I often felt that our discussions left me feeling that I had very little to contribute. I also think the lectures could have been a bit more interactive, involving breakout rooms or activities that would make sure that everyone was involved."

Everyone has something to say on this topic and having classmates who have lived in or experienced a wide range of cities makes it really interesting. Even if you dont come from a big city, take the class if you can! Mat and Manasvi are great and super understanding about student workload, etc."
