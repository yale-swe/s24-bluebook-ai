We also learned the insights on how to NOT make those mistakes in our daily lives and overall make better, more logical decisions.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: very well taught with an engaging and passionate professor and TF.\r\nWeakness: summer courses, not exclusive to this Thinking class, go VERY fast. You must devote the recommended hours of study each week in order to truly succeed.",
                "The material was super interesting, and discussion sections were great for reviewing concepts and preparing for the exams (midterm and final). I also appreciated that the exams were non-cumulative. \r\nAs for weaknesses: this course is fairly memorization-heavy, and I would have appreciated more testing on the application of concepts as opposed to regurgitating findings of a study or theoretical concepts. Also: for whatever reason, the multiple-choice answers on quizzes and finals could only be viewed a single time after submission, and if you wanted to see your short answer responses you had to meet with the professor or TA to do so. I have no idea why supervision is required for reviewing exams and quizzes--it seems pretty unnecessary. \r\nThe grading of discussion sections is also something that I didn't like about the course, though if you are taking this class during the academic year and not during the summer you won't have to worry about sections. Each section was 2% of your grade and a 0-5 point scale was used to grade your performance during section. You get a 1 simply for showing up, but then the rest of the points are based on how prepared you are/the correctness of your answer. I thought this was pretty frustrating considering that discussion sections are meant for actually DISCUSSING the material and it shouldn't matter if you got the question 100% right as long as you prepared a response and are engaged during the section. It also makes section kinda anxiety-inducing because students are called on at random to answer, as well. So not only are you thinking about when you're going to get called on during the section itself, you're also worried about how correct your answer is. I totally understand that the lack of essays assigned during summer session means that we need to be graded in some other way, but if the prof is so concerned about accuracy of answers why not just tack on short response questions to our post-lecture quizzes? \r\nAt one point (during the first section, actually), the prof forgot to stop sharing her screen and we could see her spreadsheet as she was actively grading us, in real time. It was pretty upsetting because you could see everyone's scores for that day. There was this one student who got the lowest score during section and she ended up dropping the class. Not sure if the fact that everyone's section scores were broadcasted had anything to do with her dropping, but still it sucks that this even happened. The prof sent out an email apologizing, but I still think the method of participation scoring should be re-evaluated. \r\nOne last weakness would have to be the organization of content. For whatever reason the prof decided that it would be a good idea to assign 4 lectures due on Monday (our final was on Wednesday). So you had to watch all the lectures, do the quizzes, and prepare correct responses for Monday night's discussion section. Then two days later you were graded on the content from all 4 lectures and whatever else we covered after the midterm. To me, it felt like we were held responsible for way too much content during such a short period of time and I would have appreciated the lectures being spread out a bit more.",
                "Strengths: clear organization in lectures, Professor Ahn and Emily (TA) are both very engaging and readily available to answer any questions. The way the course is taught is really conducive to learning and spontaneous transfer, so as long as you pay attention during lecture and take good notes, you will do well! The quiz and exam questions are fair, just make sure you read the questions and choices carefully since wording can be a bit tricky at times.",
                "The lectures and in-class discussions are informative and engaging. The workload and exams require a great level of rigor considering the easily understandable content which may be frustrating for some. The grading based on in-discussion verbal responses can add stress, especially for someone like me who can understand and write answers but has anxiety when speaking.",
                "Strengths: The discussion questions were helpful in further emphasizing core course concepts. The exams were fair, and the concepts were really interesting. Weaknesses: The discussion sections were largely structured in the professor calling on students, and while the discussions were helpful for reviewing what was covered in the lectures, there was generally less exploration of topics outside the lectures in a more conversational format.",
                "I really enjoyed being able to watch the lectures on my own time and then having the group discussion to go over the discussion questions, I thought that was a very effective way of learning. I also liked having the quizzes after every lecture.",
                "The course is very well organised and the process of giving us discussion questions every week and preparing them for each class helps a lot to learn and fully comprehend the material.",
                "Strength- The topic itself was very fun and engaging to learn\r\nWeakness- Felt like there wasn't much area for students to engage within themselves",
                "I can't think of any course weaknesses! I loved the online lectures, the discussion sections, the quizzes, and the homework that became exam reviews!"

                "Yes! I absolutely would, whether over summer session or during the semester. You will realize all the logical mistakes people (and yourself) make when thinking and/or making decisions, and you may come out with better decision-making skills. It is incredibly interesting.",
                "The content is really interesting and the prof is an engaging lecturer. You won't have to worry about discussion sections during an academic semester, and the content is spread out more, so I would recommend taking it. However, some of the exam questions are designed to trick you and there isn't always clarity on grading (you have to set up an appointment to even view how your short answer responses were graded).",
                "Yes!! Professor Ahn is amazing!! Anyone looking to take a fun psych course/ fulfill their social sciences credit will not be disappointed by the class! The workload was very manageable and the professor and TA are great at explaining concepts clearly. The topics covered in the course are extremely interesting, and it was fascinating to understand why and how we think the way we do.",

                "Definitely, especially for those planning to major in Psychology. It is both fun and informative.",
                "I would! I think this class helped me think more about how I personally think and receive the world, as well as how others think and perceive life. This class has altered the way I think and do self-reflections. Highly recommend taking it!"
