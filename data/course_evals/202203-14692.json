                "I learned to think on the spot, to gather important passages from long readings, to engage in discussion with others, to think deeply and closely with the text.",
                "After taking this class, I've improved significantly in my ability to think critically about literary works. Our in-class discussions were always robust, so I feel much better at articulating my own analysis and engaging with other classmates' insights.",
                "My close reading skills and attention to detail have significantly improved during DRST 001. I learned how to better support my more thematic observations about texts with closer analyses of rhetoric and language.",
                "I learned how to analyze texts at a very deep level. I also learned how to create strong, clear arguments.",
                "An ability to read and evaluate literature from the beginning of the western cannon through the 13th century. An emphasis on close reading a passage and connecting its contents to broader themes to the overall work and other texts.",
                "How to write better essays, develop more complex theses that did not stick to one interpretation, but rather evaluated many different sides",
                "I learned a great deal about classical Western literature and its development from Homer to Dante.",
                "This class helped me to hone my close reading abilities and to delve into the nuances of a text more than I have before. It pushed me to challenge and work at the text rather than stick to surface-level interpretations. The professor did a good job of pointing out specific parts of a text that could use more profound analysis, and was helpful in highlighting particularly important passages of long assignments. Coming out of this course, I feel that I have a much better understanding of how to analyze literature structurally. I feel that my writing ability has improved as a consequence of this as well. Understanding how carefully great authors have mastered their craft has sharpened my focus on my word choice and composition structure. Overall I have become a more thoughtful writer and observant reader.",
                "I better learned to analyze complexity and nuance in a text, express my ideas to my peers, and to integrate my findings from various texts to better understand the greater picture behind the Directed Studies Literature Curriculum. I also learned much about the process of brainstorming, drafting, editing, and finalizing a literary analysis paper throughout my time in this course.",
                "I improved my close reading and seminar skills, as the course gave a foundational overview of Western literary works that inform current literature. We studied a range of texts of various genres, from epics to plays to poetry, and through our discussions, we extracted key themes that resonated across the texts. The three essays helped me improve on the structure of my writing, and I feel that I learned how to sharpen a thesis and organize my paragraphs more clearly."

            "comments": [
                "Strength: quantity\r\nWeakness: depth of discussion is limited",
                "Strengths: The syllabus itself has some incredible works of literature. Professor Ellerman does a fantastic job tying them together thematically and bringing us backward whenever necessary in order to reveal the importance of a particular moment or character to the canon at large. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: By nature, the DS lit syllabus is very fast paced. So sometimes in class we could only get partway through a book, leaving a lot of important content untouched. Sometimes our discussion would then just be in-depth analysis of a few important sections - feel like this is more a problem with DS as a whole rather than this specific class.",
                "I found all of the course material highly engaging, and I especially loved Literature (out of the three Directed Studies courses) because of the vivid texts we read and the engaging conversations in seminars. I think the course could stand to feature some more diversity, in terms of both gender and geography, in its curriculum--I found the Arabic and Hebrew poetry of Al-Andalus particularly beautiful, and the voice that Sappho brought to the class as a woman poet contrasted nicely with the Homeric epics.",
                "Strengths: Although we moved through the texts quickly I felt like we went very in depth into the sections that we focused on. The lectures were interesting and there were often guest lecturers from outside DS. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the readings were very long and it was challenging to complete them in time for class. Although we talked about how to write papers in the beginning of the year, it would have been nice to talk more about writing techniques and skills throughout the semester.",
                "The strength of this course is found in the many different works covered. There is only enough class time to spend on one portion of the text. Also, the course moves so quickly through texts that an uninteresting work will be covered quickly and moved on from.",
                "Student hours could be on any other day that Friday. They occur just after the previous essay (for a different class) is submitted, and rarely I've started the new one.",
                "I wish there was a bit more feedback/instruction on how do perform a close reading. This was a new skill to me and one I honestly felt I wasn't instructed on enough.",
                "Strenghts: pace of reading, enjoyment of works.\r\nWeaknesses: in-depth exploration of works, historical background of works, inclusion of works.\r\nImprovements: Devote more time in the lectures to explaining the historical significance and background of the texts we read. I think people would understand the material more if they had a chronological basis of historical development to work off of; also, teacher's in seminars wouldn't have to spend so much time talking about the historical background, and we could get straight on with analyzing the text. Also, certain texts need to be explored more! What is reading Dante without reading all three books of the \"Divine Comedy?\" And three classes on each of the Homeric epics is not enough. Although I enjoyed \"Gilgamesh,\" it felt like a strange sidetrack for the start of the year. The \"Iliad\" or \"Genesis\" feels like a better place to begin.",
                "Strengths: Classes are easy to prepare for since most discussions follow a similar flow: read aloud a selected passage from the text and then do a collective close reading analysis. It's helpful to know what to expect for every class in order to participate more frequently. Some of the selected works for the class are extremely interesting and impactful; there are moments and excerpts that will stick with me for life. It's also very interesting to see the foundations for modern literature set in the classics. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The syllabus is interesting but narrow in scope -- it covers mainly epics of the ancient Greco-Roman world without branching out into other traditions for a more intercultural approach. Though the point of Directed Studies is to provide an overview of the Western canon, reading such similar texts can get repetitive depending on your interest level in the material. There are also so many reading assignments given that they are practically impossible to complete in their entirety, which means that oftentimes texts are reduced to last-minute summaries or online notes.",
                "The strengths of this course is its comprehensive look on many key texts in literature and their connections between each other and to their contemporary time periods. I really enjoyed how I could understand the subtle and not-so-subtle influences of each text on its successors both within and beyond the realm of DS Literature. However, I feel that we spend too little time on each text in the attempt to rush through the reading list and we could benefit from a freer exploration of the text not directed by having to discuss certain passages determined in advance.",
                "This course was very structured, and the workload was even throughout. Since it's a broad survey course, we couldn't discuss each subject in depth, but it introduced a variety of topics that students might then be interested in pursuing further. I would have liked some more discussion in class through back and forth conversation with classmates."

            "comments": [
                "Yes. I think any student can resonate with at least one major work of literature within DS lit. Professor Ellermann does an excellent job extracting major themes and summative ideas of each text, such that I felt well prepared for papers and the final. Writing this now, I remember many moments in class where Professor Ellermann made excellent observations about components of the text I hadn't thought of. He does a good job facilitating discussion as well - if you want your voice heard, you will have a strong platform to do that. If you do not participate as much, you will always have the opportunity to chime in.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning about the Western Canon. The texts I've read in DS Literature are ones I've always heard about and wanted to analyze in an academic setting, and this course has provided an open and constructive space for me to do so.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to understand some of the most fundamental texts of western literature. The lectures are very interesting and all the books are a pleasure to read.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students only if they are very interested in the literature of the classical era and if they have a solid understanding of world history during this same time period.",
                "If you're in DS it's of course a no-brainer. But don't take this course if you dislike literature.",
                "I would recommend that any freshman interested in a well-rounded view of the Humanities participate in the DS program. The program as a whole provides a space and a community for those to explore the works that are foundational to our society. The beauty of the course comes not at the beginning, but at the end, when students are able to look back from the vantage point of understanding and enlightenment they have received over the course of their two semesters of enrollment. Beyond the knowledge the course provides, it is a great way to make friends in your first year, a time when securing relationships is incredibly important. DS builds in relationships from Day one with its shared classes and lectures, both of which are taught by world-class professors with incredibly deep knowledge of their subjects. Taking DS was definitely the best academic decision I made my freshman year.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they were very personally interested in the material in the syllabus and were willing to engage with the texts on their own as opposed to depending on a class environment to prompt analysis. Since there are so many works being covered in such a short amount of time, sometimes only one or two classes will be dedicated to each text. In some circumstances, it was only half a class before we moved on to the next topic. This means that there's a limited interval for discussion or space to delve into the material within a group setting. To truly pull richly from the texts, it is necessary that you engage with them on your own. So unless a student is very interested in them independently, I would not recommend this course.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course (and Directed Studies as a whole) to other students as long as they are prepared for the heavy course load and are willing to race through many texts representing only a narrow selection of the Western canon in a short amount of time. Literature was a lot of fun to read the books and discuss the content, although at times the paper writing proved to be difficult. However, I think overall it was worth selecting this course and taking Directed Studies.",
                "Yes, I think that this course was constantly engaging, and everyone had the chance to participate, which made the class more interesting. Although the amount of text we covered from each work was limited by time restraints, I always greatly expanded my analysis of the text through seminars or viewed it from new point of view. The literature lectures were my favorite, and I loved hearing the various theories that the professors introduced."
