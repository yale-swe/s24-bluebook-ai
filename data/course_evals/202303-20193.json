                "I learned about the legal history of the US Supreme Court, and its deeply connected racial history. We analyzed contemporary and several older Supreme Court decisions including the Students for Fair Admissions decision from this past Spring. I learned how to do case briefs and effectively analyze the language of The Court. I also strengthened my critical analysis and close reading skills. This class reinforces the notion that you cannot talk about this country's legal history without including a discussion of slavery and its impacts.",
                "Historical thinking skills, contextual analysis, constitutional law analysis, ability to read very long academic papers and apply them to Supreme Court cases. You learn how to think like a Supreme Court justice, you learn how to be creative and to place different thinkers ideas in conversation with one another. You learn how to be an effective listener. The best class I have ever taken in my entire life.",
                "I learned how to complete case briefs and had the opportunity to revise my papers, which always helps!",
                "I really enjoyed this class. I learned so many things in this course. I learned how to write case briefs, how to analyze Supreme Court decisions, how to interpret different sorts of constitutionalism, and how to understand and think about historically grounded legal analysis, and how to write different forms of legal analysis myself. Theres a lot of consistency and reiterated practice to build these skills structured into the course throughout the semester so learning how to do all this was not nearly as intimidating as I had thought as someone who hadnt had exposure to this sort of legal analysis in the classroom. That is a testament to Professor Vinson - she has a really good sense of meeting and supporting students where they are and shes just a really good teacher.",
                "- how to case brief for court cases \r\n- thinking outside of the law to create sites of transformation \r\n- how to read and analyze Supreme Court cases \r\n- creating alternative solutions and critics to landmark decisions \r\n- the power we have to access the law, understand it, and do something to change it"

            "comments": [
                "This course was structured really well. I liked the way we would read a real Supreme Court opinion each week along with a CRT rewrite. The pairing was really helpful. I also really liked our circle discussions every class. It not only made sure I spoke but because it was something I knew about, it helped me engage more deeply with the readings to be prepared. I also liked the way Professor Vinson would frame our discussions at the start of each class, asking which ones were the most insightful and which ones raised the most questions. All of this structure was really helpful to my ability to grasp the material. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "I loved this class. Professor Vinson's teaching was absolutely a strength of the course. Her teaching style was engaging, and her background as both a Yale alumna and someone who worked at the Equal Justice Initiative brought so much to the course. She provided opportunities to engage with and \"participate,\" in the course beyond just speaking up in class, whether through discussion posts, discussions with classmates. The format of the course was another strength; every class began with a short lecture on some of the historical background or relevant themes from the readings from that week. We would then have a circle discussion where each student would share a takeaway from the readings or lecture. Every class included a ten-minute break, and it kept class engagement high throughout each session. The content was so relevant to our current political world, and I couldn't have taken this class at a better time.",
                "Strengths: Very organized. Intellectually stimulating. The readings are always perfect compliments of each other. The cases we read are so important, and we each are provided the skills and context to analyze each of them in depth. The lectures are riveting. Discussion flows naturally. The assignments we are given are intentional and fresh.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish it was listed under the African American Studies department, and it should probably be a required course for the major too. It is actually the perfect class",
                "A huge strength of the course was the syllabus and the content  if you plan to go to law school, these are concepts that are not only super engaging but that are really important to engage with (that often arent typically centered)CRT, Constitutional Abolitionism, etc. Professor Vinson really does make her class feel like a safe space for students. The course was also really well structured. Its apparent that Professor Vinson is super intentional about how she plans the course which really helps students. Assignments are paced so you dont get too overwhelmed and they build upon skills as you learn them, so you get plenty of exposure and practice before writing each assignment. Its definitely a solid amount of writing but Professor Vinson provides a lot of support and wants you to succeed in her class. \r\nThe class is also a good balance of lecture and discussion. The lecture is multimedia at times which is great and where Professor Vinson breaks down the readings and provides a basis of information and background to allow for richer discussion. The discussion is prompted by Professor Vinson and by student questions and is a great way to hear and learn from students while getting to voice thoughts you have. Its a really good balance especially in a course where many students dont have a lot of exposure to legal classes (there arent that many at Yale). So students arent thrown into the deep end, yet you still get to have really interesting and informed discussion.",
                "strengths- the small lecture, round table, and then open discussion format, the engagement of both students and Professor with material and concepts, very open and quick communication with Professor, ample opportunities to recieve feedback on work, is a great setup for one to actually learn and absorb the material and themes of the class \r\n\r\nweaknesses- recieving grades/current placement within the class is slower or comes later than desired"

                "Absolutely! Whether you are interested in the legal field or not, it is a really great class for framing a lot of the Supreme Court decisions that impact all of us. Professor Vinson is an absolutely wonderful teacher both in the way in which she runs this class but also in the care that she runs it with. The community formed in this class was absolutely amazing and you come out of it with so much knowledge.",
                "This class has something for everyone, whether you envision a future for yourself in the law or not. I saw this in the makeup of our class this semester, where we had a wide range of majors, class years, and backgrounds. You have to be prepared to engage with and question your own understanding of the law, the Supreme Court, the role of education in America, and be willing to discuss your vision for an antiracist future. This course was so unlike any others about the law I've taken or explored through course search. It's a fair amount of work, but I always felt like it was interesting and worth it.",
                "Yes. I have recommended it to at least 10 different people. It better not just be taught again in the 2024 Fall, but it better be under the African American Studies department. This class is probably one of the best classes a student can get at the undergraduate level. Its a 10/10.",
                "Absolutely! This course was incredible. If you are interested in the law, especially law school, you have to take this course at some point during your Yale experience!",
                "YES! Especially if you are interested in law or law school at all  this is a must. Even if you are not though (there were students from different academic backgrounds) its such a gem and important to learn about. Legal education is soooo unavailable for almost everyone so this course is so important but also so engaging and interesting. Youd be lucky to take this course.",
                "Yes! If you have any interest in law/the court system, are pre-law, just wanna know whats going on in our government, or just wanna talk about the nation we live in TAKE THIS CLASS! It offers a very accessible and non intimidating introduction and forum to discuss huge decisions and systems that shape the world we live in. I feel so much more confident after this class to read Supreme Court cases and offer a meaningful interpretation. It also guided you to think outside of the system we have help in place for so long, and think about new and refreshed ways to look at law, read the law, and protect peoples humanity and rights."
