    "I learned about various aspects of French culture and daily life, including geography, politics, views on family, immigration, etc.",

   "comments": [
    "This class is brilliant in that it gives a relatively detailed overview of many of the pressing topics in France today and in its history. Madame Pinzka is an incredible professor and engages the class in a way that promotes debate and offers a variety of perspectives on each topic. I honestly can't think of a way that it could be improved",
    "The strengths is that it was a small class with lots of engagement and interesting material to work with (presentations, short-answer questions, long-answer questions, documentaries, movies, etc). The level of teaching was also incredible and I loved the professor. There are no weaknesses I can think of."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is at a level of French above L5 but wouldn't describe themselves as completely fluent or bilingual (if this is the case it might be worth doing a higher numbered course, unless they just want to learn more about France). I thought it was brilliant",
    "I would 100% recommend this course. I think it is fantastic to develop both oral and written skills and you learn so much information in a fun, engaging way. Professor Pinzka was always available to help us and corrected us in a kind, informational (non-judgmental) manner.",
    "I would only recommend this to someone who is very serious about French because of the workload and time commitment.",
    "yes, the course is great for anyone interested in practicing French or learning more about French culture",
    "Yes"
