   "comments": [
    "I was able to learn the insights of Ancient and Medieval Western Philosophy, ranging from Plato to Aquinas, on the nature of a good life, that of the reality that surrounds us, and the philosophical basis for an Abrahamic God. Given the extensive and often richly packed reading required, I very quickly developed my close-reading skills. Class discussions and three weeklong essay assignments further improved my argumentation skills. Overall, I leave the course with a strong grounding in philosophy, a much more developed worldview, and the pleasure of having worked with my professor and peers.",
    "I developed an understanding of the basics of ancient Western philosophy. I learned how to closely read, re-read, and analyze philosophical texts, as well as how to write philosophy papers.",
    "Knowledge: A survey of ancient to medieval Western and Western-inspired philosophy. Skills: Reading closely and copiously, writing philosophically. Insights: A deeper understanding of what I believe and how I would like to live my life.",
    "I developed stronger analytical writing, close reading, and argument reconstructing skills. I also gained a broad understanding of most important Western philosophers from Plato to Anselm. This course made me think, continuously and urgently, about some of my most fundamental beliefs. That was quite a gift.",
    "I developed a basic understanding of classical philosophy and the skills required to evaluate it.",
    "I got a good overview of major philosophers in the Western canon, particularly Plato and Aristotle, and I developed my writing skills, as well as learned how to reconstruct an argument.",
    "I did not have any background in philosophy before beginning this course, so was understandably quite nervous coming in. However,  I ended the course feeling as though I have a solid foundation in ancient philosophy. Of course, there is always more to decipher when it comes to these philosophers, but I truly feel as though I can write papers and hold conversations on each of the texts we have studied. Not only this, but I have also learned useful tools in how to approach these kinds of texts when reading them for the first time.",
    "I gained knowledge of the main ideas of influential western thinkers and also practiced the skill of logical argument reconstruction. It was also great to be challenged to truly understand the logic behind complex ideas rather than just memorizing the conclusion.",
    "I improved the clarity of my philosophical writing",
    "This course helped develop writing and critical thinking skills. Being exposed to several different philosophers helped me disentangle myself from the present and take a better look at how I understand the world. I was able to shape how I process the world more effectively with this understanding. The clarity and directness of my writing also improved as this course progressed.",
    "I learned much about the ancient philosophers and their ways of thinking, as well as how arguments are formed and supported."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\n-Unique breadth and philosophical significance of content for a first year philosophy course. \r\n-Develops writing, close reading, and argumentation skills.\r\n-Balance between seminar discussions and content delivered directly in weekly lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Perhaps excessively fast-paced, making it nearly impossible to devote to each text the attention it deserves.\r\n-People are not held sufficiently accountable for doing the reading throughout the course. \r\n\r\nPotential Improvement:\r\n-Develop some kind of system of reading checks, perhaps administered on a weekly basis.",
    "This course provides an excellent overview of early Western philosophy. Our in-class discussions were a highlight of the course, as they were always engaging and helpful for sharpening my understanding of the texts.  However, because of the breadth of content covered, there is not really enough time to explore each text in depth, and our discussion of certain texts felt rushed. Additionally, the translation of Aristotle that we used was difficult to understand (the version of \"Politics\" that we read in H&P was much easier to work through), and I think that the course could be improved by switching to a more approachable version.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in its ability to pull together the thought of people who lived hundreds of years ago and set them in conversation with each other and our own modern perspectives. A work that hasn't been used for very long on the syllabus is Hayy ibn Yaqzaan, and I reaffirm the value in keeping it on the syllabus.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this course was that we delved into Islamic philosophy, but missed some of the key figures (Ibn Rushd, Ibn Sina, etc), receiving them only tangentially (through Ibn Tufayl's Hayy ibn Yaqzaan). I understand that this was only to provide a taste of Islamic philosophy alongside Christian and Jewish philosophy, but I can't help feel like there's a world that we're missing, especially since Hayy ibn Yaqzaan receives much from prior Islamic philosophical and religious traditions. Additionally, the Aristotle translations from the New Aristotle Reader were very difficult -- Aristotle's arguments can be difficult, but it was definitely a struggle just to get to his argument through the translation (my H&P professor took a look at the Politics translation from it and asked, \"why do we assign this translation?\"). I would highly suggest finding a more current, updated set of translations. It would also be nice to have electronic readings printed out for us -- printing is difficult and expensive.",
    "I appreciated Professor Fine's incisive essay feedback and his availability to discuss it during office hours and beyond. I found Professor Fine's chalkboard diagrams and notes very useful. They helped me understand the structure of opaque and\/or byzantine arguments. If he made more handouts for select challenging arguments (like stuff out of Aristotle's De Anima, Physics, and Metaphysics), that would have helped me learn more readily. I also feel like I have a poor basis from which to evaluate this course: I did as much of the reading as I could, but not all of it. That probably led me to have impaired understanding of the texts.",
    "We covered an exceptionally large body of material in very little time. Given how complicated many of the works we read are, I can't help but feel like I may not have a very deep understanding of any of it. I understand that the nature of DS as a survey course may limit any solution to this critique, but I think eliminating even a text or two might improve absorption. On the other hand, I am very grateful to receive such a comprehensive philosophy education so early into my time at Yale.",
    "The course was really enjoyable and I love the small seminar setting for discussion. My professor made sure that no one dominated the discussion, but that could easily become an issue with a different professor. The reading load was very manageable, especially since my professor gave us specific sections of the larger readings to focus on. However, not all sections focused on the same things or read the same sections.",
    "I can only think of strengths. Professor Fine clearly organized each of the classes and created fruitful and meaningful discussions. Most of our discussions were student-led, though Professor Fine explained difficult concepts on the board when necessary (which was extremely helpful).",
    "The wide span of time this course is its weakness but can be a strength if embraced. Having the knowledge of the most influential thinkers in western thought prepares students for future academic studies and allows them to make connections to current developments in literature and history. The layout of this course is essential to the DS curriculum.",
    "This course covers many of the major philosophers in the Western cannon. I feel that too much time (2\/3 of the semester) was spent reading Plato and Aristotle. I understand how important the contribution of these two thinkers was to western philosophy, and frankly you could spend a decade delving into Aristotle without doing justice to the breadth of his thought. The issue with the amount of time spent on them was not due to students becoming board of them, so much as the rest of the semester feeling rushed. It was difficult to immerse myself in the works of philosophers we read in the last four weeks [even though they very much merited immersion] because we would often read 2-3 thinkers per week. If the time spent on Plato and Aristotle was cut by even as little as one quarter (three weeks per philosopher instead of four), I feel I would have grown a great deal more while reading the other philosophers."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it to any student with a strong sense of discipline, a genuine interest in the humanities, and an open-minded curiosity. However, because the course calls for a significant commitment, especially if one wants to take full advantage of it, I would not recommend it to anyone who does not see these traits in themselves.",
    "Yes, it was a great introduction to philosophy and to the skills needed to analyze and write about it. You need to be prepared for lots of reading and writing, though.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student! It grapples with ideas of happiness, justice, the existence of God, and the best life. All questions that we still wrestle with today.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. DS Philosophy is an excellent introduction to Western philosophy and I felt like my horizons have been significantly expanded for taking it. I would highly recommend it to someone who has taken proof-based math because philosophy runs very similarly in proof styles. I would highly recommend it to someone who has not taken proof-based math because philosophy is a way to access logical reasoning with more \"real world,\" applicable stakes.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The questions we wrestled with and the texts we explored were fascinating, and Professor Fine led a well-balanced section. As a broad, first-look sort of survey into early Western philosophy, this class does an amazing job. Depth and rigor comes largely through conversations with the professor, essaying, and close reading, all of which are incredibly fulfilling.",
    "Of course! Professor Fine is fantastic and I love DS.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was a great introduction to philosophy and a wonderful way to improve my writing and argument skills.",
    "Definitely! It was an amazing semester and I am sad to be leaving the class. I loved each philosophy seminar and feel as though I have learned so much.",
    "Yes, I believe Directed Studies Philosophy trains students to grasp many challenging but monumental philosophical concepts. It is really valuable in order to see the roots of many modern ideas and gives you the ability to understand academic references to the most influential thinkers in history.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to a student interested in philosophy. If you are taking this course because you have to as part of DS, and not because you are actually excited to study philosophy, then you will probably think the material is pointless and esoteric. If you value the material for its own sake, you will probably find the course startlingly engaging.",
    "Yes"
