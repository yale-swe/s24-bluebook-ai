I think that after four years of taking English seminars this was truly the first class where we had actual conversations about the topics. Most of my other seminars consist of people making tangential points that don't really build or respond to previous comments. Maybe the small class size helped but Professor Hammer deserves credit for this.",

                "If you have experience in writing and are deeply interested in Bishop and Lowell, I would recommend this course.  That said, there is a LOT of reading required every week--both of poetry and correspondence---and the papers are not clearly laid out, so if you're new to English classes at Yale, it might be a bit overwhelming.  That said, this is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, so I would absolutely recommend this class for that reason alone, just don't expect an easy time!",
                "YES! I absolutely loved this course. Every class was both intellectually challenging, but also so interesting and thought-provoking. I learned so much about Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop, but even more about life and art!",
                "What a joy this class is!!! Professor Hammer is amazing -- funny, thoughtful, open-minded -- and so passionate about the subject, which makes all the difference. You wouldn't think it'd be possible to spend a whole semester studying just the relationship between two poets, but I would've been interested to keep going all year -- it is such a fascinating, rich topic, complex and broad and deep, with layers of poetry and autobiography and letters bridging the gap between the two. This is such an unusual course for how specific but open-ended it is and it's truly so worthwhile no matter your level of familiarity with any of the subject matter. Don't miss it!",
                "Yes, the readings are great, Professor Hammer is great and the assignments are interesting.",
                "This course was exceptional. Langdon Hammer is extremely knowledgeable about both Bishop and Lowell and was genuinely interested in hearing the ideas and perspectives of students. The seminar was a supportive space of investigation into the poetry and Professor Hammer facilitated these discussions with information about the lives of Bishop and Lowell. This course also brought the private letters by these two poets into a conversation about their poetry. The personal lives of Bishop, Lowell, and Elizabeth Hardwick intersected with the poetry and we dealt with questions about how to examine poetry in the context of these relationships and lives. It was one of the most interesting and stimulating English courses I've taken!",
                "Yes, if you enjoy poetry. Professor Hammer is very passionate about both poets and its a very fun course."
