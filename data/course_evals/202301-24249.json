Applied insights to every task that you do and every difficulty and how it can act as a puzzles and what you can do to reverse engineer it or design it yourself.",
                "I was able to do a greater deep dive into Hofstadter's Gdel, Escher, Bach, an Eternal Golden Braid that will be so helpful for the Cogntive Science degree I want to pursue. I was also able to understand more about the creation and evaluation of philosophical questions and puzzles that are key to mastering tests like the LSAT.",

                "Perfect course.",
                "This course helps students to break down key puzzles and expand their brains when it comes to looking at more and less modern puzzles.",
                "We got to challenge ourselves by solving some tricky puzzles of all kinds with very little actual work!",
                "No logic and philosophy, just random puzzles",
                "The strengths of this course were that most of the learning had its basis in the discussion and analysis of puzzles. We would start every class with a new type or several new types of puzzles, talk about their rules, attempt one puzzle together, discuss it, try another puzzle of the same type on our own, then discuss the solution. The most incredible aspect of this class was the breadth of knowledge made available to us about puzzles. Before taking PHIL 045, I had prior exposure to about 15% of the puzzles we learned about in class. There were not many visible weaknesses of the course, but one that stood out to me was that there was not as much opportunity for exploring these puzzles on our own as I had hoped for. Whether it was trying to create our own versions of puzzles we had learned about in class or developing puzzles of our own inspiration, I wish there had been more opportunities for solving puzzles outside of class.",
                "This course was super super fun and entertaining. The coursework was low and any student could honestly get by with just staying engaged during class time. No weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: incredibly engagingthis is an absolutely unique course that really digs into a specific (and very interesting) subject: puzzles. Class atmosphere was also great and everyone felt bonded. The escape rooms we got to do were definitely also a plus!\r\nWeakness: none that I could really think of, but if youre looking for a more traditional class this might not be for you"

The course was taught with enthusiasm and open dialogue, so we all felt comfortable asking questions and making contributions. If one is interested in logical and philosophical puzzles, this class will meet and exceed all expectations.",
