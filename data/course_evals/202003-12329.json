                "interesting lectures, though not particularly related to the assignments. 6 assignments that take ~20 hours each, though can be done with a partner. The assignments are occasionally a bit tedious to complete (namely, hw5, implementing a shell), but usually fairly rewarding.  Reasonably difficult exam, but take home due to  COIVD",
                "It is a lot of work but you learn a lot in this class",
                "Just like in systems programming, the programming assignments and the office hours are crucial to success. Our TAs were all very bright and supportive. Another strength of the class is encouraging students to form teams of 2 to do the programming assignments together. This is the first programming class I've taken at Yale that has had this, but I think it's a great model since it forces students to collaborate and explain their thought processes, which really sharpens programming skills, especially those applicable to industry.",
                "Strength was the engagement of Prof. Shao and the quality of his teaching and his TAs. No weaknesses",
                "Strengths: Professor Shao could explain OS concepts in incredible depth, but was also able to use analogies and explain their relevance to real-life situations. The labs were incredibly challenging but ensured that we all had to how each part of the OS functioned to complete them.\r\nWeaknesses: Office hour zoom rooms should have been created by the TAs instead of the students, and the queue was often glitchy.",
                "It was awesome. Took a lot away from the course and gave me a better understanding of how computers actually work.",
                "I enjoyed the problem sets, although the lectures were often not needed to do the assignments and I found it difficult to refresh topics in lecture regularly until the midterm, which covered everything we had learned.",
                "The lecture was great and the projects were very topical. I think working with the toy OS and implementing features we discussed in class was a great way to reinforce learning. One issue I had was the temporal disconnect between the project timeline and the lecture timeline. Sometimes it felt like too much time had passed between learning the content and applying it, and while spaced repetition can be helpful, I think it's best to get both of those pieces up front.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shao is a pretty great lecturer. The problem sets are pretty cool.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The pair programming setup probably causes someone to get carried in mosts pairs, which isn't great for learning.",
                "The problem sets were crucial to grasping the material for ourselves. They were very well organized and managed. I only wish that there could be larger projects with more collaboration.",

He also stays after class in case you didnt want to ask during recorded lecture! Absolutely amazing and very kind and considerate. He is also very funny and his metaphors are quite creative.",

From what I could tell, Prof. Shao didn't really change the way that he taught the class in terms of lectures, which still worked well because, well, he's a great professor. I think encouraging people to participate through questions and perhaps having more of a cameras on time might help with engagement. And despite physical distance, keeping the pair programming aspect of the homework was definitely a large part that kept me engaged throughout the semester."

I took 323 with Prof. Bhattacharjee, while my project partner took it with Prof. Eisenstat, and for me about 50-60% of the content was review, while for my partner nearly everything was new. If you took 323 with Prof. Bhattacharjee, taking this course might still be valuable to reinforce concepts from 323 and dig deeper into them, but expect it to be on the easier side for you.",

                "Absolutely.",

                "Yes. While some topics overlap with 323, the extension into OS specifics makes this class almost must-take for anyone looking to understand computer science or how computers work in general. Class is well taught and professor Shao is a great lecturer!",
                "Yes, if you're a CS major. Even though this stuff is pretty low-level, it seems like stuff that is important for all programmers to understand, at least to some degree.",

I would recommend this class to everyone to have a better understanding of how a computer actually works (scheduling, preemption, interrupts, exceptions, etc) to create the appearance of a dedicated machine for programs.",
                "For sure. Operating Systems are a fundamental and fascinating part of Computer Science. You write a working operating system over the duration of the semester which is really satisfying, and even if you don't work on an operating system again the skills learned will make you a much better programmer overall. Professor Shao is great, and he makes sure to emphasize how topics discussed in class apply to life outside of computers (which is kind of fun).",
                "If you were looking for a class to take after 323 (although maybe not RIGHT after) that integrates the class content and homework a little more, AND you're looking to do a fair amount of programming (lower-level, with another person), I would recommend this class. Zhong Shao's lectures are very well organized, the course is structured well to give students the support they need even amidst their struggling, and the content is pretty interesting. Even if you don't plan on going super low-level, any computer that we use is bound to have an OS and it's nice to know a little of what's going on under the hood.",
                "Yes.  I think this course provides a great deal more detail in systems programming than 323, and does so with practical assignments."
