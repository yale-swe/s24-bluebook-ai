I cannot convey enough how taking a course with Professor Steinacker (Adriane, as her students call her)! She cared, not just about student learning (which was extremely well-facilitated by weekly PSETs that were collaborative in nature and met with encouraging help provided both through Adriane and the teaching staff (TAs and Peer Tutors) but also about the well-being and extracurricular activities of her students in the course. I frequently hear her ask other students in Office Hours (which she had nearly everyday of the week for several hours) when their extra-curricular concerts/activities were and if she could go and support.",

As someone who had already taken AP Physics 1 in high school, I was expecting to have an easy time in this class, but this proved to be wrong.  This course was very challenging and involved a lot of work, but I came out of the semester with a heightened awareness of physical concepts and a much deeper understanding for the material.",

                "Strengths: The professor loved her work and you can tell from how excited she gets. Super cute. Weaknesses: I think she has a thing for challengingand at times, seeing us struggle as studentsbecause she genuinely seems to derive happiness from seeing us struggle with the exams and problem sets in office hours. I don't think I've spent this much time ever in my time as a Yale student in office hours as I have for this class.",
                "Strenghts- Steinacker, study halls/oh, grading structure\r\nWeaknesses- Lectures in SPL at this time are hot and stuffy which makes the difficult lectures turn into perfect background noise.",
                "Strengths: The excitement she shows and the interesting problems she procures. She is a very lively teacher\r\nWeaknesses: The over-emphasis in our homework on specific ways she wanted us to solve the problems, or very long math execution that just seem like busy work.",
                "The lectures might benefit from more visual examples, or visual recaps.",
                "Adriane is a very likable human being. However, I feel that the class is too hard for the purposes of the students. Most of them are bio majors or premeds that need the class as a requirement; most will not go on to more advanced physics courses.",
                "Strengths - lectures\r\nWeakness - difference between difficulty of material covered in lectures and material covered in homework",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker was amazing. She held so many office hours and genuinely cares that her students are learning something, which is so different from most STEM professors. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the exams were quite difficult, and many students felt that their grasp of the material was not rewarded during the exams. Also, some PSETS felt too lengthy.",
                "It was too hard for someone who does not come from a physics background.",
                "Professor Steinacker is really knowledgeable about physics, but the course was a lot of work. While I learned a lot, the course required a significant time commitment to succeed.",
                "The course had too high of a workload. It needed more teaching assistants and a bigger room to hold office hours.",
                "The lectures cover difficult material very quickly, and the problem sets are much more difficult than the lectures. So, it feels very easy to fall behind, and going to office hours is pretty much required to complete problem sets. \r\n\r\nHowever, working on the problem sets is a great way to understand the concepts so the exams did not feel too difficult, and the support from TA's and peer tutors is great.",
                "Strengths: excellent lectures, great demonstrations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: psets unecessarily long & difficult; exam questions do not reflect material/techniques covered in lecture & require considerable self-teaching",
                "The biggest strength of the course is the support system it has in place. I dont think theres any other course at Yale that offers this many office hours/study halls per week. This means that there is always, and I literally mean always somebody there to answer your questions, which you definitely will have, about physics and the weeks problem set. The professors lecture notes are also just great if you happen to miss a class and need to catch up. I think the biggest downside of the course is the workload. I understand that physics is a subject that requires practice to master, however, at times working on the problem set for 10 hours every single week just makes you ask if this might not be pushing the boundaries of reason a little bit. This course was definitely one of the biggest contributors to the steep decline of my mental health this semester. It is pretty demoralizing to be faced with a problem set week after week that you never know how to solve. Dont get me wrong, you will be decently good at physics by the end of the semester if you put in the work, but just beware that this comes at a cost.",
                "The lectures were phenomenal; the concepts were really well explained and there were always a ton of examples that we walked through together. It was also really helpful to have access to the lecture notes and lecture videos through Canvas. The office hours and study halls were incredibly useful in tackling problem sets; I would go to almost all of them every week.",
                "The major issue with this class is that it is designed for students that come from a fairly strong physics background, and those that do not will have a very, very difficult time trying to understand the way this course is taught. I think this is something that needs to be kept in mind for the professor as they design the PSETS and other material in the class.",
                "Lecturers and course notes were great. Professor Steinacker is good at explaining topics and the course notes were indispensible for reviewing topics. However, I felt the course was made to be a lot more stressful than necssary. Professor Steinacker would frequently go into derivations and topics that we did not necessarily need to know, without making that clear. The psets were also incredibly difficult but there was not a great culture created around that intially which made people very stressed out about them. Generally, people in the class were stressed about it which made it a somewhat unpleasant experience, and thati s partially because of the high workload and very difficult psets.",
                "Strengths: The class covers a lot of material, and the problem sets are very detailed, with solutions provided to compare answers and prepare for the exam. The class also has many office hours with TAs and ULAs for problem set help.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures weren't recorded, which made it difficult to make up missed classes, and Adriane's handwriting on the board was sometimes too small to see clearly from the back of the classroom.",
                "This course definitely moves fast, but one thing that took up a lot of time was constant derivations of new ideas; otherwise, very interesting.",
                "One strength of this course is that everything was explained very well, but one weakness is that I wish there were some more practice problems.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Steinacker! The psets were hard, but they prepared me well for the exams and really tested my knowledge. The office hours and study halls were also lifesavers; I wouldn't have been able to complete the psets without them. The TAs and peer tutors were also super great and helped me a lot with understanding different concepts on the homeworks. Steinacker's class notes were also EXTREMELY helpful. As someone who has never taken physics before, I often struggled to follow the lectures, so the notes on Canvas, which are super detailed, helped a lot. Another strength is the test corrections- they take some pressure off of each exam and kinda force you to look back at what you did wrong and how you can improve. Class overall is very well organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The classes moved really really fast. I often got completely lost and had to go through each lecture very carefully and slowly to learn the material. The psets are also extremely long and tedious at times. They take an average of 8 hours to complete, but only if you go to office hours almost every day for help. There is a certain level of math background that is necessary, but doing a bit of calculus review outside of class helped me with that. You really have to put the time and effort in. Make sure you have time free to go to office hours multiple times a week. The exams were hard, but the psets prepare you for most of what you will see on tests.",
                "Strengths: half-back grading system, support from office hours\r\nWeaknesses: disparity between difficulty of lecture and difficulty of problem sets which could be ameliorated by making lecture more difficult or making the problem sets less difficult",
                "It is very well taught and I felt that I could always get support if needed.",
                "The course overall has a lot of strengths and I found it interesting and engaging, but for me the weaknesses would be how much time the homework took each week.",
                "The biggest problem with this class is that there's too many students and too few peer tutors/peer facilitators to truly give everyone to the time that they need to fully grasp every concept. If more people with a firm grasp on the lecture content were available that would really improve students' understanding of things.",
                "I thought that the lectures could be made more engaging by focusing more on the conceptual side of physics. I felt that mathematically being able to solve some problems was what was covered most in the class, but I thought that lecture could have been better used to go over more of the conceptual aspects of physics and then going over more basic concepts. Perhaps there could be section in which the more mathematically rigorous parts of physics is gone over, but I think the conceptual aspect of physics could have been gone over more in depth.",
                "Strength: well-structured. midterms of reasonable difficulty, especially given the generous grading curve.\r\nWeakness: nothing major, perhaps the class could be recorded though?",
                "The lectures were captivating and I learned a great deal. The lecture notes were very helpful as well. \r\n\r\nSometimes in the Pset problems there was information that we needed and it wasn't clear how to get it. Laying out clear expectations on what we are expected to use the internet for would be very helpful. For instance, in one early problem we needed to round a term to 1 even though we hadn't gone over when it is appropriate to round this sort of term. On another Pset, we needed to look up a moment of inertia, although it wasn't clear that we wouldn't be able to calculate it and earlier problems had given moments of inertia even though we were capable of calculating them. This meant it was often impossible to solve the problems without going to office hours, which was difficult as I couldn't always guarantee that I would be free during office hours. Two ways to potentially address this problem would be to have an Ed Discussion so you can make clarifications to problems that everyone can see, and/or to ask a TA/someone with a similar background to us to work through the problems in advance so you can see if extra information needs to be gathered. \r\n\r\nI lastly found that the TAs often did not have a good sense of the material and didn't know how to solve the problems beyond looking at the answer sheet. This led to them telling me to do things but not being able to explain why, or sometimes being unable to explain how a problem worked. \r\n\r\nI also think curving tests is more fair than weighting your higher test higher, because if you curve a test you give credit to someone who gets a score which normally isn't great but is good given the difficulty of the test. When you just weight the higher test higher it hurts kids who improved throughout the semester but took tests that were of unequal difficulty.",
                "Strength of class is that it introduces you to physics in a fairly interesting way. But it can be hard for students, such as myself, who have never taken physics when you cannot take a lot of the physics and equations for granted (i.e. they are not familiar). But it does a good job none the less pushing your understanding and thinking.",
                "This course is very very difficult, and I think that having a little more of a gentle transition into some of the complicated concepts would be beneficial for students with no physics background, but other than that, the material was presented well and the problem sets were appropriate for what the examinations entailed.",
                "strengths: the professor is amazing, lectures are very engaging and fun to attend, professor is great at lecturing, you don't to use a textbook\r\nweaknesses: if you can't do complex algebra and calculus don't take this class, once you understand the physics it just becomes a math class, psets were brutal if you did not get started on them early and it was more the math that would create the problems rather than the physics",
                "The strength of this course comes from the rigor of the material and Professor Steinacker.  This course prepared me for the physics I would see later on in Engineering, something I very much appreciate.  However, I would suggest more leniency on improper submissions or incomplete work.  In particular, the harsh \"no exceptions\" grading policy for midterm corrections was largely unnecessary.",
                "Strengths: lecture notes are uploaded, exams are generally fair, lots of office hours and peer tutor hours, Professor Steinacker really cares about students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the pace of lectures can be tough to keep up with; seems to assume some existing knowledge of physics and upper-level math; psets are lengthy and time-consuming; a significant chunk of the course focuses on how certain concepts/equations are derived, which could be scaled back a little to leave more time for example problems",
                "This is one of the best courses I have ever taken. The homework problems require time, but are also very gratifying. The amount of office hours offered every week for this class are incredible and very valuable. Professor Steinacker herself holds ten hours worth of office hours throughout the week in the afternoons, and then there are twelve hours worth of evening study hall throughout the week, plus four hours worth of office hours on Fridays. Office hours are always well-attended and I have learned a lot during them.",
                "This course gives us a lot of information, but it could sometimes be difficult to know what is relevant when we are learning in class.",
                "The strengths of the course is how rewarding it was to learn difficult material that explains concepts that occur in the real world. The weakness was that getting there was especially difficult and felt overwhelming a lot.",
                "I think Professor Steinacker did an amazing job at providing clear and thorough lectures that really ensured a fuller understanding of the material. I would say the biggest strength of the class was the amount of resources it provided for the students  there were 10 hours of office hours a week with the professor herself, along with several other opportunities for students to seek help in study halls. Overall, this made it really easy to work on the psets in a collaborative environment.",
                "Strengths: Most collaborative course I have ever been in. Everyone, from Prof Steinacker to the TAs to other students in the course, will help you get through the psets. There are office hours + study hall nearly every day of the week, afternoons and evenings. Also, Prof Steinacker is one of the most engaging and brilliant lecturers I have ever had. She is passionate about not only physics but teaching it, and this passion shows as she is always available to support students.\r\n\r\nNot a weakness but something to consider: The psets take far longer than they should, and I don't know how I feel about this. On one hand, the challenge of the psets allowed me to better understand and apply the concepts from lecture + perform better on the exams. However, the amount of time it takes to complete the psets is no joke - I think most students spend at least 10 hours per pset.",
                "Strengths: all the help with the Psets, Prof is a super sweet and kind person who definitely cares about her students, the trauma bonding - I definitely made some new friends\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the workload. I spent over 10 hours every week on the Psets. This class literally drained me of all life, all my time and energy was spent on this class that I didnt have the time and energy to invest into my other classes or other things I wanted to do. There should really be a separate class for engineering majors who are taking physics or maybe it should be announced at the beginning of this class that you should take 170 if youre pre-med and that this class is geared towards engineers. Ive never shed more tears over a class. The exams were also crazy difficult and demoralizing. Also the mathematical gymnastics required was ridiculous - a lot of the time the hardest part of a question was thinking of which trig identity to use or which other mathematical trick to use",
                "The strength of the course is, without question, Professor Steinacker. Her amazing lectures and associated resources of lecture notes meant I could do the problem sets and tests and receive high marks without the need to reference the optional textbook. The only weakness is that the class is large; I think we had around 150 kids per section and 300 people in the class all in all. The point is that the study hall is massive, so the sound level and atmosphere of people talking are equivalent to trying to do your PSETs in the commons (for any first-years looking at ratings in the summer, commons is a pretty loud lunch hall). If that doesn't bother you, and the help of the TAs outweighs it, then that's great: but for me, the hustle of it all was a bit too much.",
                "Its a good course but it is extremely challenging. Concepts often zoom by and its a fatal weakness for someone who has never had prior physics background. It is hard but possible.",
                "This course does a great job of providing support for students, providing daily opportunities to study with others and seek help from peer tutors in study halls and office hours. While the material is difficult, the enthusiasm and skill of the instructor and teaching fellows make it very understandable and doable."

            "comments": [
                "Only if you need it for a major requirement.",
                "Only if you want to spend hours upon hours in office hours and wait to be hand-held through the problem sets by the peer tutors (who are god sends). Or if you're a physics nerd and love to solve challenging problems on homework she assigns. Or if you're the type to want to get close to your professor. Or if you need a physics credit for your major/premed/engineering. Otherwise, take another physics class, I don't think you need to spend that many hours on one course.",
                "Yes, if you have any physics background, the concepts will generally be a review but harder. If you felt really comfortable with AP Physics C, this class will be a fairly easy A but will require time investment for homework. If you don't have any physics background, this class is 100% takeable and if you're prepared to work hard, you will learn a lot and the grading is very generous.",
                "Yes. Great intro course to physics. Teaches a broad overview of the material. It is a lot of work but you learn and gain a lot, and honestly make friends in office hours.",
                "I would, but only if the student is aware of the actual workload. Great professor though.",
                "If you are taking this class, you most likely have to take this class as a requirement. If you HAVE to take 180, 200, or 260 and that's a requirement for you, take this class. If you are debating between not taking physics or taking this class, don't take this class.",
                "only if you need it, will have to go to office hours in order to understand it or get psets done",
                "Yes. It is probably the best of the intro physics sequences, and if you are a premed deciding between this and 170, I would say choose 180. The grading is clear, the test corrections are nice, and the homework sets, while time-consuming, are thought provoking and really improve problem solving skills.",
                "No, unless it is required.",
                "No because it would take too much for their time",
                "No, unless they are interested in physics. This class is very difficult and time consuming, and not really worth it to just fulfill a pre-med requirement.",
                "as far as required courses go its not too bad",
                "Good intro to physics if coming from a non-physics background",
                "Please do yourself a favor and dont take this course unless a) youre really passionate about physics or b) you have to take it for your major. The cost-benefit analysis is just not looking good. The number of hours youll be putting into simply passing this course could be spent doing so so many other more intellectually intriguing and \"healthy\" things. This course will consume your (social) life and sleep and mental health, so please dont do this to yourself unless you really really have to or you'll be really miserable.",
                "Absolutely. It was a really challenging class, but it was challenging in a way that encouraged me to really apply the concepts we learned. I feel like I left the class with a really solid foundational understanding of all the concepts that we covered.",
                "If you are not a physics or engineering major, I would not recommend that you take this course. If you have the option to take another, equivalent physics course (such as 170), I would take that. This course is not designed for students who have little background in physics, and the cost of trying to catch up with those that have is insanely draining and unnecessary when you consider that the course should have taken into account that this is several students' first time encountering physics material.",
                "If you need or want a more rigorous physics introduction, this is it. I feel very confident about my physics skills after this course. However, if you are apt to stress out easily or not be able to manage work (first-years) this may not be teh best class to take of the bat. You need to be able to keep a level head to complete psets or this class will break you.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about physics.",
                "Absolutely, especially since it is required for my major.",
                "Absolutely!! Even for someone who is afraid of physics (as I was), this is an INCREDIBLE course! Adriane always has her students' backs and organizes the course and grading to be fair and always in the students' favor. More than that, she cares about her students' improvement and is always encouraging in a way I've found to be genuinely kind and caring.",
                "Yes, it was a fun class and very useful for any stem major.",
                "If you enjoy physics or if it is a requirement for you. If you're premed and picking between this and PHYS 170, I would go with PHYS 180 if you really want a good foundational knowledge of physics even if it might be harder and have more work. From what I've heard from friends in 170, 170 has very little calculus and if overall less difficult than 180, but is less organized. PHYS 180 is hard, especially since it is my first time ever learning physics, but I feel like I'm truly learning and getting smarter in this class.",
                "Yes, if engineering, physics, bio, chem, etc.",
                "Yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the lectures are engaging and truly help you learn how to better approach physics problems, and I enjoyed the way the professor taught and was very friendly.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student only if they must take it for their major or for medical school.",
                "Yes, PHYS 180 is hard work but worth it. P-sets are pretty time consuming but if you give them the attention they deserve, then the exams should be alright.",
                "If you are a math major thinking: \"Physics is math. I am good at math. This course will be easy\" you should not take this course. Physics is hard differently from how math is hard, which can be super disorienting. \r\n\r\nThe fact that there are two other physics courses that cover more material does not mean this course is easy/a gut. \r\n\r\nIf you have not taken physics/don't have a lot of experience with integration, be very careful. Most people who take this course took physics in HS, so you will have to work harder. \r\n\r\nIf you took physics before but had a bad teacher and you are wondering if physics could be good and/or if you would like to know how to model the motion you see around you via equations, you should take this course. \r\n\r\nIf you want to take this course because you like thinking about physics conceptually (eg find being in things that are accelerating to be cool ect.), you will not necessarily like this course, but maybe you will. \r\n\r\nIf you need this course for something else, take it. You will survive, just make sure to treat it like the difficult science course that it is.",
                "Depends on what you are interested in getting out of a class: If you want to just fulfill a physics requirement, I would not recommend this class since you will be WORKING for your grade and working hard each week. But, if you'd like to learn physics and push your understanding, I recommend this class.",
                "Well, this class is a requirement. I wouldn't recommend it because it is so difficult, but most students that take it don't have a choice. It's not a terrible class, it's just hard if you've never taken physics before.",
                "If you enjoy math then you should take this course",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it gave me the background I need for an engineering major.  Even though it is difficult material, I think the rigor outweighs the weaknesses of the course.",
                "Yes, if you have an interest in learning how certain physics concepts or equations are derived. If you would prefer to focus more on applying formulas that are given and want to learn about physics in a life-sciences context, PHYS 170 might be a better choice. Would recommend taking this course in a semester where the rest of your workload is relatively light and you know you'll have enough time to go to office hours/peer tutor hours.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of the best courses I have ever taken. I have learned so much about physics and problem solving; it's really gratifying to realize how far I've come since the start of the semester in terms of my ability to look at a problem and figure out what steps I need to take to solve it. Office hours are incredibly helpful, and I strongly recommend going to the afternoon ones with Professor Steinacker if you can.",
                "If they are interested in physics, this class can allow them to discover more about it.",
                "Not unless required by your major.",
                "If you are truly interested in physics or need it for a prereq then yes. However, expect a large workload and a major time commitment.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking to learn physics in a challenging but warm and encouraging environment!",
                "Yes! This is the most collaborative course I have ever been in. Everyone, from Prof Steinacker to the TAs to other students in the course, will help you get through the psets. There are office hours + study hall nearly every day of the week, afternoons and evenings. Also, Prof Steinacker is one of the most engaging and brilliant lecturers I have ever had. She is passionate about not only physics but teaching it, and this passion shows as she is always available to support students.",
                "NO!!!! If youre an engineering major then its required (so sorry) but if youre pre med please do yourself a favor and take 170. This class is not worth the time and energy",
                "I'll repeat my answer to one of the previous questions: As someone who took AP Physics C at a high school that admittedly wasn't taught well, I found that PHYS 180 is a class that more or less goes through the AP Physics C mechanics section. Much of the work was a reinforcement of Physics C, but again, this is what I was looking for. If you are a student that wishes to go further into the world of physics and engineering at Yale, and you feel that you want to ensure you seriously understand the fundamentals (no prior knowledge of physics is necessary to go into this class), then 180 is a great choice. Additionally, it's a great way to learn how to take a college-level lecture if you are a STEM student.",
