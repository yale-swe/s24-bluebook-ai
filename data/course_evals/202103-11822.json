            "comments": [
                "Prof Fadiman has made pedagogy into an art. Every minute of the class is carefully planned out. It's really rewarding to know that someone pays such close attention to your writing and is so invested in your development as a writer. Prof Fadiman's strength surely comes from how much time she devotes to each student individually. She conferences with students after each essay and breaks down your pieces into the word level. Though I enjoy these conferences a lot, I did sometimes wish there was written feedback on our essays. I also think that the rigorous nature of the class limits spontaneity and I wish there was a bit more freedom in what we did.",
                "This course is excellent and completely transformed my ability and love for writing. (Marginally, I think it could be improved by being shortened by 20 minutes, as we often spend time just reading the syllabus at the end of the class, which feels redundant.) Otherwise, it's the best course I've taken at Yale.",
                "Strengths: one-on-one feedback, Anne's seemingly preternatural ability to select a workshop cohort of 12 that have really good chemistry, opportunity to report long form, author visits, social culture of the course, Anne as a professor caring about both you as a person as well as a writer. Excellent in general.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: only two that come to mind are really 1) having the Irene/Mara visit about a week or two earlier would've helped inform the initial site visits, first calls, and interviews at the start of the Yellow Pages, and 2) sometimes working the first paragraph during conferences wasn't always the most helpful application of the conference (some essays needed more macro feedback than sentence by sentence edits, but the sentence by sentence edits were still very helpful).\r\n\r\nAlso loved the little 1/3 class segment we did on applications/cover letters/interest statements/etc. Maybe a little more of that added in one class could help.",
                "I think the readings are very well-selected, the writing assignments are challenging in a good way, and Anne really tries to push you out of your comfort zone.\r\nThe weakness, I would say, is that sometimes privacy is not so well protected in the class. Ive heard from multiple students in my class (as well as learned from my own experience) that private things discussed in conferences were disclosed to other students in the class.",
                "Strengths: the atmosphere among classmates is very supportive, Anne devotes tons of careful attention to the class and to all her students, the assignments are incredibly well-paced, the Yellow Pages assignment is fun, readings are generally good, and many interesting professional writers visit the class for Q&As. Also, an underrated part of the class is that you get a fair amount of in-depth editing practice (a rare quality in other writing courses).\r\nWeaknesses: discussions of the readings and workshops of student pieces can feel scripted and hurried along, there isn't any written feedback from Anne on pieces (although she does meet with each student for an hour after each submission and give verbal feedback).",
                "Strengths - You will have a lot of people reading and commenting on your work, as well as helping you improve it. Every piece gets posted to Canvas, everyone has one in-class workshop, and there's a peer critique of every piece (three written, one verbal). Also, Anne herself is very invested in her students' writing, and she offers a lot of verbal feedback in mandatory, hour-long, one-on-one conferences. Weaknesses - I respond best to written feedback, so I really wish we'd gotten written feedback on our work from the instructor. (There was none.) I also would've liked for the class to lean more toward the seminar side than the lecture side - it definitely was pretty interactive, but I found that there were often times when I would've liked for more open discussion on the (fantastic) readings, as it sometimes felt too structured or rushed. And honestly...I don't think this really needs to be a three-hour class. A lot of time at the end of class was dedicated toward just explaining whatever was on the syllabus for next week.",
                "ENGL 469 is a phenomenal course that teaches you so much about writing. It brings together really smart, humble, and supportive peers and an incredibly dedicated professor in Anne. \r\n\r\nMy only suggestion for the course would be that the seminar was somewhat long, and perhaps unnecessarily so. A quarter to a third of it could probably be trimmed down and communicated in an email or handout (in which form Anne likely has it already). I definitely felt that I learned so much outside class (during workshops, while doing assignments and critiques, etc) but sometimes found class dragging a bit."

                "I would, but with the caveat that this course is a lot of work. The workload rating is very much representative. Though Prof Fadiman does encourage students to pass/fail her course, she still has a lot of expectations on her students. I think the work is worth it though, and it certainly shows in your writing. I think I became a much better writer.",
                "Absolutely, but only if you have time for it and are willing to let it take over your life from time to time. You get out what you put in.",
                "Absolutely. It is a tremendous amount of work, but Anne is among a handful of professors at Yale I know who have nothing on the syllabus that feels like busy work. As challenged as I was, I learned something lasting and significant from literally every assignment. It's worth all the time it takes up.",
                "Yes, but only if you feel like you have a lot to learn, and youre very clear in conferences, class & etc. about how much you want your privacy to be respected.",
                "This course can be amazing if you decide to buy into it. It's designed incredibly well -- Anne provides you with lots of structure and lots of encouragement, and the course is paced so that you produce four drafts plus two polished pieces by the end of the semester. Most other writing classes I've taken, I haven't had that same chance to produce polished work. On the other hand, if you aren't in a place to fully buy into the class, I imagine it could be a difficult semester. It's a heavy (but not insane) workload, and the class is designed to get you to take all of it very seriously, to pour yourself into each assignment. On the whole this is probably a good thing, but the class could get annoying if you don't have the mental/emotional space to take it all so seriously.",
                "It depends. If your ambition is to write profiles for the New Yorker, the Atlantic, Harpers, etc., I could see this being a very fun and rewarding class that would directly apply to what you want to do in life. For anyone else, it could just be an interesting experience, but the work can become time-consuming, and I wouldn't say that it was my favorite writing class. The syllabus readings are very purposefully chosen to mirror the type of writing you do in the class, so I'd recommend checking out some of the syllabus readings and seeing if that's writing you'd like to emulate.",
                "Absolutely! Anne leaves no stone unturned in this class, and will spend hours working with you on your writing. She'll push you to match the care and effort she shows, and you'll grow as a writer and person in the process. If your serious about your writing, make sure to take at least one class with Anne before you graduate."
