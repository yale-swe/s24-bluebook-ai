I loved how the course began by laying the foundation for Universal Grammar which gave a great backbone to the coursework that followed. I also loved how the class took its time in building the groundwork for X-bar theory before then diving into movement and argument structure.",
                "In this course, I learned how to draw basic syntax trees before moving on to being able to draw extremely complex trees. The course also explores head to head movement, question formation, and other parameters of syntax. We also looked at a lot of data from languages other than English. One of the most interesting aspects of the course was looking at data from other languages and determining what parameters the language follows. I ended the course not only with an understanding of syntax, but a genuine love and interest for the subject. I am better able to understand the parameters and structures guiding syntax structure in language.",
                "This course helped me develop important analytical skills for linguistics; more specifically how to apply, explain, define, and argue theories and how to interpret and use linguistic data in said arguments.",

            "comments": [
                "One of the strengths of the course is that it has a nice build up of difficulty as the semester progresses. The professor is great at starting at the ground level and then building up instead of throwing us difficult concepts to master at the start. Another strength of the course is that the lectures were guided by the questions and curiosities of our class. This helped the lecture to flow better and overall be more engaging. In the short span of a semester, I feel like I was able to grasp the fundamental concepts of syntax.",
                "The professor and TF of this course are both excellent as they took their time in teaching the material and demonstrated an immense amount of care and passion for all us students. The workload was very manageable and not immoderate , as the readings from the textbook aligned with lecture material to make for very fair problem sets that painted a good picture of what to expect on exams. I cannot think of a single weakness for this class!",
                "The course is very well-designed, with lots of support and interesting psets. The psets built on what we learned in class and were challenging without being overwhelming. We also focused on topics for multiple classes at a time instead of rushing through them, which gave me the opportunity to learn each topic thoroughly. The course builds on itself by ensuring that you have a strong foundation in simpler topics so that you can better understand the related complex ones. \r\nI can't think of any weaknesses for this course; it was honestly one of the best structured and most interesting classes I have taken at Yale.",
                "The structure and flow of the course feels very natural, which makes it much easier to grasp otherwise complex and confusing topics. I think the class would benefit from a stronger emphasis on deriving linguistic and syntactic theories before they are given to us, rather than just being told what they are and learning how to apply them. This was the case early in the semester with Binding Theory, but eventually not any more. I also think that the class would be stronger with a bigger emphasis on in class discussion and group work. At times the class environment was a little stiff, which made it difficult to contribute to conversation and participate. I think the circular seating arrangement helped to remedy this. I think getting up, walking around the room, and doing example problems on the board also helped to make the class environment feel more organic.",

I would highly recommend this course to another student who has any interest in linguistics, as it gets you thinking in really fun ways that's totally unique  you'll most likely think in ways you never have before in any other class you've taken. I gained a great appreciation for linguistics because of this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to any Yale student who has an interest in language or linguistics. The course is abstract enough and also rooted enough in data from real languages to be accessible to any type of interest in language -- theoretical or otherwise.",
                "I would recommend this class to any students interested in structural linguistics and logic. If you are interested in an introductory course to general linguistics, this probably isn't the course you are looking for. The material of this course, although introductory, is very streamlined toward a specific field of linguistics (Syntax) and should be approached with that in mind. However, if you are interested in exploring this particular field of linguistics in depth and enjoy challenging logic problems, puzzles, and theories, this is the perfect class for you.",
                "Yes, I would. Interesting content, taught in a fun and inspiring way by Raffaella. Really eye-opening and cool to see how all of the drastically different languages in the world can be unified under the same theory."
