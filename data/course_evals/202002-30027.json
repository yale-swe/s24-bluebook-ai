   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I developed a further understanding of higher order organic chemistry reactions and properties.",
    "Solid understanding of organic chemistry reactions and the basic mechanisms that tie them all together, ability to understand and predict what will occur in a given reaction rather than just memorizing reactions and products",
    "I learned to intuit how organic molecules interact. I also learned that having daily accountability for reviewing and returning to the material (via daily quizzes) was essential for my success.",
    "The foundation established in orgo I was built upon to include chemistry relating to alkynes, benzene derivatives, and amines, to name a few. The second half of the course in particular had a heavy focus on learning reactions and reaction mechanisms.",
    "Throughout this course, I learned a lot about how to effectively use my time without spending too much time and risking getting burned out. It was also wonderful to learn more about the electronics and chemistry behind the organic molecules we discussed.",
    "organic chemistry",
    "This course teaches the second half of undergraduate organic chemistry, i.e. more mechanisms, reactions, etc.",
    "I developed a good understanding of numerous reactions in organic chemistry.",
    "I gained a more in-depth understanding of Organic chemistry specifically with respect to the underlying electronics of reactions.",
    "This course helped me understand a lot about organic chemistry and synthesis of different molecules. It built off CHEM S220, obviously, and overall I think it was really interesting to me to see how molecular synthesis in particular works both in nature and in the lab.",
    "second semester of organic chemistry",
    "I developed so much organic chemistry knowledge",
    "This builds on everything learned in the first half of the orgo sequence. Reactions of many different functional groups, especially aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and their derivatives.",
    "Basic orgo II. Pretty fast, but I felt like I learned most of it.",
    "It was a really great way to build on Orgo 1, and taught me a lot about organic chemistry synthesis."

   "question_id": "SU103",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The weakness is that of all summer courses- a huge amount of information in so little time. It might be improved by limiting the amount of reactions introduced in order to have a solid grasp on key reactions rather than a weaker grasp on many extraneous reactions.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Martinez led very helpful problem solving sessions, which made digestion of the material much easier\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While Dr. Parr is clearly very familiar with all the material, the lectures felt a bit disorganized at times. Examples or reactions that were not in the textbook were also sometimes mentioned, but it was hard to tell which of these we needed to know for each exam.",
    "Would like if the instructor and the class notes were more explicit about how the reactions tie together and what were likely to be tested on; handouts that compile the reactions in terms of mechanism (for example, grouping nucleophilic carbonyl reactions) would be amazing\r\n\r\nTransition-metal catalyzed reactions felt like a curveball  I wish that it was clearer how much we needed to know about them, since the mechanisms were a lot different than the ones we had learned before, and it wasnt clear if we just needed surface level understanding or in-depth understanding",
    "The professors were all fantastic. I appreciated the amount of time dedicated to office hours, which I took advantage of. The sequence was taught well, and the explanations were great for each reaction. It would have been nice to have a little more practice in the of synthesis questions before the last week. They sort of appeared on the tests without much forewarning.",
    "After a certain point in the course, classes just feel like a litany of reactions and mechanisms. This seems to be how organic chemistry is taught everywhere, and that's probably why it has such a bad reputation.",
    "The strengths were that overall, the live parts of the class did not take up too much time, so I was able to effectively understand the material with time. One weakness was that at times I felt that the live lecture felt a little long, especially because it was so early in the day. I would suggest a larger or entirely recorded version that is no more than an hour so that students are able to absorb the material without feeling overwhelmed.",
    "Dr. Parr is a horrible instructor. He is so disorganized and makes it so difficult to follow along or organize what we are learning. I don't think I learned anything in this class other than how to take a test using the book and your notes as the only source of knowledge (not your actual brain). There is literally too much to say about how bad this experience was.",
    "Lectures were not engaging, and were not well-suited for the online format.",
    "I think the weakest aspect of this course is the textbook. It's poorly organized, bad diagrams, etc. I would recommend any student taking this class to buy a textbook that offers clearer explanations, such as Klein's Organic Chemistry.",
    "The course was pretty well-taught, which is impressive considering the short time frame. One weakness was that because of the short time frame, there wasn't much time for review.",
    "The course instructor did not do a very good job at explaining the course material or teaching what was going to be on the test. A change of instructors or a significant change in the instructors teaching skills would most benefit the class.",
    "Include more problems worked in lecture.",
    "For an online course, they did a really good job of making sure that there were a lot of accessible resources. Problem solving sessions and classes were pretty promptly uploaded onto the media library, making it fairly easy to keep up remotely. I liked too that they were pretty consistent with the textbook, because that ended up being a really great resource for me. The biggest weakness of this course was that we did not have enough opportunities for practicing problems. We had a couple problems every day on Canvas, but I would have genuinely benefited from Sapling-like problems where after studying, I could work out a wealth of problems that helped me understand the material better than simply reading or watching a lecture. There were end of chapter problems in the textbook that I tried to use, but those questions didnt look like the ones that we were expected to answer, so it was difficult to feel prepared for exams. I also feel like the course staff could have been more communicative about course logistics, like when things were due, how or if the class would be curved, etc. I appreciate though that they were very responsive by email and I also appreciate that they were flexible in accommodations that I needed.",
    "I think this summer was an interesting one, but comparing it to Dr. DiMeglios S220, I thought her class was a little better done with the videos we watched outside of class time. I think it would have been a little more useful to have a shorter in-person class time supplemented with videos we could watch beforehand. I also know I have a hard time watching a lecture normally because its hard for me to pay attention for an hour+ so I think it would have been nice to take this opportunity to break it up a little bit and make it easier for people like me.",
    "Online school is pretty difficult, I had to rely on the textbook heavily in order to learn the material and still had a lot of questions. Getting my questions answered was difficult because there usually wasn't time at office hours or I didn't feel comfortable asking questions that might seem dumb at office hours with other students. Asking questions through email was also not ideal because there were often misunderstandings as to what the question actually was and not all of the questions asked were always answered. Also receiving feedback was sometimes confusing online and sometimes I never found out what the correct answers were for the quizzes.",
    "tough online, but professor made the best",
    "Strengths: Great professors who are very helpful and responsive. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very fast paced and may be hard to keep up.",
    "The daily quizzes were very helpful to guide studying\/main points we should have learned. One thing that could be improved was how all the course material was only available the day of instead of in advance.",
    "Enjoyable lectures, but sometimes it was hard to organize all the information in my head. Lecture slides were not used in the same order as presented on canvas files and a virtual black board was also used without saving the notes. Sometimes classes were split across large chapters which was difficult to manage."

   "comments": [
    "Only if the student needed it for a major or graduate school. Otherwise it is not a pleasurable experience.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they really needed to fulfill prereqs in time. The course is extremely fast-paced, with little time to digest information. Given the timeframe, it is hard to master the different reactions and use them in synthesis problems.",
    "Yes - even though the 5 weeks makes it more intense than other organic classes, the exams are all really straightforward and the course is well-organized. Professor Parr is amazing and does a really good job explaining everything, and he doesnt try to trick you with the exams",
    "Yes. I'm not a big fan of online classes, but this one was well done. The professors in particular made this class enjoyable and more manageable that I had expected.",
    "Most people take the course as a requirement. The material is conceptually interesting, but it's annoying to have to stuff so many reactions in your head.",
    "I would because with the online and at home aspect, I felt that it was much easier to take time to study\/focus than if it was an in person class. And due to the fact that I took this course during the summer, I also had more time all around to focus on my studies. It was very helpful that we had a peer tutor as well as consistent office hours and time before and after every discussion section and class to ask questions and make sure we understood the material.",
    "Not really. Dr. Parr is the WOAT, but also taking it online is probably better than in person solely because of the open note exams. And doing this for an entire semester instead of 4 weeks is probably better but who knows.",
    "I would recommend this course. Organic chemistry is sufficiently challenging to be a rewarding experience, but not so difficult as to be a burden.",
    "If you want to take organic chemistry in a short amount of time, I would recommend this course.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you need to take it. If you really want to learn chemistry you would be better off reading the book at your own leisure.",
    "Most of us have to take this course for premed reasons I think, but I do think its easier than I thought it would be on the whole. I did decently well in regular chem and I was afraid that this would be very different from that but actually having understanding of orbitals and molecular structure is crucial to this course. Ultimately I would tell students who are required to take this but worried about it that its not as hard as you think it will be and that if you stay on top of it and take good notes, youll be alright.",
    "if you have to take it",
    "This course is a continuation of Orgo I, so your preparation in that class will determine in part how challenging this is for you. Also, the lectures rely heavily on the textbook. I definitely recommend this course, but you learn a lot in a short timebe ready for a fair bit of work.",
    "yes you have to take it",
    "The reactions were certainly interesting, but this isn't a course I would recommend to people who are looking to fulfill a requirement. However, I did not find the course as awful as so many have warned it to be and it is definitely doable.",
    "Yes, I would. but be prepared to be organized and stay on top of everything.",
    "Yes!"
