                "Personally, I really like calculus, but some may see this class as a necessary evil. If you enjoy doing a lot of (sometimes tedious) calculations, it can be a strength, but often the practice problems seem more like busywork than emphasizing learning.",

                "I enjoyed the break out rooms. Sometimes, the pre-recorded videos were confusing.",
                "Strengths: structure was clear and an effort was made to synthesize material across the course, a weakness perhaps was that the preparation for class and the lectures repeated each other quite a lot, using time that could have been spent on more examples or deeper explanations.",
                "Excellent",
                "Sudesh is a really really really good teacher, but I think Zoom really hurt this course. I had a very hard time visualizing what we were talking about, and seeing it described on a white page over Zoom did not help. Sudesh did a really good job of linking geogebra lessons, using props, and being available for office hours, but math over Zoom is not my strong suit.",
                "This course was extremely organized and we always knew what to expect on the tests and there was ample opportunities to learn and review material. Even though there is a 20/25/30 grading structure, one had to basically perfect to do well so it's pretty stressful throughout the semester as grading is pretty harsh. But overall the course as bad as I thought it would be.",
                "The strength of this course was 100% my prof Sudesh. That man is a legend and I can't recommend this class highly enough if you get in his section. Weakness: online interactions were a bit dull/awkward in class.",
                "I felt that the course covered too many topics too quickly.",
                "Strengths: Curriculum seems well-thought-out, professor was great (at least mine was), problem sets are good prep for exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not really I can think of - it is a math course with 3 midterms and weekly problem sets. I got exactly what I expected.",
                "The lectures and notes were clear. The professor provided a lot of opportunities to ask questions. \r\n\r\nOne thing that may be improved are the pre-class quizzes. It feels as though they take up too much time (taking time away from solving the problem sets) - if the pre-class quizzes provided more direction as to what we should specifically focus on and the questions tested the fundamental knowledge needed to go into the next class prepared (as opposed to a trick question), it may be better."
