From very meta discussions about the human mind as it relates to creativity to hands on activities to engage in creative processes, these class is a must take for anyone interested in what makes up creativity. This class certainly sharpened my insights into my creative process and allowed me to be more comfortable as I thought through cognitive aspects of my thinking."

                "Loved the creative exercises in class (clay modeling, painting, sketching and dancing, combinatory play skits, final creative project) and the midterm interview. I also appreciated our start-of-class stretching ritual. Weaknesses: 10 am is ROUGH, and the reading responses were confusing and we didn't get feedback on them. They were cut halfway through the semester, so maybe they were deemed unhelpful? I felt planning was disorganized, and I wish that the weeks where we had long readings that we could do an activity with them or a small project).",

                "This class has many strengths and few weaknesses. It is a very hands on class as it allows students to explore creativity through play, performance, and production. Additionally, the other students brought diverse perspectives and expertise from their various interests and fields. This class was well organized and each class was extremely fun! The readings and assignments contributed greatly to the overall discussions and learnings throughout the semester. Additionally, at no point was work in this class too much or burdensome, allowing students to truly explore their creative process with ease."

This class is geared for all audiences and both professors strive (and succeed) to make the classroom an inclusive space for all different types of interests and fields. Taking this class was an utter joy and certainly a highlight of the classes I took at Yale."
