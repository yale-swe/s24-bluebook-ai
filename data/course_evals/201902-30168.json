    "Learned basic calculus skills.",
    "When I applied for the summer session, I had not taken a math class since high school seven years ago, so jumping right into this course and starting with terrifyingly difficult calculus concepts immediately was, in a word, non-ideal. However, with persistence and a qualified teacher, I eventually made it through this class on sheer willpower and gentle guidance from others. I learned that I am more capable of understanding and solving these complex mathematical questions than I thought, if I spend enough time and energy on them. Determination (and the internet) helped me see the light at the end of the tunnel. And even though this course was fast-paced, I absorbed the math as well as I could. When I take more advanced courses next summer, I'll have a steady foundation and review materials needed for the other classes.",
    "How to derive, how to calculate limits, a little bit of integration",
    "There are some new knowledge and skills to solve calculus problems that I did not learn in my school."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Loved the professor!",
    "Strengths: 1) The qualified professor, Pam, and 2) the accessibility of the online materials. 3) I liked that we had little videos explaining the material from last year's course, and 4) I liked the short homework quizzes that we were required to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 5) I also liked the way the calculus concepts were planned out from week to week as we went through them; it started simply and built upon the concepts as the weeks flew by. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) This can't be helped, but it was extremely fast-paced. We barely had enough time to tackle one concept before moving on to the next one. 2) Most of my study time was outside of class and I would spend literal hours trying to solve even one of the written homework assignments. I did not like the written homework assignments as much, because I would have to spend so much time on them. 3) I got a little used to Canvas telling me immediately if my answers were correct on the online homework. This is bad for my impulse control, because I would want to see if I had answered a question and almost press the submit button before I was finished with the homework. 4) I did not use the textbook (which I thought was too advanced for what we were doing) or the TA much at all. 5) This may only apply to me and the other working students, but my job is from 8-5 and I would have to dart away from work in order to show up for the online face-to-face class sessions. Maybe having them in the evening would be better? \r\n\r\nImprovements: 1) A time change for the face-to-face class sessions, and 2) longer class sessions because we'd often have to tack on things we didn't cover to the next session. I'd like the class to be in the evening because I work from 8-5. 3) A less dense textbook. 4) I know I can't suggest that there be less material to cover given the time crunch nature of a summer class, but it does come to mind. 5) Finally, less written assignments, or a reduced number of questions per written assignment.",
    "The overall is great. However, I think the pace is a little bit fast."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Summer classes are a great way to get a credit.",
    "Yes, I absolutely recommend this course taken with Pam.",
    "It depends on the student's situation. Do they have the money, time, energy, and capacity to dive into a rigorous calculus course that will command their entire attention for the whole of July? Ordinarily I would not recommend the course, due to the fortitude it requires to get through it, and during the summer, too. However, if it is absolutely necessary for their academic future? Yes, I would recommend it, provided that they do not want to go to another program that is less expensive and probably less intense.",
    "Yes! It's a lot less stressful over the summer, although the pace is accelerated",
    "Yes, because we can learn to solve problems in a different perspective."
