            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Amazing professors and content, engaging lectures and discussions, opportunities for critique in other studies, creative projects\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading scheme was somewhat confusing and opaque, and the syllabus changed significantly over the course of the semester. This made it a bit confusing to understand and evaluate individual grades. I also wish that the assignments were due at 11:59pm instead of 7pm; a 7pm Friday deadline is really difficult to work into a weekly schedule.",
                "Strengths: Honestly, anybody working with data should learn about these concepts. It is worth knowing the ethical implications of the datasets you use and the other effects that go behind and are impacted by data practices. Furthermore, the instructors love these topics and are clearly knowledgable about them as well, and usually can explain content in ways that can clarify the readings. It was clear that they cared about the class and put a significant effort behind the curriculum, and they also invited several great guest speakers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This was the course's first iteration, so there were a lot of smaller issues that students may not encounter when this class is run in the future. However, they did affect my in-class experience. Unfortunately, my TF did not grade my assignments in a timely manner for the latter part of the semester. For example, we had a project in which we had an outline due a month prior, but by the time the project was due, my outline still wasn't graded. As a result, the feedback I received was close to none, so I lacked guidance for the larger assignments. In fact, because it took so long for my first two assignments to be graded, I feel that the lack of timely feedback also impacted my performance on our first major assignment, which was just three weeks into the semester. Furthermore, the instructors significantly changed the syllabus mid-semester by adding a major project without notifying us nor displaying it on the course homepage (please keep the course schedule on the main page of Canvas!). This slight disorganization did affect my schedule during the time when we needed to work on this newly announced major assignment. Several other deadlines were also changed over the course of the semester. Again, these are issues that affected my personal class experience but may not affect yours as this course continues to be fine-tuned. \r\n\r\nI also did find it slightly off-putting that Prof. Posada would publish his lecture slides on Canvas yet Prof. Tahir wouldn't (the professors alternate lecturing week-by-week). I appreciated that his slides were available as resources to cite for assignments and projects, but I also understand that by not posting slides, students would be more encouraged to go to lecture, so I'm not sure which policy was better, though I would suggest that the professors agreed on a single policy regarding posting lecture slides. Either all or none of them should be on Canvas, not half of them.\r\n\r\nAlso, many students would skip lectures, which made it seem that lectures were not always engaging from either the students' end or the instructors' end, but also as the lectures typically covered the readings, only doing one of the two was truly mandatory (hence probably why many students skipped class), which I personally don't like in a class.\r\n\r\nI was also not a fan of the grading scheme in this class. There could not be a more ambiguous grading scale and it was difficult to really tell where I was in the class. The scale worked as follows: students could receive either a 1, 2, or 3 on an assignment, with 1 indicating a strong submission, a 2 indicating a satisfactory submission, and a 3 indicating that the submission needs revisions and could be resubmitted. There wasn't a great way to tell what each of these numbers really corresponded to grade-wise, and considering that I did not receive timely feedback, it was very difficult for me to gauge my class performance. That said, I am a STEM major and this is one of the only humanities credits I've taken, so it's possible that I am not as familiar with what grading is like. If this or something similar is a more common practice than I had thought, please do disregard this paragraph.",
                "I think the material in this course is really interesting. However, I think it was not organized in a way that was the most conducive to my learning as it often felt like we were jumping around from topic to topic.",
                "strengths: broad survey of the literature\r\nweaknesses: i think this course is trying to do too much theory for a survey course. It would be better to either do this in a more applied way and aim it explicitly at CS/S&DS people, or make this a full on social science course. Right now its in an uncanny valley",
                "needs some foundational texts or more grounded in depth lessons. the course covered a lot of material but its hard to walk away overall with any solid knowledge",
                "The lectures are one of the course's strongest assets; Professors Posada and Tahir are both engaging lecturers, and both share a knack for imbuing their lectures with a sense of urgency and relevance. In terms of weaknesses, I wasn't very much a fan of how the workload for the latter half of the course centers around one student-chosen topic with one pre-assigned peer. The last two major assignments (both required to be about the topic you and your partner choose for the earlier of the two) could perhaps be condensed or broken up to allow for collaboration with more individuals, as I think that being able to work with peers from so many different disciplines/backgrounds is another asset of the course. I'll say (neutrally) that the course is structured such that you can get by mostly without doing the readings, or by only skimming the specific readings addressed by the week's assignments. Some more clarity as to how directly each week's readings would relate to the lectures and section conversations might be useful, as I found myself erring on the side of under-reading rather than over-reading once I realized that not every single \"mandatory\" reading would be necessary.",
                "I think overall it was a great and insightful class, but I think it would be valuable to learn more about the technical terms described before diving into the social implications they cause.",
                "Strengths: I loved how we focused on a different theme related to data studies each week and analyzed data through that lens. I also liked the final project format of doing a weekly assignment that built up to the final project.\r\nWeaknesses: The discussion section wasn't useful because we just discussed what was covered in the lecture, which most of the time was very understandable. It would have been much more useful to use that time to work on our final projects with our partner and apply the knowledge from class into our own work. And there was little guidance about the expectations for the final project.",
                "I'd say it's a very good class considering this is the first year. It has a compelling reason to exist and the material is fascinating. I would say that as long as it continues to update itself as long as new things are happening in this field, it should remain a very interesting class."

                "I do think this class should be taught several more times, but assuming this class is taught every year, I would wait until the Fall 2025 semester to take this class. I think one's learning experience would be significantly better after this class goes through a few iterations and becomes more organized. That way, external distractions don't affect student's experiences in this class, and there are certainly ways that the professors can improve this class that they are already aware of. It is certainly a concept worth teaching, but the course still needs several adjustments to its organization with lectures and maybe even the projects and deadline timelines. This course has great potential, especially if the professors maintain a similar effort in improving the class as they did for creating the class.",
                "I think the subject of this course is valuable for any student to take. I think especially as this course is taught more (as this is its first time being offered) the strength of the material combined with the logistical improvements will certainly make it a class worth taking.",

                "i think it provides information that is really important for everyone, but no because i disliked the assignments and format overall. and i dont think it should be cross listed with the film department that felt wholly inaccurate. but in time, with a workshopped syllabus i could see this course being very strong",

Fairly approachable humanities/social science inquiry for those whose course load has mainly been STEM, though not watered down to the extent that hums/soc. sci. students wouldn't still get a lot of valuable insights from the course.",

The course is focused on data extraction and use, and the implications of it, which was really interesting to learn. I feel like there aren't many courses that address the power dynamics/effects on data subjects, so it's definitely something you should learn!",
