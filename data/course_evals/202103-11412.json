I learned how to build a long-term research project from the ground up, beginning with a set of anchoring primary and secondary sources. I also learned how to peer review other students' work and provide thoughtful and concise feedback.",

                "I thought the milestone due dates prevented me from accomplishing more in my thesis this semester. I felt like the bulk of the assignments served the purpose of reminding us to think about our thesis research, but most did not actually move me closer towards completing my research and thesis. Instead, I spent time completing what felt like busy-work that I would have otherwise spent on research.\r\n\r\nThat said, I thought the initial milestones for meeting with a librarian and creating a bibliography were very helpful. I also enjoyed meeting with my thesis adviser.",
                "The Senior Essay is a great way to get history students to push themselves in their senior year. It has forced me to rethink how I write and convey my narrative of the past to my reader. I can definitely see how by the end of next semester, I will be an entirely different student and thinker than when I started the process. I think one criticism would be that the opening orientation session was not so helpful. Some of the speakers highlighted how long and intimidating the project is, how important it will be in the scheme of our lives. Students are already very anxious about their theses  I think the focus of that opening session should be building students' passion for history and love for the work, rather than encouraging us to worry about the thesis from the get go.",
                "I really appreciated the weekly meetings with my advisor as well as the freedom to go into a topic of my choice. I can not think of any way the current structure could be improved.",

I did not hear from the history department during the fall semester unless it was them reminding us of an impending deadline. But there is no organized support or guidance to help students approach or complete all the different requirements of the project. And for those of us who have little experience with these types of assignments, the history department should be doing much more than it currently is to help.",
