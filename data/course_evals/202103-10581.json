We didn't receive any feedback on our grant proposals, and we didn't really discuss our project outside of our lab until the end of the semester. The assignments were a bit unclear in what they were looking for."

I learn a lot because of the amount of effort I put into my experiments and thinking about the project. The presentation also pushed me to present my research in a way I haven't done before. With that said, the intensive major is a lot of effort (>20 hours a week), so it feels like I am in classes or lab the whole entire day."
