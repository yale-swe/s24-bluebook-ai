I felt challenged to think about my experiments critically and read more papers.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there would be more feedback and clarity on the assignments consistently throughout the semester. We didn't receive any feedback on our grant proposals, and we didn't really discuss our project outside of our lab until the end of the semester. The assignments were a bit unclear in what they were looking for."

I learn a lot because of the amount of effort I put into my experiments and thinking about the project. The presentation also pushed me to present my research in a way I haven't done before. With that said, the intensive major is a lot of effort (>20 hours a week), so it feels like I am in classes or lab the whole entire day."
