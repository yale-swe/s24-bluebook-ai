This would be more beneficial than reading the textbook and answering pre-written questions that we can prepare beforehand."

                "YES!! Especially with Ao Laoshi because she really makes the class so enjoyable - going to Chinese class never felt like a burden because of her enthusiasm. Your Chinese will definitely improve pretty notably; I think my tones are definitely better. Just be prepared for daily work - and lots of David and Helen.",
                "Definitely! It was a great source of Chinese learning and community and the teacher was incredibly supportive.",
