Other professors in the department can be very harsh and intimidating but Farina recognizes that languages might not be everyones strength but he cares about the effort you put in.  Basically you get what you put into this course and I couldnt imagine L3 with another professor.  There are daily quizzes and I wasnt sure how much they were worth but they kept you on top of the class."
