                "I learned how to conduct ethnographic research, along with what methods are good/beneficial for research generally. I learned how to code and how to go about all the steps that ethnographers take when undergoing a research project. I also learned how to synthesize and analyze the readings given. I hadn't known how to code before, so this was a really cool class that I enjoyed when it came to taking all the steps that qualitative researchers do. It proved that there is merit to qualitative research and we should treat it as having the same authority as quantitative research.",
                "I developed a basic understanding of ethnographic methods, analysis, and writing.",
                "Any knowledge or skills I developed from this course were the result of my own engagement with course readings and had little to nothing to do with the course or instructor. Readings discussed important and worthwhile skills but it was rare that we really discussed or practiced them as a class in order to internalize or famaliarize ourselves with them or even understand how those skills could be incorporated into our research.",
                "This course attempted to guide students into thinking critically about our research methods, especially in racialized communities that are often our own; I think this was achieved to some extent, but a lot of it came from my own readings of the course material and individual practice, as well as conversations with classmates outside of the class itself.",

                "The class could have been better by having regular structured check-ins to build up to the final product, including making certain steps deliverables like the consent forms, transcript, coding diagram, and a draft of the ethnographic paper. Ethnography, and research, is something new to most students. Otherwise, I enjoyed the workshop aspects of the course, as well as discussions about the ethics of conducting research.",
                "Strengths: Readings are usually interesting I guess.\r\nWeaknesses: One of the most poorly taught and structured courses I have ever taken. I will try to give a rundown to prospective students. We are given large amounts of readings each week (which considering it is a once-a-week seminar class is mostly fine on its own) but then proceed to barely engage or discuss them in class. It is unclear what even goes on during the class time because the one hour and fifty minutes would seem like enough time to complete the weekly student presentations \"co-facilitations\" as well as receive instruction/lecture from the instructor to properly situate our readings and the skills/methods they discuss in the context of our research. However, student presentations take up inordinate amounts of class time and lectures are ALWAYS abridged and meander. Additionally, many of the classes at the beginning of the semester and toward the end were taken up by class discussions regarding the logistics of the class and coursework. And this was not logistics regarding how we should complete the coursework and the necessary steps and timeline which would have been incredibly helpful, but rather simple logistics regarding which week assignments would be due and various quantitative features of the assignments (length, number, etc, etc) whose negotiations and discussions also took inordinate amounts of time and pointed to a lack of structure and overall guidance from our instructor. \r\nGuidelines were vague if even present. Rubrics did not exist for most assignments and for our final paper, we were given a rubric that was mostly qualitative and vague. Feedback was nonexistent. In addition to receiving little to no guidance regarding expectations or an outlined rubric for assignments, students would receive their work back with grades and docked points that had no explanation. How students were supposed to change or fix their mistakes without feedback is beyond me. Major course assignments were handed back with one or two brief comments and a grade.  \r\nAssignments were thrown at us and we were expected to complete them without fully understanding what our expectations were or even how we should go about completing it. Students in the course were forced to work together informally outside of class time to guess the parameters of assignments and how to complete assignments at every step of the process. \r\nThis might all be forgiven if the instructor was a kind instructor who was simply a little new or unfamiliar with teaching. Instead, on top of the course being poorly run and structured, the instructor was largely unhelpful and also disrespectful of students' needs, time, and labor. The instructor is the type to never practice what they preach when it comes to pedagogy and community care with strict deadlines and inflexible (and often unspoken) course expectations. Students would receive notice of new expectations to course assignments days before they were due. And above it all, the instructor is often rude, unkind, and patronizing in her correspondence.",
                "I found a lot of the readings in the course interesting, and I think that the goals of the class held the right focus in wanting to ensure that we are considerate of ethics in research. However, I found that the course was often disorganized, and the professor seemed a bit confused at times about her own expectations for the class. It also seemed that the professor lacked knowledge on several topics, such as Yale's IRB process, which seemed pretty relevant for a methods class where students were interviewing people, especially in vulnerable populations. The workload was a bit intense, as the reading load was significant alongside thorough assignments towards our final projects, which made it difficult to meaningfully engage with both components. The pacing of classes themselves reflected this, as there was often not enough time to cover all of the material for a week---we rarely got to engage in-depth with the readings, and student presentations on the readings were frequently cut short because Professor Hidalgo needed to discuss logistics or give information to support our projects, which she often was not able to get through entirely either. Overall, I think that the timeline of the course, including both weekly assignments and time management during class sessions, were not as effective as they could be, which I think hindered my experience.",
                "Although I appreciated the work we did in class, I felt that the structure of the course was not as engaging and it failed to invite meaningful discussions between peers and the professor. I felt that instructions for assignments werent clear and always needed extra discussion during class. Some of the work we engaged with, such as a film we watched in the first weeks of class, were irrelevant.",
                "The materials for the course were interesting and informative, though at times, some readings were repetitive. That said, the course was poorly structured. The lectures, while containing some helpful information, were often just read off the screen by the professor and did not help to really teach the methods of research any further. Student-led activities and presentations would often take up too much class time, so that it was hard to learn about the methods and practice them during class. Additionally, the workload of the course did not consider the weight of conducting a research project in addition to keeping up with weekly materials. It was hard to engage meaningfully with both the personal research project and course readings. Finally, the syllabus was misleading and unaccommodating to students. The syllabus notes, and the professor had also stated in class, that extensions are only granted in the case of medical emergencies, with the proper documentation for said emergencies. This goes against university policy, violates student privacy, and creates an environment that is hostile and inaccessible for students, both disabled and temporarily undisabled."

                "I would! The course taught me many new things about what it means to conduct qualitative research. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to pursue a PhD in the humanities/social sciences, especially in an ER&M-related field. I would also recommend it to any Latine students interested in research, as Prof. Hidalgo caters the class to these students because her work is in the Latine community.",
                "No. I absolutely would not ever recommend this course to someone for whom I cared about their mental, emotional, and academic experience. Perhaps to an enemy I might, but even then I would feel sympathy for their experience. \r\nUnless you absolutely must take this course, please take a different course on ethnographic or qualitative research. You will learn far more and be instructed by someone far more equipped and in an environment better suited for student learning. \r\nThere are simply no redeeming qualities to this course outside of course readings which will be better in a different but thematically similar course (I know from experience). Additionally, you can just do the course readings on your own time. The limited personal engagement is basically what would happen in the course anyway as being in the course would offer no further insight.",
                "I honestly would not. While a lot of the themes about ethics and intentionality in research, especially with marginalized communities, are really important as researchers, I think that the readings themselves did a lot of heavy lifting as opposed to Professor Hidalgo (aside from choosing the readings). These are themes often explored in ER&M classes, and can definitely be found in other methods courses, so I think the shortcomings of this course and Professor Hidalgo outweigh the benefits when compared to other options to fulfill the same interests and requirements. I do think that there is potential for the course to be more enriching for all students, but as is currently, it is not worth it.",
                "Although I feel that it is necessary to learn about ethnography, qualitative methods, and its ethics, I do not think this course presented these topics in a helpful and engaging way. There were a lot of times where it felt\r\nlike I was unprepared to develop and submit the final research project.",
                "Unless Professor Hidalgo seriously considers student feedback and restructures the course and her pedagogical approaches accordingly, I would not recommend this course."
