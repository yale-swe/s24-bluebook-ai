    "Small class size and a great professor made speaking in class very welcome and accepted. I felt very comfortable asking questions and making mistakes which is important in a language class.",
    "The pacing of the course was very fast, almost too fast at times. The course could be improved by perhaps omitting some of the material and instead spending more time on the nuances of the other grammar concepts.",
    "Too much homework every night",
    "The course requires a good amount of assignments in order to maintain practice, but at the same time a lot of the work tends to feel like \"busy work\"  that takes time that could otherwise have been used in a much more productive way"

    "This is a great opportunity to improve your Spanish grammar. Each class is enjoyable because Prof. Seymour is so positive and welcoming. The syllabus is clear and straightforward and the Skype sessions with a student in Ecuador were way better than I expected. Overall super happy I took the course. The work is steady but never too stressful or difficult.",
    "Yes, teacher is very engaging and you will learn a lot from this class without having to do any oral Spanish evaluations and gain a L5 foreign language credit in 1 semester.",
    "This course greatly improved my reading and grammar skills in spanish.",
    "Yes, if you need to take a Level 5 Spanish course, this course is a great way to do so in a small class size that lends itself nicely to an engaging and discussion based environment.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who really wants to improve their Spanish in a meaningful way and would be willing to spend somewhere between 4-6 hours a week on homework in order to do so"
