                "This course is like no other. It taught me how to call a box at the Beinecke, how to touch and handle the original journals and letters of living poets, and how to conduct original research that mattered to me. I had 0 archival experience before taking this course, and after this class I feel completely  comfortable with it.",
                "This course helped introduce me to the concept of a long-term research project.  The instructor set recommended pacing, but ultimately it came down to the students to reserve time in the Beinecke, start their papers, etc.  Additionally, she helped us to examine our projects, poets, poems, etc. in the artistic and cultural framework they existed.",
                "This semester I learned how to conduct research in the Bienecke, and also how to consider the connections between a poet's published work, and their correspondence and papers.",
                "I learned a lot about how to approach archival research and generally plan and execute a research project. I also learned a lot about the New York School of Poets. I gained the ability to analyze and make claims from reading poetry along with writers' personal papers. I also gained more familiarity with using the Beinecke.",
                "I came into this course having done a bit of archival research, although I had little knowledge of New York School poets. Over the course of the semester, I learned an immense amount about late 20th century American poetry, as well as intellectual circles in and around the New York School. More importantly, this class made me a much stronger and more thoughtful researcher. By working on a semester-long research project, I learned how to formulate and reformulate questions that sustained and followed my interest. I'm much more comfortable working in the archives, and I feel more prepared to work on longer research papers in the future.",
                "How to research in the archives, construct an independent investigation, close read archival papers in relation to poetry, and make insightful connections between writers, their poetry, and their papers."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths - Prof Roffman is a shining light, she is so special and kind. She has such an incredible love for archival work that really shines through in the way that she discusses and creates assignments. All of our weekly work was so nuanced and interesting, making for wonderful class conversations that were as creative as they were rigorous. Weaknesses - None.",
                "I cannot think of a single way to improve this course.  It was open ended, had engaging conversation, and the professor regularly took time to speak with each of us about our work thus far.  She wrote handwritten feedback on our weekly assignments, and brought in poets to speak to us about their work, process, and papers.",
                "I think I could have personally benefitted from more structured conversations earlier in the semester regarding what the research paper would look like; I think I dived in a little too blindly at the start, which meant that a lot of my early research wasn't particularly useful to the final paper. Another general point: I think having more assignments and readings located in one place (i.e. on Canvas) would have helped me organizationally (vs. digging up different emails \/ Dropbox files etc). \r\nOtherwise enjoyed the community and kindness of the students of the class and of course Prof Roffman's rich insights. And loved the visitors :)",
                "This course was amazing. The opportunity to study in the Bienecke, conduct a personal research project and meet three poets whose work we had been studying, was phenomenal.",
                "The strength of this course is that all of the assignments are very intentional and student directed in a way that forces students to develop their own research questions and instincts. Another strength is that it uses a lot of resources like the Beinecke and actual living poets really well by inviting guest speakers and encouraging students to do archival research. The structure and size of the class also encourages students to share their research interests with each other in a way that builds community.",
                "I really loved the majority of the course, from the poet visits to the research time to class discussions. Sometimes the homework assignments or criteria for larger projects were a bit unclear, but Karin was able to clarify them when we had questions.",
                "This was a phenomenal course. Karin Roffman is a deeply knowledgeable professor who is truly fascinated by what her students bring to class. She contributes to  discussions thoughtfully but not prescriptively, and gave considered feedback every week on students' research projects. The class subject itself is fascinating and is a wonderful entry point for those interested in poetry to enter the world of archives. The independent nature of the research in this class was also a strength. Students were immersed in papers from different writers, so perspectives shared in class were varied and illuminating. Everyone became interested and invested in their archive research. Poet visits and readings were also a highlight!"

                "I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS COURSE ENOUGH. This is a true gem of a class, a rare find that lets you delve into a whole new world of archival research. We got to meet some of the coolest living poets, including Ron Padgett and Mei Mei Berssenbrugge. This experience is unheard of in a class.",
                "Absolutely.  This was bar none the best course I have ever taken at Yale, and taught by the best professor I've ever learned under.  Her teaching style is warm and encouraging while also offering feedback an rigorously reviewing your writing and process to help you improve.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Roffman is incredible and shares so much insight on how to do research in the Bienecke, as well as showing students the connection between poets' papers and their final work. We were able to look at so much primary materials throughout the semester as well as meet three of the poets that we had been studying. I truly cannot recommend this course enough.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! I loved it and Karin is an AMAZING professor!",
                "Yes! Especially if you're someone who wishes you spent more time exploring the Beinecke or is interested in reading artists' letters, drafts, and journals, this is a class for you. Karin is a wonderful and incredibly thoughtful professor, and she makes the class exciting, regardless of your past experience with poetry.",
                "Yes! If you have never conducted archival research before, this class is for you; if you have, this class is also for you. Because it's a very self-directed class, you can study and focus on what elements you are most curious about. This is a class on contemporary poets, largely intersecting with the New York School, and while the poetry itself is read closely and investigated, this class is also equally interested in the poet and their process, and what personal papers in the archives reveal about the poet and poetry. There are at least three things going on in this class at any one time. You have readings, responses, class discussions, archives viewed in class, independent archive lab hours, poet visits and readings, an exhibition, presentations from Beinecke curators, and research that culminates in a final essay. These elements make the class such a rewarding and diverse experience."
