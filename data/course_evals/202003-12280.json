                "I learned the basics of error propagation\/analysis and mechanics, including pendulums, accelerated motion, collisions, torque, simple harmonic motion, rotation, gyroscopes, fluids, and radioactivity. We used loggerpro to plot data and perform curve fits to understand the relationships between variables in the context of each topic. Generally, I learned that I don't always need to have an extensive background knowledge about something in order to analyze the situation and draw conclusions based on data. I actually had fun in this relatively low-stress environment, just jumping in and working with the equations\/data in order to better understand what is physically occurring in the different situations.",

            "comments": [
                "A well executed class. I'm personally not in love with physics",
                "I would never pay attention to the actual methodology of the labs because I didn't need to. I would just extract the information I needed. Therefore, this was more of a physics class than a lab for me specifically. I understand though that there's not much that can be done about that though, since it is all virtual.",
                "This class is a lot of fun.",
                "The amount of work needed to go into submitting a lab report and post lab is far higher than in-person labs.",
                "I appreciate all of the effort that the teaching team put in to make sure students were able to have some form of physics lab albeit remotely. The kits were very well-done and useful.",
                "Strengths: the course instructors are really helpful and responsive, chill lab environment, lots of options in take-home assignments, lab reports are straightforward\r\nCould be improved by having more experimental freedom in the labs.",
                "Strengths were that the materials were all very well prepared and distributed and labs were all very well adapted to online learning while trying to maintain as much actual experimenting as possible.",
                "Given the current situation, I think this course was organized in the best way possible. The weekly classes to complete our assignments were typically divided into breakout rooms similar to how an in-person lab would work I presume. The post-lab activities were creative ways to further apply our understanding of the concepts learned in the labs. I particularly enjoyed watching the WTF videos Professor Cahn made.",
                "Strengths: Since we worked virtually, we watched videos of the experiments being conducted properly. This was very helpful in developing an understanding of proper experimental procedure.\r\nWeaknesses: The Post Lab Activities (PLAs) were often very time consuming and vague so that they added unnecessary pressure and work, especially since they were due at the same time as the regular labs. The PLAs only asked you to work for around 2 hours, but in order to set up your experiment properly with limited resources and gather enough data (and 'correct' data at that), you had to spend much more time or else points would be taken off for lack of 'insight'. These felt like the course requiring you to do double the lab reports for half the course credit. *I believe this format has been altered for the spring 166L course based on student feedback*",
                "Though the videos and lab handouts were very effective at communicating the spirit, if not the letter, of a physics lab course, in the virtual format the presence of the TA added little, and the course would likely have gone smoother if we had spent the entirety of it in breakout rooms.",
                "Strengths: Ample opportunity to ask questions to the TF and\/or one of the course professors",
                "The strengths were the teaching team and the quality of the videos, and also the couple times we did lab experiments together when they were simple. Maybe one weakness was sometimes when the experiments they included in the kit were too complicated and\/or didn't work for me, I would have to panic and have to wait for others' results or the TA to know what to do. Maybe another weakness was how awkward the breakout rooms would get sometimes as it ended up just silence until one of us would ask for answers or results from each other. I DO see the need for breakout rooms though, because all of us in one meeting room would make it hard for the TA to attend to our individual\/group questions. A major weakness: Sometimes it would get a bit long to sit in the same place watching physics videos or doing lab calculations\/data recording for 3 hours. A shorter lab activity (max 2 hours) would be preferred.",
                "I love how considerate the instructors were. The workload was a bit high at first with a lab report and the post lab due in the same week in certain weeks. However, the instructors were super understanding and eventually lessened the load. I felt like they spent so much time trying to send lab equipment but because it arrived so late, I didn't really get to use it. Not their fault though.",
                "strengths: supportive instructional staff \r\nweakness: disorganized, did not learn much, kits were not helpful",
                "strengths: did well given the circumstances of virtual learning and were very, very on top of ensuring every student in class received a physical kit to work with if they wanted to which must have been a logistical nightmare. TAs and professors very responsive and helpful in and out of lab, pretty clear with what was expected from assignments save for the post lab experiments which were very low pressure but almost too freeform.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: some components were repetitive but once again could not really do much in making a physics lab go virtual.",
                "I liked how well this lab course adapted to the online format.",
                "I thought it was well taught, but the PLAs and WTFs weren't needed and were just a hassle.",
                "The strengths of this course was the patients and commitment of the teaching team. I thought the professors and TFs were very considerate and always spent time answering questions. I learned a lot through the in-person activities, especially if they were more hands-on. The weaknesses are that I sometimes felt like I did not get very much out of the lab if we just watched videos and did calculations. Labs like the gyroscope lab was more informational since we could explore phenomena. Post-lab activities (PLAs) also caused a lot of stress because it was unclear what was expected and seemed very much open in the air. I spent more time than what was indicated just to collect data and make sure I had enough. I also thought that PLAs did not really add to my learning experience. I also wish that answer keys would be given for the quizzes or the practice practical. Otherwise, physics lab was very informational.",
                "Strengths: well organized\r\nWeakness: I understand that since it was online we couldn't do hands on things often or at all, but because it was mostly just taking notes obviously we didn't learn the techniques as deeply as we would in a normal year",
                "This course did an excellent job as establishing physical principles and experimental practices to be used throughout the semester as a whole. The labs made sense and, with just a couple exceptions, were readily completable within the 3 hour timeframe. Obviously it was difficult transferring an in-person lab to a virtual format, but I think this class did a good job at it.",
                "One strength was that there was a lot of time given to ensure completion of any lab report or activity. One weakness was the online structure this past year as it created an environment unfit for bonding with lab partners and classmates.",
                "Dr. Cahn did a wonderful job at providing the physics kits that allowed students to complete projects at home\/dorm. However, it was also a bit of a double edged sword because they increased the workload of the course a lot.",
                "I think the PHYS 165L teaching team did an excellent job with the course. I did however think the number of post-labs was a bit much and could be lowered in the future if PHYS 165L is taught virtually again.",
                "The Post lab assignments, like the WTFs, while funny were not helpful. Most of them were the same thing and felt like busy work rather than learning",
                "The instructors are super passionate which is great. Generally good course especially given the circumstances.",
                "The strengths were being able to do our own experiments with the kits and that the workload was reasonable. The professors clearly wanted to make this course engaging despite the virtual format. The main weakness was that sometimes directions were confusing or unclear, and also I didn't really receive feedback on my lab reports and post lab activities since many of them still have not been graded so it was frustrating to not be able to correct mistakes in future lab reports since grades were so delayed. For example, only my first post-lab activity has been graded which was due in September, with no comments about why points were taken off, and we had one due every other week of the semester. Therefore, I have no idea if I did the rest of them correctly or if I made the same mistakes on each one, and I don't even know what my mistakes were on the first one were. This was not a problem in every section, but having so few assignments graded in my section was very frustrating.",
                "I think the professors did a great job at moving the lab from in person to virtual. The kits really helped me get hands-on experience, and the TAs were very helpful during class time. Also, I liked the small group break-out group format because that was much easier to ask questions. I think early on in the course, the expectations for what a lab report or PLA looked like could have been a little more clear, and an example report would have been helpful. After the first lab, however, I understood the expectations.",
                "The lab was a ton of work for a .5 credit course- the lab reports took a long time outside of the 3 hour lab session, and then on top of that the PLAs took several hours. I understand the purpose of them and I honestly enjoyed using the kits to do experiments at home but in addition to all of the other work it just got super overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: I think the topics were super engaging and the team was helpful in making sure students had fun while completing these labs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of work for a lab course, I don't think I understood as much of the physics concepts as I should have? The act of setting up the lab right, getting results, and structuring a neat lab notebook took away from the relationship I was supposed to get from the lab itself and the concept it's connected to",
                "The professors really cared and worked hard to transition to a productive and engaging virtual format.",
                "Strengths: Very flexible and between the lab and the PLAs, you get comfortable with the concepts. Weaknesses: The online format made it very different and we were often watching the experiments being done rather than doing them.",
                "It was very well organized and I think the labs were thoughtful. I wish it were less work for the large portion of students taking it who learned all of it prior to Yale.",
                "I learned nothing in this class except for how to use logger pro and graph data. The labs were extremely long, monotonous and pointless. I still do not have grades for 8 assignments I turned in ON TIME, so there was absolutely no feedback to help guide my learning or help me improve throughout the semester. A waste of time and energy to be blunt.",
                "The course was well thought through. All labs had a very thorough guide with easy to follow steps. However, the individual additional experiments became time consuming and difficult to do at times.",
                "Given COVID-19, the lab was handled very well. Learning to analyze data in LoggerPro using the video feature was a great adaptation. At times the post labs were pretty tedious on top of the lab reports, though (since they were basically repeating concepts).",
                "The course's strengths include clear explanations of physics concepts, and seeing them demonstrated in experiments and analysis. An inevitable challenge in the course was the virtual format. I thought that watching recorded experiments and conducting experiments of our own were both interesting, but given that most labs were based on the recorded videos, I found that the biggest weakness\/issue of the course was in having a practical lab final when we hadn't had too much experience with doing labs ourselves.",
                "Strengths: It was a fun class and I learned a lot of basic statistical error analysis, I'm a personal fan of the take-home lab materials and I think they made the lab much more accessible and enjoyable\r\nWeaknesses: Chaotic to say the least (last minute emails, sudden changes to the labs, confusing assignment schedule, combination of over- and under-communication) but equally forgiving, the emails were a bit archaic and confusing and veeeery long I still haven't uncovered the meanings of a few of them",
                "Too great a workload for a .5 credit lab and especially for a virutal semester",
                "The course was engaging and required critical thinking about topics being studied in other physics courses. The lab reports were reasonably-sized and fairly simple to complete within the timeframe. The use of extra \"Do it Yourself\" experiments every other week was a bit excessive on top of the other lab work, and given the open nature of these projects with very little instruction it was a bit tough to judge the level of work expected.",
                "Strengths: The teaching staff worked very hard to make this class work, mailing every student a kit to use.",
                "This course was very well organized even in the online format.",
                "The strength of this course is that the instructors cared about the class and were quite enthusiastic. However, there were many weaknesses. First, the post lab assignments were unhelpful. After writing a full lab report and finishing the experiment, we had to complete busy work assignments. These post lab assignments taught me nothing I hadn't learned from the lab, and took well more than an hour to complete. The professors insisted the assignments shouldn't take long, but in order to finish assignments and receive full credit, we had to spend much more time than the professors suggested. Otherwise we would lose points for leaving out details or not watching the entire video series. Second, Professor Cahn's emails, while funny at the beginning of the semester, quickly became immensely frustrating. It's very stressful to receive an incredibly long email from a professor and not even understand what the professor was trying to convey. These emails took time to read and decipher, and often conveyed important information about assignment changes and deadlines. I often had to email my teaching fellow to figure out what was required of me, and my teaching fellow often couldn't tell. Clear and concise communication is essential. Finally, the sindYkits were fairly annoying-- they were large, difficult to pack and unpack, took up space in our small dorm rooms, weren't used very much at all, and required us to pick them up in person multiple times in a semester with a global pandemic. In short, I really do feel that the professors meant well, but I don't think they fully realized how stressful poor communication, complicated physical pick-ups, and changing assignment dates and deadlines are.",
                "One strength was the ease in finding all the necessary videos and lab worksheets on Canvas. I think the videos and the layout of the class was very engaging and I had fun despite doing lab over zoom.",
                "this class had a lot of work in my view - though I do think some students were able to finish the lab in time, I personally found it difficult as did some of my friends. It would be nice to have more talking about the physics concepts in simple terms at the beginning, as I have no previous experience with the content.",
                "I personally see no weaknesses in the current course. More practical experience would be great, but I do believe the post-lab assignments creatively remedy that problem given our current situation.",
                "Really liked the set-up, except when we had a PLA and lab due the same week",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that the lab handouts are very clear and easy to follow. It was great that, while we had to think through and do many things on our own, we weren't just stranded. Also, the course expectations were always very clear, and I never felt overwhelmed by them.",
                "This course was definitely challenging to have online!\r\nStrengths: good professor and TA, interesting labs\r\nWeaknesses: having to do the experiments via recordings for the most part, a very intense workload at the beginning - this was improved however as the semester went on",
                "I believe that the format of the class works well in terms of the zoom call with students going into small breakout rooms where they can call on their TA to help. This format allows for small group collaboration or independent exploration while keeping someone who can help close by at all times.",
                "Great course, the physics team really put a lot of time and planning to ensure the students learned the maximal amount (given remote situations)",
                "This class was a really good companion course to PHYS 180 since we covered all of the topics in PHYS 180",
                "The faculty is very enthusiastic. The TFs were very kind and helpful, and the passion the instructors put into making the videos entertaining and enjoyable was very palpable. The professors also prepared kits for activities at home\/in the dorm room, which were very interesting, though our engagement with the kits were limited. The virtual setup of the course made it very difficult to be engaged, however; most of our time was spent on watching videos and recording things from watching videos, which were difficult to engage with.",
                "There were many parts of the course that were inefficient for learning. For example, emails sent by the professor were long and written in a riddle format. This was unnecessary. There were also WTF and do it yourself labs that did not display my knowledge nor deepen it. I felt that these were a waste of time and could have been replaced by legitimate learning opportunities.",
                "The instructors were really excited and dedicated to making the online experience work and listen to feedback. The class was too much work for most of the semester for only a half credit lab as we were doing the in-person lab component, writing up lab reports, and doing diy experiments on our own, but the instructors recognized this and tried to change it later in the semester.",
                "Strength: \"Insight Points\" encouraged out-of-the-box thinking and thorough reflection.\r\nWeakness: Time-consuming assignments that yield little personal\/educational value",
                "Strength: Providing kits of materials to student for use in the second half of the semester was a game changer and very appreciated. Weakness: In this semester, it was very disorganized. There were way too many videos in the media library, many of which were extraneous, that made it overwhelming to find the relevant material. The intention for how the course would be formatted was not clearly communicated, especially with regards to assignments - probably because decisions were made on the go -  but this was stressful and not great.",
                "This course was strong because  it provided each student with all the information necessary to succeed and it emphasized intellectual interest and the pursuit of knowledge rather than perfect test results when it came to creating our own experiment. This was appreciated because it allowed for students to develop their skills creating an experiment rather than always playing it safe to get the best results. This courses biggest weakness was occasional technological glitches and the fact that some labs were not ideal for at home experiments. This will be easily resolved once classes are back in person, but for now the best thing that the teachers are doing is being understanding about the process.",
                "The weaknesses of this course stem from the virtual lab setting. There is little to no point in doing the lab section in a synchronous manner. I think the course could be improved if the lab was conducted using videos in an asynchronous lab.",
                "The strength was that the labs were done together so there was a TA or professor to help. The weakness was the first few labs went overtime.",
                "Strength: it was fun to see everyone each week and get to do an experiment together online! \r\nImprovement: a lot of confusion on sending\/receiving physics lab supplies",
                "It seems too boring to have student sit in front of their computer screens for 3 hours just to watch videos and answer questions for the actual in lab portion. I suggest shortening the amount of videos and questions we have to answer in class and allowing us to perform our DIYs during this time as well, to make the course more engaging. It seems as though the courseload for the virtual semester is more than what is given to students in a regular semester.",
                "The at home component with the sindeYkits was a strength of the course. Despite the course being online, it was still possible to engage with the concepts at home and learn all the necessary material in an engaging way.",
                "Too many assignments. Very thorough.",
                "A lot of it wasn't the instructors fault, but it's really hard to do physics lab virtually, it's not very engaging. The labs were also in general far too long. Most classes I barely finished on time or had work to do after the three hours in addition to the reports which isn't really fair for a half credit course. The instructions or assignments for each week were also often unclear and confusing.",
                "It was kind of weird having to go to lab on zoom but then just work silently in breakout rooms. Basically all my work was individual. It might be helpful instead to just host office hours during the time that the lab is usually scheduled so that while working on the lab students can stop in and ask questions as necessary.",
                "The course can often feel disorganized during an actual lab, but overall, I thought it was very well-taught and the material was interesting.",
                "I was happy the labs were due a week after they were done in class; I finished within the class time frame only once. I liked that we were placed in groups to do the labs; I loved my group and it was very helpful having other students I could contact with questions outside of class!",
                "A strength was the ability to ask questions during the lab, but a weakness was having a 3 hour zoom where it was hard to stay focused the whole time.",
                "The instruction prior to a lab regarding what would be done during the lab and what the students she record regarding their work was very weak. However, the grading and feedback was very good.",
                "The instructors made sure that students understood the concepts taught.",
                "As far as an online lab can go, I would say that this course went pretty smoothly. I liked that we were placed in breakout rooms during labs because it really allowed us to collaborate without the pressure of having to talk in front of the whole class. The lab handouts were always useful--as long as you read the handout before class, you were good to go. I also liked having the kits sent out to us to allow us to experiment at home.",
                "Strengths: easy to get into a routine with the class, good way to introduce physics material and how to deal with errors in physics\r\nWeaknesses: excessive workload and time commitment for a 1\/2 credit class",
                "Strengths: The lab packets are very informative and I have found myself using them to study concepts that I have found challenging in class. I also like the practical component of the labs. Great instructors. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I just dislike the amount of hours that you would have to spend each week just to prepare and write notes\/reports. Not to mention the post lab assignments and the weekly quizzes that we had on top of that. In some lab modules, the tasks were very repetitive and it felt like we were just filling time which I could have used for something more productive. I also dislike the break-out rooms mode of instruction, as we would all just shut the cameras and the microphones and work independently. It would have been better if we stayed in one Zoom room, with the TA available at all times. In addition, it would have been helpful if TAs would brush over the experiments at the start of each lecture to speed up the work done.",
                "Prof. Cahn and the other professors put in a lot of thought and hard work into making this course (a physics lab course !!) work remotely. The videos we used to collect data from were always interesting to watch, and I really appreciated the thoughtfulness. It was a fair amount of work to do lab reports and post-lab assignments, but not as much work as several other lab courses. I liked having break-out rooms with other students where we could ask each other questions, check answers, or call the TF for assistance.",
                "I think the labs we did were well planned and well selected to demonstrate some of the most important concepts. I found that the labs we did really helped me better understand concepts I was simultaneously learning in PHYS 180. I really like Professor Cahn a lot because he made the course so entertaining and more fun, and he never hesitated to challenge us to dive deeper into the lab and try new experiments and learn more. \r\n\r\nI think it could be improved by reducing some of the work at the start of the course, like what happened in the last few weeks. As a course of half a credit, I think it demanded a bit too much (at least at the beginning) because I essentially did every lab twice at first: once during class and once after to complete everything I didn't finish\/understand the first time. It felt like I was repeating a lot of information from my notebook in my lab report, which felt unnecessary. I suppose it may have somewhat helped in teaching me to write scientific paper in a succinct way, but repeating the information from my notebook in a lab report every week felt redundant.",
                "Workload was a bit high but overall engaging material - instead of 3 labs\/2 weeks, 1 lab\/week would have been more manageable",
                "The course was obviously dampened by the online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We had to watch pre-recorded videos by the instructor and analyze data that he made, which was slightly dull. However, a strength of this format is that we don't have to worry about errors that we students make, nor worry about putting the setup correctly and waste time making mistakes.\r\n\r\nOverall, Professor Sidney Cahn is an enthusiastic and knowledgeable professor. Our TA was also incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.",
                "workload was a little much at first, but it leveled out by the end of the semester.",
                "The strength was the phenomenal job of the lead instructor, Sidney Cahn. The idea of shipping materials and making themed videos and inspiring enthusiasm was The Best. \r\nThe weakness was the workload of Post lab assignments which seemed often like busy work which was unfortunate to add onto the workload of finalizing lab reports. That was the only thing I didn't quite enjoy in the course.",
                "I think a strength of this course was how we were still able to learn the basics of in-person lab from our homes\/dorms. A major strength was the amount of handouts and files provided to help us understand the information and topics beforehand and the walkthroughs for the procedure. I think one way it could be improved is taking into account struggles with the SindeyKit and time constraints. For the one or two labs where we needed to build something by hand, I believe the amount of time needed to build the apparatus and get meaningful results was underestimated, especially during the final exam.",
                "Strengths: online lab worked well, although I think the lab sessions were too long at times.  The block of time required for this class in the schedule isn't great if you're not a STEM major and it conflicted with a lot of other classes I wanted to take.  The TAs are very helpful and nice.\r\nWeaknesses: 3 hour time block not fun to have in schedule, too many conflicts.  Could be boring at times if your lab group didn't take a lot.",
                "The course sent each student a lab kit to do experiments at home and I really appreciate the dedication and resources that were allocated to students.",
                "I enjoyed the format. It was a bit tedious though.",
                "I want to preface all the comments I will make by saying that I acknowledge that it was an insanely hard and peculiar task to try to navigate the intricacies of structuring a lab course in an online format. I believe that the fact that this course was possible is testament to the fact that the educators running this course are extremely passionate about helping students in any way they can, and I sincerely appreciate that. Having said that, I think it is simply impossible to replicate a lab course in an online format. Contrary to other courses I had this semester, this course did not feel feasible taking place online. First and foremost, I found the lab sessions themselves to be extremely draining over Zoom. Having students sit in front of a computer on a Zoom call for 3 hours straight is definitely something that is not sustainable. I found myself extremely drained many times throughout the semester, and I believe that that definitely took away from my learning experience in the course. Many times the fact that we were sitting in a Zoom room even felt counter productive. For many of the labs in my breakout room we would just sit silent working individually on the lab tasks at hand, seeing no apparent reason why we had to sit in front of the call working. Moreover, I know that this is a problem with many lab courses, but this was one of the times that I felt that the 0.5 credit was not sufficient for the work I was putting into this course. I would spend hours and hours during the week attending the lab sessions and working on the lab reports and the PLAs  more time than I frankly spent on a lot of my 1-credit classes  and this class still awarded me only one credit. I know this is by no means the fault of the instructors of this course, but I think it is important to acknowledge that lab courses like this are very time-intensive. On that note, I believe that the format of having PLAs as an additional assignment  this semester make this course all that more hectic. The workload was significant as it was and having to spend additional hours during the week working on the PLA was definitely something that added a lot of stress and took a lot of time. When it comes to the grading scheme itself, I believe that many times I would lose points for things that were not extremely clear and that I would spend hours and hours trying to improve on those mistakes by polishing my reports, seeing no tangible change reflected in the grades I would get back, losing the same points on things like insight. Again, I want to stress that this was a Herculean task, and that the fallacies I found in the lab were certainly not things that the instructors were to blame for. If I had to make one board suggestions for the next semester of the course that would be to try and be cognizant of the time that the students have to spend in front of a screen doing online school. It may end up being better to cut out things like the PLAs altogether, as they make students spend more time in the course than they would spend during a normal year.",
                "Strengths: professors and teaching fellows were good, labs were reasonable in length, lab reports were fair \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the labs felt like they were pointless (ex. the coin flipping lab). Just because you are given 3 hrs of lab time\/week doesn't mean you have to use it all",
                "Strengths: the amount of preparation by the professors and teaching assistants to make a virtual lab possible. The SYNDEY kits were great, and the at-home experiment options were creative and made up for the virtual environment. Kudos to all who made PHYS 165L possible this semester!",
                "Strength: well organized with clear expectations, the instructors\/TAs are always willing to accomodate and adjust the content to best suit the needs of the students\r\nWeakness: watching recorded clips of experiments may not be the most exciting, especially for students learning remotely while waiting for the kits to arrive",
                "It was interesting but it was honestly too much work. In addition to the lab report which took much longer than the assigned 2ish hours after which they said you should submit to complete we also had to do post lab assignments which took forever.",
                "The labs were interesting and helpful. It was a bit difficult having both a lab report as well as a DIY lab report due in the same week.",
                "I did not really enjoy the PLA's. I felt that they didn't really serve their purpose of reinforcing the concepts learned during lab but felt like just another assignment I had to get done. I think a better idea would be to assign something related to the application of the material.",
                "The professors and instructors are absolute gems and really helped us through the course despite everything being so unfamiliar due to the online format.",
                "At the beginning of the semester, the amount of work and assignments was overwhelming. There were multiple lab reports\/activities\/quizzes each week, and the labs were too long for the allotted time. However, this was addressed towards the end of the semester, and the class significantly improved. I hope they continue those improvements in Phys166L next semester.",
                "Hard to be done online, missing out on a lot of lab stuff, gets kind of boring.",
                "Labs were much less engaging through Zoom, most labs just involved watching videos of the experiment being performed, lab groups didn't feel as close as they would have been in-person; not sure how things could be changed given the circumstances",
                "Strengths: the teaching team is very invested in student learning.",
                "I thought the PLAs were the most fun\/engaging part of this course. I think using the SINDeKITS and doing experimentation ourselves was exceptionally helpful in actually understanding the physics.",
                "I hate doing labs over zoom.",
                "One strength of this course was that we worked on experiments as groups, promoting teamwork with classmates and also making it easier to solve problems as they arose. Also, the workload was very fair, especially compared to general chemistry lab. The TFs were very helpful and I also think the grading was fair for the most part.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course was maybe the lab practical exam. It felt a little rushed and it was kind of a stressful experience. However, for 166L, I think they are eliminating the practical exam component altogether.",
                "The lab packets did a great job of introducing the fundamental material and equations to allow us to complete the labs. I really enjoyed the pre-lab videos and my TA was very nice and willing to answer any questions throughout the lab. Sometimes it was tough to get through the 3 hour lab just sitting in my room, but this was not a fault of the course itself and more a difficulty with taking a lab online. I still think this is probably better than condensing the live lab sessions\/having more take home activities on our own time because it was nice to ask questions to the TA\/other classmates in real time.",
                "Great physics lab! Very well organized, suitable for learning.",
                "I do not believe that this lab transitioned to remote learning well. So much insight into the course was lost on me, and other students.",
                "The course was well-organized, and the selected teaching staff effectively supported student learning. The kits sent to us were very fun to conduct labs with, but logistically it seemed very difficult to distribute kits to so many people across the world. At times certain lab procedures seemed to be somewhat repetitive or even tedious at times, but perhaps this was an artifact of the virtual world we live in.",
                "I really wished I got to do the labs in person. The SindeYkits and the PLA allowed us to do some hands-on activities, but they seemed repetitive because we already did the labs during our assigned lab day. The chemistry department had in-person labs. Could this be implemented for physics lab?",
                "Strengths include strong teaching staff and experiments, weaknesses were only due to limitations caused by virtual format",
                "I felt this course had many weaknesses. Namely, there was so much work! The pre-lab quizzes, lab reports, PLA's. It was very time-consuming to put together full-point-worthy DIY's using the kit...sometimes, I got points off for not \"improving the experiment\"; there were few feasible improvements I could come up with and what with setting up the experiment and writing up the report, took well over 2 hours!!!! Overall, I felt that the kits did NOT teach me anything, other than how to stay up late.",
                "I think the whole sugar with water analogy from the last fill in the blank was correct, but I guess you can't expect us to do rocket science either so there's no remedy.",
                "Strengths: I think the best way to describe Professor Cahn is whimsical. His enthusiasm for teaching really shone through this semester. The instructors were all very creative and worked hard to make sure we still got a physics lab experience despite the COVID-19-related challenges. The pre-recorded lectures were great as well as the sidneYkits.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The organization was sometimes unclear given the virtual structure (a LOT of announcements)."

            "comments": [
                "I liked splitting up into breakout rooms to work on the labs. Having the DIY kits was also helpful for the post lab activity",
                "Having to watch someone else do the lab wasn't beneficial. The analyzing component worked well though, as it was pretty similar to when we had in person labs.",
                "The professors actually understand that we are in a pandemic, and act accordingly",
                "The DiY post lab activities were really fun and low-pressure. Great balance of recorded and in-person learning.",
                "The virtual labs were quite successful and well prepared. The Post Lab Activities were a bit confusing at times and their purpose could be clarified.",
                "I enjoyed the use of breakout rooms to simulate an in-person lab experience.",
                "The technique of placing students in breakout rooms to work side by side on virtual activities was very effective and allowed for collaboration in a way normal lab courses never do. The unique style of the videos for the course, both main and extra, also contributed to engagement with the material. However, the virtual TA lectures did not translate effectively, and the content was often made more confusing rather than less by them.",
                "Succeeded: breakout rooms during the lab were helpful for us to work in small groups\r\nCould be improved: most of the labs consisted of watching recorded videos of the professor performing the experiments for us. This made it hard to stay fully engaged in the labs, since we could not perform the experiments ourselves.",
                "The breakout rooms are a good idea, but maybe have us pick our own groups or have us do some sort of freebie icebreaker activity together so it's less awkward!\r\nI also really disliked the use of LoggerPro when we had to record our own data from videos. The premade data LoggerPro files were more easy to work with.\r\nSometimes it would get a bit long to sit in the same place watching physics videos or doing lab calculations\/data recording for 3 hours. A shorter lab activity (max 2 hours) would be preferred.",
                "I feel like I missed out on a lot of the hands-on experience, but I still gained a lot of knowledge. I got the most out of this online lab that was possible given the circumstances.",
                "I think how they have adapted the lab is great. It allows students to be able to get a lab experience wherever they are.",
                "We were given really cool kits of physics equipment at the beginning of the year, and I know they must've been such a hassle to assemble and distribute, but I do feel like working with my hands helped me visualize the physics. The pre-recorded videos were also super helpful (and funny!).",
                "the workload was unnecessarily high for a half credit. It is already difficult to manage so many online classes during a pandemic, and i felt that this half credit course consumed way too much of my time.",
                "successes: videos for lab were easy to follow and understand as were the lab packets, TA engagement with section was good and help was received when needed during and outside of lab via virtual correspondence or zoom\r\n\r\nimprovements: more structure for post lab assignments; i opted for watching videos over the physical experiments because i had no idea how to design one different from the one in lab videos or how to set up somewhere at home in a way optimal for a physics experiment",
                "I liked how there were videos of the lab for those learning virtually. But delivering lab supplies was inconvenient as the delivery service kept on damaging the supplies.",
                "I really appreciate the consideration that the professors and TFs put. The SindeyKits were phenomenal and helped the learning experience. However, I think it could have been improved if we had more guidance on how to use the materials. The breakout rooms were also pretty successful since I could interact with other students and ask questions.",
                "Something which was a great addition were the Post Lab Activities that actually allowed us to physically conduct experiments ourselves. We were given a series of lab materials and several experimental suggestions to facilitate our own work.",
                "The course succeeded in allowing us to have some hands on experience. It was less engaging, however, than it would be in class and was not as helpful to learning via watching others do demonstrations.",
                "This course succeeded given the difficulties of a lab class during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lab kits and prepared labs by Prof Cahn and the rest of the teaching team made this class enjoyable. I don't have any notes on what could be improved.",
                "Post lab assignments were not necessary to make up for extra learning that couldve been done in person",
                "Although it was logistically complicated, distributing the kits to all the students succeeded and I really enjoyed being able to perform my own experiments with the kits. Also having the labs over zoom and watching videos was obviously not ideal but given the circumstances of this semester I think the format was the best it could be.",
                "At the moment that I'm writing this evaluation more than half of my assignments have not been graded. I understand how extremely difficult it must be to grade things during the pandemic, but perhaps this might show how there should be less PLAs or Lab reports if my TA cannot finish grading the majority of my assignments. I have no idea what my grade is going to be in this class and I just don't think it's very considerate to the students who work hard to make sure the assignments are turned in on time.",
                "I think the small group break-out room format was very helpful because lots of people asked questions, and I don't think that would have been the case if the entire class was in one big room. I did find that we got more tools in our box than we needed and it was sometimes confusing which parts we should use.",
                "the zoom sessions are super draining and tedious, I would like to do a more PLA-like\/hands on experiment during the lab session and not have to just analyze on logger pro for 3 hours.",
                "Post-lab assignments could be improved. I think there was a very rigid structure for post-lab assignments, and although the handouts say that you should spend about 1.5 hours on it tops, that's an additional 1.5 hours on top of the 3 hours of lab, 0.5 hour of pre-lab reading, and 3-4 hours on making the lab notebooks neat, organized, and including everything that needs to be included.\r\n\r\nI really liked that one week where we completed the lab ourselves and wrote our answers on worksheets. That took a lot of stress out of rewriting lab notes and was one of the only times I finished lab within the allotted timeframe.",
                "They adopted the course pretty well to the online format and it was a good fit for myself this semester.",
                "the kit! great to be able to actually do hands on work even from afar.",
                "The PLAs were a success in getting up to apply the knowledge learned in the lab but the lab session can be improved by incorporating places for the students to perform the labs.",
                "Zoom meetings for lab were not helpful. My TA just read of slides and didnt teach the physics we needed to know for the lab.",
                "The virtual lab sessions were helpful in that our TA was able to answer questions and we could work with peers in breakout rooms. The walk through videos were also detailed and helpful.",
                "The use of breakout rooms within lab sessions was very effective! It provided a comfortable setting in which to speak to peers, ask questions, and work through the lab together. The recordings of labs we would usually do ourselves also worked surprisingly well; even though we couldn't do many labs ourselves, watching and analyzing the videos or data provided to us was still interesting and informative. Perhaps next semester the balance between recordings and labs we do ourselves could be improved\/altered so we can gain more experience actually doing labs ourselves.",
                "Big proponent of SINDEYKIT. Loved that thing. Breakout rooms for labs were also helpful. \r\nThe PLAs stressed me out I can't lie. I'd rather do some more of the interactive content during lab time than outside of it. All the computer stuff and worksheet-style material can easily be done outside of lab I think but the more engaging parts are in the kit. In short the kit deserves a lot more attention.",
                "The course transitioned well to an online format, and the provided kits further made the lab feel authentic.",
                "I appreciated that the teaching staff made an effort to give us some hands-on experience by mailing out the lab kits (which must have been very expensive to do). We didn't end up using them very much, but perhaps they will be used next semester. There was a lot of trial and error in course format this semester, but the professors were always asking for feedback and willing to listen.",
                "This course was able to stay engaging even during the modified online format.",
                "See previous answer-- post lab assignments and sindYkits should be eliminated or greatly minimized.",
                "The lab videos were very helpful and fun to watch. If there was more guidance on the post-lab experiments, that would really be helpful.",
                "i enjoyed the breakout rooms which enabled us to talk in small groups and made it less stressful",
                "Yeah, the Sindey Kits were helpful",
                "I did not personally use my kit much, but it was fun to use for the Lab Practical exam and I appreciated having the option to use it. I chose the \"What's the Flaws?\" solely because they much easier.",
                "We were given kits with materials to help conduct experiments at home - I personally did not find this too useful especially given how extensive the kit was and how little I ended up using.\r\nI found the practice exam to be quite challenging given the need to complete this outside of the lab. \r\nSection via zoom overall worked fine!",
                "I felt very unengaged during the labs, since a majority of them were prerecorded videos that we simply watched for data. I think using breakout rooms in the sections made it easy to ask people questions about the labs.",
                "We were sent kits including a ton of bits and bobs for performing labs physically and also for further optional explorations. There were super helpful, and I really appreciated the opportunity to be more hands-on than most virtual labs!",
                "Most of the course was virtual; it composed mostly reading lab handouts and watching videos. These succeeded to some extent, as they expressed the lab ideas clearly, but could not fully replicate the lab experience. The enthusiasm of the instructors in these videos and in virtual lab meetings helped, however. The instructors also prepared mailed kits for home use; these had limited success, however, as they were only used for selected post-lab activities, which were not always required. The kits themselves and the activities were interesting.",
                "email communication could be clearer. lab reports were effective. do it yourself\/WTF portions were not effective.",
                "Really great effort with the kits and at-home diy component. The experiments didn't always translate well but the instructors were really great about being flexible, taking feedback, and trying to translate the material as best as they could.",
                "Kits were a good idea.",
                "Having a lecture before proper lab stuff was somewhat helpful. Making use of breakout rooms to have private study halls helped with engagement.",
                "As mentioned above, the technology needed for this class was not always cooperative, so this presented some challenges when it came to getting the experiments done. Furthermore, the idea of screen sharing a video through zoom was not always the best because it made it so that the video often lagged and the data was hard to interpret. Fortunately students also had access to all of this information so they were able to look back to clarify things later. Being on zoom to conduct the experiments was very helpful because it allowed students to ask questions amongst each other.",
                "The efforts of Dr. Cahn to send people the kits for the lab was very effective.",
                "The decision to use prerecorded lab data was both good in that it allowed for anyone to do the lab from anywhere, but it did limit engagement and sometimes the recordings weren't of the highest quality, which made the video analysis work difficult.",
                "Succeeded: doing actual experiments with tools sent to us \r\nImprovement: more clear and concise communication about what experimental tools are being sent to us, and what changes are being made to assignements.",
                "It seems too boring to have student sit in front of their computer screens for 3 hours just to watch videos and answer questions for the actual in lab portion. I suggest shortening the amount of videos and questions we have to answer in class and allowing us to perform our DIYs during this time as well, to make the course more engaging. It seems as though the courseload for the virtual semester is more than what is given to students in a regular semester.",
                "The sindeYkits and PLA assignments were a great way to remain engaged virtually. Additionally, working with lab groups also allowed for engagement amongst students.",
                "Very chaotic. Very many steps and announcements to be aware of at all times. Wish the class just cut back on everything a little.",
                "Handing out the kits didn't go very well. There needed to be more times available to pick up the kit and more advanced warning since people have other things to do.",
                "Labs were as good as can be expected in a virtual environment. The out of class hands-on portions of the course were very interesting, but were very easy to get lost with.",
                "They got us all the supplies we needed to do several of the labs from home! While they were not always perfect the effort was appreciated.",
                "I think that having a weekly Zoom meeting where we go over the lab procedure and watch the pre-recorded videos together was very helpful and effective.",
                "The DIY at home experiments could have a bit more guidance.",
                "Lab over Zoom was very challenging, and some of the online labs that just included watching videos made it hard to stay engaged.",
                "Having multiple instructors to explain questions in different ways facilitated understanding. The format was slightly repetitive by the end of the semester.",
                "The live virtual labs were well accomadated in terms of changing the procedures for virtual instruction. However, the labs themselves would often take longer than need be.",
                "Having students collaborate on some assignments was nice, as it made me feel like I wasn't alone during this covid period.",
                "The idea of sending boxes of physics lab equipment, while I'm sure came from a well-intentioned place, was simply unnecessary and just another hassle to deal with in this unprecedented time. Frankly, they didn't add anything to my learning experience than had already been obtained via the live lab sections.",
                "I liked the way the live session was conducted--first, the TF would talk briefly about the lab, then we'd go into breakout rooms and begin the lab while the TF went to different rooms in case anyone had questions. The kits were a great help. Overall, I think the instructors and TF adjusted very well to virtual learning.",
                "I really appreciated the effort to provide us with materials for lab. The access to a TA and instructor over Zoom was also very helpful and appreciated. The supplementary activities (due to the virtual nature of lab) seemed to add a great deal to the workload and time spent on the class.",
                "The practical component of the lab was a success, however, the practical final was very stressful and very challenging to do over Zoom.",
                "The videos we collected data from were fantastic and interesting to watch. I am learning remotely from home, so I received a kit of physics equipment to run my post-lab assignments. I only used the kit for my final lab practical exam and aa few of the labs. For post-lab assignments, I only used the ping-pong ball and thread provided. Having break-out rooms for lab was nice and encouraged me to finish the labs \/ graphing components in class (as opposed to later in the week when finishing my lab report).",
                "The videos Professor Cahn made were really helpful in demonstrating the lab, and it was really nice to see such clear footage of a succesful lab. I think the Post Lab Activities were also nice because they encouraged us to still get hands on experience. I also liked the Sindey Kits we received, although I only used about half the materials I received, so I'm not sure it's worth all the effort it must take to distribute such large and complete kits to everyone in the course.\r\n\r\nI think the interactions between students early in the semester could be improved because the first few weeks were drastically more difficult than the last few weeks, largely because we didn't feel comfortable asking each other too many questions in breakout rooms and we were still not used to the format of the class. I did really like how we had the same lab partner every week because it created a sense of continuity and gave us more chances to create somewhat lasting relationships with at least one classmate, but I also never contacted my lab partner outside of breakout rooms in class.",
                "Breakout rooms worked well to ask other students questions as we worked through the  labs",
                "The course was obviously dampened by the online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We had to watch pre-recorded videos by the instructor and analyze data that he made, which was slightly dull. However, a strength of this format is that we don't have to worry about errors that we students make, nor worry about putting the setup correctly and waste time making mistakes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we were provided with kits of objects that we could emulate the experiments at home with. These were useful in clarifying the physics concepts and made it a bit more fun, although sometimes it was tedious.\r\n\r\nThe PLAGs\/WTFs (extra experiments in addition to normal physics lab) were honestly unnecessary and repetitive, and mostly a waste of time.",
                "Distribution of the physics kits was successful and helped with the engagement with the virtual lab.",
                "To move a lab course is a challenging thing. I really appreciate the work put in to distribute experimental kits. Using tactile experimental tools for some experiments in combination with the video watching was helpful for 1) to force me to think creatively about the experimental approach 2) become more accustomed with seeing physics concepts in real life. That being said, the work-load of the course at times felt daunting. Post lab assignments were helpful in solidifying concepts, but it did add a significant amount of work during weeks that it was due.",
                "The shipping of materials was Superb. And the pre-recorded lectures had amazing enthusiasm even if at times tedious.",
                "I enjoyed the watching of videos and analyzing of data using LoggerPro version of the class a bit better than the building a physical apparatus version of the class. When we had to build something, it took so much time and gave me a lot of anxiety that I wasn't doing it correctly or why it wasn't working. The watching of videos was very easy to follow, especially since this class was one of the best organized classes in terms of the Media Library I have seen this entire semester. I think the final exam was very nerve wracking because of time and the nature of the experiment. Anything that has to do with balance is very precarious and ate up a lot of my time, so I would avoid having a final like that in the future. Also, I don't know if building in breaks or something would be helpful because sitting over zoom for 3 hours straight was really hard to do as the semester went on.",
                "I thought this course was great over Zoom.  It took less time because we didn't need to set everything up each week like we would have done had it been in person.  Our TA was very helpful as well.  Sometimes it was boring if group members were just muted and camera off the whole time.  Also, the practicum were not too fun to do in my dorm room.  I preferred watching the videos already prepared and doing the LoggerPro.",
                "Sending lab kits to students was one of the strengths of this course during the pandemic.",
                "The extra PLA that were assigned to supplement out of class learning were a waste of time and did little to increase my understanding of concepts",
                "I wish it was treated like a real lab because it really wasnt. I would have preferred like a worksheet format to make the information more digestible because it was hard to do online alone.",
                "As mentioned above, I certainly believe that things like the PLAs did not fulfill the purpose for which they were created in the first place, and instead made the course feel more draining and tiring. The WTF videos and assignments were also probably one of the most vague assignments I was ever assigned. I did not find them to contribute towards my learning experience in the course, and they sometimes felt like somewhat of a joke. If they were to be implemented again I would try to make the aim of the assignment much more clear to the students and try to deliver the WTF videos in such a way that make students search for specific mistakes rather than not knowing what to point to first in a video that feels completely wrong and chaotic.",
                "The virtual lab component was successful in my opinion but the post lab assignments were difficult to carry out at home even with the given materials. In the future, either eliminating this component or giving clear instructions instead of asking to develop an experiment would be better.",
                "The individually packaged kits sent to each student was really useful, though they sometimes arrived rather late",
                "They assigned too many additional things, especially considering covid and the virtual learning difficulties.",
                "I think that the professors adapted the labs very well and I was able to learn how to collect and analyze data.",
                "Other than what I said above about the PLA's, I thought everything else about the course was great!",
                "I really liked having the Sindeykits, but I think we could've had more guidance on how to use them early on in order to actively use them for the lab write-ups later. I do enjoy the small groups and working together live a lot!",
                "The adjustment of labs and limits on the number of PLAs that we did helped a lot. The kits that were distributed allowed for as much hands-on experience as possible for a virtual lab.",
                "The use of recorded lab videos and the effort required is appreciated, but they still cannot compare to in-person labs. If possible, students should probably wait until labs are in-person for a better experience.",
                "The professor was very accommodating and personally delivered\/shipped lab kits and other materials to students. The deadline for the practical exam was very flexible.",
                "I think doing more experimentation and less video watching would be great.",
                "Physics lab does not work over zoom",
                "Working in small groups to complete experiments was very helpful, as we were able to collaborate and work through challenging situations together. I think the post-lab assignments were also good, as they allowed us to build our own experiments and think of potential error\/uncertainty that came from our setup.",
                "Splitting the class into breakout rooms and having the TA circle between them to answer questions was nice in the end. At first it seemed like having the full section together would be best to hear more questions, but it felt more comfortable to reach out to other students when it was a smaller group, and then we could still ask the TA for clarifications when he joined our group. I also REALLY liked the PLA videos that Professor Cahn provided. Actually, all of his videos for the course were great! He made it very light-hearted and enjoyable for me, even if some of the jokes added an extra 5-10 seconds to the videos.",
                "Now that physical supplies have been distributed, I hope they are used more often, most students liked the lab where we did the experiment ourselves.",
                "During our lab days, the zoom meetings and breakout rooms worked. I did not learn additional information from doing the PLAs after the main lab.",
                "The lab group format helped, as well as being able to ask for TAs advice. It definitely was difficult to learn how to use LoggerPro without in person help.",
                "I thought the mailing of the lab kits was genius. Thank you.",
                "Halfway through the course, we started employing breakout rooms to increase engagement, which I really appreciated. It wouldve been nice if there were more student-to-student interaction because the breakout rooms were quite awkward at times."

                "It's not bad and has interactive components even in a virtual setting. I would not have taken it if I didn't have to but it wasn't bad.",
                "Yes! This class is so much fun!\/",
                "Yes! Best lab experience I've had at Yale.",
                "Yes. Pairs nicely with PHYS 180 to help illustrate concepts.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. I'm not familiar with the prerequisites for this class but I definitely think it can be taken with very limited prior knowledge of physics. Each lab provides a detailed background section that explains the concept, its derivations, and applications.",
                "Yes, if it is a required course.",
                "Much of the appeal of this course could be replicated by watching the course videos in a movie marathon format; the actual data analysis which formed the meat and bones of the course felt like busywork. I would only therefore reccomend this class to a highly quantitative-oriented student for whom the data is its own reward.",
                "I would only recommend this course if it is needed (e.g. for premed students).",
                "Sure! I loved the teaching team and the videos. Sometimes it would get a bit long to sit in the same place watching physics videos or doing lab calculations\/data recording for 3 hours. A shorter lab activity (max 2 hours) would be preferred.",
                "Yes, I feel like this class is extremely valuable and well-taught. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes, I think this is a great lab course. The instructors are really great and you learn a lot.",
                "Not unless you have to take it",
                "yes but chances are you have to take it anyways; professor cahn is who came to my zoom sessions and he was very willing and happy to help whenver anyone had a question.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in physics or premed.",
                "Yes. Well taught and I had a great TA",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in basic physics. I thought there was a lot of repetition with calculations and graphs and watching videos. But, I overall did learn some physics principles.",
                "Yes. If you need to take a physics lab for a major, or simply want to learn the basics of how an experiment is carried out, then I would say to take this class. It is not a rough workload at all and should fit nearly anywhere in your schedule.",
                "I would recommend this course. Overall, this lab is not too hard and also helps you see some concepts from the classroom setting applied in a real world setting.",
                "It was alright. Probably better in person",
                "This is a required lab for many students and overall it was a good course, it was just frustrating not having anything graded until months later which made it impossible to fix mistakes on future lab reports.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student, but like most lab courses, I would recommend it if someone needed it for a graduation requirement or for a pre-med requirement.",
                "If you need it",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The content is fun, and the team does a good job to keep you engaged and interested.",
                "Only if required.",
                "If you want to take it go for it. I liked the online format and believe it was a little less time intesive than the inperson format. If you need this class for a credit I would say take it as it is a fine class with some pretty cool topics and it not too hard.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in STEM and students taking a physics lecture because a lot of it will match up somewhere along the line.",
                "No. Do not take this course if you do not need it for a pre req. The labs are long and a waste of time",
                "Yes, if you have to take it!",
                "I would recommend this course! I was generally impressed by how well it went for a virtual lab. The content is interesting and clearly presented, and, though many people might take it for a requirement as I did, I found it fairly enjoyable.",
                "Yes, it's probably a requirement anyway!",
                "I would! It is a pretty simple but interesting lab that will help you solidify the concepts studied in an intro physics class.",
                "No, but if you have to it's not that bad. I didn't really feel as if I learned anything from this course, although some of the experiments did demonstrate the concepts we learned in class. Writing up the summary reports and PLAs was tedious. I appreciated the efforts that the teaching team made to make this course as interactive as possible, and I think it got a bit better towards the end. However, this is really a course that could be taught entirely asynchronously (at least for 3\/4 of the labs we had). This class isn't that challenging (perhaps maybe if your TA is strict) or intellectually stimulating, but it didn't feel like a good use of 0.5 credits at Yale or 3 hours every week.",
                "This person should take this class if they are taking Physics 170 or 180 and they are wanting to apply physics to the world.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who was required to take it.",
                "Yes, if this is a required course or if you enjoy physics lab experiments.",
                "its a requirement - gotta get it out of the way, and it's not so bad, just takes some time.",
                "Absolutely, this course has been brilliantly conceived by the professors and TAs to be suitable for our current situation.",
                "Yeah, it was well-taught, really liked my TA",
                "Yes",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. It was hard for me at first because I had almost no lab experience, but I improved a lot as time went on and feel much more well-prepared for future classes now. The expectations and assignments were clear, and there was no curving or competition, which made for a non-stressful experience and nice lab dynamic.",
                "You would likely only be taking this course if it was a requirement for your major. I would wait until we can have in-person lab if you can!",

                "Yes, such a great course!",
                "Recommend if it's for a major requirement for obvious reasons. If in person, this may be a fun course to take because the instructors are very passionate about it.  If virtual, it may be a difficult class to stay engaged in, though it is still interesting and is relatively relaxing, so it can still be a reward course.",
                "no but it is a necessary course for many students",
                "Not really, if you don't have to. There are moments of it being interesting but considering that it is one of those 0.5 credit courses that masquerades as a full credit course, I think time could be better spent learning other physics material.",
                "Yes, if you have to take this as part of a lab sequence then there is nothing negative about having to take this course, but I could not see it being taken for fun if it is not part of a required track.",
                "I would recommend the course to another student as it isn't too difficult, and has some interesting experiments. Would take it in person if I had the chance over online though.",
                "Yes, I think this was a great course!",
                "I would recommend the course if you want to explore basic physics content. The instructors are all very enthusiastic about what they teach, which makes the content seem more interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to apply many of the physics concepts that they have learned about.",
                "Yes, learned many vital aspects of physics",
                "No, it continues to amaze me how big a waste of time lab courses are at Yale. (Although I do not think this is Professor Cahn's fault)",
                "I would only recommend this course as a prerequisite or as a first lab course so that you can get the feeling for what labs are like. Otherwise, it won't teach you much new.",
                "Sure. It's not too difficult and the workload is not a lot in comparison to many of the other STEM labs.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because I feel as though it helps in learning the real life applications of physics.",
                "It is a fun course that allows you to see physics in action. I would recommend it.",
                "I would not recommend it if you don't have to take it for major or pre-med requirements.",
                "I would not recommend a solely virtual lab to others, because I feel the concepts would be much better and easier in an in person format, rather than having to improvise and set up experiments ourselves.",
                "Yes, the TA's were very helpful and faciliated learning.",
                "If you want a deeper understanding of physics concepts, then yes. The workload isn't bad.",
                "No, unless you have to take it (eg. Premed)",
                "Yes! Definitely take this course (though it's likely a requirement, if you're considering it). The course instructors were really thoughtful in making this work remotely, and the labs actually worked well remotely.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course because it really helped me better understand physics concepts, which helped me in PHYS 180. At the very least, consider the benefits of getting your own Sindey Kit stickers with our very own Professor Cahn on them. Consider the benefits of meeting Professor Cahn (and his wife if you pick up your Sindey Kit in New Haven), who is such a passionate professor about both physics and teaching.",
                "No, unless you need this lab for major requirements or have a fascination with significant figures and error analysis.",
                "If they need it for pre-med requirement.",
                "I think this is a great lab and anyone who is interested in gaining physics lab experiences should definitely take this course.",
                "Yes. This course is of much greater value than lecture at teaching basic physics both in lecture and lab format at once.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you need it. As someone who doesn't necessarily love physics, it is very well organized to help you learn and the instructors are very passionate about the subject and pushing you to think, and the workload isn't too crazy, it is just a lot to sit over zoom for 3 hours straight doing one procedure. If you like hands on physics to match the topics gone over in PHYS 180, I would recommend this course.",
                "Only if they have to take this or if they're super interested in physics.  It's a pretty basic lab course, but I have to take it for a requirement.",
                "Yes, you probably have to take it as a pre-requisite but it's an engaging course.",
                "Only take it if you have to (its a premed requirement)",
                "If you are taking this course chances are that you have to. One thing I would say is that you should not take this course if it is to be offered online  even though I hope that that will not be the case again. When it comes to the course itself, I think that the instructors are doing a very good job of first and foremost caring a lot for the students and for our learning within the course. All of the instructors are approachable and the care that they put into making this lab a reality during a semester like this is definitely laudable. Overall, I think I would have enjoyed the course if I was to take it during a year that it would not have happened online.",
                "Definitely a good course to accompany introductory physics",
                "I'd recommend it, but I'm not sure how the normal in-person lab would compare to the virtual lab. Honestly, I enjoyed the virtual lab, because we got to focus on the concepts and not fiddling with the setup. It was pretty cool seeing the data actually match the physical laws you talk about in lecture.\r\n\r\nAlso, Dr. Cahn is quite the character (I might say hilarious).",
                "Yes if you are pre-med. Not for fun though.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course because I learned how to use Logger Pro and set experiments up very well.",
                "Yes, if it is required by your major or track.",
                "Definitely, especially with Sidney.",
                "This course is a requirement for many majors, so there is not really an option. It was fun when we were not asked to do too much busy work. Virtual labs are tough though.",
                "Yes, its a good course.",
                "Absolutely. The passion that Dr. Cahn and the PHYS 165L team demonstrate towards the course, the material, and to helping students was a motivating force throughout the whole semester, even though the lab wasn't in person. The course structure, material, and everything else about it were designed to make it an enjoyable learning experience and I can't thank Dr. Cahn enough for making it that way. Among the best courses I've taken at Yale, and that's coming from someone who isn't the biggest fan of physics.",
                "If the labs were in-person, I definitely think I would have enjoyed the class more. That said, some of the lab reports felt tedious and I didn't learn much from them. I would only take this course if you need the credit for a pre-req or distributional requirement.",
                "Yes, this is a fun class!",
                "Yes! It's a pretty fun lab.",
                "Not over zoom",
                "I would recommend this course to a student needing a physics lab. This course is pretty chill and I did not ever really feel overwhelmed by any of the work given to me. The expectations are clear and the grading is pretty fair as well. It is definitely nowhere near as stressful as introductory labs in chemistry, so I highly recommend this lab to anyone starting out in physics for the first time.",
                "Yes. I was taking 5.5 credits this semester and only took the E&M portion of physics last year, so I wanted a fundamental review of mechanics ideas from AP without too much stress of completely new material. I thought this course was very accessible, as the lab packets all were very self-contained (I didn't need to look anything up outside of the provided material in order to complete the lab\/questions). The instructions were very clear, my TA was always willing to answer questions and seemed to grade nicely as long as I put in the effort to complete each lab, and the post-lab \"what's the flaw\" videos were comical and not too difficult to complete (though still provided me a nice review of the material from the lab and some interesting questions to consider). It was really tough for me on the first week to complete the full three hours sitting at my desk, but it got a lot better and faster as the semester went on. I originally wanted to take 205L to learn more about different instruments and have a potentially \"deeper\" understanding of these ideas in case I decide to major in physics, but honestly I am very happy that I took 165L this semester as I still feel that I learned a lot, and the people\/professors\/TAs I met were all really nice!",
                "Not if you do not HAVE to.",
                "I believe the in-person equivalent of this lab would be a solid introductory physics lab to take.",
                "I believe I would recommend an in-person version of this course.",
                "Yes, the teaching staff was excellent and the series of labs were very engaging and educational",
                "It's a requirement :(",
                "I would because you have to take it for my major. I would say I would recommend it for the personnel. They were very helpful in the production of the labs.",
                "Youre probably only reading this if you have to take the course, so take it."
