    "This is my second course with Prof. Casson after having taken MATH 250. I found Prof. Casson's lectures very well-organized and clear. Prof. Casson's proofs were better than the book. An element that I really appreciate about Prof. Casson's lectures and that found in few math courses is the consistency with which we advance through topics. I never felt that Prof. Casson's lectures were rushed and this helped me immensely in understanding the proofs. Prof. Casson would emphasize the important steps of the proofs and would always address questions in class and in office hours. I found this course very well-structured and clear. Prof. Casson is very meticulous about writing the right statements on the board and he will not move on to the next statement without making sure the current one is correct. I found this degree of carefulness very helpful in analysis.",

    "A more rigorous understanding of the foundations of calculus, and a good introduction to metric spaces.",
    "I learned a bit about how difficult proof writing can be.",
    "I learned the basics of analysis and practiced proofs",
    "I was able to develop a lot of skills in proof based math in this class. The material really challenges you to understand concepts at a deep level.",
    "I greatly improved my understanding of delta epsilon proofs, and I think I got better in general at figuring out how to prove things. I also learned about the different types continuity and convergence. However, mostly all of this knowledge came from the textbook, not from in class.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The greatest strength of this course was that it was taught by Prof. Casson. I found him very clear, careful in the statements he would write on the board and helpful in answering homework questions in office hours. I also took MATH 250 with Prof. Casson. I found the material in MATH 300 clearer to understand. The class moved at a good pace.",
    "I actually really loved this course -- Casson is an institution onto himself in the Math department, and his notes and lectures are immensely clear. The homework is well-assigned, takes an appropriate amount of time, and the intellectual challenge is good. I do wish the grading made the final a little less high stakes, but that's the nature of many STEM courses.",
    "Lectures are all proofs from the book, which is a weakness and strength - the proofs in the book necessarily needed to be explained, but some more examples of applying the theorems we proved (like we do on tests) would be helpful. However, understanding proofs of theorems from the book in itself also gives intuition for applying them, so it was not a strong negative aspect.",
    "Strengths: Material presented in the class! The material was super interesting -- enough for me to consider changing to a pure math major. \r\nWeaknesses: Disparity in feedback. Grading on the problem sets was incredibly lenient; grading on the exams less so (I think Casson literally gave an F to someone on the second midterm). There were no answer keys provided either so it meant studying for the final and midterms nigh impossible -- especially because the class gave incredibly challenging proofs on examinations (significantly harder than anything we had to do on the homeworks).",
    "Strengths- material is very important in math.\r\nWeaknesses- probably THE worst class I have ever taken at Yale. The material is so dry and presented in a manner which makes you want to pay attention even less. The professor basically just talks at your face and doesn't care whether or not students understand the material he NEVER once stopped and asked students whether they had questions. We don't learn anything in class that isn't in the textbook, so if you don't understand the textbook you won't understand the lecture. We never went through practice examples\/proofs. THERE ARE NO PSET SOLUTIONS AFTER THEY ARE DUE, NO PRACTICE MIDTERM\/FINAL SOLUTIONS AND NO MIDTERM SOLUTIONS. This makes it impossible to learn from your mistakes if you don't know how the problems are actually solved. You could go to office hours, but the professor just reiterates everything he said in class- so if you didn't understand in class, you won't understand in office hours either. TA was helpful but hours were inconvenient. So what are you supposed to do when the professor, the textbook and the TA aren't helpful? Well you just don't understand anything which makes the class suck even more.",
    "No real weaknesses. Would be helpful to get some suggested solutions to the problem sets, but it would definitely be helpful to have solutions to the practice exams.",
    "The final was absurdly difficult",
    "It is a little dry. Hard to tell if this is he Professor or the material.",
    "Prof Casson is crystal clear and has a charming British accent. I wish we covered a bit more topics though",
    "Lectures were uninspiring and since he followed the book so closely I stopped going, and it was clear that many other students did as well. However, when you teach so close to the book that kids don't go, and then throw in some random things that aren't in the book just to mess with people, it is not appreciated. If you want kids to come to lecture, don't waste their time by just writing down the book verbatim on the blackboard.",
    "The book is ancient, yet costs over $200.",
    "This course is very difficult with a lot of work, but Professor Casson (who is unfortunately retiring) is a fantastic teacher. Also, you would think that an analysis class wouldn't be very applicable to real life, but a lot of what you learn is directly used in other mathematics and economics courses.",
    "Perfect.  Esp. because of Casson.  VERY sad to see him go.",
    "The syllabus could be expanded to include more real analysis, such as more content about Banach spaces\/ Hilbert spaces etc.",
    "Strengths: very straightfowards, easy to understand.\r\nCons: I would have liked more motivating intuition.",
    "Overall, the course was great. Lecture was detailed and problem sets usually had a good balance of difficulty.",
    "The strengths are that it provides a foundation of understanding for basically all of math, by covering proofs of the most fundamental aspects of math, like continuity, differentiation, and integration. However, the weaknesses GREATLY outweigh the strengths. The material itself is so dry and boring, and the professor does nothing to make it interesting, so it is extremely difficult not to want to fall asleep. Lecture consists solely of the professor putting a definition or theorem on the board, writing a proof for it, saying it out loud, and repeating that process about 5-10 more times. He NEVER stops to ask us if we have any questions, NEVER checks for understanding, and RARELY gives examples as to how the information is actually useful or even usable in a problem. He NEVER posts any solutions for problem sets after they are due, or for any practice exams, or for the actual midterms, so there is no way to learn from your mistakes. His office hours are unhelpful because he just repeats what he says in class, and the textbook is also exactly what he says his class, so forget about those options for getting help. There is a peer tutor who can be helpful, but the hours are very sparse and inconvenient, and they are not allowed to meet outside of their office hours, which is very unfortunate. This class definitely needs HUGE reform if the math department wants to stop scaring people away from the math major.",
    "The course is extremely we'll run thanks to Prof Casson. Perhaps there should be more peet tutor help hours. Borys was wonderful, I would have liked to have sessions with him thrice a week.",
    "great course",
    "strengths: don't have to go to lecture if you are reading the textbook closely\r\nweaknesses: book problems can sometimes be inaccessible without having a group, no solutions.",
    "The grade distribution for the class is harsh, but made clear from the beginning. The lectures were very clear and helpful.",
    "I am really surprised that especially for a large math class there are very few resources available. There is only one ULA and no TAs. This course would greatly benefit from having more resources, especially since it is a course people tend to struggle with especially in the beginning of the semester.",
    "Very structured and good amount of practice. Could use more proof writing practice in the beginning and clearer comments on homework grading."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student if it is taught by Prof. Casson. His strengths are clarity and a steady pace. I do not remember Prof. Casson skipping any theorems and he always took the necessary time to write out and explain the proofs of the most important theorems. Even for theorems that were not proved in class, Prof. Casson would always write the page on the book were the proof was found. The fact that Prof. Casson moved at a steady pace really helped me understand, because I have also taken courses were the pace was faster and I was using office hours to discuss things mentioned in class, whereas in MATH 300 I went to office hours to discuss the ways I had attempted to solve problems, but which had not worked. By moving at a steady pace, Prof. Casson helped us a lot understand the material and solve the problems.",
    "If you've done Math 250 or Math 225, or if you're confident in your math ability and \/ or your ability to put time into understanding the concepts developed, then it's a great introduction into what mathematics is like at higher levels.",
    "Yeah - this or MATH 244 would be a great first proof class. The proofs really are intuitive when you follow them.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student -- especially one  that is on the cusp of wanting to major in Math. I think it is a good taste of what upper level math looks like and is an excellent primer on proof-writing and analytical (in both senses of the word) thinking!",
    "10\/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!! So bad all the other evaluations are a lie. Math 250 is 10 billion times easier than this. Don't be fooled. Make sure you know what you're getting into if you want to take this class.",
    "This course kicked my ass. But it's also one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Casson's lecture is excellent. Though he destroyed the class on the final, he usually curves so we'll see I guess lol. I came into the class with only Math 120 and 222, and I needed to work hard but did not feel behind.",
    "Great class, but lots of work",
    "If you have to take it, you know you do.",
    "YES",
    "If you have to take it, its probably a better introduction than just jumping into 305. Also I highly recommend taking this before 250 as the material is logically prior and IMO it is actually easier and will help you be better at 250.",
    "No; only as a requirement should you take this course.",
    "Really hard course. Take it because you have to or CR\/D\/F it.",
    "YES.  Not only is it required for a bunch of different majors; it is a necessary step to move from formulaic math into proof-based math.  Wonderful wonderful course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, especially given the not-so-great reputation the other real analysis class seems to have.",
    "This is a solid, fairly easy class. It's good to learn the basics of analysis to be able to take the more advanced courses in the sequence with confidence.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone planning on focusing on math.",
    "There is NO student who I would recommend this class to, at least not in its current state. You do not feel like you have learnt anything by the end, your GPA suffers tremendously, and you waste a ton of time on the psets and studying, all for naught.",
    "Yes. This is a great course to get introduction to Analysis mostly thanks to Prof Casson.",
    "Yes if interested in math of any sort",
    "Would recommend for someone who is already good at math and enjoys proofs. Not a place to become good at math. Not a place to hate proofs.",
    "This is a great course if you want to strengthen your mathematical thinking skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I think it is essential if you're doing almost anything in STEM. I repeatedly saw concepts from this course pop up in my stats and differential equations classes. I feel like my understanding grew exponentially in this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has moderate comfort with proofs and wants to gain an introductory survey to real analysis."
