    "Helped improve my chinese speaking abilities and learned about Chinese culture",
    "With the sheer amount of vocabulary required to learn for each of the 6 units this semester, I amassed an enormous new lexicon from which to formulate my sentences. We focused a lot on more formal speaking and writing and differentiating between formal and informal language uses, so I definitely learned more properly how to do that. I feel much more confident in writing essays with fewer grammatical errors as well, and I can speak on a lot more topics than I thought I could.",
    "I broadened my vocabulary in Chinese, and had the opportunity to learn new phrase structures and idioms.",
    "Developed my Chinese skills better.",
    "I learned a great deal of Chinese vocabulary and grammar patterns, which allowed me to significantly improve my essay writing and oral presentations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Regular feedback and work aimed specifically at building necessary skills; too much reliance on Quizlet(NO MORE QUIZLET PLEASE!!!!); online homework is not as good as written homework. I miss writing characters. \r\nWeakness: Lack of information concerning overall grade throughout term",
    "More of an emphasis on speaking",
    "Strengths: the professors are absolutely amazing. Liang Laoshi genuinely cared about all of her students, asked us questions about our lives, and really got to know me in her office hours. She even offered to be my adviser already and I'm only in my first semester at Yale! They're sweet, kind, and very generous when it comes to grading, almost to a ridiculous extent. The class is also very well organized and follows the structure down to a T with no room for adjustment.\r\nWeaknesses: because the structure is so rigid, there is no leeway for anything that Liang Laoshi may have wanted to expand on. We have to keep moving and follow Zhou Laoshi's schedule or we'll fall behind. It felt like we were just regurgitating the textbook as well, and the only times we really got to put the language into practice was when we did our independent presentations. HOWEVER, be aware that you'll have to speak about things like whether illegal immigrants should be deported or what your opinion is on the necessity of marriage, which I just think are really odd questions - like what's the point of answering \"would you divorce your spouse after the first time they hit you\" or \"do you agree with same sex marriage?\" Unless you're expecting a visceral reaction from your students, I suggest the teaching staff refrain from such weird questions.\r\nThe tests were also not very conducive to learning. We just spit back out what we were taught in a formulaic pattern. Match the words to the sentences already in the worksheets and convert the informal to formal from sentences we already know. Nothing new here, and no test of actual knowledge.",
    "The professor was always knowledgeable and well-prepared to discuss and explain the material. The course was very well organized and instructions were clear. One weakness is that the students were tested on their writing ability, but homework and quizlets were submitted online, leaving many students out of writing practice when it came time to take the in-class written exams.",
    "Strengths: kind teacher, easy to follow class materials, generally chill, study guides are REALLY helpful for the tests\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of characters to learn, really high grading curve (95=A-), tons of quizlet sets",
    "Strengths: Great teacher, interesting content, room for freer conversations during class\r\n\r\nWeakness: Quizlet homeworks are kind of annoying",
    "While this course was quite effective at teaching language content, its modus operandi was mostly rote memorization and repetition of the lesson text in class. I sometimes found this format frustrating and difficult to stay engaged with."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is a good course for improving Chinese.",
    "Yes but wont improve chinese that much",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The topics are absolutely fascinating: online dating, name brand fever (could do without this one if we're being honest), TV dramas, the miracle of the city of Yiwu (which ended up being a way to learn vocab on introducing our hometowns and talking about industrialization and mechanization of labor), floating population (illegal and legal immigration, why people leave their countries, etc.), and the changing views of marriage in China (which contrary to popular belief, is not about homosexuality, but rather on modern concubinage or \"kept women\"). The textbook is very easy to follow and Liang Laoshi's powerpoints were great for going through the material.\r\nQuizzes are soooooooooo easy and so are the tests. Grading is soooooo laid-back and relaxed. They just want you to really learn the language and have fun, and I mean, if you're taking L5 second year, then you're in the class for more than just fulfilling a requirement (at least I hope). We had grad students, and Eli Whitney student, and students of all grade levels in my class, so you really do get a breadth of levels and viewpoints on the variety of topics. The professors are supportive and the material is definitely doable.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in improving their Chinese.",
    "If you love Chinese and have the time for it, yes. It's a pretty chill class, Liang Laoshi is awesome, it's just a lot of characters to memorize.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, if improving their Chinese was their top priority (over, say, taking a really eye-opening seminar)."
