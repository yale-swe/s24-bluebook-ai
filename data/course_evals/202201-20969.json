                "I learned about lottocratic legislatures, referenda and town meetings and how to apply participatory democracy in places like the workplace",
                "This course gave me a foundation for thinking about the future of a more small-r representative American democracy. It taught me the basics of understanding different forms of participatory democracy such as lottocratic councils, referendums, and town hall meeting.",
                "This course focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of democracy and our understanding of democracy in the modern world. It challenged me to think beyond the scope of representative democracy. Through this, I got to explore the history and theory behind participatory democracy, why it has not been used extensively in practice, and examples of it in the modern world.",
                "A deeper understanding of participatory forms of government. Emphasis less in deliberation and more on lottery.",
                "Professor Fairdosi's seminar represented my first bona fide taste for political theory. I came in cold (if not a bit intimidated) and left with a vision for a brighter American democracy. This course challenged me to think about innovative theories of representation, demanded that I interrogate my previously held suppositions about the nation's democratic systems, and afforded me the ability and vocabulary to chart a course ahead.",
                "In this course, managing a heavy reading low each week is essential. Every piece contains valuable insights that can be missed if not enough attention is paid.",
                "This course taught us how to critically think about the political system we have now; representative democracy is all we know but it is not the only option! I learned a lot about participatory democratic theory and how to read these works closely and thoughtfully. Professor Fairdosi does an incredible job of breaking down the readings and sparking meaningful conversation."

                "Professor Fairdosi is an awesome professor, and in my opinion he is one of the greatest strengths of the course. There is not much I can honestly say here about things to improve. I think this course will be interesting to someone who is already interested in \/ wants to know more about democratic theory. The discussion based format of the course is a huge compliment to the readings, and I think it is the main strength of the course.",
                "Strengths: low key environment that still is engaging\r\nWeaknesses: Not a lot of guidance on the final paper.",
                "The course is built on mutual participation and enthusiasm, and thus demands a lot of students. I was lucky that my peers were eager to engage and thoughtful in their commentary. Be advised that the final paper errs on the longer side, though is a rewarding capstone to the semester's theoretical debate.",
                "Each theme of the course was connected to the overall exploration of what participatory democracy is. Though we had more questions than answers at the beginning of the course, the second half of the course provided interesting avenues to answer those questions. The main suggestion for improving the course could be to suggest students to also interact with the questions posted on Canvas because we could not always discuss every proposed discussion questions due to deep, thoughtful seminar discussions.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fairdosi! He is incredibly passionate, dedicated, and knowledgeable about the topics we studied. He is an outstanding professor!\r\nWeakness: Not a whole lot of weakness; I really enjoyed this class and it was one of my favorites so far at Yale! I looked forward to every class meeting. If anything maybe in the future the course could touch on more real world examples \/ potentials for real world applications."

I think this course is about a somewhat niche topic within political science, and I dont believe that everyone will find it interesting. The longer form final essay requirement is a very large assignment, and I think that successfully completing it requires a genuine interest in the subject matter.",
                "Yes! Manageable workload, interesting content, and a wonderful professor. Add it to your worksheet now!",
                "If you are a Political Science major interested in American democracy, this is a fantastic course to take. You will question your own assumptions of what democracy is and should be, and you will explore alternatives that make American democracy more accessible to the people.",
                "Yes absolutely! Professor Fairdosi is a gem. He is an incredible person which translates into him being an outstanding professor. I truly enjoyed learning from him. The class was interesting, yet manageable and one of my favorites thus far at Yale."
