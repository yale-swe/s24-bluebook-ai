                "The course is taught well and enthusiastically by Rafail and Professor Johnston. The course does not assume any knowledge on the Roman empire by students but can become hard to understand or grasp without prior knowledge of the era.",
                "The course is well organized, and the professor and the TA are both accessible and eager to help students. The professor's thoughtful individualized feedback on each assignment allows students to gauge their progress in the course.",
                "The course did not go over enough actual Roman history\r\n\r\nI was interested in learning more about it, and yes I did, but there was a big gap in knowledge since we would jump into reading Edward Gibbon and assessing his writing and the events of the Roman Empire he wrote about,  while I would be lost on names of random emperors and events.\r\n\r\n+ kinda lack of accessibility since some students knew a lot about classics and Roman history, they led the class a lot, which was interesting to hear but sometimes a bit confusing. Coming from a disadvantaged public high school where I didnt read classics and etc. i felt a bit discouraged when not understanding what they were talking about or referencing, and I dont think I was alone in that.\r\n\r\nClass couldve been more personal as well. Great, sweet Professor, and same with the TA. However the class wasnt very close, we kinda just came, discussed a bit, then left. Couldve been a better facilitated discussion. \r\nCouldve left even more knowledge if there was a breakdown of the history alongside every seminar.",
                "The course was outstanding overall! The readings were fascinating and meaningful, the discussions were engaging and enlightening, and Professor Johnston is an incredible teacher. Towards the end of the course, students seemed less interested in the material, which may be explained by a less discussion-based learning system that we approached near the closure of the course. Despite this minor detail, I'm very impressed and thrilled that I took this course.",
                "Strengths: Outstanding Professor, great syllabus \r\nWeaknesses: Could have used more discussion at times  occasionally would become slightly too lectury",
                "Strengths:\r\n-Seminar format, the discussions were excellent, and really well guided by Professor Johnston. He gave a large amount of freedom in the discussion paths, but also contributed a lot of wisdom to the discussion\r\n-Writing, Professor Johnston and Rafail gave in depth feedback to our responses, which really helped me to further develop my ideas and reasonings for arguments.\r\n-Gibbon's Decline and Fall was a perfect text for analysis. Its length makes it appropriate for a full-term course (and we still read the abridged version), but it also covers such a vast range of events that it never becomes dull. Gibbon is insightful, witty, and deep on every single page. You could easily fill several discussions with every section of Gibbon that we read.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Diversity: the classics is more of a male dominated space. I don't like looking at things racially either, since that can become problematic, but it is also a very white/asian dominated space as well. This class was all men, it would have been nice to have some women. I know there are several prominent women in the classics space (Mary Beard comes to mind), so perhaps there may be growing interest from women in the area.  I liked how we discussed in the course about how Gibbon showed prejudice with \"Orientalism\" (i.e. looking at Near-Eastern peoples as languid and decadent), and \"Barbarianism\" (looking at Northern European/Hunnic/Slavic peoples as savage), and also how Tacitus's Germania helped prop up the Nazi regime's claim to certain territories, and the idea of the Aryan race. I think it was fascinating to learn how the Classics can be both beneficial to society, allowing the continuation of literary traditions, and learning from the mistakes of our ancestors, but also how it can be abused to prop up nationalistic ideologies (this is not just European, Japan and China come to mind for empires that used the classics to provide cassi belli for expansion); which makes it important for the people of the classics to maintain the \"beneficial\" form. I don't think the lack of women detracted from the course, it was excellent, but their presence may have added several more insightful ideas.",
                "Extremely well taught course, no weaknesses",
                "It was a great course. The only improvement would be making it more than explicitly clear the nature of taking a course over 1 book."

Gibbon was such a charm to read, and every page of his is vibrant and overflowing with wit and character. The critical analysis of Gibbon is key; we learn not just about Roman history, but also how Gibbon's views shaped that history. We spent a lot of time discovering Gibbon's motives and biases, including reading his autobiography, and supplementary texts on Gibbon. These texts (Momigliano, Lieberman, and Woodhuysen especially), really illuminated who Gibbon was, and added a lot more depth to the reading of the Decline and Fall.",
