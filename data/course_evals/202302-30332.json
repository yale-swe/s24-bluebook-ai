                "I found that the overall experience fell short of my expectations. While I was eager to learn various painting techniques and methods, the professor's approach to teaching left much to be desired.\r\n\r\nOne of the main concerns I had was the lack of emphasis on teaching fundamental painting techniques. Throughout the course, there was a notable absence of in-depth instruction on how to handle different brushes, blend colors effectively, or use various brush strokes to create different textures. This absence hindered my ability to fully grasp the technical aspects of painting, which I believe are essential for any aspiring artist.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the professor seemed to primarily focus on color theory, leaving little room for other crucial aspects of painting. While understanding colors is undoubtedly important, it should not have been the sole focus of the entire course. I had hoped for a more well-rounded curriculum that would delve into composition, perspective, and other elements that contribute to creating compelling artwork.",
                "I thought it was a great course! I loved the way it was taught and thought the profs did a great job of explaining and teaching by example. I definitely learned a lot!",
                "Strengths: the intro to color theory beyond just the color wheel, the feedback given during the painting process, the relaxed and supportive atmosphere, the creative freedom, the end of project critiques. The final, collective still life was also really fun. I liked that it wasn't your typical still life set up. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more feedback throughout the painting process and some basic technique instruction.",
                "I would have loved for the program to be a full blown intensive program like the Yale Summer Acting Program with 4-5 classes on different aspects of painting."
