                "The strength of the class is definitely Dr. Levchenko. I think it's clear how much effort he put into making this class so great. One of the weaknesses is that certainly not all of the speakers were engaging so that classes were sometimes boring to attend. I know that's part of the game though. I also think the final proposal was incredibly and unnecessarily long. I also think much of the beginning of the year felt a little slow. There was a whole presentation on how to create a powerpoint presentation and how to present and I feel like that is a bit out of touch for a group of people who are seniors.",
                "if you dont want to go into a field relating to biomedical engineering, this course is a waste of time",
                "Meeting twice a week all the way up in Watson for a half credit was not great. The professor wasnt engaging, and the material was quite dull. Some of the speakers were very interesting, however, and I hope they continue to come speak to the students. If classes were more discussion-based than lecture-based, I think students would get more out of it- even if it is just getting to know their peers.",
                "I don't know how useful this course is to BME seniors. The course was very centered on entrepreneurial efforts and the possibilities of a start-up for new devices\/concepts. However, more often than not, undergraduate seniors aren't going to follow that path. There may be one that is considering that option, but not everybody. Forcing everyone to work on projects related to that won't help in determining the right future career path. Therefore, increasing options of study (i.e., talks on graduate school, medical school, industry work, work options outside of BME) during this seminar would be more beneficial to those not considering the entrepreneurial route. The course is also a half credit, but it meets twice a week for 1 hr 15 min at a time. If it's only going to be a half credit, then one meeting a week should be sufficient, like the sophomore seminar (BENG 280).",
                "Strengths: low stress, low workload, super amazing professor!\r\nWeaknesses: Assignments felt very repetitive. Could have been way more interactive (like viewing labs, touring facilities, watching surgery etc.). Sometimes lectures were dry.",
                "I enjoyed the guest lecturers a lot and wish that there had a been a few more. I also enjoyed the first presentation project. I think group work is especially important to help us get to know each other more if we have not met yet. I think the course could be improved if it felt more personalizedif the professor or TA sat down with the students in small groups at the start of the semester to discuss their thoughts about BME at Yale thus far and their career goals to help us feel like someone is actually keeping up with us. I think many students still do not know what they are doing after graduation whether they even know what they are interested in. It would be helpful to know that there are BME faculty keeping tabs with us and connecting us with the people we need especially if this course is to help us achieve those goals. Might be helpful to outline those goals to start with...",
                "The speakers and course work was more skewed toward entrepreneurship but I was hoping that a wider array of future opportunities would have been covered.",
                "Strengths: speakers are amazing (just wish more were in person); the projects are also straightforward and helpful to the future (for someone who might be for example, going into research)\r\nWeaknesses: The projects (proposals) could have clearer guidelines.",
                "Really appreciated that this course brought in all the guest lectures to help us envision ourselves in the field! However the commitment to this class doesnt justify the 0.5 credit",
                "This course could be much better. The speakers were great and should be kept in the curriculum. The weeks spent going over how to give a good presentation or write a good proposal should be scrapped or moved to the sophomore seminar. At this point in senior year in the BME major, we should all have a good understanding of those skills. I think using those weeks to go see cool labs or go watch a surgery or other hands-on activities would be far more valuable and interesting for the students.",
                "Strength: Really great guest lecturers!!\r\nWeaknesses: Regular lectures weren't intellectually engaging.",
                "Strengths: definitely the guest speakers. They gave good advice on the different career paths one could choose after receiving a BME degree.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: half credit course that met two times a week. on days without guest speakers, quality of instruction was not great, engagement motivation was very low despite required participation grades via atendance."
