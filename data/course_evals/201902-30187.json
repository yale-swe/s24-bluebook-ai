    "Strengths- organization \r\nWeaknesses- n\/a",
    "Very well taught! We were given many examples to support the information as well.",
    "Quizzes were nice to make sure I was paying attention and understood the material correctly. Using the discussion section questions as review material for the exams was very much appreciated. Thank you. I only wish that the instructors were more clear about what the correct answers to the discussion questions were exactly because the answers that other students gave were only partly accurate at times so it was difficult to tell what a complete answer should be.",
    "To start, it's hard to say that this course has any weaknesses. PSYC 179 is so well organized for student learning during the summer. The list of discussion questions distributed before each class allows us to have fruitful discussions during our short meeting times and to think about things we don't understand in advance, so that we don't waste time asking dumb questions. Prof. Ahn and the TA were great discussion leaders, and challenged us in class to make sure we really knew the concepts, rather than just testing for superficial understanding. The course is designed in such a way that it is very clear how to do well (prepare using quizzes and discussion questions) and if students want to go beyond the material of the course, Prof. Ahn and the TA always open themselves to helping students do that.",
    "The strength of the course is definitely the content of the course. I did not experience any weaknesses in the course as far as I am concerned, and I enjoyed the course very much."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, overall a very good course, would predict fall\/spring term would be better than summer",
    "Yes!! It's a great course and not too strenuous (if you manage your time well).",
    "Yes. It's a very straightforward course, and the professor is very fair.",
    "Absolutely. It's very clear how to do well in the course. If you put in the effort to do the quizzes, participate in class, and study for exams, you will get a high grade. The material is also incredibly interesting; it's basically an intro to decision making class, with some additional concepts that are relevant and interesting too. I'd recommend taking it over the summer instead of during the year because it's much easier to do well during the summer and engage with the concepts (given the discussion section format as opposed to lecture format) than it is during the year, when it's a lecture format.",
    "I would! My summer was so enriching thanks to the course."
