                "This class was extremely insightful to me in that I wanted to enhance the quality of my research by implementing mixed methods approach. However, I was unsure of how to do this. This course gave me the proper guidance on how to integrate quantitative and qualitative research to form a cohesive scholarly argument. This was also the first graduate course I took as an undergraduate, and it was a phenomenal experience.",

                "Strengths: very in depth on the theory of mixed methods, useful case studies, high student participation. Weaknesses: feels abstract the first few weeks",
                "For certain, one strength of the course was the class discussion. Both the professor and the TA were extremely adept at facilitating differing perspectives and frameworks in class discussion, and I feel that the class time was very well spent. Furthermore, I appreciated that there were a variety of literatures that we could read and learn from. The plethora of mixed methods research examples helped me with my own research project. There is one recommendation I have for improvement, which has already been mentioned in my mid-term feedback report. The first is that I think there should be a 'weekly' assignment due, whether it be a reflection on the readings, or some other form of work.",
                "I think that the student facilitations could be reworked in a way that encouraged more engagement among the class and felt more like a discussion rather than presentations on readings that the class has already read. Also, having more applied readings at the beginning of the course would prove to be useful."

                "Yes! Prof Mousa is helpful in office hours and a great resource. Just be mindful of the many readings for each week",
                "Absolutely! The course was extremely helpful to me as an aspiring political science researcher, but I feel that the course would be an excellent introduction to mixed methods research for a researcher in any field. I really enjoyed that I was able to focus on doing a research project that was tailored to my interests and passions, and was given the space to work through ideas and thoughts with professional academic guidance.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. The class provided a great way to learn more about mixed methods that are not really found in other courses, and the focus on a mixed methods research design is very useful for future research projects."
