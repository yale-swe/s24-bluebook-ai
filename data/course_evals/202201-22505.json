                "We learned about a number of views from philosophers and other writers about how poetry and the humanities might be valuable to individuals and to society. A lot of this discussion revolved around education, so we also read a number of more modern accounts about how our current education system  came to be, including debates about what gets included in the humanities curriculum. Ultimately, I think this class gave me a better sense for how the humanities represent a valuable tool for moral and philosophical instruction, rather than solely being a form of entertainment for people. We also read some poetry which was a lot of fun.",
                "I learned a lot about the subject matter of the class  The value of arts and humanities  But I also learned a lot about how to read and sit with difficult texts, how to write complex argument based on those texts, and how to actively participate in small group discussion."

                "Strengths: lots of interesting readings, small class size meant that it was easy to participate in discussions, Professor Berger always had comments that made the readings make more sense. Weaknesses: sometimes, I felt like discussions didn't really reach a satisfying conlusion (much of this is just the nature of discussions in general) and that directing comments at each other rather than Professor Berger would have created a better flow. I think it would have helped to have more people and thus more ideas in the class.",
                "Overall, I thought this class was great strong. It was exactly as advertised: a high-level English seminar. There are two areas I think could be improved. First, I know that this is a senior English class, but I think the amount of reading was still unrealistic. To be honest I dont think most of the people in the class completed the reading, and had less just better signed, the discussions couldve been more substantive. First, I know that this is a senior English class, but I think the amount of reading was still unrealistic. To be honest, I dont think most of the people in the class (if anyone) completed the reading, and had less just better signed, the discussions couldve been more substantive. I also wouldve appreciated more structure on the essays. Theres a lot of value in having open ended assignments, but having no prompt or specific guidance meant it was hard to know what the professor was looking for and what we were being graded on."

You will read a lot of interesting stuff and have the opportunity to discuss it at length. However, the discussions can be a little slow if it is as small as it was this year (5 students total).",
                "The course is pretty niche, but for student interested in the subject matter, I would definitely recommend this course. I think it fosters a lot of intellectual growth, despite the assignments not necessarily being so well defined."
