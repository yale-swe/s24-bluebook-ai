                "Many of the concepts covered in the long, strenuous lectures were never seen again. I would prefer it if the meat of the course was stuck to, tested on, and large key concepts that are applicable to everyday life were hammered in well.",
                "Great material, however the course is very poorly organized and the instructor needs significant improvement in explaining and instructing in class.",
                "Am I just stupid? This is the question that crossed my mind a lot when in this class. I have some background in ECON and I had to take this class as a graduation requirement. I thought hmm probably more efficient to take in the summer. I was very wrong. The professor was very kind and all the TAs were thoughtful HOWEVER the material was harder than it should have been. The professor didnt change his notes and material from his graduate course material on game theory. Thus this made the course unnecessarily complex in the explanation. You may be thinking, isnt this just you? While I may not be an Econ major, I have an incredibly strong background in maths and statistics. This class was much more complex than it should have been.",
                "Strengths: Super generous grading on problem sets (complete\/incomplete), practice exams were pretty good preparation for exams, notes were quite useful.\r\nImprovements: Lectures could be more engagingsplitting up two big lectures into three smaller lectures would be great. Also, problem sets are not exactly representative of exams (but are generously graded).",
                "IT's good. The final is somehow difficult than the sample",
                "The lectures were very interesting and engaging. I wish that we had more exercises to practice on and not just theoretical questions in the PSETs.",
                "Strengths: interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: the professor's English is not very good, so sometimes it's hard to follow what he is trying to say",
                "The pacing of the lectures were generally pretty slow, so I didn't attend them. The notes were somewhat poorly written at times so I ended up needing to search and learn many of the topics on my own. The homeworks were only checked for completion, which meant that we received no feedback other than the midterm and final, each of which represented a substantial portion of our grade. The scenarios and problems were generally pretty interesting, so that part was a positive.",
                "The course gives us an overview of game theory and introduces several vital models and theorems in eight lessons. However, I think more classical models and more information about Bayesian Games can be covered if the course is extended to 10 lessons or more.",
                "I feel playing videos is not so suitable for an online course, since the soundtrack is often not in sync with the picture. (I believe this was not caused by network problems because the other part of the class was just fine and the same problem occurs in other online classes.)",
                "it's too lecture-y, but i think that has to do with the online format and the fact that it's 3 hours makes it very difficult to absorb things by the end.",
                "As there was alot of material to go over, we didn't get the opportunity to interact with our peers or professor. Maybe next time, the number of hours alloted for this session can be increased to accommodate such considerations. Also, the homework questions we received, in my opinion were very difficult, and not being able to answer them left me demotivated and agitated at times. Even the final examination was considerably more difficult than the sample exam paper we were provided as reference.\r\nHaving said that, however, the professor's classes were very interesting and the notes he provided were especially useful.",
                "strengths:the teacher's illastration is clear.\r\nweaknesses:the questions for practice are lack and too hard",
                "The exercise questions were hard for me. Even though, they were sometimes  solved by the TAs, I hoped we could have more explanation text solution.",
                "Strength: good lecture notes; interesting psets. Weaknesses: too rushed and many topics were not covered in enough depth.",
                "I think the course was well structured and went at a very good pace. Remote learning was very well supported and there was plenty of room\/time for questions office hours etc.",
                "I think the course was a good introduction to the field of game theory, but it attempted to cover to much in too short a period of time. Instead of focusing on the basics for us to apply to more complex games, sometimes I felt as though we tried to extend what we learned in class too quickly to scenarios beyond the scope of what we were learning. Furthermore, while what we learned in class was very much grounded in concrete examples, our tests were much more theoretical, and I feel like we were unprepared and could have benefitted from more explanation in class."
