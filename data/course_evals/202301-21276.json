This course is a very good introduction to sociolinguistics as well as some more technical aspects like syntax. Additionally, I developed the skill of writing linguistic research papers.",

Overview of basic morphosyntactic and phonological concepts (to aid discussion about variation), especially tense, aspect, and negation (generally and in specific dialects), as well as vowel shifts, th-stopping, and other concepts. Sociolinguistic factors involved in language use and codeswitching. Prejudice against different language varieties and the sources and impact of that prejudice."

                "Strengths were Prof Zanuttini, who was incredible! She's so kind and understanding, and fosters a great classroom environment. The class was very engaging and lectures weren't so stiff; they involved a lot of participation in a fun way. The assignments were fun and realistic (not too much work and never busy work). I can't really think of weaknesses!",
                "I loved everything about this course! Lectures were interesting and engaging. The discussion posts were a fun and helpful way to prompt reflection about your own speech and conversation with others in the class about how our speech differs. The psets were totally manageable, and the structure of submitting parts of the midterm and final papers in weekly psets was very helpful to motivating me to get started early on the papers.",
                "Honestly everything about the class was amazing!",
                "Strengths was the in class discussion. Class was always so much fun because I enjoyed talking about whether certain linguistic phenomena were permissible in our own idiolects. Weakness was this class was A LOT of work. Class was 1 hour 15 minutes twice a week plus a one hour long section plus a weekly discussion post plus a weekly written assignment. I don't feel like all this work was always that beneficial to my understanding the concepts. I feel like I could've gotten everything I ended up gaining from the course from just the 1 hour 15 minute classes and a weekly written assignment.",
                "Prof. Zanuttini and Comfort fostered a great classroom environment by striking a balance between lectures and discussions. I loved getting to know my classmates and learning about the differences between our respective linguistic backgrounds, as well as hearing about what projects everyone was working on thanks to the in-class presentations. The guest lecture on slurs and insults was also amazing.\r\n\r\nThis course has two weaknesses. First, its 'target audience' isn't clearsome of the content was way too technical for people who had never taken a linguistics course before, but some of it was a bit repetitive for linguistics majors. Secondly, it felt a bit disorganized at times, with new assignments being added at the very last minute (like discussion posts due as early as 24 hours after we were told about them).",
                "I loved this course. A huge strength is that we got to pick any topic we wanted for our research projects; this really helped me engage with what I was interested in. I also loved the student presentations, so we could see what other people were interested in working on, and I loved the guest lecturers that we had. The only weakness that I can think of is that we delved into some pretty technical things, like sentence diagrams and other things that I was not entirely familiar with, without a lot of introduction.",
                "The lectures are very clear. The class discussions are very fun and informative as well. While I was very engaged with the morphosyntax, I do wish there was more focus on semantics\/pragmatics, or at least a few lessons on the basics of those fields since they're less familiar to me.",
                "Professor Zanuttini is incredible. She explains concepts very well, and creates a friendly classroom environment that welcomes discussion. The readings were very well selected and engaging."

                "Absolutely!!! I took this as a non-linguistics major and had a great time. Prof Zanuttini is a gem and the classes are all super engaging. The work is interesting and manageable, and you feel very supported as a student.",
                "Absolutely! It'll get you thinking about how you and those around you talk and you'll notice a lot of cool things you'd never paid attention to before. You don't need any linguistic background to understand and enjoy the class.",
                "YES! It's not that high of a workload and it's so intellectually fascinating. It was a joy to attend class and I always learned interesting anecdotes and more about how I can appreciate the beautiful diversity of speech around me.",
                "I would recommend this course. Even if you are not particularly interested in linguistics, the subject matter is extremely interesting and very relevant to our society. Professor Zanuttini is a very good teacher, and classes are sure to be enjoyable.",
                "I would recommend this course if the person were interested in fun class discussions of interesting topics. I would probably tell them to credit\/d\/fail because what is expected of us on a weekly basis is A LOT. I wouldn't recommend this to someone with an already heavy courseload.",
                "Yes, but it shouldn't be the first linguistics course you take. Ideally you should have already taken a 100-level introductory linguistics course. On the other hand, this course might feel a bit repetitive if you've already taken more advanced linguistics courses in syntax and phonology.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. Professor Zanuttini is an absolute gem, the class is so fun and flies by quickly, and the interest-led research projects hardly felt like work at all.",
                "Yes, great learning environment and opportunity and great instructors.",
                "Yes! Usually class discussions can be daunting, but the ones I had here were fascinating. Everyone has something to say, bringing in how they use language in their own lives. It's a lecture that isn't too big, so you can get to know people pretty well. I think this class is probably one of the best introductions to linguistics because it's so much about the social aspect, and everyone can relate.",
                "Absolutely! What we learn about language varieties in this class is not only fascinating but also incredibly important and has honestly affected my worldview and brought awareness to issues that I had never truly considered before. This class also gives a great introduction to linguistics in general, especially major concepts and what exactly it is that a linguist does and how their approach to language differs from that of most nonlinguists. \r\n\r\nThis class caters both to people who have never taken a linguistics class and to people who have, so (1) if you are not new to linguistics, you have probably learned some of the material, but you still get to learn about specific varieties of English and apply your general linguistic knowledge in discussing and analyzing those varieties, and (2) if you are new to linguistics, you might miss an opportunity to do more sophisticated analyses or discuss the more technical side of things, but you nevertheless get a wonderful and mindset-changing introduction to linguistics. So whichever category applies to you, take this class if you are interested!"
