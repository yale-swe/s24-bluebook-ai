    "I learned how to write short journalistic pieces analyzing art.",
    "I was intimidated by the idea of writing about or even discussing modern figurative art. I definitely feel more comfortable doing so now, and I think I also learned to trust my instincts and subjectivity on the subject more.",
    "I learned a bit about how to write about art.",
    "A decent familiarity with debates, methods, and ideas central to figurative art.",
    "This course teaches you what art criticism looks like, and Professor Spillane encourages bold ideas and clear writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about contemporary art and how to write about it. Sometimes it felt like there was a disconnect between the readings and the class, since most of the readings were never discussed, and we had almost a dozen readings for every class. It was difficult to determine what content to focus on, since it was often impossible to read all of it, so it might be helpful to reduce the amount of readings and have more focused class discussions on just those.",
    "I think a strength of this course is that it is very well-organized, and a major weakness that I found frustrating is the amount of assigned readings\/videos versus what can feasibly be expected to discuss in class. There is definitely a disconnect between the syllabus and class discussion.",
    "I thought the homework was often unrelated to class and I would have rather talked about what we read than taking about the random reviews people brought in each week.",
    "I enjoyed the writing assignments in this course, as well as the various museum visits. I think it was hard to see a correlation between the reading assignments and the class. I also did not feel that the blog post assignment was useful or had much buy-in from my class.",
    "The primary way I could see this course improving is more thorough integration of reading\/viewing material into the class discussion. I found a lot of the theoretical texts about art and art theory very engaging, but they only rarely seemed to be discussed in class. Students do receive a lot of good feedback on their writing, with the ultimate goals of concision and clarity.",
    "In this class, you'll be bombarded with information in a somewhat disorganized way, but you'll learn how to deal with and absorb it, and you will come away a stronger writer.",
    "Great reading list, although we didnt get to everything in class discussions. \r\n\r\nWould love if prompts were more student-directed. With true freedom to choose the artists we write about (so maybe less reliance on Yales and the Mets collections). \r\n\r\nWould be great if local artists & emerging artists played a bigger role in who we write about, for at least one assignmentMFA students next door and more broadly in New Haven."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if you have an interest in learning about figurative art through the lens of writing and criticism. It is very time consuming, though, with essays due every Saturday.",
    "I would recommend it but I might recommend credit-ding the class if you want to get the experience without worrying about grades.",
    "I would probably recommend the course for Professor Spillane; she's a lovely, thoughtful professor. I think the course itself was a little difficult to keep track of.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who enjoys writing about things they may not know very much about. Sometimes it may feel as though you are writing uninformed opinions about a \"highbrow\" subject with which you're not very familiarbut the learning experience and writing skill growth are worth the mild discomfort.",
    "If you're interested in arts criticism and you want to write about art every week, yes. If you need structure or organization or you get upset when discussion strays from the readings, no.",
    "Professor Spillane is the best!! Such a thoughtful, caring, and passionate professor!! Definitely take.",
    "Yes, if you read over the biweekly prompts for pieces. Also beware its not writing analysis, its writing quick and streamlined criticism so its very different from a lot of art history classes. Sometimes feels businessy. If youre already engaged with contemporary artists (and you definitely dont need to be) check out artist lists provided in prompts & readings in the syllabus. I found some great and many kind of eh. If you like the syllabus though and want to write get someone in the door-type art crit (or go see this, with a caveat, or stay far away from this exhibition!-type pieces), opportunities for conversation and feedback from Spillane are endless; shes an inexhaustible resource."
