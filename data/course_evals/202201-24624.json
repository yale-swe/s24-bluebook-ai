                "I learned broadly about the African diasporas and how a framework on diaspora helps to expand our engagement with racialization, modernity, and more. The course begins with the afterlives of slavery and touches themes of Black feminism and queer theory and activism, Blackness in Europe and South Western Asia and Northern Africa, Blackness and Indigeneity. Beyond themes, I was able to engage with visual and sonic cultures from across the world that truly deepened my understanding of social and material realities.",
                "It was a great chance to expand my knowledge and thought not only about the Global African Diaspora but also how we look at it and operate academically. We explored non-linear thought, art as resistance and much more",
                "I gained breadth of knowledge about texts concerning blackness from a swath of continents, countries, and perspectives. Some of the main themes covered were: colorblindness and ways to prevent talking about anti-blackness, the European Enlightenment project and the anti-Blackness at the heart of it, how Blackness relates to borders and the insider or outsider status, Black Feminism and Queer Studies, problems with solidarity based solely in similarity, and honestly so much more that I'm likely forgetting!\r\n\r\nI think I learned to think more critically about Black Studies Discourses, and pick out patterns of anti-blackness or colonial relations in dominant/White discourse about Black people.",
                "I developed an incredible understanding of the nuances of race, politics, and gender across the Black diaspora.",
                "In this course, I deepened my knowledge of Global African Diaspora studies and the wide-ranging theories it uses and the regions that are its focus. In this course, I also developed my skills in class discussion and insight into the truly inter- and tran-disciplinary nature of the field."

            "comments": [
                "The course readings and materials are so, so rich. The syllabus allowed me to explore and expand my understandings as an ethnic studies student based in the United States. As a non-Black student, I was humbled to be in conversation with many peers who shared their experiences for the sake of our learning. \r\nA weakness is a lack of structure in class discussions. Student facilitations helped to break the monotony of weekly discussion but could benefit from a rubric that grades for (1) summary and scaffolding of readings, for students who skim, (2) a reflection activity that requires writing instead of speaking, and (3) sharing multimedia content and contemporary resources. Classes that had some or all of these elements helped me stay focused at 930 am on a Thursday!",
                "Strengths of the course are definitely that there is a valuable range of topics to explore. Additionally, it is a reasonable amount of work. Some of the assignments are open ended and not completely clear what the expectations are but in the end she graded very reasonably.",
                "The strengths included the very interesting and wide array of readings on the syllabus, each weeks was so different and exciting! The very open final project was also a strength, our class did a class-wide group project producing an interactive thematic map which was a cool experience of collaboration. There was a lot of space to produce projects that aren't just an essay or research paper. \r\n\r\nOur class did have an problem of people often being late or missing class, which was likely caused in large part by personal stressors and health problems as well as the pandemic. I'm glad people could take control of their health and time, but there were classes where I missed the perspectives of people who were gone. I'm wondering if setting aside some time at the beginning and stressing the value of coming to class and participating might help create more of a culture of being on time and coming to class. But yeah this is not really the fault of the course or instructor.",
                "I think the content of the course itself was fantastic, the readings that we did every week were amazing and very engaging. That being said, having perusall being the only way we mostly interact was interesting just because we could always just comment and not actually read the reading. I also think that the class was a great setting but it was not fully interacting as much as it could have been.",
                "I think that the comments on Perusall system could be improved, I think because it was especially hard to take your own notes on Perusall. However, I think the general discussion style of the course definitely helped us learn with each other. Otherwise, I think some more clear guidelines or structure would help as well.",
                "The strengths of this course are our readings and the very open nature of our discussions."

This course was something that was very enjoyable, especially when it came to the group presentations: those were the highlight of the course because everyone cared a lot to work on it.",
                "Yes if the subject interests you! We went over a lot of basic things that I wish were more common throughout the ERM department.",
