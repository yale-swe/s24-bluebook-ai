Some assignments were auto-pilot and not very useful.",

                "This course is well structured and organized in a way that makes learning Japanese easier due to the way he lessons build upon each other in a way that works really well. The lectures are well taught and allow for practice speaking with breakout rooms with classmates. Homework always helps reinforce what's been taught and solidifies reading, writing, speaking, and grammar skills.",
                "The strength of this course is Yamaguchi Sensei. She made sure that the work was challenging but also manageable and it was clear that she really wanted us to fully understand. She will push you to expand your vocabulary and your skill level. She was also very understanding when the class was tired. She gave us five minutes to talk freely and I genuinely appreciated and needed that.",
                "Online aspects of the course were extremely well organized, facilitating learning and submitting assignments. Everyone was engaged in the class and Yamaguchi-Sensei is very passionate and caring about her students.\r\n\r\nBetween mandatory weekly clinics, homework, and (necessary!) review, there is more of a time commitment than anticipated that I wish I was aware of before taking the course."

                "The 4\/1 synchronous\/asynchronous classes was a good set-up. Good use of breakout rooms, however, often we would go over the hw\/assignment much more quickly than the time allotted. Free talking was useful to do in this free-time but would be easier to do if there was a topic of discussion suggested. Making conversation through zoom in English is hard enough.",
                "I personally think the class should have been more flexible considering the circumstances, yet it seemed like it was taught just like how it would normally be in an in-person seminar.",
                "The classes and the Canvas page were incredibly well organized, it was very clear what we would be doing every day and what homework we had due. I think the class was about as well planned and executed as it could possibly have been online. Of the classes I took this semester it was the best adapted for the online format.",
                "For this semester, this course was structured as a completely online course with 4 synchronous online lectures\/discussions with one asynchronous day for working on group projects and\/or completing tests or quizzes in the middle of the week. This adaption worked fairly well in my opinion. Synchronous  days and homework were ( I assume) pretty similar to how the in person version of this course would have been conducted, except the lessons were over zoom with breakout rooms used to practice speaking Japanese and homework was taken a picture of and submitted as a pdf online.  The tests\/quizzes on asynchronous days were conducted via a timed test on Canvas with both multiple choice, fill in the blank, and open response questions. These were perhaps more difficult that they would have been in person because of difficultly scrolling between the reading passage and questions and typing instead of just writing Hiragana\/Kanji. Overall, this course was very engaging even though it was online and the only improvement I would suggest is streamlining test\/quiz structure online on Canvas.",
                "It was helpful to reinforce what we learned by reviewing homework. I believe that there should be more group projects in order to encourage more conversation among classmates.",
                "The Canvas website for the class was extremely well organized and made online lessons and assignments very clear-cut. In class, we were put into breakout rooms to practice activities before returning to the main room to repeat and solidify concepts in front of the class. The breakout rooms definitely helped make classmates more comfortable around each other."

                "Yes! This was a wonderful introductory course to the Japanese language. It is well taught and well organized, Yamaguchi-sensei is truly a wonderful teacher. It is quite intensive (hence it being 1.5 credits) and there is a good amount of homework and quizzes every week, but it never feels like work just for the sake of work and you learn an incredible amount in a short amount of time. I started with absolutely no background\/experience in Japanese or any other similar languages, and after one semester I hold basic conversations and can read and write Hiragana and Katakana, as well as many Kanji. I cannot recommended this course enough for those interested in learning Japanese.",
                "If you're interested in learning Japanese, yes. It helps to drill the basics of hiragana, katakana, and some kanji before going into L2.",
                "Yes, as long as you are passionate about learning Japanese. Even if you know zero Japanese words prior to taking the course, you will be able to read and hold long conversations confidently by the end of the semester. It's very satisfying to track the immense progress made in such a short period of time."
