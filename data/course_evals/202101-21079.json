                "Strengths: The professors were kind, generous with their time, great at teaching, and obviously very knowledgeable about the subject matter. David (rest and peace) and Dean revolutionized the endowment management industry, and it was an honor and pleasure to learn from them every Monday. The curriculum was comprehensive; we got to learn about a wide variety of asset classes, investment strategies, and investment topics. The guest speakers in the class were outstanding in every way. I can't think of many weaknesses. If I had to give one, I'd say that we didn't get much guidance on the assignments (5 two-page memos), though I don't think they were supposed to be a major focus of the course. And in any case, the teaching assistant, Ilana, made it clear that she would be more than happy to help us, provide feedback, or answer questions if we ever reached out.",
                "I loved the guest speakers and only wish we could have been there in person!",
                "Key strengths: very interesting series of speakers, the chance to learn from the best in the field instructors.\r\n\r\nKey weaknesses: perhaps, the course wasn't as demanding at times, leading to lesser engagement.",
                "I think the class could benefit from being more interactive by asking students questions about readings and allowing room for more collaboration.",
                "Strengths: very organized weekly lectures (the lecture/conversation was natural yet structured and flowed well), incredible guest speakers that were truly passionate about what they do and very open to sharing their experience and giving advice to students, assignments that were close to what analysts do working in an endowments, opportunity to interact with two professors who run the world's best performing university endowment!!"

                "I think the course ran as smoothly as it could've, given the fact that everything was online. This class was a seminar, so for most sessions the professors didn't need to share their screens or use slides. Technological difficulties rarely got in the way. We just had discussions. The only real difficulty was coordinating and splitting up work with group members for our two presentations, though I think that was more on us (the students) and less on the professors. And once someone got the ball rolling by setting up a group chat or initial email, things worked out just fine!",

I'm not exactly sure how the course will change now that Professor Swensen has passed away, but I am confident that future iterations of the course will still have much to offer students. Professor Takahashi is wonderful and knows so much about endowment management, having helped revolutionize the field. You'll learn a ton from his insights and experiences. You'll get an inside peek at how the Yale endowment functions. You'll learn about a wide variety of asset classes and investment strategies and how to think like an institutional investor. Hopefully, you'll also get the chance to hear from some fabulous guest speakers from the investing world, like we did.",
