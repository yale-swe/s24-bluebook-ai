                "Great course for sharpening your skills as a writer, mostly through peer and instructor review. The lessons themselves are interesting but fairly introductory. The peer review process allows you to get a good idea of how things play for an audience, and there are lots of opportunities to get feedback throughout the year.",
                "I learned a lot about character and plot development of stories in working towards longer pieces of fiction as well as about style on the sentence level.",
                "I learned a lot of new narrative techniques, which were necessary to elevating my writing style.",
                "I learned so much about short story writing including skills in characterization, persuasive scene-building, meaningful sound, unreliable narration, and more. I also learned how to give instructive feedback on my peers' work and how to revise my own work based on the feedback of others.",
                "Discipline in writing consistently, revision skills (both macro and micro), ability to give and receive very constructive criticism, etc",
                "How to develop characters, how to be more aware of the information I was providing readers, and how to evaluate other people's work."

                "Strengths are the workshop component and the professorGaige is great, and the environment is really supportive and fun. The only weakness I can think of is that things were a bit too positive early onfor the first month or so, no negative feedback really happened in class, which wasnt super helpful when my stories were read.",
                "The strengths of this course are its small class size. I knew everyone in the class very well by the end and Prof. Gaige did a wonderful job fostering community in the class that will continue past the end of the semester. This was aided by the many workshops we had in class.",
                "I really think it was a fantastic course and theres very little I would change. The only thing I wished was that we had slightly longer class time. Even 15 or 20 minutes would have made a huge differencejust sometimes felt that critiques could be slightly rushed. But otherwise just a wonderful class.",
                "The major strength was definitely the workshop format. I wish there were more and more diverse readings.",
                "The strengths are the writing exercises that allow us to focus on different skills each week, the mini lectures by Prof Gaige, and the workshops that build a really welcoming class community. There aren't really any weaknesses, but sometimes it would have been nice to talk a little bit more about some of the short stories we read for homework (but I get that we don't have time to go into detail on all of those, and we still learn by reading them even if we can't discuss them that much in class).",
                "Strengths - great weekly assignments and readings, really proud of the work I produced, very communal classroom culture \r\nWeaknesses - none really, it is what you put into it!",
                "I liked how the class had a mixture of short writing practices and 2 longer stories. Towards the end of the course, the workshops were really conducive to helping me improve my writing."

                "Definitely. Fun for anyone who has a passing interest in fiction writing, and a great jumping off point for people with a deeper interest. Great time, great course.",
                "If you have any interest in fiction writing, I would definitely recommend you apply! You'll learn a lot about writing, yourself, and the world through writing a lot and reading a lot of writing by others.",
                "Definitely. Anyone even remotely interested in any kind of writing can get a lot out of the course. Just being forced to write every week (a short story was due almost every week) was really great and made my writing improve.",
                "Definitely take this class if you can. This class forced me to turn in my creative brain at least once a week which was such a nice change. It is also just super valuable to learn from a published writer and Professor Gaige has so much knowledge to share. If you like to write and want to do it more often, definitely take this class.",
                "Definitely, it was overall a very positive experience and I think anyone who enjoys writing to any extent would benefit from taking this course!",
                "Yes! If you'e interested in fiction this class is perfect because you will learn so many fundamentals and you will write so much and you will be in a community of people who care about writing as much as you do.",
                "Definitely!! Gave me a really strong foundation to explore fiction writing.",
                "Yes, definitely."
