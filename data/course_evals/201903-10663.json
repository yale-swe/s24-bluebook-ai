    "I learned a lot about how the mind works such as in the fields of linguistics, reasoning, morality, turing machines etc. The course taught me a lot about the mind and also an interesting overlap with computer science, philosophy and linguistics. It does overlap with AP Psychology a bit, but I still learned a lot.",
    "An introduction to cognitive science and the various disciplines that make it up.",
    "How to study in lectures! Also how cognitive science is disciplinary :) Things relating to biases, morality, and A.I.... a sprinkle of computer science (Turing Machines)",

    "This class provided me with a substantial overview of the primary fields within the cognitive science major, most interestingly covering memory, hebbian learning, components of morality within philosophy and foundational concepts in linguistics.",
    "As someone who has never taken any classes in psychology, philosophy, or cognitive science, I took away a lot from this class. Getting an overview of how the mind works, how we perceive sound and image, how we make decisions, ..",
    "worst class i've taken at yale",
    "I learned more about how computer science can be used to apply to psychology and understandings of the brain.",
    "Terrible teacher and teaching method. Hard to understand, jumps around too much and cant focus on a single idea for long.",
    "This course covers a lot of different topics! A lot of concepts related to psychology, computer science, neuroscience, linguistics, robotics and AI, philosophy, economics, etc. are discussed and it is very engaging. I was able to apply concepts learned in this class to other classes, and topics covered are hugely relevant to a lot of current issues.",
    "In this class, I learned about the various different fields that make up cognitive science. I learned about the wide variety of tools that can be used to evaluate human cognition, as well as how we can utilize artificial intelligence to gain a better understanding of the human mind. We went into specifics about some cognitive processes, such as perception, memory, and reasoning. The guest lecturers of this course also expanded my horizons of what studying the mind can accomplish.",
    "Learned about how to think about the mind and people's behaviors.",
    "I really learned alot in this course. In terms of knowledge, this class provided an understanding of cognitive science, which is a totally new way to look at the world and added to my understanding of other things as well, like psychology, computer science, economics, language, etc. In terms of skills, I practiced learning generalizations and extracting key trends from details, in addition to considering the implications of arguments, understanding complex academic arguments, and linking concepts.",
    "I learned about how other disciplines affect the study of cognitive science and how we can understand the brain without actually having to understand the neuroscience of it. I also learned to think in a new way about how to connect abstract concepts.",
    "General knowledge about the brain, how we think, and the field of cognitive science.",

    "Learned overview of the field of Cognitive Science.",
    "I have a general understanding of a few areas of cognitive science but not in in-depth understanding of what exactly is cognitive science. I understand the professor was attempting to convey the breadth of the field by tackling so many areas but it did feel a bit frazzled.",
    "We got a good introduction to various areas in cognitive science.",
    "To be completely honest, Im not sure what I learned in this class. It was all over the place, and things like the final exam didnt even reflect big ideas that we were supposed to know. I learned some more about specific sections of Cog Sci (language processing, vision, etc.) but even they were at a very minimal level and just trying to remember useless facts for the exam. Im leaving this class barely learning anything - we could have focused on so much more during the course. I understand that this is an Inteo course, but it was designed terribly and doesnt help the students. \r\n\r\nI think that it was a good experience nevertheless for me to learn and grow stronger as a student. I truly appreciate all of the efforts of the professor and the TFs.",
    "I learned about the different kinds of questions addressed by Cognitive Science; we covered everything from perception, to infant cognition, human evolution, memory, language, etc. We also learned how Cognitive Science is a highly interdisciplinary field since it includes fields from linguistics, psychology, computer science, neuroscience, and so much more. This is a survey course so we cover a lot of topics but don't get too in depth on many of them. It gave a really great intro to the field of Cognitive Science.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of Cognitive Science- the techniques used in experiments, the kinds of topics that are being researched, and overall how the disciplines work together.",
    "I learned basic cogsci.",
    "I developed an understanding of many functions of the brain and the implications of these functions.",
    "An overview of the subdisciplines of Cognitive Science (linguistics, CS \/ AI, neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, comparative cognition, etc.) and of significant topics (memory, cognition in other animals, space \/ time cognition, learning, development, etc.).",
    "I learned about the different perspectives from which to study the mind.",
    "This was a great survey course of different topics in the field of Cognitive Science, including overlapping topics from psychology and computer science. We learned a wide array of cognitive topics, such as robots and how they show us gaps between human and non-human intelligence, human visual system and how environmental contexts can affect how\/what we perceive, etc. This class definitely emphasizes breadth over depth so keep that in mind when shopping\/taking this course!",
    "General studies in the field",
    "More knowledge about what cognitive science is, although I am still confused about how completely the Prof actually covered the field of cognitive science and how much she just focused on what she found to be interesting.",
    "Cognitive Science knowledge, skill of studying for an exam in an effective manner, not in a way of learning every single detail, but understanding the concept.",
    "How to look at topics from different perspectives",
    "I learned all about cognition, the ways the human mind is truly spectacular in conducting even the simplest of processes, and how cognitive science can be applied to a wide range of disciplines and fields like robotics, neuroscience, and philosophy.",
    "I develop skills to think about concepts in cognitive science and looking at the way that we think from a variety of different perspectives.",
    "I developed a general understanding for cognitive science.",

    "I learned many interesting facets regarding the mind.",
    "A survey of the cognitive science discipline.",
    "I learned that the study of the brain is still very new and that there is still a lot to be learned.",
    "I now understand a wide view of basic cognitive science fields.",
    "Learned a bunch of general information and about different interesting studies.",
    "A broad survey of the cognitive science discipline.",
    "Nothing - without a textbook provided and very sparse lecture notes on powerpoints- AND with the professor reading off the slides, it was very difficult to learn anything",
    "I developed a solid understanding of the development of the brain and the reasoning behind why multiple brain processes are the way they are.  I learned the similarities between among the brain and other systems and the versatility of cognitive science as a study that can contribute and draw from other disciplines.",
    "How to think and draw connections between many fields of study. Also I learned a lot about the everyday decisions I make.",
    "I learnt a lot about a variety of topics in the field of cognitive science, the course dealt with a great breadth of subjects. I also learnt how to answer short, qualitative questions in a strategic fashion and how to take notes effectively in a large sized class.",

    "This class answered many of the questions that I had previously had about how the brain worked, and how human beings were able to think, make decisions, and understand the world around them. I also discovered cognitive science - an interdisciplinary major that combined all my academic interests into a subject with valuable and widely applicable insights.",
    "I learned about many facets of cognitive science",
    "This course helped me learn more about what cognitive science is as a field of study, and also about what it would look like to major in cognitive science.",
    "- I gained exposure to the field of cognitive science and learned how to effectively read research papers",
    "I developed my ability to learn how to read scientific articles and how to analyze them to be able to answer questions about the ways humans think.",
    "This is the class whose information and teachings I refer to the most in everyday conversations. I learned so much in this class about so many topics (and yet it was tied together so well) that I see connections to it in the news I read and the world I observe around me. This class really informs how I interact with the world.",
    "Survey of a vast range of topics in cognitive science, including memory, language, and morality.",
    "I learned a basic understanding of several cognitive science concepts.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Cordova is an incredible lecturer, and she offers a lot of cool examples to demonstrate the concepts. The material is also just very interesting overall if you are interested in the human mind.\r\nWeaknesses: it is a large lecture, so it can be a little difficult to get individual help, but the TFs do a lot to help too. The tests are all short response, which is a little tricky but worth it!",
    "The lectures were at times rather dry and sometimes even all over the place. Study guides would have been very much appreciated. Also, wish the slides were a little more explanatory instead of just random words or phrases that aren't explained.",
    "Strengths - TAs are freaking awesome. Never change them. :) Professor Cordova is very sweet and passionate. Weaknesses: well it's a lecture so it's difficult to know exactly what you're not understanding or finding the right pace for the class...",
    "The exams occasionally did not reflect the balance of our learning over a section of the class, but on the whole, I felt that the expectations for homework and engagement for the class were reasonable and I loved learning from Professor Cordova.",
    "The strengths of this course are its intellectual challenge and the passion of the professor and teaching fellows. It could be a little more well-organized, though.",
    "it's too big, i would get anxiety attacks inside the lecture. the lectures are also not coherent in terms of structure there's not really a framework, more of just random facts thrown at us and it's incredibly hard to keep our focus despite the fantastic content.",
    "The course begins with very abstract concepts and over time becomes more concrete, but the variability regarding the level of detail learned about each topic was unpredictable. It felt slightly disorganized.",
    "I thought the course material was super interesting, and I liked how we did our final exam on a computer, but I wished the material were paced a little slower.",
    "Strengths: covers a broad range of topics, professor was excited to share with us, workload was manageable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the work seemed like busy-work, the neurological topics were often times under-explained, the exams didn't reflect what we learned in class",
    "Professor Crdova is a very engaging professor who presented the material clearly. I always enjoyed going to class because of her enthusiasm. She was very responsive to student feedback and cared that everyone was learning and understanding the lectures.",
    "Strengths: The material is interesting and well-curated to provide a broad, but in-depth understanding of some of the seminal concepts in cognitive science. Thought provoking.\r\nWeaknesses: Not well-taught and there should have been a discussion section. Also the parameters for tests were very nebulous so the evaluation seemed unfair and unrepresentative.",
    "In my opinion, this course is a great introductory course to cognitive science as it covers a variety of topics within this field.",
    "worst class i've taken at yale. content was unorganized, exams tested random material, and expectations were not very clear. definitely the worst professor i've had at yale (dr. cordova). she was not an effective communicator, voice was super annoying, very bad at responding to emails, and not helpful providing support to students who were struggling.",
    "Professor Cordova Sanchez, while academically gifted is absolutely unable to communicate a point. She goes in circles and the bulk of information must be gleaned from time with TFs. It is frustrating that such an interesting topic is being taught in such a confusing and un-engaging way. The only strength of this course is the presence of the Teaching Fellows.",
    "Professor Cordova is fantastic! She is by far one of the most engaged and kind professors I have had at Yale. She really followed up on our interests and adapted the pace and style to fit students' needs. The class itself touches on many subjects so sometimes it was hard to follow the order and connections between material",
    "Strengths- the professor is great and really responsive to student needs, the content is interesting and workload isn't too high.\r\nWeaknesses- the class has no textbook (maybe a strength for some?) which made reviewing for exams somewhat difficult and means you have to take really good notes during class, and some of the readings are conceptually difficult and hard to get through but aren't really the focus of exams.",
    "The class was very interesting, and the guest lecturers are all knowledgeable individulals who are accomplished in their field. I found the class to be a good way of introducing people who were never exposed to the field into cognitive science. One weakness was that the lectures have a large amout of information, and the powerpoint slides were not very helpful when studying for this course. In the future, it will help if all the lectures were recorded.",
    "This course was a really good survey course, so we got to learn a little about a lot of different areas of cognitive science. It covers relevant and interesting examples to help reinforce the larger concepts, particularly artificial intelligence. However, this made it so that most of the material didn't really go together and there were so many different topics that it made the exams harder than they needed to be.",
    "The strengths are that the teaching fellows are wonderful, the content is super interesting, and the guest lectures are really nice. Course expectations are very clear and reasonable, and the workload isn't extreme. The course could be improved by having lectures be better organized: Dr. Cordova clearly knows all the information but I think slides should be structured in the order that is best for people who are first encountering the material. Additionally, I'd like if students are asked about there interests at the beginning of the course to determine what topics are covered. There are also high expectations for exams, and I think it'd be helpful to better explain the format and what is expected before the first exam.",
    "This course was difficult to understand if you missed even one lecture. If you missed a certain detail like a short anecdote you could lose a significant amount of points on the exam. It would be better if a transcript of lecture was included or on the PowerPoint slides posted on canvas there could be a sentence summary of additional points not accounted for on the slides.",
    "Strengths- interesting concepts were covered. \r\nWeaknesses- some concepts were explained in a rather confusing way that made it difficult to engage in class",
    "I think the course covers a lot of really interesting and relevant information. I'm really glad she took our feedback about talking to fast and started doing lecture videos during the end of the semester. Aside from that, it's a bit difficult to know what were main ideas, so maybe outlines before each exam would be helpful.",
    "Strengths: The professor and TFs were extremely passionate about the content, and they strove to be of best help and support to students. Although this was much later in the course, the lecture recordings were very helpful. Taking exams on the computer was also much better than paper and pen.\r\nWeaknesses: While the professor has a lot enthusiasm, it would be helpful if her public speaking was smoother. I had trouble concentrating and staying engaged in the content because her filler words and rapid switch of sentences were confusing. I also wish the exams reflected the content equally. Sometimes, material covered in the lectures is not mentioned in the exams.",
    "There were no strengths to this course. It was poorly organised, the exams were unclear and did not assess knowledge of content, the lectures were awful, the TFs were not allowed to give feedback on reading responses, in review sessions the TFs seemed as confused as students about content, in office hours the professor was completely unable to answer some questions and otherwise only made things more confusing with her explanations.",
    "I think the reading responses every week were great, and the tests were fair.",
    "The difficulty with this course is that it covers so much that it feels like it's all over the place but the topics are interesting. A bit slower paced slides would be helpful, at some points it was impossible to keep up.",
    "I was disappointed with the minimal opportunities to ask for help, as each TA only offered one hour of office hours per week, and since I had class during all the available office hours, I was always unable to make any of them. I also found Prof. Cordova's presentations hard to follow at times, as many of her slideshows were just lots of pictures and the sequence of the topics sometimes did not seem well organized. This could be easily improved by adding more description in the slideshows and clarifying the \"roadmap\" for the day with better titles and subtitles. I also felt like the exam questions and reading response assignments were too subjective.",
    "The topics of this class were well structured and ordered. There were clicker questions to ensure student attendance (though the WiFi in the classroom was bad sometimes I would not be able to answer which showed in my grade unfortunately). The information was presented in a way that was comprehensible to first years who may have never been exposed to cognitive science before which was very helpful. Also the guest lectures were very informative and interesting to hear about the different realms in which cognitive science can reach. The emphasis on AI was very important to this course as well because of the several applications it has in our world today. I was very happy for its inclusion as I constantly see references to it in the news! \r\nI think having decisive grading methods at the beginning of the semester would be helpful. I was always confused as to what my grade was and how things were weighted because it changed many times. I also think that in lectures it is important that it is recorded and also that more is written on the powerpoints such as key terms and concepts as there is no textbooks assigned for this course. Much of the time, there would be pictures (some of which were for metaphors, but not clear from just an image on a slide) with no explanations making it very difficult to study for exams later on. I also think that grading the reading responses on a 1-3 scale is not practical.",
    "The science aspect of it can be very confusing at times and not much is explained prior to the use of certain terms or concepts for students unfamiliar with the material, which made it a little more difficult. The instructor was clearly very invested in what she was teaching and all the topics were naturally interesting.",
    "Professor should be more straight forward with the material",
    "The material is generally interesting, though there's precious little actual content that can be learned or assessed.",
    "Strengths: Lots of material that teach interesting and relevant information. The teacher also made an effort to be engaging and enthusiastic which is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The pace of the class was sometimes a bit too fast for me.",
    "The first midterm came quite early on, before we had learnt much, which could be improved, but the course itself and especially the guest lectures were interesting",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Prof. Crdova Snchez \r\n- interesting course material\r\n- great office hours discussions\r\n- mostly helpful TA's\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- very dense info given at lectures, but no small quizzes or anything to test understanding until the midterms\r\n- optional final exam policy that could possibly hurt you\r\n- absolutely no structure given for midterm studying (most students would at least like a list of topics to check off and make sure they have\/study everything expected of them",
    "The first exam was really hard but the TF's worked with us to help us be better prepared for the remaining two. There are 3 midterm exams and was an optional final exam that counted only if you took it (but even if you did worse on the final than your lowest midterm grade it would replace that midterm grade...which is weird and I doubt many people took the final for this reason). It's nice that the reading responses are graded on check, check-, check+ scales because you get full credit for a decent response so it's not super stressful. Sometimes it's just annoying to do.",
    "Strengths:\r\nExcellent Professor\r\nFantastic TF's\r\nWide variety in course materiel\r\nServes as a great introduction to CogSci",
    "Since this was Professor Crdova's first year, I do not think she had a clear understanding of now best to facilitate student success. The review sessions for the exams were always unhelpful as these TFs themselves seemed as clueless as the students. The infancy of the new course as created by Professor Crdova was the class's greatest weakness. A strength of the course was Professor Scaz's guest lecture. His talk was, without a doubt, the best lecture I have seen at Yale.",
    "Strengths: TFs. They were quite helpful and knowledgeable. Most of them were happy to help any time you reached out and were much better at explaining than the professor herself. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Everything else. the class was designed terribly, the exams were bad and so specific when the class was so broad, the optional final exam was a terrible round up of all of the information in the class, and the homework were useless to our overall understanding of the lesson - these were also graded extremely subjectively by the TFs and it was clear that creative thinking was not supported.",
    "Strength: Professor Cordova & TFs are very knowledgeable and very helpful during the course. Always helped during office hours and were very nice people. Guest lecturers were also a great highlight. I also liked the check system for reading responses. \r\n\r\nWeakness: this was the first time Professor Cordova taught this class, so a lot of my issues are not specific to the course and more about being a guinea pig. There was a huge disconnect between what Professor said we had to know vs what we were tested on--exams required so much detail when we were explicitly told not to get bogged down in details (but once you realize that it's easier to do well). Some exam questions were phrased confusingly--it was less about knowing the material and more about trying to understand the phrasing in the question. I also did not like taking exams on the computer at all. Finally, some of the readings for the weekly reading responses were very long.",
    "I found the weekly reading assignments exciting to read, but I wish the class and those assignments were more engaging- if we had sections where we could discuss the reading and lectures, that could be really useful. I thought that the guest lecturers were really cool and gave us a better idea of how cognitive science is approached by researchers.",
    "I think the grading is a bit weird and the test questions also don't quite focus on main ideas. Otherwise, the course was interesting.",
    "The course material is strong, but its presentation was disengaging in my opinion. The material wasn't presented very logical, we frequently jumped from topic to topic and there wasn't any building off of the previous. I would've like this class to be taught more linearly.",
    "Lectures were well organized, TFs were always open to meet and discuss topics beyond course material, readings and responses facilitated learning and critical thinking.",
    "Strengths - Professor is super enthusiastic and passionate about the topic, TA's care a lot, the lectures are engaging, material is also engaging (esp. if you're seeing this material for the first time)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Some lectures can get repetitive if you're familiar with some of the topics. I'm a senior CS major so the topics on AI \/ boolean logic were things I've seen before but it was still cool to see them discussed in a new light! So there's always something new to learn. The reading responses are weekly and are kind of annoying to do...",
    "I wish lecture slides could have been posted before class and been more detailed.",
    "The lectures did not seem to have a clear logical order, both within them and between them. The lectures were rambling, seemingly unscripted, with overly complex explanations which later (after having to talk to the TF) were revealed to be able to be explained in much simpler terms. Lectures need to have an order, the lecturer needs to better understand how to communicate concepts in a way people understand. Room also was too small for the class and every class at least 10 students were left sitting on the floor.",
    "survey course, has lots of different topics to learn about\r\nbut also does not go too much in depth so which of these is the strength and which is the weakness depends on the person judging it.\r\ngreat instructor",
    "It was interesting but I thought there could be more resources posted like lecture notes or study guides to help us review material",
    "strengths: The professor and teaching fellows definitely made themselves accessible to students; help and clarifications were always available if you needed it.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I felt like lectures could feel really vague and confusing at times. It would be very helpful if the professor could explain better how specific concepts we learned were connected to larger, broader ideas. It felt like the connections were often implied, and not explicitly stated, meaning that students had to muddle their way through the material to figure out what those connections were (I.e. why learning a specific concept was so important, and how that specific topic related to cognitive science). \r\nAlso, if the lecture slides had more text on them that explicitly explained the concepts instead of just a few words and some pictures, I think it would help boost student understanding immensely.",
    "The strengths are that this course covers a lot of interesting concepts in cognitive science that helps you determine if it is something you want to further study. The professor tries to get you think about larger ideas instead of memorizing every detail in the slides. With that said, studying for exams is very hard in the way that it is formatted. Understanding bigger concepts definitely isn't enough because there are specific things that you do need to memorize.",
    "I think that there aren't a ton of strengths with the course. The material is pretty good and interesting, but it's organized in a very poor way. Also, some of the lectures could be incoherent, and I was never sure about what was important and what wasn't. Honestly, I would restructure the course to make it a more student-friendly experience and cater it more to an intro level.",
    "Its just a very confusing class. The lectures were a bit all over the place and way more complex than they needed to be. It really only came together after hours of studying for most people. And the exams were pretty hard.",
    "This class lacked a defined structure. The weekly lectures did not flow and oftentimes were confusing due to the scattered nature of the information. I would do a bulk of the learning outside of the class, oftentimes in other courses that were teaching the same material but better. Furthermore the weekly homework assignments were largely useless in that they did not help me better understand the material for the week, but rather felt like busy work. Certain lectures were fascinating and most of the guest lectures were amazing but these occasions didn't outweigh the overall slow pace and lack of engagement of the course.",
    "Pretty good, sometimes I felt the lectures were jumbled first time through but realized they're actually well put together",
    "The exams were poorly structured but the professor was very approachable and engaging.",
    "I think part of what was frustrating was simply the way the course had to be. It is an intro class to a major that really isnt structured at all, so in order to convey the necessary amount of information, it just all had to be pretty general, which could make it seem like you really werent learning a ton.",
    "I liked the division of content.",
    "This course had very little student engagement, but that is probably because it was a large lecture course. I also thought the tests were not very fair. It seemed as if a student did not have one specific word, he\/she would get the entire question wrong.",
    "This class was very organized and the professor was amazing. However, the tests felt a little unfair at times.",
    "Its a survey style course by definition but I dont think that is my preferred learning style. Definitely prioritizes breadth over depth.",
    "Strengths: passionate instructor \r\nWeaknesses: poorly designed powerpoints with not much relevant or key\/descriptive info",
    "The course needs a textbook. The little concrete information taught was bland and repetitive- mostly vague ideas about AI or poorly explained and brushed over theories",
    "Many of the topics discussed in this course are extremely abstract and a few of these were simplified to a point at which they could be easily understood.  However, the difficulty of the many of the topics was overcome through interesting and exciting presentation and connection to simpler topics.",
    "Slide show notes are a bit unclear and the lecture goes a bit fast and there is no physical textbook. However the readings we get assigned for homework are super interesting",
    "A strength of the course was definitely the breadth of the material. The weakness, however, was given the breadth none of the topics dealt with was explained in any depth. This resulted in students being unable to comprehend a variety of necessary concepts in the class.",
    "strengths - the readings, the general structure in terms of content, the format of the exams, the TAs\r\nweaknesses - sometimes, the slides\/ lectures felt disorganized, & I think the midterms were too lengthy given the time we were given",
    "Interesting content, but presented in a fundamentally disorganized fashion. It seemed more like a buffet of information than a coherent narrative.",
    "The second half of the course was interesting, but the first half is very boring. Also, the exams are poorly and unfairly written.",
    "I thought the material was very interesting, and overall enjoyed the lectures (specifically the first two guest lectures). I personally did not like the system of in-lecture polls as measurement of participation, but understand why it was necessary.",
    "Strengths: captivating topics in lectures and good teaching.\r\nWeaknesses: homework assignments are monotonous and tedious.",
    "I loved the course material, but I didn't feel as engaged in the class as I would have liked.",
    "Strengths were that the content was very interesting and varied. It was a fun introduction to how the mind works. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses were that I didnt often feel very engaged with the ideas. For the tests I felt that I had to regurgitate ideas from the slides.",
    "I found the lectures and the course content to be very interesting, and especially so for such a large lecture class. I also enjoyed the structure of the class - I felt that it had engaging readings and the perfect workload which promoted learning but did not make the class a burden. Tests were generally very fair and well-written, and grading was remarkably objective for the open-ended questions that the tests were composed of. At times, however, I felt that the course could be better organized. Certain slides were posted under canvas without the standardized naming format, making them hard to find. Additionally, the last test was much more difficult and fact-recall than the first two tests, which were more logical and tested for ways of thinking as opposed to raw knowledge.",
    "Strengths include that it provided a surface level introduction to many sub fields in cognitive science. Weakness include that lectures were sometimes disorganized and hard to follow.",
    "Strengths: Interesting topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Extremely broad, topics don't seem to follow a systematic order\r\n\r\nHow it could be improved: I think the course should have more structure to the way it is taught (e.g: grouping topics to Marr's level of analysis or to different fields within cognitive science). The lack of structure (such as when a guest lecturer is invited and teaches on a topic that is often irrelevant and introduces ideas without much clarification) is what threw me off a lot, especially when it came to revisiting my notes.",
    "- The teacher is really amazing and is really invested in her students\r\n-I have no weaknesses",
    "The main weakness of the course was that sometimes the lectures were a little all over the place and it was hard to grasp the information being taught. The strength is that all the TFs and the professor were always very approachable and willing to help.",
    "I think all the topics were well organized and covered a good range of relevant cognitive science information. The way exams and office hours were set up was very helpful. It was a really fascinating class and I enjoyed every lecture. I do wish that there could have been a lab section and also I wish that the first couple lectures covered a little more.",
    "I think the course did a great job of exploring some very interesting material, but I struggled to grasp the main ideas\/most important takeaways during the first third of the course, before we got into more specific lectures. I think abstract concepts should be more well-explained with concrete case studies\/scenarios.",
    "This course inherently has a challenge because it is such a broad overview that you do feel that you are jumping around significantly. I thought the second half of this course was far stronger than the first half of the course-- the first half on the robotics side of cog sci was challenging to dive into with no previous knowledge.",
    "Not enough opportunities to test\/assess oneself, not enough outside material to learn topics on one's own, there was not enough homework to consolidate topics learned in class",
    "Lectures were great and tests were fair",
    "The information was disorganized lecture-wise, hard to follow",
    "It was really helpful once lectures started to be recorded. This helped me when studying for exams. Also the typed exams were much better than the non-typed exams-- there was not enough time to write out complete answers when the exams were written."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class for people particularly interested in psychology and cognitive science, but if you are just somewhat interested in the mind, maybe take a psychology specific class. I also think it is an interesting class for computer science majors because we discuss somethings that are also in CS 201.",
    "If you want to be a cog sci major, this is required! But also a good class to have a quick exposure to what cog sci is. Not a gut course!",
    "Yes! Definitely not an easy A, but very interesting material. No regrets",
    "I would recommend this to a student trying to decide whether or not to major in Cognitive Science. The class is a very helpful overview of the types of content that might be explored in higher-level courses in the major.",
    "Yes, it is a fascinating course for everyone regardless of your major.",
    "only if you're interested in the topic, but the size of the class makes learning difficult",
    "This is a necessary prereq, but I would recommend taking with a different professor.",
    "I would recommend this course to psych majors because it was a good intro to psych topics expanding on intro psych, and it fulfills a requirement for the major.",
    "I would recommend this class to other psychology majors, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who just wanted to explore classes at Yale. It was supposed to be an intro level class, but I think that there were many days that would have been confusing I didn't have a background in psychology.",
    "Yes! An exciting and engaging introduction to cognitive science. I am a first-year and this course helped solidify my decision to major in CogSci! Professor Cordova Sanchez is great too.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it is a good introduction to cognitive science that covers a wide range of topics and is very interesting.",
    "If you're interested in cog sci, yes. The instruction was underwhelming, but the course helps clarify whether you're fit for the major and what components within it intrigue you most.",
    "As an SOM graduate student, I must say I would certainly recommend the course as I believe that educating yourself in other areas is very important. Moreover, I was surprised to find that many concepts from cognitive science and related fields could be applied to business and management.",
    "absolutely not with this professor.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone interested in Cognitive Science or learning more about interdisciplinary learning as it relates to studies of the brain and human behavior",
    "no.",
    "Would definitely recommend! It is very interdisciplinary, so there is probably at least one aspect that will catch your interest. The workload isn't too high and I feel like I learned a lot. As a computer science major, it has definitely made me more interested in artificial intelligence and robotics, but isn't conceptually difficult for people without this background.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone interested in learning more about the mind. However, I do think the exams are very diffcult, but they did help me learn how to study more effectively in college.",
    "Yes, if you are actually interested in psychology or cognitive science. It isn't extremely difficult, but I wouldn't consider it a gut, so you get out what you put in.",
    "Definitely! I think this course can be super useful to a variety of people and learning styles, and I really learned alot.",
    "No. I would not recommend this course to another student. The topic is very interesting and the class does help you understand complex ideas, however, it was not properly structured for large lecture learning which made it difficult to enjoy and understand.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to determine whether or not you are interested in the field of cognitive science, this gives an overview of most of the disciplines covered by the course.",
    "It was pretty decent and it should only get better!",
    "Yes, if the student has an interest in cognitive science. If cognitive science is something the student has no interest in, taking the course may be difficult. Especially when the exams are all short answer questions and require a lot of engagement.",
    "No. I have told everyone I know interested in cognitive science not to take this class. Nearly everyone else I know in the class fell into one fo the following categories: (a) CD'd the class because the assessment structure was so bizarre; (b) dropped out of the class, either during shopping period or just to 3 credits during the main part of semester because they hated it so much; (c) were forced to be in it as part of the major. I regret taking this class.",
    "Not with Professor Cordova -- Wait until Brian Scholl is teaching it if at all possible. Otherwise, yes -- cognitive science is awesome, and the subject matter taught is awesome. Prof Cordova does not articulate\/explain the concepts well at all, and therefore they end up being confusing rather than interesting; the only reason I was able to do well in the class was because most of the content was a repeat for me.",
    "Yes! Great introduction to cog sci.",
    "If the student is genuinely interested in learning how the mind works 100% but not if they're looking for a gut class.",
    "If youre interested in this type of material and like the scientific aspect, this course is definitely for you.",
    "I can't recommend this based on my experience in it, sorry to say. She's invested in students learning, but her lecture style makes it difficult - she has a very \"bubbly\" high-energy manner of speaking that, to be candid, makes it difficult to listen to her. Her exams were also overly specific, quizzing about particular examples from lecture rather than probing conceptual understanding (which I confess might be hard to do in a class as general as intro cog sci, but I certainly felt like it could have been done better). If Natalia's teaching again and you're interested, give it a shop - as I said, she's receptive to feedback, so I wouldn't be surprised if she's improved.",
    "I think this course is a well-designed and intellectual course. If someone's interested in psychology or machine learning, this course is kind of like a fusion of those two fields, I think it would cater to people interested in either. The professor is nice and engaging, but the workload might be a bit heavy sometimes.",
    "Yes- it covers lots of interesting material and provides a helpful insight into lots of different majors",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially if they're pre-med or interested in psychology\/neuroscience concepts.",
    "It's not much work, and I thought it was easy because I have taken many Psych and Comp Sci courses before this, but my friends who hadn't definitely did find the course more challenging. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the Cog Sci field and for those who aren't in the major it's a good class to take Credit\/D and is fairly easy to do well in. The class length is horrible though, it's soooo long so by the last 30 minutes everyone is shuffling in their seats and it's hard to remember all the info. The room is really poorly laid out too, but what are you gonna do. At least they moved the exams to SSS114 which has plenty of light so you can see what you're doing.",
    "Absolutely. This course covers a broad range of fascinating topics and is taught by excellent faculty.",
    "I would not recommend this course for a few years, at least until the professor figures out how best to teach the class.",
    "Yes, it's interesting and you'll be able to engage with the lecture  or the material.",
    "No! If you need an SO credit, take intro psych instead. If it clicks for you, great, but it seems that it took way more effort than it should have to succeed in this class.",
    "Yes! Especially if you are slightly interested in Cognitive Science. You have to take this course for the major anyway. I gained a lot of insight into questions on human nature that I don't think I would learn in any other kind of discipline. I also think it will get better as Professor Cordova gains more experience.",
    "If they are interested in the subject, it gives a good platter of what cognitive science offers, but it isn't a class that can be taken without thought.",
    "No, unless you needed the credit. This course doesn't really test on the scientific material as much as it does other things.",
    "If you are interested in the field or are very interested in how the mind works then yes, otherwise no.",
    "Yes! Material was interesting and incorporated recent research. Guest lectures provided great diversity.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in the intersection of CS and psych! I think that's probably the best way to explain this course because it's not exactly psych and definitely not a coding class, but it covers topics on both fields. There's also a mix of philosophy in there. There are 3 exams and they are definitely not trivial, but mainly just requires a lot of memorizing so beware of that! It isn't a lot of work besides reading responses with question prompts (which means you actually have to do the readings carefully to answer the prompts).",
    "Probably not. While the content was interesting, it was hard to keep up with the way it was taught.",
    "Yes!!",
    "I would tell anyone who doesn't absolutely have to take it for their major not to take it if the same prof is teaching. The class did not actually teach much useful content and it was done in a way which so confusing it was frustrating. The tests also made little sense at the beginning and the class did not prepare students well for the style of tests.",
    "I recommend if a survey course of many different topics studied at the surface is what you are looking for. Also a great course for anyone still looking for a major because CogSci is so interdisciplinary.",
    "No because it was hard to know what to study before exams and I had no idea what to expect. Also it was hard to go back and look at lectures because the slides did not have much information written on them.",
    "If you're really into cognitive science and are comfortable with having a lot of open-ended\/unresolved questions, you should give this cognitive science class a shot! If you are a psychology major taking this class to knock out requirements, I would think more carefully about taking the class. It is a bit difficult to get yourself to think in terms of cognitive science frameworks, and in terms of the specific class itself.",
    "If you're interested in what types of concepts or ideas you can studying in the cognitive science field or the studies that are happening currently, this course is for you. If you are looking for more specific, more in depth things, you may need this course as a pre req.",
    "Not really. The material of the course isn't worth the organizational structure and the lecturing style struggles that I experienced.",
    "Unless youre very interested in cognitive science, probably not. It should be a Sc credit. The class is very confusing and the exams are pretty difficult and require a lot of studying. The material is cool but needs to be better taught.",
    "Depends. If you're thinking of cogsci as a major take the class because you have to but keep in mind this class is not representative of what you'll actually be learning or focusing on. If you just want a gut social science, take intro psych or a different course where you'll likely learn something.",
    "Yeah, thought it was pretty interesting, I also was considering a cognitive science major beforehand though",
    "Yes, if they knew what they were getting into.",
    "I hesitate to give a strong yes, just because of my frustration at the exams. However, most students do pretty well, so I would say that if you are looking for an interesting class that may not be the easiest A, go for it.",
    "I would if they are interested in particular aspects of the human mind.",
    "I thought the material in this course was interesting, but the lectures did not really help me learn much. I also thought the tests were unfair.",
    "Absolutely. Cog sci is very interesting and the readings are awesome. The class was also taught amazingly.",
    "No, unless you want to be a cogsci major and have to take it. The material itself is interesting but is taught very superficially. I also did not find Professor Cordova to be a good lecturer.",
    "Yes if you are looking to major on cog sci and know that this intro course doesnt equate to what the whole major is going to be like.",
    "Definitely not. The professor did not make the class interesting at all despite clearly having passion for the subject- it was very difficult to do well in the class despite the easy subject matter",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student.  Although many of the concepts are not extremely concrete, I learned vast knowledge regarding brain function and structure and the translations of these topics across multiple disciplines.",
    "No I would not recommend the course as is to another student. Unless the isntructor or the material organization of the course were to be changed, taking a course in only Reasoning, Logic, Thinking etc. would do a student more good because they would actually learn about a specific concept in the cognitive sciences with sufficient detail.",
    "Yes! Really really interesting content, and Prof Cordova was generally pretty good with gauging what depths to cover each topic in. Even though it's kind of a survey course, it never felt superficial in terms of content, I always felt like I was learning a lot. The readings are absolutely amazing too.",
    "Only if you need it for your major.",
    "I would, because I find the material interesting and the teaching engaging. I feel that as far as intro level classes it gives good insight into the field. However, I would do so with the caveat of the work level and not particularly straightforward way in which the information is presented.",
    "This class is surprisingly difficult, but for someone who has an interest in cognitive science, I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in cognitive science and want to be exposed to an overview of functions of the mind this course is fun and informative.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in human behavior, psychology, or the intersection of philosophy and science. I also strongly recommend this class over Introduction to Psychology - I learned many of the same concepts, except at a much more technical level and with more concrete explanations.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in cognitive science but dont know much about the field",
    "-Yes it was a great class",
    "Yes if they plan on majoring in Cognitive Science, if not, I think there are better classes out there that go more into detail about the brain.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! So interesting and all of the exams felt very fair and representative. No complaints.",
    "Good for any student who thinks they may want to major in psychology or cognitive science but is not quite sure which specific area of study\/research they would like to pursue.",
    "I would recommend intro psych over this course to another student as it seems to provide a stronger foundation.",
    "Yes extremely interesting, great and energetic professor",
    "I would recommend the course if there were significant structural changes made to the teaching style and outline of the course material.",
    "With a different professor",
    "Yes I would recommend!"
