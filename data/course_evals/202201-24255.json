The readings and films we watched all went together well and exposed me to a lot of films I haven't seen. I've taken many film classes at Yale, and yet this class really shifted my view of film studies. Professor Forster is incredibly intelligent and thoughtful and put together a great syllabus and encouraged super interesting discussion. He gives pretty extensive feedback on work which is also helpful. However, I did find Professor Forster to be a bit rude and cold to students at times so please be prepared for that."
