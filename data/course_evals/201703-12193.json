    "The course is slightly unorganized, but this may just stem from the size of the class. Overall it is an excellent course - very interesting, engaging and challenging.",
    "Great course overall. Would recommend less emphasis on the textbook for daily instruction and a slight variance in the homework assignments.",
    "Strengths: Daily homework, numbers practice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Practice speaking\r\n\r\nI feel as though I've improved in writing, reading, and listening, but I don't think I've improved my speaking very much. Speaking is the most difficult part of learning a language for me, so I think it would benefit me to have more opportunities (both formal and informal) to speak for extended periods."

    "Yes! \r\n\r\nI really enjoy the language and Professor Dolgova and Ms. Nordgaard are both great instructors. They are both very willing to help outside of class and they put a lot of effort into ensuring that we get useful feedback. The workload is definitely manageable."
