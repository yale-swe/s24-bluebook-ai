                "I think the readings before class were a great structure. Debating about the readings in class was great given that it clarified and expanded what we read in the prior week. However, I believe that it may have been nice if Professor Aslanidis added a bit some more class lecture content to make sure we get the broad understanding of what was going on before entering the reading comprehension.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone with an interest in Modern Greece or of the Balkan area/region. There were a mixture of a few Greeks taking the class but mostly non Greeks who wanted to learn more about a country we would learn about in another class.",
