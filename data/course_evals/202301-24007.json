You'll write 5 short response papers, a 5pg. response paper to an interesting movie, and 1 longer (~8-10pg.) paper about a topic of your choosing. The readings are really interesting and Prof. Yahaya is very knowledgeable about the material & the region.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Yahaya is fantastic, and the readings are all excellent and fascinating. This is such a unique and special course that really has no substitutes among undergraduate offerings. The class is a lot of work, but has well-paced reading reflections and paper milestones such that you shouldn't be too bogged down by the end as long as you plan your time well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: in some weeks, it would have been helpful to have more context in the readings about what exactly was happening in that time period; sometimes felt like the readings started off assuming that the reader had some background knowledge already (which was not true for most of us)",
                "Strengths: class discussions were interesting, the film we watched was very eye-opening, liked the flexibility of the final paper, Professor Yahaya is very knowledgeable, class is very structured\r\nWeaknesses: none really",
