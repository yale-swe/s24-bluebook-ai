                "The strength of this course was that it taught a lot of Italian in a short amount of time. For example, we covered lots of vocabulary words and multiple verb tenses. Another strength was that we did exercises in class where students received feedback from the professor. At times, however, it felt like there was too much material on a test which made that test daunting.",
                "I liked the workload of the class. Given that the class met every day, I thought that the flexibility with outside-of-class assignments was helpful. It allowed me to complete the work on my own schedule instead requiring a certain amount of work every single day, especially because I often had particular days that were way busier than others due to the schedule of my other classes."
