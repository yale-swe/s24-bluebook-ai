                "Professor Aslanidis does an excellent job in both selecting readings and in discussion at representing the nuances inherent in any political discussion and never discredits any point of view.",
                "The strengths were the readings and prof Aslanidis. The professor is really engaging and works really well with the students in making the seminar into a productive learning environment.",
                "Strength: Readings! What a wonderful and comprehensive collection of readings on populism! I thoroughly enjoyed them, and I never questioned why I was reading them.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes Professor Aslanidis created a hostile seminar environment. We are in a pandemic, cut students a little slack. Some of us work 2 jobs and didn't have stable housing for food security this semester. There are ways to encourage class participation and outside reading assignments without attacking students in a confrontational manner that makes everyone uncomfortable and scared to speak in class... Alternative ways to get students to complete readings or participate more: have weekly memos due each week that have students summarize the readings and what they thought of them. These could be 300-500 words, and they have been very effective in my other classes. This could also take weight away from the two papers and give people a chance to show their engagement.",
                "Strengths: The readings were well-selected and interesting, though sometimes they could get a bit repetitive. The topic is endlessly interesting and there is a lot of freedom in choosing where you want to take your research. Guest speakers offered interesting perspectives in class. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the readings could get a bit repetitive, and the class could have helped from more discussions\/readings bringing together a bunch of variable concepts.",
                "The readings at the beginning of the semester were the most intellectually challenging. However, the readings became easier as the semester progressed. I also enjoyed writing papers on topics that I chose.",
                "Virtually, it was difficult to have a seminar, as discussing content was hard in a virtual format.",
                "I think this course was structured well. It encouraged critical engagement and conversation.",
                "Although some readings were a bit dense\/difficult to grasp,  the vast majority of the readings and class discussions were interesting and engaging. I particularly liked the ability to choose our own topic for the midterm and final papers  (after consulting with the professor) because it allowed us to choose topics that were of particular interest to each student. I also really liked the methodological workshop.",
                "The course being so focused on populism lends itself to the ability to deeply explore the topic. I felt that this made class discussions very intertwined and by the end of the course everyone had their own positions on the matter. In my opinion, this was a strength. At times the discussions died down because readings could be somewhat confusing. In those cases, Professor Aslanidis would interject to hopefully provide clarity."

Professor Aslanidis teaches the course wonderfully, selecting interesting readings and prompting provoking discussion, it's clear he has an in depth knowledge of the study of populism.",

                "Yes, it teaches you how to analyze populism from a critical perspective, detached from the way the media slings the word around.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who enjoy seminars.",
                "Yes. The course helped me develop a personal definition for populism that I am able to apply to current events and understand where it is applicable. Professor Aslanidis helped develop ideas and challenged the concepts students brought up and made sure that each student understood the topics discussed.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this to another student especially given the current state of American politics.",
                "Yes, particularly if they're at all interested in populism. This class is 100% about populism: the historical roots of populism in the US with the People's Party, different ways of understanding populism, Latin American populism, grassroots populist movements, etc. If you're not interested in better understanding populism, this is likely not the class for you. With that being said, this course was really interesting and engaging and understanding populism is key in the current social\/political sphere.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student! It is a great way to understand the ways in which populism as an identifier has been misused and misinterpreted. We discussed extensively the definitions and theories of populism, populist case studies from history around the world, and the ways in which one can measure populism through discursive analysis. A very engaging course!",
                "If someone is interested in deeply exploring populism and political movements, then yes. The class is on a specific topic, but that doesn't mean that discussions will run dry. Prof. Aslanidis is a deeply knowledgable in populism, and has extensive ideas. His theories and opinions never dominate conversations, but they are exciting opportunities to hear\/learn from someone so knowledgable."
