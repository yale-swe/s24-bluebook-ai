                "This course is really well taught and has a good balance of math, concepts, and concrete examples. One major weakness is that the problem sets cover much more advanced material than the lectures, so it can be difficult to figure out how to start and what concepts to apply.",
                "This course is clearly taught and structured. The material is interesting and engaging, and Nilay is a great professor. Problem sets are manageable and help guide you through the material, though they sometimes rely on concepts that weren't explicitly mentioned in class, so it was difficult to tell exactly what we needed to know for the exam.",
                "Strengths- Excellent information, really in depth, great course material, fair exams, homeworks are reasonable length\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Nilay has a lot of wonderful information, which he says very quickly while writing information very quickly on the board which is difficult to read. I found it very difficult to take down enough notes each class because I struggled to keep up (though his stories do allow for a little bit of catch-up time regarding what he has written on the board). The course resources provided are helpful, but having resources specific to his lectures (such as access to past Zoom lectures, which could be made available a significant amount of time after the lecture they correspond to in order to provide an incentive to attend class, or handouts of each example reaction\/each substrate survey) would really help with studying and reviewing notes to fill in the gaps of what was missed in class."
