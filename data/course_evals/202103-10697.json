                "- the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland (including how it began, what happened during it, and how it was settled by the Good Friday Agreement) \r\n- the legacy of the Troubles\/current issues in Northern Ireland today -- there is still a lot of work that needs to be done in that region in promote peace and reconciliation \r\n- how to perform qualitative research by doing interviews",
                "This seminar taught me about the complex nature of the Troubles and how to apply lessons from the peace process in Northern Ireland to other areas of conflict. I also learned how to engage with people with a variety of perspectives on a question that has no easy answers.",
                "I learned A LOT about Northern Ireland.",
                "The peace building efforts of Northern Ireland throughout the history of the troubles and into today. How the sectarian divide has shaped Northern Ireland and effected the society and governmental issues.",
                "I gained extensive knowledge about The Troubles and post-conflict problems of memory and development in Northern Ireland.",
                "I learned how to critically reflect on conversations with speakers, connect overarching themes present in Irish history, and theorize about contemporary issues facing the people of Ireland today (e.g. Brexit).",
                "I learned so much about the Northern Ireland conflict and about modern conflict in general. Being such a relatively small and localized conflict in scale, you really get to feel the human impact that the conflict has had. A lot of the course involves interviews with people who were on the ground for the conflict, so you really get to learn through people's firsthand experiences which was super valuable. I came away with so much knowledge.",
                "I gained a deep understanding of the history of conflict in Northern Ireland and how that history impacts life in Northern Ireland today. I also learned about qualitative research methods in political science, and the benefits and drawbacks to those methods.",
                "A familiarity with the history of Northern Ireland and the Troubles. I entered the course with no knowledge and learned a ton.",
                "I learned about Northern Ireland, its history, and current politics."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of the course are undeniably the knowledge of the professor and the value of the guest speakers. The latter make Northern Irish issues personal and offer rare first hand insight. I can not think of a single thing I would change, this course was fantastic.",
                "Strengths: content is fascinating and Professor Weir cares a ton about it. She's a, if not the, leading academic in peacebuilding in Northern Ireland. It's great to watch her interact with our guests.\r\nWeaknesses: WPNI felt more like a series of talks than an actual class. There are basically no assignments. That's awesome from a workload perspective, but it makes it very easy to coast by in the class. There are too many students in the class and even if you really try to participate, you're only going to talk once or twice per class. So there's no real incentive to do any of the readings on the week you're not presenting.",
                "Strengths \r\n- Professor Weir is AMAZING -- so accessible, friendly, knowledgable, loved answering questions, answered them really well, funny, kind\r\n- low stress (both outside of and inside the classroom) -- purely enjoyable!!! I loved being in class all the time \r\n- the guest speakers were really amazing. we talked to a guest speaker for half of every single class, and it's so special that you can get a firsthand account of a historical war, so it was super cool and really helped with understanding the conflict \r\n- low workload (pretty much just a 2-page reflection every week and some light readings, no final!!!), but I still learned SO MUCH\r\n- extremely interesting and fascinating material \r\n\r\nMaybe a bit more feedback for the reflections would've been nice just so I could keep track of how I'm doing in the class? But they seemed pretty chill, so I honestly wasn't that worried about the lack of extensive feedback",
                "War and Peace in Northern Ireland was organized around guest speakers. This format was excellent for learning and engagement, since each person we heard from had unique insights into the Troubles and its aftermaths. I think this format fit perfectly with the course's subject matter.",
                "It depends on how you learn, but for me the structure of the course was incredible. No long writing assignments, just an opportunity to engage deeply with the course content without stress. Clearer expectations and feedback on the assignments would be nice, and the speakers could sometimes feel repetitive. It would be nice if we could pick from the questions we had to submit each week ahead of time, so everybody got an equal opportunity to ask questions and the answers would vary.",
                "Strengths: Q&As with people involved in Northern Ireland added a really cool change in format from most other seminars at Yale. Additionally, student presentations weekly on the readings helped to increase understanding and interaction with the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Oftentimes student questions leftover from past weeks at the beginning of class made the presentations have a bit of time crunch before guest speakers arrived, which left little room for in-class discussion on the current week's material. Additionally, feedback on assignments (more than likely because of their high frequency) was sparse, and it sometimes felt as though I was missing constructive feedback that would help me better engage with the course.",
                "Strengths- hearing from guest speakers every class and gaining wonderful insights from these conversations \r\nWeakness- none",
                "The strengths of this course lie in the conversations we had with speakers each week. It is one thing to learn about history from a textbook. It is another to learn about history through the words of someone who lived it. I found each class to be captivating, eye-opening, and mutually engaging. Because we were able to ask questions to each speaker, it felt more like a conversation, rather than a lecture. The class benefitted from Professor Weir's wide-ranging connections: we were able to speak to people from both sides of the conflict with different lived experiences, interests, and areas of expertise. The weakness of this course relates to it being only an hour and fifty minutes! I wish we had more time to talk with speakers and engage in class discussion about the assigned reading. We mainly focused on the former (which I'm not complaining about!), but I think it would've helped to also dive deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of the conflict as well as explored the history more.",
                "The strengths are definitely just the amount of diverse learning you get from all the different speakers and topics you cover over the course of the seminar. I learned so much. However I would maybe have liked if there were more opportunities for discussion amongst the students as the class was mainly dialogues between students and speakers.",
                "The content was fascinating and Professor Weir is a great instructor. We spoke with someone in Northern Ireland almost every week which made the classes very engaging. We rarely got feedback on our work, however, which made the assignments feel like a task to complete rather than an evaluation of our work. A lot of class time was often taken up by people asking Professor Weir questions, which meant that student presentations were usually rushed and class discussions were cut. Overall, the course was great, but the structure could be improved to facilitate more in-class discussion and reflection on guest speakers."

                "Absolutely! As someone with an Irish family, this course opened my eyes to such a complex history. But even for those without any connection to the island, it is a fascinating study of an ongoing conflict and one of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
                "You'll get as much out of this class as you put in. WPNI might be the easiest class I've taken at Yale. There are no papers or exams. The class is split into two pieces -- a student presentation and a guest speaker. In both parts, there aren't many opportunities to speak. Take this class if you want to learn more about the conflict -- your curiosity will drive you to do the readings and engage in the class. But if you're looking to be taught, you won't find that here. It's not very structured. It is a super interesting course though!",
                "YES!!! 100%!!! everyone loved it, and you will not regret it. it's about 1-2 hours of reading\/writing per week, but they're super low stress\/honestly pretty enjoyable. no final or big papers! Prof Weir is the best professor I've had at Yale, and she really wants you to just learn and enjoy the material. 1 hour of every class is a low-key student presentation\/everyone just asking questions, and the other hour is always a guest speaker (they're all SO COOL!) which makes class-time really chill too. the material is also just super fascinating and exciting! my favorite class at Yale.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any students interested in history, international relations, Ireland, or conflict resolution.",
                "Absolutely!! Professor Weir is awesome, and she has so many stories from her field research that make studying the topic feel real. Also, unlike a lot of polisci courses, it's not a lot of theory and more about understanding what's going on and why in very clear language, learning from the people who were on the ground. It's a very cool opportunity to speak with people who lived through the conflict. If you don't mind doing weekly assignments, this class is a really fun, and chill way to learn about a topic a lot of people don't really know about.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course! It's a very interesting subject field about which you have probably heard very little, and the guest speakers each week make it much more engaging than other seminars. Dr. Weir is also super great and wants to help her students succeed!",
                "Yes, the conversations had are incredibly enlightening you learn so much in such an engaging way.",
                "Absolutely! The readings combined with Professor Weir's insights and the weekly guest speakers give you an intimate look at the conflict in Northern Ireland in ways which are applicable to conflicts around the world.",
                "I would highly recommend this course! You learn a lot about Irish history by speaking to people, instead of reading hundreds of pages with no community engagement. If you have any interest in the conflict and\/or new forms of teaching, this is the class for you!",
                "Yes, if you want to learn more about Northern Ireland through people who actually lived it, this course is for you. You really get a glimpse of the actual human impact and the people who live through that history.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in studying conflict and its lasting impact on society. Even if you have no real interest in the region, Northern Ireland is a fascinating place to study, and what you learn about sectarian violence can easily be applied to other conflicts in the world. Professor Weir is incredibly knowledgeable and has great contacts in Northern Ireland, so it was wonderful to discuss readings with her in class and in office hours. For a class with a relatively low workload, I feel like I learned a ton.",
                "Yes!! If interested in the subject, this is a great environment to learn about it!",
                "Interesting subject, great teacher, just be prepared to have zero grades the entire semester."
