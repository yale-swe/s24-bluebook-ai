    "I learned quite a bit about general trends that lead to crime. The class focuses a lot on psychopaths, externalizers, conduct disorder ,etc. I also learned to think more critically of government responses to crime and how they are portrayed in the media",
    "I learnt about the neurobiological, genetic, social and environmental context of psychopathy and externalizing disorders, and became more familiar with the criminal justice system and treatment\/therapeutic pathways associated with violent\/antisocial behavior.",
    "All about psychopaths, externalizers, conduct disorder, brain regions involved in these disorders, social\/environmental factors that put people at risk, etc.",
    "Learned about the criminal mind, specifically about psychopaths and those who engage in antisocial behavior. Learn about causes, mechanisms that explain it, and possible treatment options. Excellent course.",
    "I learned more about the criminal mind, mainly on a psychosis level.",
    "You learn a lot about the true definition of a psychopath and why they act the way they do. You also learn a lot about externalizers, people with conduct disorder and other psychological disorders.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about different forms of psychopathology that often lead to criminal behavior. The lectures were very detailed, so we learned a lot about different disorders, how they are diagnosed and treated, as well as the etiology and risk factors associated with each one. I also feel like I gained skills in regards to reading research papers and learning when to consider the methodology of a study and whether or not it is generalizable to all\/certain populations.",
    "I learned so much about different kinds of criminals, why they act the way they do, and what we can do to help them. It was super interesting, informative, and fun.",
    "I learned how to discern the factors that contribute to why criminals behave in the way they do, both genetically and neurally.",
    "This course taught me all about abnormal psychology in relation to criminals. It covered everything from childhood to adulthood in an attempt to understand why people commit crimes.",
    "Great understanding of criminal activities and the reasons behind them, also the pathways to different mental diseases and their social consequences.",
    "I learnt to read psychological studies critically and I got a much deeper understanding of how role psychopathology plays in our criminal justice system. I also now understand better the etiological factors that influence conduct problems in children, and psychopathology in adults",
    "I learned the necessity of proper diagnosis techniques and I learned how you must be precise when defining what you talk about.",
    "I learned a lot about the psychology behind those who commit crimes, as well as the factors that contribute to the making of a criminal. Surprisingly, this class also helped me improve my writing.",

    "I literally learned about the criminal mind, as I had no prior knowledge of the subject at all.",
    "I truly developed an ability to recognize different types of criminal behavior in adults and children. I am constantly analyzing the characters in shows and movies now and trying to determine if they are an externalizer or a psychopath and what mechanisms led to it.",
    "I gained a deep, but not necessarily broad, understanding of the psychobiological mechanisms of psychopathy, conduct disorder, and externalizing. I learned a fair amount about the human brain, but the majority of the course was a summary of Professor Baskin-Sommers' own research.",
    "I learned an immense amount about the criminal mind, but more specifically psychopaths, externalizers, and children with CD or CD+CU. While I am not a psychology person, my biggest take away was that psychopathy is actually a very specific disorder and for those of us outside the field we should be careful to label people as psychopaths because it is a very specific disorder.",
    "This class really helped me begin to understand why people commit crime. I learned how to read empirical articles,  a bunch about the brain,  interesting experimental tasks, and genetic factors that could influence antisocial behavior. I learned exactly what being a psychopath means.",
    "Before taking this course, I never understood how people commit such heinous acts, but this gave me a better understanding of the neurological mechanisms that underly people's actions.",
    "How the brain of antisocial personality disorders work. SUCH a fascinating course, especially for those interested in criminals and neuroscience.",

    "Insight in how the brain can malfunction to cause criminal and psychopaths to behave the way they do",
    "Criminal psychology",
    "I learned how to adapt study skills so that I could improve test scores and essay scores as the course went on.",
    "I learned a lot of things about basic ways that neuroscientists\/psychologists run studies, and common methods. Very interesting lectures, but I wish there could've been even more lectures at the end of the course about the bigger applicability of the knowledge on policy. I think many of the students taking the course may not be psych majors, but that's an even better reason for people who may be future policymakers or future researchers, etc. to not only understand the mechanisms, but how all of this knowledge should inform prison reform and larger policy reforms.",
    "I learned so much by taking this course. I learned about the distinctions between psychopathy and externalizing, other mental illnesses, and conduct disorder and callous unemotional traits. I gained a lot of insight into how those who are mentally ill think, behave, and act.",
    "I learned how to think about the brain and how it works in a new way",
    "A lot of information about the brain and psychopathy.",
    "I learned about concentrated disadvantage, psychopathy, externalizing, the difference between psychopathy and externalizing, how genetics and environmental stressors interact to lead to disinhibitory psychopathology, treatment for adults and children, conduct disorder, and so much more. Such a cool and informative class.",
    "One of my favorite courses I have taken here so far! It was super engaging, extremely interesting, and wasn't overloaded with science! While the brain was discussed, the class focuses more on behaviors and studies which made it so enjoyable!",
    "Learned about the etiology of psychopaths and other psychobiological disorders. All pretty interesting",
    "Learned about what the psychopathology associated with adult criminal behavior, what kind of treatments are available and how they work, and what kinds of children grow up to become criminals.",
    "I can't really say I'm taking much away from this course besides cool facts I could say at dinner parties.",
    "This course was really very interesting and a gave a good understanding of the topics. I learned a lot of really interesting things that I had never really considered about the way psychopaths are portrayed in the media, and also about the how the poor conditions of prisons impact prisoners.",
    "This course covers the psychological and neurological factors that explain and cause disinhibitory psychopathology and criminal behavior. It explores etiological models of psychopathy, externalizing, childhood conduct disorder, among other disorders, as well as treatment, environment, and other issues surrounding these behaviors.",
    "I felt that I got a very engaging and comprehensive look into the criminal mind; I gained a very thorough understanding of how neural, environmental, and genetic factors all coincide to produce certain aberrant behavior. I also realized that a large problem with America's criminal justice system is its inability to use this research in providing treatment or punishment for crimes.",
    "The course dives into many topics on crime and psychology. It does not particularly teach you any analysis skills in psychology, but rather focuses as more of an introductory course for those interested in the subject.",
    "I learned a lot about the basis of criminal psychology and the different factors that go into the development of criminal behavior. I learned a lot about the different aspects of criminal psychology like psychopathy, conduct disorder, and other personality disorders and how these disorders interact with neurology and one's environment to cultivate a criminal.",
    "Honestly, I didn't learn a lot I will take with me. The classes were fun but a lot of the material seemed made up....",
    "I learned a lot about the cognitive, genetic, environmental, and psychobiological factors behind criminal behavior.",
    "Learned a lot about the genetic, environmental, and psychobiological factors behind criminal behavior",
    "I developed a much deeper level of knowledge on the human brain and on various antisocial personality disorders.",
    "I learned so much about the inner-workings of criminal behavior and their brains, whether through the actual differences in anatomy or the psychological differences. I think the material was interesting and taught from an educated perspective how people ended up in situations that caused this kind of behavior as well as being born with deficiencies that caused them to interact with the world this way. Explaining racial, economical and emotional hardships with explanations and good resources to follow up with, including the readings assigned.",
    "I developed loads of knowledge concerning mental illness, treatment, the prison system, and more.",
    "I learned how to write a research paper effectively, how to read empirical research. I learned about the nuances regarding psychopathy and overall criminal behavior.",
    "A lot about psychopathy and APD- gene, environment, social, etc.",
    "I learned about the reasons why individuals act violently execute criminal behavior and that these reasons can be very different for different types of people based on various individual, environmental, neural, genetic, and other factors.",
    "Before this course, I used the terms \"psychopath\" and \"sociopath\" interchangeably and without any substantial knowledge of their meaning. This course has given me the knowledge to decipher not only what each of these clinical diagnoses means, but how specific criminal behaviors boil to the surface through a combination of genetic, environmental, and neural factors. This course is incredibly comprehensive, looking at the psychological underpinnings of crime from childhood all the way through adulthood.",
    "-etiological mechanisms driving different pathologies, and consequently, antisocial and criminal behavior\r\n- psychopathy, externalizing, CD, CD+CU (diagnosis for each, traits, mechanisms, correlates, neural function)\r\n-treatment for pychopathology (ATC, ACC, MJTC, Cognitive Remediation therapy, etc)",
    "Learned a lot about psychopathy, and what it actually means to have that diagnosis. It was really interesting to learn new things like conduct disorder in children. Really neat class overall!",
    "Through this course, I learned skepticism for given methodologies, conclusions, and assumptions when it comes to \"accepted\" psychological and psychiatric research. I learned about the nuance of people's disorders and multiple ways their etiologies could differ and interact with environment, genes, and neurology. I learned that the current treatment set-up of the already dysfunctional criminal justice system is just as dysfunctional, and is in dire need of change.",
    "I gained a much better understanding of the neurological and environmental factors that may increase rates of mental health. The course did a great job teaching neurobioligical and cognitive mechanisms and then applying them to issues in the  criminal justice system.",
    "I learned a lot about criminality and psychopathy from the perspective of psychology and neuroscience.",
    "I realized the range of ways in which environment and life experiences can impact people's dispositions later on in life. I was also able to become familiar with the APA format for writing and reading research studies.",
    "I learned a lot about the misconceptions in the media regarding psychopathy and the neurobiological mechanisms that actually make up psychopathy.",
    "As a non-psych major who had never taken a psych class before, I feel like I left with a solid understanding of the structure of the discipline and of how studies are conducted and why they matter.",
    "I think this class was very interesting and effectively covered the main psychological models that explain criminal behavior.",
    "We learned about psychopathic criminals and several other disorders that are common in criminals. I learned a lot about the specific studies used to evaluate psychopaths with the purpose of discovering the causes of psychopathy.",
    "lots about crime and psychopathy and the mind",
    "I learned a lot about the neurological and environmental factors that contribute to psychopathic and externalizing characteristics in adults and children, and treatment methods for it.",

    "Very clear understanding of psychopathy, externalizing, child antisocial personality disorders, etiology of these disorders, and potential treatments",
    "I learned all about topics such as psychopathy, externalizers, and conduct disorder. It was very interesting to learn about topics I have little knowledge in and also all the studies and evidence to back up the claims and treatment options.",
    "I learned very specific information about the brains and behavior of psychopaths.",
    "I learned how to evaluate different psychological abnormalities that are common in criminals and children with extreme behavioral problems.",
    "I learned about the various psychobiological and environmental factors involved in criminal behavior, how to recognize the different diagnoses associated with antisocial behavior in childhood and adulthood, and the best approaches to assessing and treating chronic offenders. I think one of the best insights from this course was how the media greatly misrepresents the relationship between mental illness and crime and how we can use neuroscience to inform future policy directions.",
    "I developed stronger critical thinking skills, especially in terms of integrating scientific information to make arguments and understand the balance of evidence on each side. I also learned a great detail about criminality, both in terms of environment and genetics\/neuro.",
    "This course was wonderful and very applicable to today's world. We learned all about the minds of people who commit heinous crimes and why, I personally developed the skill of writing a concise research paper, and got a lot of insight into the problems with the justice system of today.",
    "Basic information about types of crime in America as well as risk factors for crime and incarceration. \r\n\r\nWe spent the bulk of the course on a discussion of etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of psychopaths and externalizers as well as their comparable childhood diagnoses.",

    "What a psychopath did",
    "- the neuroscience, psychology, and sociology which contribute to criminal behavior\r\n- a solid working knowledge of the criminal justice system, its faults, and how we can apply neuroscience to hopefully fix those faults",
    "I learned how to identify psychopathy and externalizinf traights. I learned about studies employed that provide evidence for these traits. I learned about conduct disorder in children. I also learned about methods for treatment",
    "Amazing professor. Take this class!!!",
    "Really great help in understanding how to read scientific research reports.",

    "The psychobiology of crime, psychopathy, and antisocial personality disorder",
    "I learned about the specific mechanisms behind psychopathy and externalizing and how the mechanisms cause certain behaviors.  I also learned about childhood disorders, especially conduct disorder and callous-unemotional traits.

    "I learned a lot about psychopathology and externalizing.",
    "Got to see past the phenotype of certain types of criminals and learned about the different causes of criminal activity in a range of people.",
    "I learned SO much from this course! It was very interesting from a psychology perspective. We learned about aspects of neuroscience, abnormal psych, how society deals very poorly with mental illness especially in the context of the criminal justice system. I really loved this class because the material was also interesting from the perspective of just being an informed citizen when it comes to how we do things in the US and where we fail. It opened my eyes to some specific ways that we can use psychology and neuroscience to better the system.",

    "I have a greater understanding of neuroscience and the human brain",
    "By taking this course, I gained clearer insight into the neurological explanations and pathways for criminal behavior. Not only did I learn about psychopathy and other disorders, but I learned how to think critically about these pathways to criminal behavior - how they could be identified, and how their effects could be mitigated. I also developed skills such as citing sources and developing arguments using a combination of outside sources, empirical examples, and my own opinions.",
    "I'd never taken a psych course before and I learned a TON about cognitive science, the difference between etiology (cause) and symptoms of various disorders.

I also learned about genetic and neural deficiencies associated with various brain regions that drive certain types of criminal behavior. Finally, I learned that crime is a multifaceted issue with a complex etiology. Among the most prominent causes of crime are exposure to violence, low socioeconomic status, and neural\/genetic deficiencies.",
    "Knowledge on psychopaths\r\nKnowledge on different parts of the brain",
    "the inner workings of the mind of a psychopath",
    "I developed a knowledge of criminal offenders and discovered a new insight to why criminals do what they do. This was an extremely interesting course.",
    "I absolutely loved taking this course! I previously have studied the concepts covered in class, but not to an extent as Professor Baskin-Sommers has taught them. It was great to learn more about mental disorders and the criminal justice system, especially that of psychopathy, and it is a topic I wish to continue learning about during my years as an undergrad. One really gets to gain the insight after taking this course of how the criminal justice system is currently disregarding the complexity that is treating and assessing mental disorders.",

    "Strengths: I think the class is very interesting. It is very easy to follow along and everything was explained well. The professor was also incredible. Playing music before every class, funny, passionate, etc. The class was also a gut, making it not stressful; I found myself able to just focus on content rather than the grade\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think that at times, the class dragged on about 1 topic. The last part was just about conduct disorder, and seemingly half the course was about psychopaths and externalizers.",
    "This was a fantastic class with plenty of incredible resources, a super helpful and responsive professor, clear expectations for exams and essays and engaging material. Huge plus was that there was no section!",
    "Really cool content and Arielle is the best. The essays were fun to write and made me more engaged in the class than I would have been, which I appreciate. The grading for the papers is very much all or nothing, so if you get one little thing wrong they'll take off a lot of points.",
    "Strengths: Interesting material, engaging assignments, great professor!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture could be a bit repetitive and dry. I also felt there were some things about the exam\/test grading that were slightly unfair, though I do understand why.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-interesting information\r\n-very easy to learn \r\n-VERY lenient grading policy",
    "This course was engaging and Prof made it very accessible to do well. At times lecture felt long, but there were ample notes and study guides for exams.",
    "Strengths: Baskin-Sommers is an awesome teacher, really interesting information, not a lot of work \r\nWeakness: sometimes you get a lot of information thrown at you in one lecture so it's difficult to really take in all the information and facts.",
    "The course is very engaging. Students are given a lot of resources and the professor and TAs are super helpful and knowledgable. Each TA is assigned to a topic they are well versed in, which was really helpful. Arielle gave us a lot of opportunities to ask questions and get help. Grades were returned SO quickly, which was also very nice. Sometimes the lectures could be a bit repetitive, but ultimately that probably helped drive home the important points.",
    "Extremely interesting and engaging material and Prof. Baskin-Sommers does an amazing job at keeping everyone engaged in the lecture. The class assignments are also broken up in a way that keeps you involved in the material and truly learn all aspects of what is being taught.",
    "Strengths - very informative, lots of resources to help with learning, easy to communicate questions with the professor and TAs\r\nweaknesses - occasionally the information was presented very quickly without adequate explanation, leaving students confused for the duration of class.",
    "I enjoyed this class because I was able to learn the information without worrying about getting a bad grade (due to the grade drop policy).",
    "The course is designed in a way that you receive information that is much more detailed than what you would ever need on the exams\/essays, so I would recommend taking it if you are truly interested in the material and are enthused to delve deeper into the topics at hand than simply what is needed for a good grade.",
    "I found the course material to be challenging, yet interesting. Maybe if the lectures were more interactive or included more real-life examples of criminals it would be more engaging.",
    "Strengths - Arielle provides you literally all of the information and resources that you need to succeed. Great professor.\r\n\r\nWeakness - Lecture material was sometimes a little disorganized and confusing in how it was presented.",
    "Strengths: The professor is just stellar at what she does. She is also very dedicated to making sure everyone gets the most from the course and learns a lot.",
    "Professor Baskin-Sommers is such an impressive woman, and understands and can relate to students better than any professor I have had. it is very clear that her aim is for students to understand and retain the most important parts of her course, rather than to try \"catch\" them out for not knowing the simplest details. Her testing is very fair and her lecturing was extremely engaging, with very important and relevant information portrayed in a way we could understand its significance.",
    "The class was amazingly organized, the professor got back to us so fast it was unbelievable. This course was spectacular!",
    "The class has really interesting material and it can be fun to learn if you can get through the complex neuroscience part of it. Despite the fascinating subject, during the first half of the semester I often found myself dozing on and off throughout some lectures because of the vast amount of information thrown at us, and I wish the material we had to know for the exams was as explicit at the first half of the semester as it was during the second half. The study guides and definitions that were provided to us made the class a lot easier.",
    "Strengths: very organized lectures, professor keeps class engaged, low-stress environment",
    "Strengths: Professor and content is very very interesting",
    "Loved the way the class ran, especially the music before each class began haha. The essays and tests were very relavent to what we were learning throughout the year.",
    "The material was much more science-based and difficult than I was expecting, and I kind of wish there was born social psychology of criminal behavior than just the neurological foundation of it. In that same sense, I love the way the class structure allows you to pursue more difficult material without worrying about grades. I found the grading to be fair and considerate of the level of the material, and it had especially clear rubrics for every assignment.\r\n\r\nOverall, a great class and a great professor!",
    "Strengths: good feedback on essays, good opportunity for growth throughout the semester, really interesting material, passionate professor\r\nWeaknesses: it's a huge lecture unfortunately",
    "This course would be significantly improved if there were discussion sections for the class. In such a big lecture, it is easy to disengage. I think a strength is Professor Baskin-Sommers' flexibility with grading although I wish this were disclosed BEFORE the credit\/d deadline.",
    "Have at least one of the tests before the Credit D conversion date.",
    "The course covered a lot of information, which for the most part was pretty clear. Arielle was clear in class that it was her goal to slow down and present the information as clearly as possible, but there were times when it was hard to process what was going on. Having less content per lecture would probably help with this. The papers and exams were well structured and graded fairly, there was no mystery as to what would be on them.",
    "Expectations for assignments and exams are extremely clear, and Professor Baskin-Sommers does literally everything she possibly could to distribute all information pertinent to the course online. She is an active participator on Piazza and gives explicit, detailed answers to students' questions. \r\n\r\nI really appreciated that this class did not have a section, and that TAs were available to answer questions.",
    "The strengths were the videos and real-life examples of the psychopaths and externalizers we discussed. I felt like the neuroscience aspect was thrown in a little too suddenly and I had to cram a lot for the exam instead of learning the material throughout the course.",
    "Strengths are the professor, the organization of lectures, lecture notes, and engagement of teacher in the material. No weaknesses.",
    "The strength of this course is that even without a strong Psychology background, you can really understand the material. Prof. Baskin-Sommers also makes it really easy to get excited about the material, so the 1hr 15 min lecture that can be dreaded with a dry teaching style feels like it flies by and you want the professor to keep going!",
    "She needs to go through the lecture material a tad slower, hard to take notes and keep up with her",
    "- Strengths: interesting topics, cohesive and well organised lectures, reasonable workload and grading, very rapid marking\r\n- Weaknesses: too much focus on studies in lectures",
    "My weaknesses are staying focused throughout the entire lecture, my strength was understanding the material when writing essays.",
    "Very interesting lectures; I enjoyed going to almost every single one, and will miss having Arielle as a professor. \r\nSometimes the videos ran a little long, and might've been more effective if it was broken up with some explanations in between.",
    "This is a great class.  The Professor makes it easy to succeed but also makes the material extremely interesting.",
    "The course was great, overall. The material presented was engaging and the videos that the professor showed in class were very interesting and helpful to understanding the material and topics even better because most of them were real life stories.",
    "I thought a strength was it was very comprehensive however it was sometimes not the most organized\r\ni thought piazza was helpful but stressful sometimes because it was like an overload of information",
    "It was very interesting subject matter but was too much to remember or really focus on\/care about.",
    "Strengths: study guides, comprehensive lecture notes, Prof Baskin-Sommers' insane response time on Piazza (7 mins), interesting lectures, the professor's passion for the subject, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of TF involvement, fast and dense lectures",
    "This course was so interesting. Watching the videos during class to show examples was a great way to apply the information to real life. Honestly, nothing bad to say about it.",
    "Speed of lecture was fast at times and sometimes there is simply too much material to follow to fully process everything. Summary slides at the end of lectures are helpful",
    "This course was the most organized course I have ever taken at Yale. All information was delivered clearly and explained thoroughly during lecture. Outside of lecture, we had access to lecture slides and lecture notes that explained the slides. Essay assignments had clear rubrics, so you could always be sure about what is expected of you. We were given adequate study guides for exams and Professor Baskin-Sommers answered countless questions on piazza in a timely manner.",
    "The course was very clear and the grading was very quick.",
    "I liked how the assignments were spaced out and I appreciate the use of mixed media like shorts video clips in class. I also think that Piazza was an incredible resource, and I am so impressed by the consistently quick and thorough responses. \r\n\r\nI think that the readings were often very dense and hard to grasp and that there was not enough interaction with the TAs. I also think that some of the denser material could have been explored with more depth.",
    "This class was incredibly interesting. Each lecture built off of the last, meaning that nothing was ever too repetitive; it was extremely engaging and fascinating to learn. The material is well-presented through lectures, and the three essay assignments help supplement the information of the class. I feel like I learned more and knew I learned a lot because of these papers and exams.",
    "I loved how thorough and responsive Professor Baskin-Sommers was. Any question I had was immediately answered, and she did a great job incorporating student suggestions into her interaction with the class (e.g. releasing powerpoints instead of PDFs and providing helpful notes for the lecture slides). The course was very well-organized from the beginning, and I never encountered a problem that inhibited my learning. Professor Baskin-Sommers did an excellent job ensuring the material was adequately explained.",
    "This course was one of the most well-organized courses I've had ever at Yale. Professor Baskin-Sommers provides all the lecture slides and notes as well as study guides and rubrics for all assignments and assessments. Her and the TF's are also one of the fastest email responders I have ever interacted with at Yale. \r\nEven as a lecture, it is obvious this class is meant to help you succeed not only grade-wise, but also on learning the material and answering any questions you have.",
    "Professor Baskin Somme's is a great lecture and incorporates multimedia into her presentations well. She is also super active on Piazza, so questions get answered very quickly. The material is covered at a very reasonable pace, but you also still learn a lot.",
    "Cool material, reasonable pace, and professor Baskin Sommers is great.",
    "The material was interesting enough but lectures at times seemed tedious and at times moved way too quickly for harder concepts and more in depth studies.",
    "The course was interesting and engaging and the professor was great at providing feedback or aiding students that were struggling with he material. She also sent out many helpful guides and tips when it came to exams or papers. I felt like I was still a student in this large lecture course that I sometimes don't feel in smaller ones. Perhaps it would have been helpful if less readings were assigned per class (maybe just 1 or 2 smaller parts of different papers) because I often did not find reading the entirety of them to be helpful and it takes much longer to get through scientific papers than anything else. Even with the large amount of students enrolled, grades were given back with helpful commentary within hours of submission (sometimes) which was really helpful in preparing for the next assignment.",
    "Strengths: Arielle is an extraordinary professor! Her lectures and insights are incredibly detailed and knowledgeable, while also being made accessible to the students. Likewise, she puts an immense amount of effort in communicating with students outside of class. The TAs grade extremely quickly, the essays and exams are graded very reasonably and do not require an unnecessary amount of work. Weaknesses: None!",
    "No improvements",
    "The information was presented in a very convenient and understanding way, which facilitated my learning. I liked having Piazza to answer questions anonymously. I wish there had been optional sections throughout the course w\/relevant TFs to ask questions about a certain lecture or reading's contents.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the accessibility of the material. Not only were lecture notes and slides posted to review after class, but the professor and TAs were always there to answer any questions or clarify confusing information online. While this class is a large lecture, you can still get the one-on-one help of a seminar if you put in the effort. Bottom linethe resources for this course were vast and there is so much opportunity to learn.",
    "strengths: extremely interesting and captivating lectures, readings to supplement class info\r\nweakness: was in the law building so we couldn't bring food to class, and it was during lunch time",
    "Loved that notes were given out at one point, that really helped me keep track of what Prof. Baskin-Sommers what saying during class\/helped me know what was important. The material seemed dense at times, and we went really in depth so maybe summary more slides to capture the main points would be helpful. I appreciate that a.) we had review sessions and b.) they were recorded. I also liked the video clips we watched during class and felt that was very engaging.",
    "The course is truly terrific, structured for thorough learning, clear and cited conclusions, and real-world applicability. I learned a lot, both about the subject material and how to approach the subject material (a skill I can take to other areas!). I truly have little to no complaints and constructive feedback.",
    "The professor extremely knowledgable and passionate about the material, which made lectures extremely engaging. To improve the course, I would have preferred looking at fewer psychological studies because those parts of the lecture felt rushed and at times were difficult to understand.",
    "Professor Baskin-Sommers was a really interesting lecturer, and even more attentive outside of class. Honestly have no idea how that woman answered peoples questions on piazza so quickly.",
    "The course is incredibly well taught and well structured. I cannot think of any way to improve it.",
    "Arielle Baskin-Sommers is a phenomenal lecturer who kept students engaged and interested. She is phenomenal.",
    "The strength of this course really is the professor - she is AMAZING and really cares about her students. The course was so well run (the exams were graded in under 12 hours each time) and the TAs were great. The course really put emphasis on understanding the material, and they made it easy for students to do well if they put in the effort. All classes at Yale should be like this.",
    "The class was very well organized and explicit about what you needed to know. The rubrics for papers, study guides for tests, and other general guidelines were very helpful. However, sometimes the material seemed overly complicated. I know the goal was to familiarize us with the lexicon of the field, but it felt like many terms\/concepts could have been explained in much simpler words.",
    "The best part of the class was the topics for the essays because they were specific to individual criminals or children with conduct disorders. However, the essays were much longer than they needed to be. The class could be improved by focusing more on specific criminals and doing more case studies in addition to the broad topic of psychopathy.",
    "great teacher with many resources",
    "The course was fascinating and Professor Baskin-Sommers was a highly engaging professor.",
    "Lectures were interesting",
    "Teacher was fantastic, I believe the information could be more condensed and class notes could be improved",
    "Strengths are the professor and the lectures. Loved going to lecture and the exams were straightforward if you studied at all. No weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: Arielle Baskin-Sommers is the coolest, the content was often presented in engaging ways like through movie clips and famous cases like OJ Simpsons and Robert Dursts, the material is fascinating to anyone interested in psychopathy and crime, and the workload and grading was reasonable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of very fast note-taking of info during lectures, info could feel repetitive",
    "The class was very engaging, and I really enjoyed the way it combined case studies with neurobiology. I wished that we had spent more time on the legal implications of all that we had discussed instead of relegating it to the last class.",
    "This was by far the BEST RUN course I've taken at Yale. Everything was SO ORGANIZED and feedback and expectations were so clear. Everything was graded in such a short time. The material was pretty interesting. This was a great class.",
    "Sometimes I felt the lectures were a bit jargon-y for someone who is unacquainted with psychology.",
    "Very clear expectations, you really learn the material, engaging professor, amazing support\/response to questions from TAs and professor, assignments are graded literally within a day",
    "Taught very well. The tests were straight forward and as long as you studied, easy to do well on, the papers also allowed you to engage more with the material and show that you understand the informations from lectures.",
    "The course material was interesting, but soon became very repetitive and I lost engagement.",
    "I loved Professor Baskin-Sommer's lectures. They were super engaging and packed with a lot of interesting information. The assignments also were useful in helping us to apply the knowledge that we learned in lecture.",
    "This course was honestly one of the best I've taken so far. Professor Baskin-Sommers is definitely a highlight -- she is a very engaging lecturer, and she obviously is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and cares a lot about her students. Lectures were very well-organized and thorough, and preparing for midterms and finals was made very simple by the availability of study guides online. The papers were also really fun to write since they asked us to apply our skills to analysis of real-world situations.",
    "Really smartly structured class which seems to understand that in being a large lecture, there will be some people who do not come to lecture. Instead of having those people cram on one final, the five assessments were structured perfectly so that students really did have to understand the major themes of course material to do the assessments. Even though I went to lecture and felt like I learned a lot there, many students did not but still came out knowing a lot more about the topics of the course and having developed the necessary skills. Overall, the strongest element of the course was absolutely Professor Baskin-Sommers - by far the most responsive and organized professor Ive ever had, and extremely engaging lecturer as well who is also THE expert for the course material. There werent any major weaknesses of the course.",
    "Great class. \r\nExams and essays straight forward and fair assessment of learning. Engaging lectures and material.",
    "The course was overall fantastic. The way the lectures were organized was really well  done and facilitated learning. The one thing I would have liked to see is more topics in crime being covered.",
    "Sometimes, it felt like the delivery of content was a little disorganized during lecture. This was more than made up for with the very clear study guides for exams though.",
    "Strengths include Prof Baskin-Sommers, the way this course was designed to teach and make students interested instead of making them feel that they're just in a constant struggle for a good grade, and the content! very relevant\r\n\r\nWeaknesses = the law school rules about no drinks in the auditorium (literally get yelled at for WATER)",
    "I think this was a great large lecture class, but I wish there were some sections to provide more engagement for the course.",
    "Strengths are integration of graphics with information and well-timed responses for questions. Weaknesses are too little of a focus on biology, when that is hardest to understand, and more discussion forums.",
    "This course was great, Arielle is an amazing professor, the lectures are great- however sometimes they are a bit fast paced and note taking can get rushed.",
    "This class was really engaging. The material was very easy and presented in a way that made it easy to understand. The pace in class was really fast, but the professor posts the slides and her notes on canvas so most of the stuff you miss can be found later online.",
    "Super engaging course, amazingly organized, you can tell Prof. Baskin-Sommers knows this material like the back of her hand.",
    "Professor Baskin-Sommers is passionate about the field and this makes the class even more engaging.",
    "Lecture was hard to follow. Individual sections would improve this course",
    "Interesting content, very science and studied based, amazing professor",
    "Was a great course!! Strong in that we were encouraged to take risks",
    "The Professor is amazing!",
    "Strengths - Lots of Kinda Interesting Material, Questions quickly answered by TAs or Professor. Lots of Study Materials to do well on exams. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Not a lot of constructive feedback on assignments.",
    "The lectures are very interesting and if you listen in lectures (most of the time) and read the notes you'll do fine and learn a ton. She does speak quickly sometimes, and there are no seminars where you can further discuss the lectures.",
    "This was a very strong course with little to be improved on",
    "There were only strengths associated with this class. Ariel Baskin-Sommers is one of the best profs Ive ever had and could ever imagine. She makes this corse amazing.",
    "Very interesting course",
    "Arielle is a great lecturer! Just the material was sometimes confusing (neuroscience components)",
    "It was a well-organized and well-taught course; Prof. Baskin-Sommers really wants everyone to learn the material and do well on the essays and exams. She posts all slides and detailed lecture notes on Canvas, and she posts good study guides before each exam. I knew exactly what to study for and what to expect for the exams, which made them much less stressful. Same goes for the three essays that you write throughout the semester. Professor Baskin-Sommers and the TAs are also fantastic about answering Piazza questions (most are answered literally within minutes) and returning grades (most grades were posted within a couple days of taking the exam\/submitting the essay.)",
    "This course was incredible. Arielle is an incredible and brilliant lecturer. Her grading policy was incredibly generous. She was organized and prompt with her responses to questions on Piazza. Her expectations for assignments were also always clear. My favorite course at Yale so far.",
    "The class is generally well structured and I probably wouldnt suggest any changes!",
    "Loved it!",
    "I enjoyed all aspects of this coursethe lectures, assignments, and readings.",
    "Assessments were great, I felt most engaged in the course when working on the essays. However, apart from that there wasnt much sustained engagement throughout the semester because lectures were mostly for us to digest the material instead of analyzing and critically thinking about it",
    "This was the best lecture class I have taken at Yale (Im a senior). I love how engaged Professor Baskin-Sommers was during lecture.  Her enthusiasm for the material was clear. She tied what we learned into real world examples and encouraged us to do the same. Even the essays were fun since the topics were so interesting.",
    "Really great class, nothing to change!",
    "The material was fascinating and very important for everyone to learn to understand chronic criminal offenders better, but the lectures became a bit dry and repetitive after awhile.  The course could be improved with just a little more variety to the lectures, perhaps more connections to current events or something.",
    "Its very focused on neuroscience. Could be better if it was a little more broad and looked at more examples of criminal behaviour.",
    "TAs were accessible but took off points on our papers even when we followed the prompt EXACTLY!",
    "Dr. Baskin-Sommers gives wonderful lectures. Papers were on interesting topics. Videos supplemented learning.",
    "AMAZING piazza tas and Professor. Would have liked a little more guidance on essays because info was pretty confusing and easy to make small misunderstanding mistakes",
    "This course was awesome. Prof Baskin-Sommers is absolutely amazing",
    "So many resources to deepen learning, exams and essays were straightforward based on what we were expected to know.",
    "Strengths: posts both the powerpoints and the lecture notes online to strengthen your notes & make sure nothing is missed, clear essay rubrics & study guides for exams\r\nWeaknesses: no way to study from past exams",
    "I LOVED THIS CLASS! The professor really puts her heart into teaching and takes into account student feedback. (For example after the mid-term course evaluations she adjusted her lecture speed and put up notes to help students who may have missed what she was saying since she tends to talk quickly) I really really appreciated this. The course material is also organized very well. It is interesting and builds well. Professor Baskin-Sommers is on her stuff. She organizes the course well and teaches it wonderfully.",
    "Professor Baskin-Sommers was very thorough and help was easily accessible all thoroughout this course.",
    "Expectations were very clear and the professor was incredibly adaptable to our suggestions. I have no negative comments at this time.",
    "- The content was really interesting, Prof is a great lecturer, assignments were fair and tested knowledge. \r\n- The class would get extremely repetitive and probably did not have to be 1 hr 50 min.",
    "Strengths: Efficiency, clear concepts taught",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken because it's structured in a way that builds on itself but isn't an overwhelming amount of information. Everything you learn is relative, but it's not a hassle to learn; you simply learn by writing the papers or studying for the tests. I learned a lot more than I expected just going to class and doing the work, and I wanted to do it all because it was so interesting (and I'm not one to overwork). I can't think of a weakness because the professor (and TF's) were all amazingly available for a lecture and answered even the most ridiculous questions on Piazza. Arielle was by far the biggest strength of the course.",
    "Amazing lecturer, interesting material, perfect amount of support from staff - it was a wonderful class!!",
    "I really appreciated the dropping of the lowest grade -- that really ended up facilitating my learning and making the class enjoyable and worthwhile. I also loved the essays, I thought each one was super fun to write, and they were a good way to apply knowledge from the class. I wish this class had had a discussion section -- the piazza\/discussion boards on canvas were fine, but I would've loved to have deeper discussions about the contents from class.",
    "This course sometimes moved too fast, but the study guides and class notes were tremendously helpful in ameliorating this.",
    "The course is made very interesting - Prof. Baskin-Sommers is a really engaging professor and makes lecture intellectually stimulating as well as enjoyable",
    "This course has no weaknesses! And for those struggling with the material, extra credit is offered to boost your grades! :)",
    "It was much harder than it came across, with more specific knowledge needed.",
    "I think this course was very interesting, and overall, I really liked the structure of the course. It was a great learning experience without a lot of pressure. It was a large class, so it could have been easy to get lost in the crowd, but if you paid attention during lectures and completed the assignments, you definitely learned a lot.",
    "More about different disorders and their etiological causes than about criminality, but still cool. Essays strictly graded by rubric which is good and bad.",
    "I loved the course! Very engaging",
    "Could be improved with a little bit more structure for rubrics. Grades felt kinda arbitrary at times.",
    "It is a very interesting course taught by a very good professor. Maybe there should be section to reinforce the material taught in the course, and to have someone easier to approach to get feedback.",
    "The lectures felt a little repetitive at times, but overall I was very engaged. The review sessions could be improved by being in a smaller room, with more accessibility to ask tailored questions and have back-and-forth discussions with TF's.",
    "She reviewed the material a lot, which is probably helpful for some students, but I feel some of the review could have been cut.",
    "The course maybe provides too much information. Also, it uses many terms without defining them first which can get confusing.",
    "The course is designed to be very understandable for individuals with all levels of knowledge and background on the topics.",
    "there are no weaknesses, prof baskin-sommers is an amazing professor",
    "Prof Baskin-Sommers is AMAZING! super enthusiastic, helpful, engaging lecturer, very quick to respond to any student concerns. She also has a great team of TAs so all exams and assignments are graded SUPER promptly.",
    "The resources for the course are outstanding. The professor was amazingly helpful and well organized.",
    "Strengths:\r\nProf. Baskin-Sommers review guides and terms-to-know sheets; Piazza page; lecture notes and slides on Canvas",
    "I think the course was absolutely amazing. It is one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
    "I believe more shorter-term assignments would be effective. Sometimes the amount of content is overwhelming.",
    "Strengths of the course included the lectures, which were extremely helpful. Professor Baskin-Sommers explains concepts extremely well and is very engaging. The material is interesting and she is very kind and generous about answering questions about all assignments on Piazza. She is not strict about grading, which makes you want to learn and understand concepts instead of worrying about grades. One of the weaknesses is that some of the readings can be long and confusing, which may incline students to skip readings.",
    "Dr. Baskin-Sommers is INCREDIBLE! Like hands down one of the most engaging, dynamic professors I've had at Yale. She's the kind've person who makes you feel smarter simply by being in her presence but who you'd also want to grab a beer with. I'm not sure if its because she's relatively young and therefore can make references that are topical and relevant or because she makes a concerted effort to understand where we're coming from, or a combination of both - probably both - but she's amazing. She really goes out of her way to connect with students and know our names - even in a huge lecture. It's clear that she genuinely cares and actually wants us to learn the material. Instead of simply expecting us to regurgitate information, she makes sure that we're engaged in the material from playing relevant songs on Spotify before class to showing video clips of movies and tv shows we're familiar with as examples in class. The course was also extremely well-organized and everyone always knew what to expect - the study guides and paper prompts were posted on Canvas from the first day of class and nothing changed. It was nice to know exactly what was expected of us. Importantly, Dr. Baskin-Sommers PERSONALLY responded to all questions posted online literally within the hour. I'm not sure how she did it but it was wild. This course really didn't have any weakness that doesn't characterize lectures generally. More specifically, I'd say that I wish there were more opportunities to engage in discussions with tfs and\/or the professor about the material. But that's hard to do in a huge lecture especially one without a section.",
    "For anybody interested in psychology or neuroscience, this is a great course. I am not interested in those fields, but I still found the course remarkably well-designed. The class is not so much focused on criminal policy and law, which I thought it was; it is very much focused on the research trying to understand the minds of psychopaths, externalizers, kids with Conduct Disorder, etc., and we only really had one class about how that research can and should shape policy and law. We spent a lot of time with the nitty gritty psychology studies, and all the readings are basically studies. Therefore, I think the course should start with a little introduction teaching people in the class with no psychology background how to understand studies. Overall, Professor Baskin-Sommers is really trying to help you learn and succeed in the class.",
    "Too many essays. I think it would have been better to have 2 essays and 2 tests. I also think the information could have been summarized better, sometime there was too much detail.",
    "Strengths: Learned a lot of information and how to classify certain conditions\r\nImprovements: Making the course more engaging would not be bad, as the entire class was just lecture slides.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and think that Professor Baskin Sommers is an amazing lecturer. She speaks passionately and keeps the whole class engaged, which is impressive considering the size. The course material is interesting and engaging and it is not centered around boring facts and statistics. Also, she prepares you so well for exams and papers, answering any and all questions and providing study guides for all tests!",
    "strengths - interesting class with a good breakdown by assignments. great teacher",
    "The course is very well designed and allowed be to learn a lot of material without feeling like I was memorizing. I dont have anything bad to say.",
    "There should be one fewer paper.",
    "I think one thing this course could benefit from would be to include more case studies, or examples of real criminals and psychopaths and why they acted that way. I felt like we learned a ton about criminal psychology but didn't learn about a ton of people in the real world that could exemplify what we learned.",
    "in depth information about psychology and an unexpected amount of focus on neuroscience. A way this course could be improved is if we had the chance to diagnose someone based on one of Baskin-Sommer's interviews with suspected psychopaths in jail. That would be a more interesting way to engage with the material.",
    "Extremely interesting course with a great teacher who clarifies all questions.",
    "Strengths: \r\nAll of the information provided was very in-depth, detailed and informative. I liked that a summary slide was included at the end of each lecture because this helped refresh the main points. Also, I really liked that a study guide was given out before each exam that clearly dictated what to study, as this helped reduce my study time and helped me score highly on the exams. I also found each review session to be very helpful, and I liked that we emailed our questions to the TFs ahead of time so that they could go over each question in the review. I also found Piazza to be an amazing resource throughout the course; questions were answered almost immediately and in great detail, which was very helpful in preparing for the exams and writing the essays. Also, all of the slides and lecture notes were posted on Canvas, which was very helpful if I needed to fill in my notes later on. Finally, we were given able time to prepare for the exams and write the essays, which was really nice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThe slides used in lecture were often a bit too wordy and distracting; often times, the professor would explain what was on the slides or provide info that was not on screen, which I would often miss if I got too distracted copying the slides. In the future, it might be a good idea for the professor to post the slides after the lecture so students can still fill in their notes, and simply talk during lecture so that students are focused on what the professor has to say in class. Also, essay instructions were often vague and a bit unclear; I think better rubrics with more detailed instructions could have been provided. It was often unclear when and if we should pull in outside information, and how to do so.",
    "A lot of information but the professor is awesome.",
    "A lot of information to cover in one semester, but the information was interesting and flowed well",
    "The strengths of this course are that all questions by students are answered by the professor or the teaching fellows on Piazza and simply by emailing as well. They are very engaged and active within the course and are always willing to help students.",
    "Strengths: Concepts covered are very interesting! Very organized, always knew what to expect coming into class everyday.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of articles to cover every day the class met.  \r\nImprovements: Adding weekly homework assignments that analyze the assigned articles to force us to actually read the studies, since they are very helpful in grasping the concepts for test once they are read thoroughly.",
    "I think that because I have already taken neuroscience classes before, understanding the brain structures was not as hard for me as others. I do think that there was enough material provided for those that did not have a background in neuro, but I almost wish that there was an even greater neuroscience emphasis.",
    "It was an interesting lecture but it was difficult to remain engaged for such a long period of time",
    "The course was well organized. It could be improved by posting videotaped sessions",
    "The essay assignments are very interesting and invite students to engage with the material in different ways. Lectures and assignments engage with cultural applications. I think that the course could improve if more feedback were provided about essays and exams.",
    "strengths: facilitated student learning, gave students plenty of opportunities to do well in the class",
    "Great lectures--very interesting and engaging",
    "I thought it was a bit dry, but enjoyed the case studies.",
    "Strengths - interesting lectures \r\n- the notes provided \r\n- the grading system\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - too many statistics",
    "Material was very well organized. Topics were interesting.",
    "Great course",
    "Weakness: There were so many students in the class that the TF's were able to read the essays. However, I felt as though every TF graded differently and it really was luck of the draw."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this class if you are interested in the causes of psychopathy, conduct disorder, or other trends in crime. It's a very good course that most people would find interesting.",
    "Definitely. As a non psychology\/science major I still found the material enjoyable and engaging, and Prof. Baskin-Sommers is so committed, eloquent and articulate. She made taking this course so enjoyable!",
    "Would definitely recommend. It's pretty easy to get an A-. Also the content is cool and going to lectures is actually interesting, she shows a lot of relevant videos\/etc.",
    "Yes definitely. Very interesting material, and professor Baskin-Sommers is so accommodating and really cares about the material and the students",
    "Absolutely. Amazing class. Professor Baskin-Sommers is one of the best professors I've had at Yale.",
    "Yes, I think it's an interesting class and cool way to learn about psychology and more specifically criminal behavior.",
    "Yes!! Baskin-Sommers was an amazing professor and the information was so interesting. It's more on the neuro side so if you're interested in taking a class about brain mechanisms without it being too difficult, this is the perfect class. But at the same time you learn a lot about how environments and our current societal beliefs really impact criminals and why they do what they do. Professor Baskin-Sommers cares a lot about her students and ensures that everyone completely understands\/can engage with the material. She takes like 10 minutes to answer feedback and helps a lot with the assignments if there is any confusion.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material is very interesting, and Arielle presents it in a very clear and compelling manner. Communication between professor\/TAs and students is smooth and helpful. You are always sure of your standing in the class, and it also teaches great skills for future psych classes.",
    "Yes, the class is full of extremely interesting and engaging material and Prof. Baskin-Sommers does an amazing job at keeping everyone engaged in the lecture. The class assignments are also broken up in a way that keeps you involved in the material and truly learn all aspects of what is being taught. Prof. Baskin-Sommers is so incredible, so if for no other reason, take it to meet her and get to know her!",
    "Yep! You gain a lot of interesting knowledge, and it is balanced with a good workload (not too much work).",
    "Yes, the class was very interesting overall.",
    "Yes. The content was very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is a psychology major or someone who has been interested in the criminal mind for a long time. I watched countless amounts of shows and was intrigued by criminal activity, so this class was a natural match for me. This class only has 5 assignments (two midterms and three essays), so it was important to do well on all of them. However, it was possible to receive a perfect score on the essays as long as you answered every part of the prompt thoughtfully and supported your claims with evidence from readings and outside research. The essays are 3-5 pages long SINGLE SPACED, something I was not expecting out of a course that is NOT a writing credit.",
    "Yes! Great class for anyone, but especially for psych majors!",
    "Yes, simply impressive professor and great material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they want to take a class that the information they learn is not something simply to pass a class or fill a requirement. You become very engaged in the material and I think I will retain most of the content well into my life. And Baskin-Sommers is such a boss",
    "Yes, this class is a necessity. If a student wants to see just how specific the real world can be this is the class for them.",
    "Yes. take this class - the material is interesting, there isn't too much work, and the grading isn't too hard",
    "If you like psychology (and having a background in it is helpful in this class) and\/or want to learn a bit of neuroscience, I highly recommend this class. Also recommend if you like reading and writing about empirical papers.",
    "Yes! The content of this course was extremely intriguing, and I learned so much during every lecture.",
    "I would 100% recommend anyone looking for a credit, a SO, or a psyc elective take this class",
    "Yes! It catches your attention and I learned a lot about a topic I probably would have no interest in beforehand.",
    "I would, this class may be difficult at times, but the material and the professor make it absolutely worth it. The assignment structure is perfect as it is, giving you ample opportunity to make a good grade in the class when you put the work in. Of course it's interesting material, too, and I love to hear the professors experiences in the field.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course! If you have ever wondered why criminals do what they do or what happens in their brains, take this course. You will learn so much more than you ever believed was possible about criminal behavior in just one semester.",
    "It's interesting, but don't take it for a letter grade unless you're good at following directions PERFECTLY. They are ridiculously nitpicky with everything.",
    "Yes, Professor Baskin-Sommers is awesome and really cares about the material she teaches",
    "I would not recommed this class to another student. Truly, it was one of the worst I took at Yale. Attending lecture was difficult. The professor speaks too quickly, the slides do not clearly connect to one another, and it has WAY more to do with research than actual lived experience. Definitely got cat-fished in to taking this course. Do not recommend. Even if you are interested in law.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but be ware, it is not a course about a TV show. This class very heavily dives into the psychology behind psychopathy and externalizing, two disorders which I knew very little about. You will learn a lot over this course, but there is a lot of information, which can be especially overwhelming if you have never taken a psychology class before.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I learned a lot and did not feel overwhelmed. One of the few classes at Yale I feel like I was very engaged in.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in learning about people, take this course.",
    "Yes, it is a great way to learn about how the brain functions in terms of crime and how nature vs. nurture plays into the development of the criminal mind.",
    "Absolutely. This course really helps you to take a different look at the prison system and the way it handles inmates with mental health disorders. It also helps you to understand the neuroscience and psychological factors that influence behavior in individuals.",
    "This was an incredibly interesting course that taught about neuroscience in a way that was accessible even to those without neuroscience backgrounds.",
    "Yes! This is hands down the best class I've ever taken at Yale. The material so interesting that you actually want to learn it and study for the exams.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! This was an amazing course accessible to students with or without psych backgrounds. Professor Baskin-Sommers is just incredible and structures the course very clearly.",
    "Yes, gives a good overview of criminal psychology and the research studies that support current knowledge about psychological disorders",
    "Yes, I think the topic was interesting.",
    "If you're interested in this kind of behavior, I think it's a great course to better understand some basic concepts behind criminal behavior. Especially since Arielle is so, so knowledgeable about this topic.",
    "Class is pretty interesting but id definitely take it credit d.",
    "I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes, definitely. Interesting, fun, and engaging.",
    "yes, it was very interesting, professor is really smart and engaging. starts each class with music which was new and fun.",
    "This was a fine class. It got rave reviews from years past, but I didn't like it as much as I'd hoped. It was a lot of scientific\/psych information to take in and I never really knew what the main goals of the course were. Prof. Baskin-Sommers is amazing though, she tried to make us engaged with the material and even let us drop an assignment so that the course wasn't a source of stress. Overall, a great fifth class but only if you take it Credit\/D, otherwise it might be a little too much work for what it's worth.",
    "Absolutely. If you're a psych major, definitely take this. This class actually was what made me declare a psych major. I had been thinking about it for a while, but this s what sealed the deal. For non-psych majors, I think the material is super interesting and approachable, largely due to Prof B-S's teaching. A really cool class taught by an awesome person. I've never had such an invested, helpful teacher that truly meets people where they're at. She really wants everyone to succeed. If you have room for this in your schedule, definitely consider this class.",
    "Absolutely! Super enjoyable and if you are into criminal behavior, you will love it!",
    "Yeah, solid class. Put in a little effort and you'll do fine. Also fairly interesting. Good class to take.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are really interested in neuroscience, but not particularly if they are interested in crime, criminal justice, or psychology. It is deceptively almost exclusively a very dense neuroscience course (though it wasn't marketed like that during shopping period), except for the first three weeks of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because I thought it was really fascinating and provided interesting insights to problems I had never considered.",
    "I would extremely recommend this course to others; I have already told so many other students how much I've enjoyed this class and the information in it. The class asks you to pay more attention to properly diagnosing disorders or other behaviors in people, and asks you to take a more critical eye in the portrayal of 'crazy people' in the media, pop culture, and entertainment. I've taken away a lot of knowledge that changes how I see the world.",
    "Yes! the course was very well-organized and the material was presented in such a way that it was hard not to understand it.",
    "If you are interested in psychology and want a course geared for non-majors, take this class. It will probably be one of the friendliest classes ever at Yale, and though the workload is not small, it is very easy to do well simply because how much the Professor is willing to help you.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is interested in criminal psychology and behavior!",
    "If you're looking for a gut, go for it.",
    "Yes! Really great course- you'll learn a lot about a cool topic, Professor Baskin Sommers is great, and the workload is super manageable. Great fifth class.",
    "Yes- great fifth class. You'll learn a lot about an interesting topic, the workload is really reasonable, and Baskin Sommers is great.",
    "It's a great class to Credit\/D due to the two midterms and 3 papers. Enjoyable content though.",
    "Yes! It was interesting whether you are studying something related to psychology, neuroscience, anything because it is something that can be useful for people in everyday life, with interactions and understanding people in different situations (whether neurological or life).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Baskin-SOmmers is amazing and you will learn so much.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is extremely doable, though still intellectually challenging, with an amazing professor and incredibly interesting subject matter.",
    "Yes super engaging and understandable but still a challenge",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It gave me a new perspective on criminality and criminal behavior that I would have been blind to otherwise.",
    "Yes! Professor Baskin-Sommers is amazing. She is clearly very knowledgeable about the field and is extremely responsive to student questions. The information we learned was really interesting, and I learned a lot about psychopaths that I would have never expected.",
    "Yes. Loved this class. You have to put in the effort to stay on task, though. The professor does her part in making sure students are focusing on truly engaging with the material more so than the grades loved that most about this course.",
    "This is one of those courses that you need to take throughout your Yale experience. Even if you're not that interested in psychology, it's a great way to fulfill a requirement and learn so much at the same time. Professor Baskin-Sommers is incredibleshe is a great lecturer and is so helpful and accessible outside of the classroom! She is immensely knowledgeable about the subject and sometimes how much she knew just blew me away. Take this course if you can!",
    "Yes. Psych classes are usually interesting and this is an example of one thats purely fascinating and not too much of a stress or work burden. The professor facilitates stress free learning by being clear about expectations for each assignment and not trying to \"trick\" anyone.",
    "Yes! A really interesting course and Prof. Baskin-Sommers is engaging, funny, and very understanding\/fair.",
    "Absolutely! You won't do as many *fun and famous* case studies as one might assume, but your exposure to chronic behaviors and disorders is just as valuable and ultimately more meaningful in the real world. The class is a terrific blend of theory and practice. TAKE IT!",
    "Yes!",
    "This is a wonderful class. I took it credit\/d and with extra credit and following along throughout the semester I was able to really slack at the end, which I didnt even really want to do, because the class was so interesting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The professor is amazing and the content is incredibly interesting. Definitely a must take.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. The lecturers are fascinating, the material is engaging, and the work is reasonable. Also the papers and midterms are very straightforward if you attend lecture.",
    "yes DEFINITELY take this class- it is not too challenging if you put in the work, and it is easy to do well in. The marking criteria for the essays are very structured, and detailed study guides are posted for the exam. Also the lowest grade pf essay\/exam is dropped, and there is extra credit work. Definitely take if you want a chill, interesting and easy class.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have a specific interest in psychology\/criminal behavior; it wasn't as interesting as I would have liked for a fun, random elective.",
    "Yes! It was a fun class and it was not too much work. It was easy to do well if you put some time into the essays, and that process really reinforced what we learned in lectures.",
    "definitely",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Learning about criminals and the mechanisms behind their behavior was very interesting. Even if you don't plan on working in that field, it is still cool to gain insights behind the reasons people act the way they do. I learned valuable information in this course that I can carry through every day life, because we always hear about criminals in the media and in TV shows, but a lot of the time they are misrepresented, so I think this material is useful for everyone.",
    "Yes I would. It's very interesting and the goal of the work is to help the student learn and not make them worry about grades.",
    "Yes, it is very interesting to learn the explanations behind peoples actions",
    "Yes, fantastic course with great energy and at times quite interesting. Yet, the material can become repetitive and it is easy to become disengaged.",
    "100% recommend. It was amazing. I loved going to lecture, the material was fascinating, and the professor is incredible. She provided feedback, answered all student questions immediately, cared about her students, and demonstrated a deep understanding of the material.",
    "Strong yes!! Really interesting material taught by a great teacher who wants you to get a good grade.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot, and it changed the way I think about criminals and mental illness.",
    "Yes absolutely! I learned a lot and EVERYTHING is clearly laid out and organized. This was a great class!",
    "I took the course Credit\/D and thought it was good for that",
    "Yes, expectation are so clear and the material is worthwhile. Very easy to do well if you put in effort.",
    "Yes, definitely. It was very engaging and interesting material.",
    "Yes, I found the material interesting and the overall class was a positive experience.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was really interesting to learn about our misconceptions about psychopaths, and I left the course feeling like I had a really solid understanding of the risk factors involved in criminal behavior, how to assess them, and how to treat them. The paper topics were really interesting, and the exams were not difficult to prepare for. Overall, this course was really great, and I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you are very interested in the biological\/neurological underpinnings of psychological disorders that are related to crime, then you will probably enjoy this course. I would emphasize that if you are more interested in learning more about crime and its social context (as I was) you will likely be disappointed by this class. It focuses very heavily on the psychology\/genetics\/biology of crime, so expect it to be pretty STEM-y, even though it's a SO credit.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Amazing and fun class which taught me a lot about a really interesting topic.",
    "YES! Take this class. Professor Baskin-Sommers is wonderful. She is so engaging, even in a lecture of 400 people, she kept my attention. The workload isn't terrible, and the concepts are so interesting that you'll want to learn more. The tests aren't difficult if you follow the study guide, and the papers are graded fairly and by the rubric.",
    "Yes! So interesting and professor baskin-sommers is an amazing and wonderful professor.",
    "Highly recommend. Very fascinating material. Class is one of the few at yale that actually wants students to learn for the sake of learning. The work assigned is not busy work but to actually encourage us to engage with the material.",
    "Definitely a really interesting class. Honestly not too sure why I took it, but I ended up really enjoying it and learned a lot (even though I'm not too sure how much of that knowledge will come in handy in my day to day life). Very fun class, and the professor is amazing!",
    "This was a very solid course. I appreciated that the information wasn't watered down to make it more accessible and was taught at a great pace and level. \r\n\r\nI think that grading was horrendous and a blanket 5% subtraction for minute formatting errors is just silly.",
    "If you're interested in this at all, yes! If you're a neuroscience student, absolutely yes!! This is essentially a gut that counts toward the major.",
    "Absolutely!!!",
    "If you are interested in psychology then I would highly recommend.",
    "Yes because its fun to learn about and important in regard to understanding how to improve conditions for people with mental disorders.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, its super interesting and you learn a lot and the workload isnt insane. Great class.",
    "This class was not a lot of work but had a lot of payoff with the material. The topics covered were really interesting but not impossible to understand, and I learned a lot. I would highly recommend the class.",
    "Yes its as great",
    "YES absolutely. It is easy to get a good grade if you put the work in by going to class and doing all of the assignments.",
    "Absolutely! The class is beyond interesting and easy to do well in!",
    "I would. This course was interesting, but not very interactive. You get what you put into it.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes. Very interesting.",
    "Absolutely - super interesting, well organized, great professor!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The material is very interesting and the assignments can be slightly challenging but theyre graded very fairly.",
    "Yeah, has a lot of work but not tough to do well in.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to others as a way to look at a group of individuals that are far removed from the experiences of the average Yale student due to their incarceration in prisons and mental instability. It's a very interesting look at people who society deem the most \"evil\" as well as the effects of poverty and disadvantaged neighborhoods are mental disabilities and crime rates.",
    "Yes, its an excellent course with a great instructor and I definitely learned a lot.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Baskin-Sommers is an absolute expert in the field. She is an incredible lecturer and devoted so much to her classes and students. I came into the class with very little interest in psychology and left considering majoring in it.",
    "Yes, awesome course",
    "Yes for sure",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "Yes. This course critically examines misconceptions about the prison system. It also introduces students to neurological concepts.",
    "Yes!! Really interesting psych class that I would definitely recommend.  Its generally just interesting to learn even if you are not a psych major.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes, this class is interesting whether or not youre thinking about majoring in psychology or neuroscience. It makes you think more about the way people interact with others and question much about the criminal justice system.",
    "I would recommend this course as a laid back class with interesting material and readings.",
    "Yes, fun material and manageable workload",
    "Take this class! This was my favorite lecture course and one of my favorite psych courses ever. I am a senior psychology major.  It is so interesting and the work load isnt that bad. Professor Baskin-Sommers is so nice and supportive.",
    "Yes its a must take!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it has completely changed my perspective on chronic criminal offenders and illuminated me to the many problems of the criminal justice system.  Perhaps more importantly, I would recommend this course because it does cover some positive treatment findings that could actually help people.  The course was not graded strictly enough to prompt greater engagement with the material, but I still learned a lot from writing the essays.",
    "Yes if they are interested in neuroscience.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely. Fantastic instructor who teaches fascinating material in an accessible way.",
    "Yes. Great 5th course. Not too much work but still 3 essays and 2 exams",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, as someone who is confused by neuroscience, this was a great course that caused me to become engaged in the subject.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Baskin-Sommers is amazing and you can tell she wants each and every student to learn and engage in the class materials despite that there are usually 350+ students enrolled. The class was well-organized and workload wasn't bad at all as long as you don't procrastinate. In terms of the material, I was fascinated by all the topics we covered and learned so much about the origins and reasons behind criminal behavior.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. Its set up in a way to provide the most information possible in a way that is still easy to process and truly understand. The combination of both exams and essays truly tests how well you understand the content.",
    "I certainly would. It is interesting, well taught, well organized and really geared towards learning. Professor Baskin-Sommers is really here for her students. She responds to questions on Piazza in RECORD time, puts up helpful lecture notes and listens to student questions and concerns. She also incorporates videos, studies and interesting material into lectures and assignments through the semester. If you are looking for an interesting class to take where you will actually learn something that will stick with you and you can talk about with others outside of class with enthusiasm TAKE THIS CLASS because THIS IS IT!",
    "Yes, I would. Aside from the content itself, the course teaches valuable lessons which are transferrable to other domains like critical thinking, application to real world scenarios and appreciation of the etiology of complex phenomema.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it was engaging, insightful, and clear.",
    "Yes, they try really hard to make sure you will do great.",
    "YES absolutely. Dr. Baskin-Sommers is a fantastic lecturer, and I absolutely enjoyed every single one of her lectures about the criminal mind and the complexity regarding criminal behaviors.",
    "Yes this course was a ton of fun. The material is super interesting, the workload is pretty low, and Professor Baskin-Sommers is a great lecturer.",
    "Yes! Definitely recommend this course for an interesting SO credit with an amazing professor!",
    "Yes! If you have any lingering interest in the minds of individuals that aren't \"normal\" take this class! I also wouldn't recommend Credit\/D this class because if you somewhat pay attention you'll do well on everything and she dropped an assignment.",
    "ABSOLUTELY",
    "Definitely take this class! The concepts are not super difficult and Prof Baskin-Sommers is SUPER willing to help out on the discussion boards or over email.",
    "Yeah probably",
    "Yes - its knowledge that Im glad and I have and I feel it is something you should learn about during your life",
    "In all honesty, if you have not had the opportunity to take this course, your Yale education is incomplete. This course is so formative and we are so fortunate to have had it offered.",
    "Yes!!",
    "no unless you are very interested in psychology and the brain.",
    "Yes! This was a great social science credit because the material was super fascinating and Dr. Baskin-Sommers was amazing! It was a lot of fun to learn about the subject, and I cannot wait to discuss at dinner parties in the future!",
    "yes i thought prof baskin-sommers was clear and engaging and the material was interesting",
    "Yes! This was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. And the Professor is very dedicated to ensuring that we get a good grade and learn everything that we need to in order to master the material. On top of all of this, the material is extremely interesting and easy to follow.",
    "Yes, Arielle is a great lecturer and puts 100% of herself into the course. I wish I had reached out to her more.",
    "I would definitely recommend it because it is such interesting material",
    "No, the material is very interesting but there should not be 3 long papers and two exams its just unnecessary.",
    "If they have a strong interest in neuroscience.",
    "Absolutely, it is an incredibly interesting topic, and the professor is amazing.",
    "Yes, very engaging and interesting course material, and taught by an incredibly intelligent and warm professor.",
    "Yes, a fascinating psych class- but don't take if you all you want to learn about is serial killers, we don't learn about them.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the subject and will make the most out of it. There is a large amount of material to interact with and concepts to know, but once it is time for the test it is not so overwhelming because of the study guides.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you have any interest in the psychology of chronic offenders. Or, honestly, just take it to have a class with Baskin-Sommers. She is amazing.",
    "of course it is well organized and covers a lot of material, and the course is just fun",
    "Yes!! take it if you're at all interested in criminal behavior, the justice system, or general psychological abnormalities and their social impact.",
    "Yes. The course requirements are very clear and you have a lot of control over how you do. The assignments are fair and you learn quite a bit of interesting stuff about criminal behavior. Professor Baskin-Sommers is insanely well organized and helpful.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student (in fact, I already have - for the summer course) because of Professor Baskin-Sommers' knowledge of the material and her engagement in the course.",
    "Yes - if they are interested in the matter. Very fascinating!",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Extremely engaging and interesting fifth class. If you put the work in you'll definitely do well in the course. Professor Baskin-Sommers wants us to do well and doesn't mind giving people As (when they earned them). Have you ever watched a show or movie and been like wow what could cause someone to act that way or say or do that? Well, taking this class will help you better understand what might cause someone to treat people terribly, engage in extreme antisocial behaviors and appear to lack remorse for their actions. Basically, take this course because it is V interesting and you will learn A TON about why \"bad\" people and kids might do what they do.",
    "This class isn't a \"gut\". It requires a significant level of engagement if you want to do well because there are so many essays to write in addition to the midterm and the final. If you are interested in psychology and looking for a manageable class, this is a good option.",
    "No. I found the course to be interesting but I don't feel like it was worth the time commitment unless they have a big interest in psychology and the psychology of crime.",
    "Yes. Easy A and very informational and very interesting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was challenging and forced you to put in effort, but never unreasonable or anxiety-inducing. Professor Baskin Sommers is amazing and is always willing to help students. The course strikes a balance between the neuroscience behind criminal behavior and the facts and stories of people affected by this behavior. The anecdotes that Prof. Baskin Sommers adds in show the real world application of this kind of study.",
    "Absolutely. The class had a lot of information to learn, but it facilitated student learning, and the professor wanted everyone to succeed.",
    "Yes, very interesting and informative.",
    "Absolutely! Even if you are not interested in neuroscience or have no background in psych the information is still accessible and very interesting.",
    "Great credit D course--you learn a lot but it's not difficult to do well in",
    "Yes, it is a very good course in a very interesting field.",

    "This is a great overview of current research into criminal behavior. It is an interesting lecture and not too difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as it was incredibly interesting and insightful especially if you are interested in criminal psychology.",
    "sure, but understand that this is a very academic perspective on a popular culture topic.",
    "Yes. Great, clear course that taught what it was supposed to teach and where learning was accurately measured via exams and papers.",
    "Yes! The class is interesting and can be used for interests in all fields.",
    "If you are interested in psychology, sociology, the criminal justice system, or simply the etiology of crime, this course is for you! You will learn a lot about the brain, which, as a science person, I found very interesting, and you will also come to realize that crime is a much more complex issue than it seems at the surface, which is something we have to reckon with here in America.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because its covers an interesting topic and could show a student another direction in psychology.",
    "Yes! It is a very interesting course to take and you learn so much. The course work is manageable. What you learn after the class is something every student should learn about the systems of justice that govern our laws and how they discriminate the must vulnerable of individuals, and the ones that need most of our help.",
    "Yes, I think it would be a great class for anyone slightly interested in the topic -- don't be scared if you have no neuro background because this class has great support both in terms of the instructor and how the class is organized.",
    "Yes, extremely interesting and important and relevant.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it applies psychology to culture and politics and provides psychological insight to prison reform, which provided for a unique learning experience.",
    "This was a great course. Not too strenuous, interesting material, and the most organized and with it professor I have encountered at Yale. There were three papers and two tests, all of which had set due dates and topics with study guides from day 1. Lectures were interesting but if you had to miss one, there were slides and notes posted which also made reviewing much easier.",
    "If youre at all interested in the topic, yes its a worthwhile gut.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone seeking to learn more about psychopaths and their unique neural deficits and circuitry which helps explain their criminal acts.",
    "YES! Such an interesting course-- the professor cares about learning and makes lectures fascinating to go to",
    "yes, if the course was a little less dense and focused more on individual cases.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. Interesting course for those interested in psychology or not. Not heavy on specific psych\/neuroscience content.",
    "yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students, if they have an interest in psychology."
