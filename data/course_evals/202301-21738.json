                "Top tier class",
                "This class is unlike any other. Grant is truly so knowledgeable about this time period in music and it is such a pleasure to hear him speak, sing, and play to this music. He is like the renaissance man of Yale music. The strength is definitely Grant's expertise, and the camaraderie developed in the class by performing together. It's such a supportive environment.",

                "This is a fantastic course! It is so much fun to perform in an early music ensemble with friends and classmates. I learned a lot about Renaissance music and the techniques necessary to perform it. The style of this music is so different from traditional classical music, so it was great to be exposed to it and understand its structure. Learning a Renaissance instrument is a fun yet challenging adventure, but the reward of performing at the Beinecke was incredible!",
                "No weaknesses, the strengths are that the teacher is amazing and that the class is structured in a way that lends itself to rehearsal and music making.",
                "Incredible class. One of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale",
                "Group rehearsals were very productive. Breakout sections with voice parts were a bit difficult to manage without an appointed section leader, but were infrequent enough that it didn't pose a significant challenge.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Professor Herreid is a true expert on early music and an exceptional musician. He is also extremely charming and fun to work with.\r\n- Relatively high level of students. The class had members of the YSO, on-campus vocal groups, and graduate music school.\r\n- The opportunity to play in a large early music ensemble is very rare and I'm grateful that Yale provides it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The theory component of the class was really interesting, but I wish the content was covered in more detail.",

If you can't sight read very well you'll need to spend some extra time practicing, but even then I'd recommend the class.",
