I was able to take information from visual forms like movies and videos and be able to converse with peers and have a group discussion afterwards. I also learned how to perfect presentation skills in order to use my vocabulary and practice the grammar I've learned thus far.",

                "weakness: it's so so much work. it's probably a great course for trying to learn the language but I really wanted to be done at L3",
                "Strengths: Juliana is a great professor who really cares about her students. Assignments were given extensive directions on canvas, the use of short films was a fun way to be engaged with the course while also learning grammatical concepts. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes directions for class or assignments were changed last minute and so sometimes it became hard to prepare for class. Workload is high. We had to do \"ELC\" assignments which required an extra hour outside of class to attend an event (on top of the 4 days a week of class), however, sometimes the events were announced to the class last minute and so it was difficult to work around work schedules to attend. Grading, lots of times, didn't really make a ton of sense.",
                "There was plenty of content to learn from, but the assignments, homework, and presentations were too much to manage. We didn't follow the syllabus content and had extra assignments on top of the syllabus\/more than what other sections had to do. We often wouldn't get much warning before extra assignments which made it very difficult to manage our time. The asynchronous days were a lifesaver to try and get back on top of everything. Having so much work and the class every day made it difficult to be engaged and refreshed for every class.",
                "Strengths: The smaller-group format allows for more individual interaction with professors; group projects allow students to interact with each other and build connections while speaking Spanish; the asynchronous day is great for allowing students to catch up.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Daily Supersite assignments in the first half of the semester can take up more time than necessary.",
                "N\/a",
                "Strengths is that it focuses a lot on culture and relevant history in Spanish speaking countries. Weakness is it is too fast paced, and don't know grades until the very end.",
                "The course is really good at moving quickly through the L2 material again to solidify it. I think there were times where there were too many assignments to give them all proper attention. Some weeks we had supersite every day and assignments on top of it every day.",
                "Strengths: The multi-media engagement with Spanish through the use of videos, short stories, songs, etc, was such a strength and I really enjoyed the literature and art pieces we looked at in class and the connections we made to current\/global events. Additionally my professor always brought energy in with her and love for the language which made for a supportive and engaged class environment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found the organization of Spanish 130 to be a bit less coordinated than Spanish 120, that is, there were weeks were assignments worked together and others where it felt like homework done outside of class had little bearing on work done in class. Workload was uneven week to week. At times the syllabus would be updated without an accompanying note\/email though my professor did try to highlight work to focus on for the next day. More consistent communication about assignments, which ones would be graded, and consideration of the syllabus as it builds will help develop the class and mitigate the pressure to just get the work done. I will add, in the final week alone there was a pop quiz, two presentations\/projects, corrections, and a write up which can be a lot to juggle if you haven't planned ahead."

                "Yes. If you dont take this course youll probably lose what you learned in L2 because L2 moves so fast. This helps solidify. I also really like the many media we studied. The readings, short videos, and movies were all pretty interesting. The experiential learning credit events were also cool.",
                "I would if you are seeking to continue on from Spanish 120 or proceed to Spanish 140. As someone who started from Spanish 110 at Yale I found the transition from 120 to 130 a bit difficult as I felt that I lost some of my confidence with the grammar (which impacted how confident I felt speaking) but Spanish 130 also focused on connections between media and events which were really engaging to talk about."
