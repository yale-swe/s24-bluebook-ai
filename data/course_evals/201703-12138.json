   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Developed analytical skills to apply to scholarly articles and novels.  Developed vocabulary for discussing religion in an academic context.",
    "Though I took the class purely for science fiction, I ended up learning a lot about various religious traditions and about the idea of religion itself: why people need religion, what kinds of functions it provides, what it can be. We also talked a lot about science fiction, and how fictional religions found in sci fi novels bleed into the real world. We were exposed to many excellent sci fi authors that I had never even heard of before taking the class.",
    "I developed better skills at analyzing texts and drawing parallels and connections to other texts and outside ideas.",
    "This course offered a wide variety of novels, short stories, comics and movies that pertained to religion and science fiction. As a result, I gained a greater appreciation and knowledge base for the science fiction genre, and was able to deepen my understanding of various religions and their manifestations in media and literature. Also, clear feedback on my essays helped me identify some weaknesses in my writing and offered me tangible solutions to them that I worked towards over the semester.",
    "How to write intensive papers on literary pieces.",
    "I learned how to write college-level essays, discuss texts in a seminar setting, and use a generalized religious framework to analyze some of my favorite sci-fi books.",
    "I had the opportunity to practice college-level writing, and was reminded of how great reading for pleasure is.",
    "I learned how to discuss ideas in a seminar format, and how to read science fiction works through a religious lens. I also learned how to think more critically about the definitions of divinity, religion, spirituality, and more. I also learned how to write essays suitable for humanities classes at Yale."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Loved the reading material - great mix of novels, short stories, and academic articles.  \r\nI think this course should be listed as a writing credit, even if means adding one or two more papers to the syllabus.",
    "The course balances fundamental topics about religion and science fiction very well. I found myself very engaged with the subject matter, and the class turned out to be quite philosophical in nature, which I enjoyed. There was also a good balance of novels, stories, and films. While the comic book selection (Akedah) was a bit questionable to me, the other students seemed to enjoy reading a comic book for a change.",
    "I found the class discussions to be a highlight of the class. Professor Doerfler is supremely knowledgeable about both religion and science fiction, and effectively guides class discussion without much intervention. In addition, while the texts were quite interesting for the most part, the reading per class in addition to the small reading responses due before every class made this class a rather large workload. Also, while I received numerical grades on each paper, the class was essentially graded based on improvement over the semester as a whole rather than each individual paper, giving me little to no idea how I would end up doing in the class.",
    "Weaknesses: No consistent grading",
    "Honestly the only weakness of this course was that it wasn't listed as a writing credit. I enjoyed or at least was interested in pretty much everything we read, and Prof. Doerfler gave fantastic feedback on all our written assignments.",
    "I loved the readings for this course.  I was engaged by the fiction both in an academic context and purely for pleasure. I also felt that the reading responses (several short essays throughout the semester) provided us with a good opportunity to experiment with our writing.",
    "Strengths of the class are: The professor gives great feedback about essays and she is always available to discuss papers or ideas with you. The curriculum of the class is good, with interesting books chosen, and I liked the high amount of agency we had over our final projects. \r\n\r\nThe only real problem with the class was that we did not have enough time to read the books assigned, so many of my classmates and I had to read online summaries of large portions of the books. It's hard to balance the reading load of this class with other demanding classes."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes indeed, but mostly as an enjoyable course with a great reading list.",
    "Definitely an interesting course if you are at all interesting in science fiction. While there is a good amount of writing and weekly reading, one should go in with the expectation that the seminar requires more work than the average lecture. That being said, there's definitely more to take away from it because of this, and if you enjoy the readings you will find yourself engaged in the discussions and postings.",
    "YES.  This was easily the class that I looked forward to each week.  The texts were beautifully chosen and the discussions were very engaging and insightful.  Amazing class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody who is at least fairly interested in both religion and science fiction. While I wasn't well versed in science fiction in particular before this class, I found my genuine interest in both topics was important to engage in the class even if I didn't have a strong background in them. Also, because of the large reading assignments between class periods (~100-200 pages of a novel or 50-100 pages of dense academic reading), it is important to prioritize important readings to be able to work through it all.",
    "No. Very low workload to payoff ratio.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to anybody even slightly interested in either religion or science fiction. It was a very approachable way to take my first college writing\/literature class with a group of people who were mainly science nerds.",
    "Yes. The instructor was fantastic, and I really liked that the course incorporated fiction; I almost always had a book to read for both pleasure and academic credit. The course also gave me the chance to practice different styles of writing. The instructor was always available and so willing to discuss ideas that I felt I had a lot of support with my writing.",
    "Yes, I would. I think it is a great experience as a freshman seminar and I also got great writing experience\/feedback. The discussions I had in class were very involved and challenged me intellectually. I also met some great friends in the class."
