No stress, just incredible guests, dancing every class, and such a wonderful atmosphere!\r\n\r\nAlso we went to nyc to watch Daniel dance in Twyla Tharps In the Upper Room and Nine Sinatra Songs for free, which was incredibly inspiring!",
                "Yes! You learn so much and it is such an incredible opportunity to have Daniel as a professor. The course was once a week and it felt more like I was taking a dance class for myself rather than doing it for a credit."
