                "This course was extremely mundane for me. I felt as though the professor interacted with students very minimally. Her style of teaching was purely presentations that were hard to understand.",
                "The lectures are very engaging if you are interested in the material! For those who are less interested, it might help their focus to have smaller group discussions instead of full group discussions during lecture (turn and talk to the person next to you and then share out, etc).",
                "Discussion section does a very good job distilling knowledge and allowing for a stronger connection to the material; the lecture atmosphere is sometimes hard to follow with the sheer volume of information that is presented.",
                "Strengths: Lots of interesting concepts.\r\nWeaknesses: There was way too much reading for this class. Often, Professor Oskian would go over all of it in class to, so it was useless to actually do it myself. I felt like it was just being regurgitated to me. I think there should be fewer readings and philosophers so that we can actually understand each better rather than moving on so quickly. We also never get our papers back, which makes it hard to improve.",

                "Lectures were difficult to follow, but the readings and content were interesting. The syllabus was organized logically and there was a lot of comparison between philosophers.",
                "The strengths are the lectures, which are incredibly digestible and super helpful to learning the content of the theory without having to bend over backwards to interpret it, and the discussion sections, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The weaknesses are the lack of instruction as to how to properly write a philosophy paper for those who have never written one before.",
                "It was really good.",
                "The strength would be that it exposed me to a wide range of political philosophy, but the reading could sometimes be a little overwhelming. I think it would have been better to assign less hefty reading blocks because I found myself getting lost and distracted at times. This would also help to make the class more effective and engaging.",
                "Strengths are in its TAs who offered amazing support but the in class experience was very boring and monotonous.",
                "Directions in some assignments were unclear with lack of teaching.",
                "Strengths: Slides were helpful to know what the readings were saying \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I didn't understand what the professor was saying in class",
                "The course was honestly boring. It was bearable, but I never felt excited to go to class.",
                "Strengths: very resourceful and insightful prof. her lecture slides are very detailed, she provides them all, along with the readings, and her interpretations of the quotes, arguments, etc. during class are really helpful in aiding your personal understanding of what the thinker is trying to get across. Great TA, I thought he encouraged our thinking and helped lead us to salient points well."

No, Prof. Oskian isnt the most engaging lecturer, but shes a good professor otherwise. I do hope that shell reflect on why shes had to make attendance mandatory, perhaps using very engaging philosophy professors like Shelly Kagan (who doesnt have an attendance problem) as a reference point. The readings were doable, although they werent distributed entirely evenly, so the weekly reading volume was, at times, hard to predict. The essay topics were interesting and fun to engage with. The grading was reasonable, although it took unacceptably long for our graded papers to be released to us (so much so that I couldnt account for my second-paper feedback while writing my third paper). Generally, I wouldnt shy away from this course if political philosophy interests you, but I wouldn't take it as an elective, either.",

                "If you've never taken a philosophy course and want to try it out, I strongly recommend this course. The subject matter is accessible since we tend to center around American civic life and institutions. If you are not familiar with the American government system, it might be a little less intuitive; however, all perspectives add to our broader understanding of evaluation."
