    "This class made me declare the English major. I absolutely loved taking ENGL 125! We learned so much about the development pf the English language and different types of poetry. There were some texts I enjoyed better than others but in general the works are well selected and flow well from one to another.",
    "I learned to engage with texts written in old English, which stretched my linguistic understanding and pushed me to understand poetry as much by spoken sound as by content. Moreover, I learned ways to better focus my poetic analysis and make more specific comments on style and artistic choices.",
    "Opportunities to read a diverse set of English works ranging from Chaucer to Milton\r\nHow to analyze lines of poetry in depth\r\nHow to write concisely and accurately on close readings and paraphrase",
    "I developed my ability to consider a text's structural set-up when analyzing texts. This course also helped me develop the skill of analyzing works at a higher level; it forced me to consider the possibility that there may be more than one possible message\/question that the author is attempting to convey.",
    "I learned the timeline needed for writing a paper and how to think critically about poetry",
    "I learned how to translate and properly analyze poetry.",
    "I learned how to use syntax to analyze poetry and how to look deeply at language to further flesh out analysis.",
    "I learned how to analyze poetry and focus on the mechanics of poetry"

   "comments": [
    "great reading list; pacing could be switched up a bit, I would have appreciated more time on Paradise Lost and less on the Canterbury Tales",
    "There were some occasions on which discussion seemed to lag and there wasn't a great deal of effort made to invigorate it, but that is really dependent on the students in the class. For the most part, this class was engaging and the readings were stimulating without being overwhelming in their pace.",
    "Strengths: diversity in course readings, discussion-based learning, peer-reviewed writing help and advice, class size (<10), rewarding for non-majors and majors alike\r\nWeaknesses: workload (oftentimes I felt I needed to skim over interesting\/important parts of the readings just so I had enough time to finish work for this class and others), academic diversity - only one non-English major (me)",
    "strengths of the course: thorough class discussions during the seminars; ability for students to drive\/guide the direction of the discussion through their blog posts on Canvas\/through the questions they posed during class\r\nweaknesses of the course: none",
    "I think that it works well as is",
    "It is boring. More creative projects and presentations might make this more enjoyable. Maybe make group projects or something that forces people to be more engaged and encourage discussion. We spend a lot of time talking about the poem, but not how to make the poem. Occasionally we would be presented with an option to make a poem like the ones we read, but we never really learned how to make the poem. Going down a more artistic and creative route rather than the standard discussion based set up would make this significantly more bearable.",
    "This course teaches close analytical skills very well. It helps students look very closely at everything from specific word choice to how meter affects the meaning of lines. I would say that overall this is a very strong course and you learn a lot over the semester. The materials that we read came in a natural order and it transitioned nicely between them. It also built upon principals learned early on in the semester and continued to flesh out concepts and ideas at a nice pace that was both challenging but easily followed. It was not slow enough to be considered an easy class but I never felt overwhelmed or unprepared for any of the assignments or texts. The class encouraged collaboration and a lot of the discussions were class lead, which helped generate ideas and conversations that enriched our understanding. I do not have any weaknesses to share.",
    "Strengths is the discussions we had in class based on the blog posts and the creativity we had in writing our own sonnets. Weakness is we don't turn in our drafts but can only have it looked over in office hours"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes; great class, even for non majors; the works are interesting and fun to read",
    "I would recommend this course to English majors in particular. There is a heavy load of reading, but it is really so engaging if one annotates and really invests in analysis. This is a rigorous course, so I would not recommend it to a student merely looking to fulfill a writing requirement, but would definitely advise all English majors to take it.",
    "Definitely take for the English major or if English poetry is your favorite... just expect 2-3 hours of reading and annotating every class meeting. Three papers, two 2-3 page assignments, and 12 blog posts spread over the semester make up almost all your grade.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if they wish to develop their literary\/critical analysis skills; the class challenged me as a writer and really forced me to move beyond high-school level essay writing.",
    "I would recommend it if they are already interested in the subject matter",
    "No. It's boring. I found it so hard to engage myself in this because I had no idea that the majority of the course was going to focus on middle English and recitation was a surprising chunk of it. Not only is poetry cryptic by nature, but middle English poetry has some substantial lingual and cultural barriers. Other than that, every unit has a similar format, read, discuss, write an essay. There is no interesting project, no reason to consistently engage with classmates. It leaves much to be desired even for those who come in loving this type of poetry.",
    "Yes. This class helps tremendously with analytical skills. I am a first year and I would say that this class alone doubled my understanding. I would only recommend this class for students who are either really interested in literature or are planning on pursuing an English degree as it is not an easy course and it does require effort. If you enjoy this area of study, however, this course is very rewarding.",
    "Yes if you want to learn how to read and analyze poetry. But I wouldn't recommend it if you don't need to take it for the English major."
