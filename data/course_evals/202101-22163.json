                "I gained a broad overview of Cuba's history and culture from the 1600s up until the 21st century. We discussed slave revolts, Cuba's tricky relationship with the US, Cuban literature & music, Cuban fashion during the 1980s, the exile community, and of course the Cuban Revolution.",

Class had a strong mixture of historical readings that offered background and selections of cultural sources -- literature, film, music, etc. I definitely came out of this class with an understanding of the nuances of post-Revolutionary Cuba, its contradictions and achievements."

                "While I think the readings for the course were interesting, there were no trigger warnings for pieces that were quite graphic and traumatic. Furthermore, our discussions in class primarily centered around mainstream notions of Cuban history and left out the perspectives of most communities except for in specific moments. I think the class could be improved by a syllabus and focus that includes a better variety of perspectives beyond just hinting that they exist or are hard to find in \"academic sources.\"",
                "The texts used in this course are its strongest element! They are varied, interesting, and engaging, and help to paint a fairly complete picture (especially for a survey course). I think that this course's discussion elements could have been slightly strengthenedthe professor often had a lot of material prepared, so the seminar occasionally felt more like a lecture, and I think that a more student-led discussion could have been fruitful. However, I acknowledge that the online seminar format has been less-than-ideal, which was a certainly a factor of my class experience.",
                "It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Laguna has done an amazing job fine tuning the course. Each reading and assignment had a specific purpose that made the experience as enjoyable as possible.",
                "Strengths are that Dr. Laguna is really really great and I learned a ton about Cuba in a pretty accessible but also rigorous way. Weaknesses were that we did not get to go to Cuba, of course, and that Dr. Funes no longer is co-teaching.",
                "Strengths: GREAT professor!! The assigned readings and discussions were very engaging. The workload was manageable (especially since the readings were interesting). Content was very strong. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of any!",
                "Strengths: Prof. Laguna is a engaging; course material is well-selected; Cuba is fascinating to learn about in-depth\r\nweaknesses: not many. class is really well organized."

What I loved about this course is that it situates Cuban culture within a historical context; we would read about a certain historical period and then have other readings about a specific aspect of that period (e.g. fashion, music, literature). Even though it was over zoom, the discussions were very interesting and engaging. The professor is also very kind and understanding! Highly recommend this class regardless of your major!",
