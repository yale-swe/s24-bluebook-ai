                "I believe that I have learned how to properly study for a STEM class. I did not know how much effort I would have to put in, but with the help of professors, it made the course easier.",
                "I learned a lot about how the concepts in Calc 2 connect to real-life examples, especially through the Explorations because they explained the concepts in ways that they could be nderstood more logically rather than conceptually.",
                "Since the course was so cumulative, I made sure that my understanding of a given topic was solid before allowing myself to move on. If I had any questions or confusion about a topic, I made sure to seek help so that I would not continue on with the course on a shaky foundation. This mindset is valuable for all my courses.",

It was a necessity in this course to be able to whiz through problems without much of a thought as to \"what is this?\" It wasn't satisfying, but it got the job done. And I do understand that part of math is turning computations into muscle memory. This class did that."

                "I appreciate how the course was taught in a seminaresque style, which allowed accessing the professor easier. The class size was also appropriate.",
                "An overall weakness is the difficulty of the problem sets. They are much harder than the questions asked in class and harder than what appears on the exam. It makes doing them cumbersome and frustrating. One thing I liked was the explores.",
                "Strengths were online resources available and the practice tests. Weaknesses were that some lectures were not helpful.",
                "The explorations on Canvas are very helpful to learning the material, but they only explain the surface level concepts and its harder to answer more in-depth questions.",
                "I liked the exposure to the material I received through the explore activities; I think those were more helpful to my understanding of the topics than I realized. Furthermore, the peer tutoring resources, review sessions before the exams, and access to practice exams were all very helpful. I never felt like I had a lack of support while learning the material.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe course was well-designed, not leaving any conspicuous gaps of knowledge for students.\r\nThe problem sets assigned by the course were also sufficiently challenging and helped me prepare for the test.\r\nBy setting numerous smaller deadlines, the course encouraged students to review often and retain their knowledge.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nCourse material is not the most interesting, but this is not the professor's fault. Probably mostly my fault actually.",
                "The problem sets were often more difficult than the exam questions, so they prepare you well for the exams. Peer tutoring is very helpful when working through problem sets, so the problem sets are not too overwhelming if you get the help you may need. With the class not being a large lecture, there are not class recordings, so you have to make sure to take thorough notes in class. The class can feel long, so it can sometimes be difficult to stay engaged and diligent with notes.",
                "I would say I am pretty solid on this topic, although I could benefit from practicing the theoretical.",

                "Whether if one is taking this for their major or quantitative reasoning requirement, I think MATH 115 is a pretty good course to take. It is what you would expect, but you get a lot of resources outside the classroom on Canvas, with Office Hours, and review sessions. I wouldn't take this course for fun though.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course especially if you are only in need of one calculus course. Even if you did not take calc BC in high school, you should be able to do well in the course without feeling far behind. As long as you have a general understanding of calc 1, you can work your way through this course.",
                "I feel like this course greatly changes with the professor you get. I would recommend my professor.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, so long as they were willing to treat these difficult subjects with the same respect and dedication that they would treat the grammar rules of a new language. It also helps if you have an innate interest in the conceptual significance of calculus. But that has to come from within when taking this course, because in my experience, it was not part of the class experience. In fact, I was constantly trying to remind myself why I used to love math."
