                "I learned a lot of very helpful insights that I will carry with me in my private and professional life. Lots of insights about the role of science, politics and policy in decision making, as well as important awareness about the importance of engaging with communities and understanding locals communities' interests, concerns, challenges and preferred strategies to solve a problem they face, rather than imposing a top-down approach from our position. The professor really thought of us as people that will someday lead groups of people with different types of expertise so he gave us lots of insights into how to lead groups and combine different areas of expertise and interests.",
                "I learned how to engage with political theory, science-based policy, and resource management in new and exciting ways. I learned to question what I assume to be true and approach scientific formation with a critical lens, and the examples in the class really hone our abilities to do this.",
                "This course developed an important tool for policy analysis, the IAD framework. The course also offered unique perspectives via the special guests and content we engaged with.",
                "I learned a lot of theory surrounding agency, democracy, human nature, and more.",
                "This is the only class I've taken where I've heard of the IAD framework and been asked to apply it. It's really great for learning this new analysis structure and getting to really dig into something you find interesting. You get to learn about a lot of different things through the course readings but become an expert on one thing you choose.",
                "I learned about Elinor Ostrom's work (Institutional Analysis IAD Framework), how the tragedy of the commons is not true, the power of science in influencing policy and vice versa, and lobster management in Maine. Wrote a IAD 15 page paper and learned how to go step by step to analyze the efficacy of a policy"

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the Professor is very enthusiastic about helping his students learn and deeply cares about our learning. the class was also a wonderful group of people, I don't think I ever had this nice of a group in a seminar, everyone was super engaged and interesting and the class environment was wonderful. Weaknesses: assignments are very unclear, my classmates and I would always find ourselves asking a ton of questions to the professor and each other, because instructions were not clear and the professor would not really clarify much. It wasn't even clear what the purpose of the paper was at the beginning, which made some of us choose our topic kind of blindly. The readings were simply too many for no reason, I think lots of them were very dry and not engaging. It'd be nice if future syllabi included more up-to-date examples of resource management. Some grades came back very slowly, and feedback wasn't extensive so it was hard to find guidance for improvement. On the other hand, when some of us asked for extensions we always had to get a dean's excuse. It'd be nice to have one chance of delayed submission per semester because life happens.",
                "The seminar is a wonderful mix of so many interesting subjects, but sometimes I fear it is almost too broad. Shifting from China's one-child policy to lobster fishery management is a pretty big jump (though you see the connections between the two eventually), but manageable with engagement in discussion. Still, the breadth got a bit overwhelming at points. Class discussions were really well-facilitated.",
                "The strength of this course is its great depth of analysis. The weekly memos were also helpful in digesting heavier readings. Something that could be improved is having slightly more engaging discussions by not having a queue and rather letting people just speak out.",
                "The directions were sometimes confusing, as Prof Fotos would assign the weekly work in the language of the IAD framework before you really understood what it was so I had to simultaneously try to figure out what Prof Fotos was asking for and also do it and it was challenging sometimes. It was hard to see the pieces of the IAD framework as they were supposed to come together at the beginning because I just had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. On the other hand, I gradually realized that Prof Fotos was intentionally a little vague to give us as much creative freedom as we could do work through the unique problems of each case. Professor Fotos did a good job of exposing us to a lot of concepts and having good class discussions and investing in each student so that we all cared about what we were doing.",
                "Strengths: IAD framework was cool to learn about, left feeling more optimistic about the possibilities of collective action, improved my writing to be more concise, very short discussion posts every week, had different activities every seminar\r\nWeaknesses: barely any readings from the past 20 years - would love to see an updated syllabus where at least one week or unit can address the role of science\/policy in current affairs. readings can be dry also, especially Ostrom's entire book of governing the commons. People were also confused about how to use the IAD framework in their paper"

                "I gained a lot of interesting and valuable insights but also wasted a lot of time with many readings, so I'm not sure if I would retake it. I think if the syllabus is updated, the readings made more effective, and the assignments made clearer, the class would be awesome. It is also quite unique to have a professor like Fotos, he's very caring and invested.",
                "Yes! The workload is a lot, but the new ways of engaging with science and policy are absolutely worth it. I will say, definitely reach out to someone who has taken the class before and ask for their advice about choosing a paper topic -- you have to choose early, and when you choose you aren't even really sure what you're selecting your topic for until it's too late.",
                "Yes, this course was a great way to engage with the EVST program and learn about useful frameworks of thought.",
                "Yes, but remember it is a writing credit.",
                "This class is very interesting but also extremely specific. I didn't realize going into it how much our independent projects were really what the entire course would be about, and that the subject you choose at the very beginning of the semester is what you're stuck researching for 3 months. If you're going to take this course, I would recommend having a pretty clear idea of your interests going in as it will help clarify a lot of indecision at the beginning and help keep you more engaged throughout.",
                "I would recommend for the sake of taking a class with Professor Fotos especially if you are an EVST major. I also do think that I learned a lot in this class - just be ready for some weeks for the readings to be drier than others. Good for those interested in environmental policy and learning about the intersection of science and policy"
