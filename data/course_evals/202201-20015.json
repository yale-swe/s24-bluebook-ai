                "I really improved my historical writing skills in this course, largely through the encouragement of Prof. Hinton and the guidance of my TF. I enjoyed the diversity of the types of history we studied, from cultural to social to political and legal history. I also appreciated the diversity of strands of Black thought and resistance we explored.",

                "I learned about the making of history, race relations in the United States and the history of African Americans. Particular emphasis was put on how history is produced in both racist and anti-racist ways and historical methods. Also learned about a ton of content in African American history, key events, people ongoing dynamics and conditions, from roughly 1860 until 1990. Also writing instruction was given in section about how to write a history paper. Feel that I learned a lot of important material, would highly recommend.",
                "I learned so much about Black history that I hadn't been taught in high school or in other classes which just shows how much is overlooked. I also learned more about how to write a history paper and what a good paper entails, especially in terms of making a good thesis statement. You really just learn so much about all the ways that history has failed and tried to redeem itself, but there's just so many factors that have contributed to the way America is today.",
                "Tons of new knowledge on US history from a new lense",

                "I definitely learned about writing a history paper. Its a different type of writing, but I had a lot of fun making it my own.",
                "I learned how to think about history in a more critical way and it also really made me relearn how to write a historical essay.",
                "Solid course for understanding themes and continuities in African-American history. Probably better for people who know less about AfAm history (e.g. just general US history) than people who are super knowledgeable, but everyone will get something useful out of this course.",
                "How to analyze historical documents, how to make compelling historical arguments, how to see the world through the lens of the oppressed, how to trust the experiences I have as the source of historical fact, how to analyze social causes and transformations of racism and suffering",

                "Gained a lot of knowledge of key events in African American history, improved writing skills and got to read some interesting, but challenging, books",
                "I really learned so much more than just like an overview of African American history. Like there was a way for Professor Hinton to have done this class that was so general and so boring but I really felt like she did a good job going into maybe a couple of specifics for each unit that we learned so it felt like I had a really deep understanding of say like the role of black blues singers in the 1920s.",
                "I learnt a lot about African American history, including knowledge about movements, individuals, ideologies and more. I learnt that the history is complex and hard to sum up in one course!",

                "I learned a lot about African American history - it was a really great survey course that went through every decade. I also got better at historical writing and using sources.",
                "I learned how to critically analyze historical documents and literature and how to use the past to make sense of the present.",
                "I gained skills in research, planning, outlining, thinking, and note-taking. I gained insight on many historical events, processes, and periods. I gained new perspectives while strengthening skills in critical thinking. This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale, I have learned so much from it!! I loved the curriculum, readings, primary sources, and outline.",

                "This course had really diverse and engaging lectures and readings. Although some of the reading was daunting, I got a lot out of it, especially the Wilkerson. I found the Du Bois harder to tackle, particularly at the beginning of the semester, and worry it may have led some students to drop the class. I also wish we had spaced out the semester better so we could have spent longer on the past 50 years -- Prof. Hinton kept hinting at future lectures on mass incarceration and policing, which I know is her specialty, but we sort of ran out of time to study those topics.",
                "Strength: solid history instruction\r\n\r\nWeakness: could be recordings for students and auditors",
                "The content and Professor of this course were both fantastic. The content was really, really interesting and valuable, and the Professor was very engaging. Section was also run well to both stimulate learning and improve how students were doing in the class. My only note is I wish there had been a bit more focus on the daily lives and macro trends over the period and a little less on the great figures and watershed moments in history, but this is a difficult balance to strike and the class did quite well overall.",
                "It was good for an intro course in giving a lot of background on Black history.",
                "The flow of the class was really nice, and I liked how we got to see Black history in a variety of contexts and mediums too. I wish we could have explored those a bit more but I know that we were already so limited and Prof Hinton was really trying to give as much info as she could minute to minute. I also felt the readings to be very engaging, especially reading Wilkerson because it almost didn't feel like academic reading but just following along someone's life story.",
                "Strengths would be her lecturing! She's a brilliant lecturer.",
                "No improvements it was amazing!!",
                "strengths: strong lecture\r\nweaknesses: some of the readings were uninteresting",
                "Lecture could be slower",
                "Mostly strengths! The lecture was engaging, I loved my section, amazing professor. No complaints, truly.",
                "This class was amazing and I would highly recommend it. i think it did a great job at teaching african american history in america, both more common sky known history and then also history that is often overlooked. at times the readings could be overwhelming but they were all very valuable to read.",
                "The lectures were shocking. Never learned a thing from them, it is a good thing that prof. hinton assigns good books.",
                "Strengths: Hinton is very passionate about the subject area and that comes through in the lectures. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly readings were a bit long for a lecture class where we didnt really get to dig into all of them super well.",
                "Strengths: very engaging material, see the historical connections that can be made in the black experience, get a general understanding of how black people have contested and redefined what it means to be a spiritually grounded human being\r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes discussion questions were slow, felt like last three weeks of class was rushed",
                "strength: the class successfully revisited periods of african american history they are traditionally overlooked and framed these historical periods in a way that made them easier to understand \r\n\r\nweakness: sometimes it was difficult to keep up to the readings, the majority of which we did not have time to discuss in-depth or at all during discussion sections",
                "Strengths\r\n- section was well taught and quite fun\r\n- interesting material covered in lectures, often focused on real people which was cool\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- lectures and sections and readings didn't have a whole lot of overlap which made it easier but gave less of a collective experience\r\n- too many pages of readings were assigned, it was overwhelming",
                "I think Professor Hinton and the tas are definitely a strength. Professor Hinton is young and engaging and really open to talking with you outside of class time about the course. \r\nI wish we had had more smaller writing essays or assignments so I couldve had more practice to improve my history writing besides just the midterm and final.",
                "Strengths - Professor Hinton was a great lecturer and picked engaging topics every week, as well as some lectures with film\/media which was nice. The TAs were really engaged and section was structured pretty well. The reading was, for the most part engaging, and there was some room to explore personal interest in the first paper, but moreso in the final paper. \r\nWeaknesses - it mightve been hard to know how to write a good history paper if you havent already, but the TAs marked relatively liberally so it wasnt a problem. There was a substantial amount of reading every week that could get repetitive and sometimes a little bit dry, it was hard to keep up with. There were weekly discussion posts but they were mainly completion",
                "soooo much reading, like way too much. even TFs knew we couldnt get through all of it which made overall motivation for the course low",
                "The course covered a lot, but I felt it moved too quickly a lot of the time and we didn't get the chance to dig deep into the material.",
                "A strength of this class is the narrative way that Professor Hinton lectures. It is rich, engaging, and clear to follow. Although it is a writing credit course, I felt there was not much peer engagement or peer review that I had received in previous writing credit courses.",
                "There are a lot of readings that get very overwhelming, but other than that i thought it was paced fairly well and done well. Discussion sections are very good.",
                "The lecture is catered perfectly for students to learn.",
                "I liked the use of multiple sources and the readings that introduced us to both primary and secondary sources. As for improvements, I think the pacing could have been a little better so we weren't rushing through the end.",
                "I think that this course was strong because the lectures were so engaging and I think it was weak because we didn't get to engage with the really interesting readings (even in section) as much as I would have. Though, that probably is because the amount of reading we had to do was almost insurmountable (though I wouldn't want there to be less reading because every reading was interesting).",
                "This course had many strengths!! The selection of readings, primary sources, and topics was phenomenal. Each reading was engaging and knowledgeable. Additionally, the lecture outlines were creative and interesting. I loved the class outline.",
                "I really loved the timeline we followed and appreciated the presentation format of the class. Although this class is primarily focused on writing, I do wish section incorporated more of the historical themes we discussed in class rather than writing style tips and peer review.",
                "Strengths: Josh, my TA, and Professor Hinton. Both were so engaging and cared a lot about the students and the course content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more time to ask a few questions at the end of class.",

                "Yes! The reading load was daunting, particularly the Du Bois at the beginning. However, I learned a ton and felt I was really pushed to take advantage of the writing assignments to push myself as a writer and historical thinker. This subject is key for any student interested in American history or contemporary social justice issues in the US. It definitely is a survey course (especially from the 1970s-the present; we only spent a week on that period!), but I still felt I was able to learn about certain issues in depth.",
                "Good",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! I learned a lot about African American history that I had never known before. A lot of things that had been covered quickly in high school were given way more depth and understanding, and also there were brand new discussions and topics I'd never thought of. Lecture was engaging, and Professor Hinton does an awesome job of making the history really come to life. Many key questions and events were re-framed in a way that I think is much more true. I particularly enjoyed the discussion of how racist history has historically been produced, and about learning real stories about real people and putting them in larger context. Take the class, it's great and very important!",
                "Yes!! Absolutely! I have become so much more informed about racial issues and what has been happening in Black history. I think if you have room for this course you should highly consider it. I know the final paper can sound a bit intimidating, but Prof Hinton gives you so much time to prepare for it, and the TA's are amazing and super helpful if you need some more guidance on what to write about. This class has definitely changed my perspective on history courses and just how great they are!",

                "Yes, to anyone interested in learning more about African American history",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. I think it really is for all levels of people from those who know nothing about African American history to those majoring in it. I think the professor just does that good of a job with the course material.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would definitely recommend it. Prof Hinton is a fantastic lecturer and the course is a great into class.",
                "Yes, but only if they are interested in the material",
                "I would recommend this class to an underclassman or to someone who has never taken a similar HIST\/AFAM course before.",
                "It is a great survey course for first years and sophomores interested in African American studies or if they want an introduction to a history course, however I would not recommend upper-level students take this course. At times felt repetitive if you have had previous exposure to course material",
                "Yes, it is good coverage of African American History, and I think it's pretty important to learn. It's done very well, and it was very engaging.",
                "Definitely!! It's a unique course that you can't cover anywhere else and contains knowledge I think everyone should have.",
                "YES. In fact, I might go as far as to say you HAVE to take this course. Unless youve taken a very similar one, if you think you already know all the information this class will teach you dont! At least one topic will be incredibly eye-opening, and very likely many or most of the subjects will be eye-opening!! Non-Black people especially, and white people even more especially. Im serious. Take this course!!! Please! So much of our current society, politics, etc. is inextricably linked to African American history, and to the systemic racism that has lasted throughout the U.S.s history and before. Even if youre not a history person, I beg you to take this course.",
                "Yes, I think understanding African American history should be required for all students at Yale because it impacts so much of the political sphere and race relations today. Also Professor Hinton i just such a prolific and excellent professor, and is such a great lecturer.",
                "Yes!! This course should be required for Yale students, everyone should get the chance to take it!! This course is one of my favorite courses I have taken so far, I have never learned so much from a class previously. The lectures were very engaging. The readings were relevant and connected well to many aspects of the class.",
                "Definitely!",
