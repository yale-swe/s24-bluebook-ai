I had never taken any queer studies courses, and this introduced me too some very new ideas that I had not thought much about prior to the class. It also introduced me to some fantastic novels.",
                "I learned so much about not only queer literature, but also queer history and other contextual pieces that all assisted in framing these texts on a grander scale. Walking out of this class, I feel as though I'm much better equipped to analyze literature against a larger contextual background, and to not shy away from controversial or difficult works.",

                "One weakness was although Professor Warner guides the conversation around different important-to-notice components of the text, the conversation doesn't feel super student-driven and we didn't often have the chance to respond to different students' comments due to jumping around so much, so it sometimes just felt like speaking into the void.",
                "Strengths are 1) that Prof. Warner is a huge scholar in this field and you'll learn from someone who has studied this topic in extreme depth 2) the syllabus is, for the most part, good and interesting content and 3) you're surrounded by other people interested in talking about queer writing. In terms of weaknesses, the pacing of the course is varied - some weeks it was just a few poems to read, and then we had to read all of a long James Baldwin novel just in the last week. There were some controversial entries in the syllabus -- particularly Lolita. For the most part, I think those choices did facilitate interesting discussions."

                "Yes, Professor Warner led good discussions and curated a really engaging syllabus.",
                "I would recommend this course because the readings and queer history were super interesting, and Professor Warner though a bit disorganized is very kind and super interesting to learn from, and a major figure in queer studies. I think it's definitely intimidating to come into the class without a solid background in queer theory but if you don't, there's a lot to learn from your classmates who do, and it's definitely fine if you don't!",
                "Yes, if the texts on the syllabus look interesting to you!",
                "Absolutely. You develop not just your writing and thinking, but also your understanding of queer history and literature (in English-speaking countries)",
                "If youre prepared for the workload of a senior seminar, I highly recommend it. Prof. Warner has so much knowledge in the field and the texts we read are some of my favorite Ive read at Yale."
