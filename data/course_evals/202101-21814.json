Heard from a lot of very experienced speakers and got to observe a child throughout the semester to note these developmental milestones we talked about.",
                "I gained knowledge pertaining to child development, specifically how language, literacy, and play work in concert to affect early childhood development and education. We also had guest lectures where we broadened our understanding of education and educational policy in America, gender as it relates to children and toys, and how to successfully implement changes into a classroom for successful learning.",

                "loved it! amazing class! guest lecturers were awesome too!",
                "Strength: child observations and journal, great opportunity to reflect \r\nWeakness: would be good to be provided with slides used by guest lecturers \r\nwould be good to discuss readings in class \/ have more group talks \r\nchild observations could probably be reduced to 30-40 mins \r\nmore ppl (maybe 20) could probably fit in course",
                "This class was absolutely fantastic, truly nothing but strengths",
                "Strengths: This class is a ball of sunshine on its own. Just... beautiful and enjoyable and casual\/non-restrictive. Even though our child observations were virtual, we still got so much out of talking to them and developing relationships over the course of the semester. Profs. Carla and Nancy are so so so kind and knowledgeable, it was truly an honor to get to speak to them. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think this time around it was the COVID-19 situation that prevented us from in-person discussions and child observations at the kindergarten. The professors can't be blamed for this, though, of course.",
                "This course was great! I learned so much, mainly through our observations of a child, most of which I will be able to apply beyond this course and even my time here at Yale. Learning about early childhood development, education, policy, and reform are - I think - important for everyone, and this class offers a chance to explore those themes with both professionals and peers through small, interactive, and dynamic class sessions.",
                "I had imagined that the course would be more discussion-based, but most of our meetings were actually listening to guest lecturers (which was also very informative, but required less engagement and sometimes made the 2 hour seminar feel quite long).",
                "the course gives a lot of freedom and independence to the students to explore what interests them (e.g., the reflection prompts for the journal entries are thought-provoking and open-ended rather than prescriptive so that the student can address what they're most interested in; prompts for observation are also open-ended and not restrictive so that the students can once again explore and analyze what is most interesting to them in their observations of their children). as a result, a person's experience of the class might depend heavily on their engagement and investment. with that being said, however, i didn't feel that there was adequate guidance and instruction on assignments, especially the final project. another strength was getting to hear a variety of perspectives from individuals of different early childhood fields through the guest lectures; majority of them were highly engaging and thought-provoking. one thing i wish we did more was having more in-depth discussions with one another in the seminar; often times, a lecture would run long and we would not get to discuss more than a question or two. over time, students seemed less inclined to participate in class because of an established culture of just lecturing with minimal discussion."

                "Yes! Amazing way to gain skills that will be helpful in life - either for your own children or work with children. A great glimpse into a child's early development and effective strategies to facilitate their learning. Not too hard of a course either! Great writing credit.",
                "Absolutely! this class is absolutely fantastic, Professor Horwitz and Close are amazing lecturers and discussion leaders. I learned so much about what it takes to foster childhood development in and out of the classroom as well as learning so much about myself.",
                "Absolutely. If you've ever been curious about how and why children learn and do in daycare through first grade, and how that helps them become fluent speakers and engaged citizens, this is the class for you -- you get to see it in action. Plus you get to talk to (no joke) a dozen specialists and big-shots in the field of education (policy and practice and science) about all the things covered in the course. \r\n\r\nIt's not a hard class at all, and you get to engage in the wider New Haven community much more meaningfully.",
                "Definitely. Professors Close and Horwitz are both amazing with so many years of experience with child development. Also very fun to do so much self-reflections about childhood and early education.",
                "DEFINITELY! If you are lucky enough to receive a spot in this course - don't hesitate to take it! It is an acceptable amount of work, but the benefits you will get out of it greatly outweigh the assignments. Professor Horwitz and Professor Close are just the best, and the material you learn is so, so engaging and informative!! I learned at least one (or maybe five) new pieces of information every class period, and the class discussions were always fruitful, engaging, and contemporary. We had guest lecturers who added something new and exciting to the course, and (although during a COVID semester) we were able to observe a child and their play habits, which is a super cool experience!",
                "Yes, if they understand that they bear the brunt of most of their learning. I learned much more from the observations (that I organized) and readings than I did from class, but that could also be due in part to COVID.",
                "yes! i've learned, grown and felt so much through this course. if you know nothing about early childhood education\/development, and you like interacting with children, have younger siblings, or want to become a parent one day, this is for you. if you are already familiar with the concepts, there's still a lot to be gained from this course as it also covers contemporary topics and what's relevant in early childhood classrooms in the modern world in addition to the foundations\/theories. the classroom environment is very relaxed as are the professors."
