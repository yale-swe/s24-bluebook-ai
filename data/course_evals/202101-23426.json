I did wish for more engaging assignments overall, but there was a lot of speaking practice in this class which definitely improved my confidence and ability to hold a conversation.",

I definitely liked having a living document of all of my written assignments! We tried having virtual \"walks\" with classmates to just discuss anything (but in Spanish) to sort of mimic being in person.
