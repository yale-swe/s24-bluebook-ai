I learned about the economic applications of calculus and linear algebra (particularly the economic applications of optimization).",
                "I definitely learned so much in the linear algebra portion of the course. It was so fascinating to learn the different ways to think about 3-D space, and the material was not like anything I had learned in a previous math class. I also think I sharpened my critical thinking skills in this course because there were many times when I would be solving a problem and I had to think about how the different concepts we learned fit together and applied to that specific problem."

                "Mihai is a huge strength. He makes class so fun and engaging. The p-sets introduce just the right amount of challenge. I used them to procrastinate other work.",
                "Interesting, cohesive content. I wish it went into a little more conceptual depth but I also think that was a byproduct of it being a non-math major class.",
                "Strengths: Mihai is an absolute gem. He genuinely made learning the content fun with his positive energy. Midterms weren't very difficult, though the final got a bit harder. Course was also relatively low workload: only one PSET a week, and not much else was needed to keep up. No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: This class was approachable and accessible for students who are not interested in pursuing higher level math, but want to learn important skills relevant for upper-level economics courses\r\nWeaknesses: If you missed a class session, the were annotated notes do not perfectly line up with what's discussed in class",
                "It would be great to focus more on the economics applications of the mathematical concepts we learnt.",
                "Good organization, daily printed worksheets to work on skills being taught that day, pre-class quizzes that would prepare you for class. I think sometimes the class was a little fast but for the most part I could stay on track.",
                "Strengths were the clarity of content, Professor's instruction, and small class size. Also, the ample office hour availability.",
                "This course was very well organized on Canvas, with modules organized by week and by day, with the corresponding problem sets, class worksheets, and solutions. The organizational structure of the class made studying streamlined and efficient, as all material was very easily accessible. Mihai is also a very clear instructor who conveyed the material very clearly. I appreciated how he would actually guide us through how to solve problems in addition to teaching us the information, as some professors just teach the information and then students are on their own when it comes to solving the problems.",
                "Strengths - very passionate professor, interesting course material which gives you the knowledge to succeed in upper level econ classes. Weaknesses - I felt like there was not enough time to consolidate the content taught over the semester before the final. I think this is important for a class where many of the students have not done calculus since high school. The TF was quite unhelpful and did not explain (probably unique to this semester as TFs change)",
                "I appreciate that all homework comes from the course director and not a textbook, ensuring that our work is closely alligned with what we learn in class. \r\nPace of course is reasonable, not overwhelming, effective\r\nIt might be useful to have packets that act as textbook material so that students can learn beyond what's taught in class or presented in pre-class videos.",
                "I really enjoyed the flow of the course. A lot of the topics built upon each other and this was particularly evident when we reached the optimization topics. The way each class was facilitated was also incredibly helpful for grasping each topic and practicing different kinds of problems. We began each class with an overview of the topics being covered and an example of a problem, then were given time to work on problems either alone or with the help of a partner. As long as you studied, made sure you understood the problem sets, and did adequate practice, the exams were incredibly doable. Also, Mihai had ample office hours (6 hours a week) where we could go to complete problem sets alongside our classmates or just ask questions.\r\n\r\nI genuinely cannot think of a weakness in this course. I looked forward to going to this class every week.",
                "Not a lot of organization, but the professor made everything clear if you asked",
                "One strength of this course is that it offers a great introduction to multivariable calculus and linear algebra, covering an abundance of material in a short amount of time but without feeling overwhelming. Plus, there were so many opportunities to engage with the material, whether it be problem sets, pre-class quizzes, or in-class worksheets, so if I had trouble understanding a specific topic, I had many opportunities to do practice problems. One weakness of the course is that we didn't get to spend a lot of time on the unit that combined the multivariable calculus and linear algebra portions of the course together."

                "Absolutely. Especially if taught by Mihai. A great alternative to anything in the main calc sequence (112, 115 and 120) because it has a much less intense workload.",

                "Yes, Math 118 is a great option for those who want to major in Econ but may not want an alternative math course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any economics majors, as it provides a strong foundation for all the math used in ECON 121, or to anyone interested in taking a helpful math course. I actually believe this course would be a helpful introduction to students wanting to take MATH 225, as it provides a solid foundation in both the theory behind linear algebra and visualization of linear algebra concepts that may help with that course.",
                "Yes, especially for students taking upper level econ courses",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course to other students who want to have a strong foundation in math. MATH 118 explores both multivariable calculus and linear algebra, allowing students to explore various topics of advanced math in just one semester. While this class explores topics applicable to economics, I took ECON 121 and MATH 118 concurrently and found that ECON 121 helped me more with MATH 118 than the other way around. I would not take this class just to prepare for ECON 121.",
                "Absolutely. If you're an economics major and need to take a math course, this course teaches you the math needed for higher level econ courses, particularly Econ 121 (intermediate micro) in a very digestible way and is actually so enjoyable. You definitely do need a relatively strong calculus base because some of the preliminary concepts aren't step-by-step explained (like the basic chain rule, product rule, and quotient rule). However, I hadn't taken a calculus course in over a year when I started this class and these rules tend to come back as you continue to go through topics. I do think our instructor, Mihai, truly made this course. Mihai was incredible and made math my favorite class this semester.",
                "YES! Mihai is the most wonderful professor! He is so excited every day, and genuinely loves teaching math.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student even if they aren't a math major because I found the material to be very fascinating and different from the material I had learned in previous math classes. We learned something new every class, which made every class interesting and exciting."
