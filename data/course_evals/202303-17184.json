                "In taking \"History 212: The Ancient Economy,\" I significantly honed my ability to analyze complex readings and historical documents. This skill was crucial in understanding the multifaceted nature of ancient economic systems. The course required me to critically engage with primary and secondary sources, enabling me to decipher and interpret historical economic data and theories.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I developed a nuanced understanding of how ancient economies functioned within their specific cultural, political, and geographical context. Additionally, this course enhanced my skills in synthesizing diverse information and constructing coherent, well-substantiated arguments.",
                "This class provided an incredibly well thought out overview of all the different evidence based approaches to the study of the ancient economies. In addition, there was a continuous education provided on the history of the field and how ideas, theories, and uses of evidence have evolved.",
                "This course taught me the groundings of the ancient economy and how there is ambiguity in the terms \"economy\" and \"the\" when pinpointing and defining the ancient economy. There were rich readings of some of the best scholars to work in the field as we analyzed the Roman, Greek, and Egyptian economic systems. The final exam serves as a reiteration of three of my personal foci from the content in the course, those being to what extent there was an ancient economy and how ancient economic history as a study is performed in the modern world.",
                "I learned what the ancient economy is-- or if it even actually exists. As my first history class, I learned a lot about historical evidence and how history is studied.",
                "I learned a lot about the significance of sources and ambiguity of evidential gaps that contribute to knowledge on the past (namely, about the Mediterranean and its evolution to a flourishing economic entity)",
                "These concepts were very new to me, and I learned how to interact with a brand new branch of knowledge.",
                "I gained a much more clear understanding of what the\/an ancient economy is. I better understand the historical context and the ways that historians and economists use available information to gain a a better picture.",

                "I got to think about how to draw comparisons between the modern and ancient worlds, as well as between the scholarly views of different historians.",

                "strengths: low workload and some of the readings were interesting, weaknesses: low incentives to come to class because we don't need to really know the material for anything because the assignments\/assessments are all essays. Could be a bit boring at times",
                "So many readings it was too difficult to read them all and actually understand what they were talking about.",
                "One of the major strengths of this course is the extensive selection of readings. These materials provide a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of the ancient economy, expanding our knowledge and understanding of this complex subject. The discussion sections are another strength. They offer a valuable opportunity to delve deeper into the readings, ask questions, and discuss concepts covered in lectures. This interactive environment enhances understanding and allows for the clarification of complex ideas.\r\n\r\nWhile the readings are beneficial, their volume can be overwhelming. A potential improvement could be to streamline the reading list, focus on quality over quantity, or provide more guided reading strategies to help students manage the workload.",
                "I truly struggle to find any weaknesses of the course. Outside of maybe two sorta blah readings, I found every lecture, every reading, and every assignment to be incredibly engaging.",
                "The concept of this course is great, but the lecture style was very difficult to follow",
                "The course has excellent readings and a teacher who is passionate about the subject. The wealth of information from these two sources was certainly very useful. The only weakness of the course (which is not even a weakness) is that the course is significantly heavy on theory. This is not as much of a conventional history course as it is, to an extent, a philosophy course on defining ancient economies. There is an incredibly small number of identification terms to give an example of why I believe so. The only identification term that comes to mind off the top of my head in reflection of the entire semester is New Institutional Economics. I would have liked to hear more identification terms, but I understand how that does, in a sort, conflict with the goal of the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Manning is clearly very interested in this subject and it definitely contributed to students' interest in learning. He is a great professor and I would definitely take another class with him.\r\nWeaknesses: The course doesn't focus much at all on actual economics, but this isn't really a weakness unless that's what you were hoping for. It focuses more on the evidence of ancient economies, what \"economics\" consisted of, and how it may be related to today.",
                "I think the course can overall improve if the powerpoints were more informative on what we are learning every week.",
                "I thought the assessments should have been more lecture focused instead of reading focused because I want to learn from the professor and from what is taught in class.",
                "Strength - Good professor, easily digestible readings\/lectures and workload was not hard at all. Good course too take for a lighter but still informative summary on ancient economies\r\nWeakness - bland lecturing and not a ton of engagement with students during lectures. Also, sometimes the material was a bit redundant.",
                "If lectures were more engaging, I am sure more people would have gone.",
                "The course was fairly well organized, but i had a bit of trouble with expectations for the written assignments as each one was graded by a different person.",
                "Learned about a lot of the ancient world",
                "I found the material of the course fascinating and the professor is great. This course had a few readings that did not feel as necessary or critical to my understanding of the material and main ideas of the course.",
                "Strengths: interesting material\r\n\r\nWeaknesse: lectures are often disconnected from other lectures, and the class doesn't have a chronological feel or definitive structure.",
                "The course has an interesTing overarching topic but the teaching style was a tad tedious.",
                "I really enjoyed the lecture style and sections. Sections were very well organized and Professor Manning is clearly and passionate expert in his field."

                "Yes",

The course covers the economic systems of the ancient world, which are crucial in understanding the foundations of modern economic practices and theories. It's fascinating to trace the origins of economic concepts and see how they have evolved. Additionally, understanding ancient economies offers insights into current economic issues.",
                "Yes. If the student had interests in the ancient Mediterranean or broader fields of history, economic history, or even business, I would HIGHLY recommend the course.",
                "Honestly, as it is right now, I would not. This course is difficult to succeed in",
                "I would recommend this course with the disclaimer that this is more of a theory course than it is a history course and that there is incredibly minimal learning about the financial structure of the ancient world, which I know I personally was hoping for. That being said, I believe that even if the true nature of the course was better advertised, the course would still have a demand.",
                "Yes. If you're not a history major, it's a great choice to open your mind to history in general. As well, it's quite interesting, and even a bit philosophical, leaving you with many questions about the ancient world.",
                "Yes, it was interesting.",

                "Yes, this course explores many facets of ancient society beyond economies and inspires broad, complex thinking.",
                "Yes, I would. I think it's a good opportunity to learn about a niche topic.",
                "This course is for someone who has a deep interest in the subject matter.",
