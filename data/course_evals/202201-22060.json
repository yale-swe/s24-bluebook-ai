                "This course provided an extremely thorough, in-depth study of cell biology. We covered a wide range of topics related to organelle structure/function, cellular signaling, experimental techniques, etc. It was a very application-based course that truly did focus on \"immersion\" rather than memorization.",
                "This course was an incredibly detailed introduction to cell bio. The research techniques and cell bio phenomenon taught in this course are highly applicable to other bio courses and to research.",
                "Learned so many things about the cell, including experimental strategies used to address cell bio questions, DNA replication and the nucleus, protein synthesis and trafficking, membrane structure and transport proteins, signaling pathways, extracellular matrix, a little bit of immune system, cytoskeleton and motor proteins, and finally the cell cycle and cancer.",
                "This course is essentially a survey course of cell biology. You learn A LOT of content, and you'll find that a lot of concepts sound familiar as you read cell bio papers.",
                "I learned how to apply information learned in class to experimental designs and how to think about theoretical cell biology questions.",
                "I learned EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW about the cell. I learned so much over the course of the semester. I learned how to critically think about pathways and clinical applications with regards to cell biology.",

                "I learned so much about Cell Biology. This is a great survey course that covers so much material, and you definitely get a great insight in Cell Biology as a field of study.",
                "I felt like I gained a solid foundation for cell biology.  I notice that I no longer have to search definitions while reading biology papers as I used to before taking this course.",
                "Broad survey of cell bio",
                "I learned about cell biology so deeply!! So many interesting things beyond our naked eye. Definitely contributed to my love for medicine.",

                "I was definitely overwhelmed with how much I learned in this class (in a good way). This course truly covered all of the material for Cell Biology, and because of how much content there was, I was able to develop better studying methods and ways to wrap my head around the processes and details a lot faster.",
                "I learned a great deal about the biology of cells, including the biochemical foundations of cellular biology, structural elements within the cell, as well as other functions and processes that occur in a cell. I also learned experimental techniques that are commonly used in cell biology, as well as how results from the experiments are analyzed.",
                "This course gave me a good, broad perspective of cell biology and systems that are likely pertinent to many research fields.",
                "I learned a LOT about the biology of the cell in this course, as well as its application in lab settings, which I found very helpful in my research.",
                "I learned about a lot of cellular and biological processes in more depth.",
                "I gained a comprehensive understanding of major processes of the cell and how such processes contribute to life as we know it. The course is well-divided according to the cell biology techniques, the nucleus, central dogma, cell signaling, cellular transport, membrane proteins and architecture, cell division, and cytoskeleton."

            "comments": [
                "Do not take! Quizzes are very hard and way to much information is covered per unit",
                "The course is super well organized.\r\nIt is very detailed and there is a TON of content, but they way that the course is structured, it is totally doable.\r\nAnother strength is the teaching, because the professors do a good job of relating concepts that seem to be deep in the weeds to a bigger picture or an everyday example, which helps understand the relevance and remain interested in the topics!",
                "The professors very extremely organized and efficient, which was very conducive to student learning. I thought the weekly quiz format was a great idea because it made sure students were staying on track with the material, which made the cumulative final less intimidating.",
                "I loved this course and thought it was very well organized and taught",
                "Strengths: I actually think the weekly quizzes were a great way to keep us on track with learning the material, and I think giving us the handouts during testing allowed us to think critically about the material without having the pressure to memorize the minute details. There would often be times during studying where I would try to predict quiz questions or make my own quiz questions, which allowed me to better learn and explain the pathways by looking at them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I honestly think this is the most streamlined biology course that I've experienced so far in Yale, so no major weaknesses. However, I wish early on in the course the professors or TA would clarify via an announcement or on the syllabus which lectures would be on the next quiz (I think by quiz 2 or 3 we learned that each quiz covered one Tuesday and one Thursday class, or two classes worth of material).",
                "Strengths: I like the style of quizzes (weekly, open-note). They are fair, help you stay on top of the course content, and often so they are relatively low stakes. The instructors for this course are also all amazing - the rotating cast was fun for some variety. Lecture slides were also helpful - well designed, I like the red boxes and font, having them in advance was helpful too. Weaknesses: There was sometimes an overwhelming amount of content. I found myself tuning out in lectures sometimes because it was so much content.",
                "This course's strength came from the study packets that we reviewed during the discussion sections, since they helped to review the concepts very well. A weakness was that the lecture slides were really just pictures and few words, so it was tough to review the slides.",
                "Strengths- You really learn so much. Sections were a great way to learn material. I really enjoyed discussing the material in a large group. \r\nWeakness- The entire class was allowed to have the handouts for the weekly quizzes. This encouraged people not to actually learned the material, and it really punished those who spent time reading the book and engaging with the material. Those who had previous biology experience could not read the textbook and could take the quizzes after skimming the lecture notes in 5 minutes, whereas I had to spend 10-15 hours per week reading the text and attending office hours. The quizzes often did not test the material, but rather, just how to think scientifically. I could have taken some of the quizzes without attending class, and others I had to spend HOURS studying the material. Also, the grading on the quizzes were very shaky, meaning that some TAs were far more generous than others. I could definitely tell who was grading each quiz. This class was a mental drain for me. It really felt like it would never end.",
                "This course is extremely well organized and has tons of support. Although I feel that lectures could be more engaging at times, I really enjoyed the material that was being taught as well as the professors who were teaching them. I think the weekly quizzes were an effective way to master the material, however, I think that weekly pets may be even better if they require us to synthesize the material that we learn.",
                "Professors should allow students to take quizzes at a different time when provided with a Deans Excuse. I missed quizzes from the beginning of the semester which were considerably easier, and I had a Deans Excuse but they said they wouldnt take it and that those would just count as my dropped. That put me in a clear disadvantage given that this class is graded on a curve.",
                "I think that the handouts were very helpful during quizzes because sometimes the questions asked could be pretty difficult to answer without them. Overall there was alot of content, but it was organized well",
                "Weekly discussion sections were very good.",
                "I think the sections and handouts were a very strong point in the class. Id say section was about as important as lecture. Section leaders were great. Handouts greatly facilitated student learning and studying, I could tell they had a lot of thought put into when making them, and let the students know which concepts are important. I will say having lecture recordings wouldve been super helpful and they should be available to the students. Attendance is already half mandatory thanks to the quizzes.",
                "Class is well taught and handouts provide all the necessary information, quizzes are a great opportunity to help stay on top of the material and practice exam type questions through the semester. The TFs are also amazing",
                "Strength is that weekly quizzes force you to stay on top of the information, but that can also be a downfall if you have an off week or two. The only grades are quizzes and the final so there is no bringing up your grade with psets.",
                "A big strength was how clear the expectations were and all the opportunities to practice answering questions and using the material.",
                "This is a great course for placing things in context if you are more familiar with pure biochemistry. The open note format takes pressure off while encouraging you to learn the things you're interested in, however, it can also serve as a means of reducing engagement with the course. Weekly quizzes do keep you up to date with course concepts to some degree.",
                "The strengths are the organization of the course and the amount of content covered. Weaknesses are the quick pace of the course and the heavy reliance of overall grading on quizzes (especially since different people are grading them so the criteria changes sometimes). Your entire grade consists of assessments so it can be high-pressure at times.",
                "Strength: weekly quizzes are fair and give you an opportunity to review the week's topics.  The free response format of the weekly quizzes are fantastic!\r\nWeaknesses: Weekly quizzes cover topics from one lecture in the current week and one lecture in the previous week - not the two lectures of the current week.  This makes it awkward to study.  I suggest making the quiz cover the two lectures of the current week.",
                "Way too rushed and final exam format was not built to facilitate learning. There were interesting things but the class focused on individual things not concepts. The tf team is very committed though. Just not sure of what  was being testedour ability to learn biology or our ability to interpret our notes??",
                "I think this course was designed so flawlessly. The professors really give you every possible resource to succeed. Everything else is up to you.",
                "strength: timely feedback constructed by weekly quiz; patient TFs who are always accessible for those who have questions\r\n\r\nweakness: fast pace; very strict rules regarding quizzes; no recording available (can make it available at reading period)",
                "The strengths were that there was clear feedback throughout the semester with the weekly quizzes, and that the TAs were very helpful in organizing review sessions. Given the sheer amount of content that is covered, I think the course is very well structured for learning.",
                "This course's greatest strength is also a weakness. It covers so much content, which, if mastered, would be extremely valuable to most MCDB majors, but there is so much content, that it is challenging to master much of it at all in the time frame given. It is especially noticeable in the relatively rushed pace of the lectures.",
                "Strengths- emphasis on understanding how to use the material in a problem-solving context, not just rote memorization, and they made it through a LOT of material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- because they went through a LOT of material, sometimes I felt like I wasnt retaining much because there was just so much content. Theres not really much to be done about it, but it can be a bit frustrating to know what to study.",
                "A strength would be that the lectures are very well taught by the professors and the TA. They were also very accomodating when I couldn't come in person for lectures or quizzes due to illness and COVID-related health precautions, so I appreciated that. While the quizzes helped me to keep up with the material in the course, they were often really challenging. I appreciated that they let us have the handouts for reference during the quiz because otherwise, I feel like the quizzes would have been a lot more difficult and not as feasible to take. I hope in the future they opt out of a cumulative final exam because I think it's a lot to put on students to re-study a semester's worth of material that went into a lot of depth and have that be a large determinant of a student's grade. I think having a final (a longer quiz) for the material at the end for the lectures that were not quizzed on would be a better alternative.",
                "Strengths: open-handout assessments, which allowed me to focus on understanding the principles and the overarching concepts rather than memorizing the details; Weaknesses: it seems like we delved more in-depth into some topics than others, which could be slightly frustrating intellectually. The TAs were phenomenal.",
                "This was probably one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Strengths: tremendously well-organized, lecture notes were truly life-savers, each lecture was engaging and I left feeling like I learnt a lot, brilliant survey of many topics, and felt very gratified to have learned a lot when looking back through notes and lecture notes when studying for finals. \r\nWeaknesses: not many weaknesses, there is a lot of material at times which can feel overwhelming but simply asking the professors and TAs for help is sufficient to stay afloat because both the professors and TAs are very available to helping."

                "Yes! This is the best course, STEM or non-STEM, that I have taken at Yale. The professors are incredibly engaging, concise, and efficient lecturers and do an excellent job at teaching concepts. The course is very well-organized and is truly designed to facilitate student learning. The class is definitely challenging and may be too in-depth for non-MCDB/premed students, but it is by far the best course I have taken in the MCDB department and highly recommend it to all students who are interested.",
                "Yes. If youre passionate about bio and research you should take this course. Its challenging, but worth it.",
                "Yes, definitely take this course if you are a bio major or just interested in learning more about cell biology (that is, if you're not already scared off by BIOL 102). It is amazingly organized and makes so much sense the more you progress and learn throughout the semester. By the end, you will be very proud of how much information you've learned, and it is a great foundation for other biology courses.",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to know a lot of cell biology. It's really nice to have open note quizzes, and you'll find that you know a lot of stuff after the course. Not the most fun at times (a lecture is a lecture) but quite practical knowledge. You could cram for the quizzes in one night, but you'd probably learn more if you studied little bits for more days. I",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to biology students. It was phenomenal and taught me how to apply knowledge in a way I have never known before.",
                "I would not recommend this course in its current state.  Although I learned so much, the way the course is currently organized with the open note quizzes does not reward students who work hard. It was very discouraging for me to study 10-15 hours and get an 8/10 on each quiz, while some of my classmates would study 1-2 hours and score a 10/10 easy. This class is a toll on ones mental health.",
                "Yes! If you are a life science major I would definitely recommend taking this course. You learn a lot of information and it is taught in a well organized and cohesive manner.",
                "Yes, you are going to learn a lot. But be careful, since there is weekly quizzes and only three are dropped, and the professors wont care if you have a Deans Excuse or any problem.",
                "I would! I think the quizzes keep you on track and the TA's genuinely want to help you. The professors also hold office hours often and try to facilitate the teaching well. One downside is sometimes they go a bit fast in the lectures and lecture videos are not released until the end.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Take this class if you are any sort of bio major. It will help your life. The 8:55am mandatory in person quizzes kinda sucked.",
                "No, (unless it is a requirement, in which case, best of luck)",
                "Yes, pretty solid MCDB core but a pretty high workload/time commitment each week to do well",
                "Yes, very interesting course and nice that three different professors lecture, focusing on their expertise. If you like biology, this course is very interesting. Learned lots of information! Very cool to learn how all the pathways connect to make things work. Obviously for those interested in biology, wouldn't recommend as a science distributional req for non stem majors.",
                "Yes,\r\nGreat for contextualizing biochemical processes",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are really passionate about biology. You learn so much in this course, but be ready for the high workload that comes with that (in terms of readings and studying for the weekly quizzes).",
                "100% would recommend for any bio major",
                "Yes because it lets you take more advanced courses but not if youre looking to enrich your understanding of cell bio. Its more labour than is necessary - just dumb down the syllabus if it means the pace slows down.",
                "Yes, it's extremely informative. The lecture slides are well constructed. The lecture notes are the best part of the class, they condense the information from the class into informative chunks that will serve as useful references later. Hope they keep allowing students to use lecture notes on quizzes; it makes a lot more sense and tests more critical reasoning skills. One improvement tip: give a short break during lecture.",
                "Definitely if youre interested in cell/molecular biology, pharmacology, or medicine. Its just so fascinating how much of a world there is that we cant directly see. To know the inner workings of the very cells that make us work is mind blowing.",
                "only for those who need it; good for building foundations",
                "For a student looking for an elective course to take, I would not recommend this class due to the intensive nature of this course. However, for a pre-med student, or a student of the major, I would definitely recommend this class because it gives a very good foundation of cell biology.",
                "This course is probably required for your major, but I think it's a great course to take to fulfill that, and it also counts for pre-med requirements. Personally, I found it exciting to learn more in-depth about many of the concepts and principles that are covered in high school cell biology, at a much more detailed level (for example, actually learning the mechanisms of cellular transport in the cell instead of just learning that the cell partitions and transports different materials to different areas).",
                "As a core class for MCDB, it is a requirement and a lot of work, but I think this class will help fellow students prepare well for future courses in the major. It is taught as well as possible and has many interesting topics.",
                "If you are an MCDB major and doing research, this course is definitely worth your time. It is a lot of material, but it is so useful and made me a much better scientist. I would definitely recommend it as a core course, especially if you take it after biochemistry, as a lot of the early material of 205 overlaps with biochemistry and makes it easier to get adjusted to the course structure and pace.",
                "I recommend this to students who would find it helpful if they are in a research lab in which these topics would be helpful and relevant to study.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about cell biology.",
                "I would highly, highly recommend this course to another student, even if they are not an MCDB student or don't have much interest in biology. I feel like the point of this class is to foster interest in biology by providing an overview of many topics and an understanding of the cell and the make up of life as a whole. It is actually quite manageable along side other classes, as long as a regular, consistent effort is put in, it is not the most difficult class to keep up in."
