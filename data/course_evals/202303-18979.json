                "In addition to learning or sometimes re-learning a ton of president-centric American history and exploring the applications of clauses from Article II, one of the most interesting parts of this class was looking at political science classifications and categorizations of the presidency.",
                "A solid introductory course to the presidency and its evolution throughout history.",
                "This course provided an interesting evaluation and assessment of presidential political leadership",
                "Prof. Skowronek is a very accomplished and insightful scholar. It is always a special opportunity to take a course with a professor who is truly at the top of his field. I learned much more about the history of the presidency and Prof. Skowronek's specific systems of analysis to understand the evolution of the office.",
                "I learned a lot of information about various presidents, their motives, their actions, and their policies. We mostly focused on the first 3 presidents then we focused on Andrew Jackson, especially in relation to the Bank War. From there we just began to think of the presidency as an institution and how it has developed over time, how presidents have gained power, and how the bureaucracy and EOP have aided those gains.This course informed me about the history of our government and how the role of the president has changed over time.",
                "I rlly was excited to learn about this course bc it is def material worth knowing. BUT, it was VERY hard to understand what was important and what was not in the class. there was no outline and it was a poorly taught class with an even poorer choice of TA. I am so disappointed.",

            "comments": [
                "Stregths: The professor has a wealth of knowledge about the subject, and his ability to pull relevant historical examples is impressive.\r\n\r\nWeakness: An incredibly hard lecture to sit through. the content is interesting but delivery is dry, plain, and overall just boring.",
                "This is not a strength nor a weakness. He does not have slides, which if you are in class it is very easy to understand what is necessary to learn and the main points of the lecture. However, if you miss class it is so hard to get any information on what you missed and you basically just go the rest of the semester without knowing any of the information from the missed lecture.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were very clearly structured and discussed a ton of content. The course structure made a lot of sense. Skowronek is the guy in the field, and it shows with his knowledge. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Section (not necessarily Skowronek's fault) was a disaster. He also doesn't really answer questions, and if section was a mess too, then it was hard to question and analyze. There also was little incentive to do the readings.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings and topics covered week to week\r\nWeaknesses: it just seems unnecessary to have an in-person final for a class of this level and topic; lectures were often disorganized and sections as well",
                "Strengths: content is very interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings are long and not clear what is assigned when, professor is not engaging in the lectures, discussion sections lack direction",
                "At times (especially toward the beginning of the course) lectures can be a bit boring. They are not accompanied by any visual aids nor are they recorded, so you have to be especially attentive in class. While that is not inherently a weakness, I see slides or other visual aids as an added strength of a course. The single most resounding weakness was the head TF for the course. The TF was rude, dismissive, and at times inappropriate with his comments. This made engaging with the course especially difficult.",
                "Strengths: \r\n-the information is in depth and you will definitely leave the course knowing more than when you came in\r\n-the discussion sections allow you to review what you learned in lecture and reflect more on the readings\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- the lecture style is not effective and does not promote learning. The professor spends all 50 minutes just speaking to the class with no lecture slides and rarely offers hand-outs or other guiding sources to understand the lesson. Therefore, you must spend all 50 minutes frantically transcribing which does not allow you to actually understand and reflect on the information in class. You can only write it down and hope to read it later. The lectures are also not recorded so if you miss something you have no way to hear that information again. \r\n- there are way too many readings for this course which makes it difficult to read anything in depth because you always have so much to read. The amount of reading discouraged me from doing any of the readings fully as I knew I would not have time to put much thought on any particular page so I would just skim most of them.\r\n-You could only write 2 of the 3 papers assigned which I thought was unfair as I wrote all 3 papers but could not submit one. You should be allowed to write all 3 papers then only be graded for your best 2 but only 2 should be required. This would encourage students to do more readings and know all the material because they would write a paper each month incorporating the lecture information and readings. It would also allow them to get a better grade as only the best 2 would be in the gradebook which would show their improvement rather than only having 2 opportunities. \r\n-the final exam also is not a productive tool for learning as students are given 7 prompts to prepare so that they can respond to 2 of them on the final plus answer key terms. I think the final should just be an essay or multiple essays that students submit via Canvas which would allow us to put more time into it, review the readings and lectures to incorporate in the essay, and intrinsically learn that way. Then if the professor would like us to take an in-person exam it should only be on the key terms. It was frustrating for me to have to practically write 7 essays and then memorize each one only to write 2 on the exam. It felt like my other work was not being accounted for and I was not able to write as eloquently as I wanted to on the exam because I had less time and was under more pressure and had to write by hand.",
                "I only saw weaknesses. there needs to be more organization and direction.",
                "Strengths is the material.  \r\n\r\nThe teaching fellows were notably the weaker aspect of the course. One displayed troubling misogynistic behavior, openly making an inappropriate comment about a female student. The other seemed quite unprepared, leading to prolonged periods of silence during the section, sometimes lasting 10-15 minutes,  \r\n\r\nAlso the workload was insane. 100 plus pages per week of a nonsense."

                "I would recommend this course to other students. However, if you have Ishaan Jajodia as a TA switch to another section. He made unsettling jokes about Cancer. Which was very unsettling to me, as my Stepmother was put on hospice that same week after battling Colon cancer for the past 5 years of my life.  Furthermore, he admitted to being sexist in multiple sections. If you are a woman, wanting to take this class, brace yourself. Furthermore, he made many jokes about athletes, their intellectual abilities and was just nasty towards them in front of other students. He constantly admitted to deflating grades because he was a C average student at Dartmouth. Discussed other students grades in front of others. Stated that he did not grade blindly. He made this class much worse and he will definitely make the enrollment rate for Fall 2024 much smaller. Even during the final he kept being nasty towards students. Although, during the final he did not snap at me or make a comment. The environment to take the final was not one for students to succeed in and I would have preferred the professor be there. He also always commented on the other TA, which I again thought was unprofessional and weird.",
                "Mildly yes. It's an interesting course in terms of content. It's super SUPER easy. It might not always be the most engaging, but if you take diligent lecture notes, you'll learn a good amount and do well.",
                "If this course was taught differently, yes. The lecture material was very interesting for those interested in presidential political theory. The readings were interesting, but outrageously long. But the lectures were just so dull and the discussion sections didn't seem to serve much purpose. If it was modified to be more palatable to students, it could be a really amazing class.",
                "I think taking this course in another year without the TF assigned from this year would make the class substantively better. I would recommend the course as a pretty easy Credit/D/Fail but a more intensive \"A\" course. The lecture content is interesting but the readings can be very long and boring.",
                "No because I did not like the way the class was organized. The lecture style was inefficient and forced me to spend more time outside of class to make up for the lack of learning I could do in class. there were no recordings or lecture slides to facilitate my learning so I was just forced to use the transcription I did during class which could never possibly have all the information as I cannot type as fast as a person speaks. The final was also very complex for no reason as you practically had to write and memorize 7 essays just to write 2 of them on the exam.",
                "I took this class bc it is in my major and the material definitely interests me. I asked someone who took this class previously if they did well and like it- they said \"no way in that class. the professor was terrible and the paper assignments were hard\". so no I would not recommend and I wish I had not taken it.",
                "No, I would not.",
                "Nope. only people that take this class are chumps (Myself included). The grading is absurd: \r\n\r\nThe final exam accounts for a significant 40% of your overall grade. The two papers together contribute 25%, and participation, surprisingly, is allotted only a garbage 10%. \r\n \r\nSave yourself stress, money, and a semester and don't take this class."
