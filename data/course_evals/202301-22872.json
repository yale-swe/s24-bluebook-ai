The assignments dont feel like assignments due to how much freedom you have to choose what to write about. I wish o could take this class every semester!",
                "Strengths: the readings were always amazing and moving. We read a variety of essays, almost every single one of which I loved. The small classroom setting also allowed us to bond and get to know each other (and our amazing professor, Kate). The open-ended nature of the essays and chance to brain storm helped me work out my creative muscles. The class is fun, dynamic, and really good for beginning writers and experienced ones alike. We had a lot of room to learn and improve individually. \r\nWeaknesses: I can only take it once!"
