Prof. Snyder is a top class orator and explainer you will learn why self-determination is a double-edged sword, understand the rise of nationalist movements under parliamentarian governments, analyze authoritarianism from history and fiction, and gain a good grasp on the period from 1914-1995. Emphasis on the 1914-1956 period; after goulash communism, the wheels really fell off the wagon and Snyder began skipping through the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s because so much of the course was focused on the interwar period and WWII (which were interesting, but again poor course planning). You will also learn how to expertly skim 200+ pages of reading each week because the amount of reading assigned is unmanageable for a lecture course. Good luck with this one! Wouldn't recommend this unless Snyder realizes he should put his celebrity tour on pause and resume being a professor!",

            "comments": [
                "Unfortunately this was one course that despite amazing course content and lectures, did not provide a sufficient support given the ongoing COVID pandemic. Professor Snyder overloaded the reading amount. This is supposed to be an intro survey lecture course but I have never read more than I have for this class-- sometimes over 500 pages a week or 200 pages per lecture (we had two a week). And despite the material being interesting, the most difficult part was Professor Snyder's requirement that we take handwritten notes on all the material and submit them to our TFs by section. While the purpose of this note-taking exercise is acknowledged by students, we all suffered from physical and mental health due to this task. As Yale students we are meticulous notetakers, especially since this was relatively new material to everyone. It was stressful to submit so much work on time when the readings were by no means structured for introductory lecture. Had this course been a seminar, and all of us hoping to become Eastern European historians/specialists, this density of work would have been understandable. But the pandemic continues and it just unfortunately seemed that Professor Snyder increased the workload rather than adjust it to the pandemic at hand. Of all courses that ever needed a midterm feedback form, this was one that REALLY needed one so that students could communicate with Professor Snyder that this approach was not working; he himself was never very available besides minimal office hours that were at difficult times.",
                "Strength: Professor Snyder is a great lecturer and very helpful at office hour too. He is definitely a world-class historian and you can learn so much from him. The selection of reading was great too. There was certainly a lot of reading (goes from 100 pages per week to whole books for a single lecture, probably 200 pages per week on average), but they were very helpful and certainly a great addition to the lecture materials.\r\nWeakness: Professor Snyder sometimes jumps around in his lecture. I understand that given the time constraint of each lecture he cannot go into every detail, but sometimes it gets a bit confusing when he skips over information. All the missing pieces would be filled in by the reading materials though. Also handwritten notes were worth 20% of the grade, which is great, but to a slow writer like me it was a painful process, and out of all my courses this part was definitely what I spent the most time on. I liked the idea of taking notes from reading but would have appreciated the option of typing them.",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures; \r\nWeaknesses: often excessive readings that had to be reflected in the turning in of handwritten notes every week (would scan as a PDF and upload to Canvas)",
                "strengths: super interesting, amazing professor, great lectures and readings \r\nweaknesses: so much work!!!! the midterm, final, and final project were all so exhausting, and the weekly submission of notes (for a copious amount of reading) was very draining. It helped with my learning of the material, but this class almost always felt like wayyy too much work.",
                "Professor Snyder is a great lecturer, and I really enjoyed listening to the podcasts he made. However, I think the structure of the course this semester was a bit patronizing. The demand to turn in handwritten lecture and reading notes felt belittling, and it reflects a poor understanding of how to increase involvement. Professor Snyder said he was doing this to increase engagement, but workload and engagement aren't the same thing. The chronology assignment was interesting, but that also disrupted the experience of the readings, because I often found myself just skimming for dates. Finding 100 dates and an underlying theme that runs through all of them just didn't seem realistic. If he really cared about us thinking about how the events fit together, there should have been fewer dates and more emphasis on how they fit together. A lot of the work just felt like stuff you would do in high school.",
                "Strengths: Timothy Snyder is an effective lecturer, and the content was well-organized and connected.\r\nWeaknesses: Way too much work to assign to students in a pandemic. The same goal of the hand-written notes assignment could have been accomplished in a less punishing and severe way and the chronology could have been considerably condensed.",
                "More opportunities for students to interact with the Professor would be great.",
                "Handwritten notes were burdensome",
                "The reading load was a little high for a lecture class like this, but Professor Snyder's lecture were fantastic and accessible.",
                "The sections made for a good discussion of the material for the week, but the fact that we had to take notes for every reading and turn it in was too much. Having to read 300-600 pages a week was a lot of work but then when you have to take notes carefully for everything to turn in to your TF it is too much. I spend at least half of all the time I spend on classes on during reading for this class. The midterms were also a lot. Going from what should have been 2 50min in class test to 2 ca. 4000 word essays in 24 hours was very stressfull, I had to skipp my other classes that day to be able to get through it.",
                "The strengths - just how much you learn. It can't be understated. Snyder is a great lecturer but I found myself learning more through the reading.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses - THE WORKLOAD. Each week consisted of several hundred pages of reading, which you have to turn in notes for. There are two midterms that are intense, and the final project (100 date chronology) was due the same week as the second midweek.",
                "The chronology was an absolute disaster. Since we had 250+ pages of reading to take actual notes on every week, there was no time for me, a student taking 6 classes, to do the chronology piecewise.",
                "Professor Snyder is a great lecturer and explains not just what happened but why it happened. I wish, however, that it would be easier to book office hours with him or a way for all of us to ask questions in an office hours session like there was in some of my other lecture classes.",
                "I wish we could have interacted with the professor a bit more. The podcasts were nice and I'm glad I can re-listen to them but that being said it almost didn't feel like I was taking the class. This was especially dangerous because i was taking it Credit/D",
                "Strengths: Good thematic structure.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes unreasonably/unnecessarily high course load.",
                "A lot of empirical history. I thought that primary sources could have been utilized much more at the beginning of the course. The course provides a great array of sources, as well as literature later on.",
                "This course was extremely informative not just in a region of the world that is seldom taught in depth, but also in general concepts such as nationalism, communism, world economics, and the fall of empires. This made it by far my favorite course of this semester and even led me to change my major from History of Medicine to History. However, the readings for this class were excessive at times, especially for the very little information that some readings contributed. This course required me to turn in notes on every reading, every class and this resulted in almost 20 pages of notes every week for an introductory lecture course. I think many of the readings could be cut down or eliminated. On the other hand, I think we recieved a disproportionate amount of reading on certain countries. I think we lacked readings on Ukraine beyond their famine of 1932 and readings on Bulgaria and Yugoslavia before Tito. This overload of readings made it difficult to get a grip on the history at times and leave with a clear idea of what factors were at play within each country. Another strength was the list of vocabulary words Professor Snyder paired with each lecture. This was especially helpful for spelling purposes, for visual learners like myself, and also to get an idea of the main concepts I should be focusing on. Lastly, I only met Professor Snyder once during the entire semester because of the podcast format. I would have liked more direct engagement with the professor.",
                "This course is very content heavy. The reading load is extremely substantial, and at times a bit too much. The required weekly handwritten notes was also time consuming. However, these are not necessarily negative things. I learned a lot and most of the readings were quite interesting.",
                "Strengths: very intriguing course with really relevant content that parallels the present moment in a lot of ways, professor Snyder is a great lecturer\r\n\r\nweaknesses: a huge amount of reading, a really large final assignment, lectures are very conceptual and thus it REALLY helps to do the reading, which can take a huge amount of time",
                "Too much student self-teaching",
                "Professor Snyder is a brilliant historian and his lectures were engaging and illuminating. He recorded lectures as podcasts and uploaded them at the beginning of each week, which gave me a lot of flexibility in planning. However, I wish we could have had some live, synchronous lectures with Prof Snyder to create more of a sense of community. I definitely felt like I got to know the people in my discussion section, but outside of sections it was challenging to feel like you were in a class with other people because of how the course was structured. Not a huge downside, and definitely wouldn't be a problem in a normal, non-pandemic year. I want to sit in on this class when it's back in person!",
                "Strength: great lectures\r\nWeakness: way, way too much reading, and the handwritten notes for lecture and readings that we had to turn in were absurd and created so much extra work. The \"there hour exams\" took me 11 hours each, and this was normal for the class.",
                "The strengths are that the instructor had students take and submit notes. While rigorous, it did force students to have a higher content standard than in other courses in the history department. The weaknesses is the 'podcast' style lectures, which are completely apersonal and make this course seem as aloof as possible from an active instructor. TA made up for it, but oftentimes felt like TA was the real professor of course.",
                "Prof. Snyder was unable to meet the demands of an online course environment. The workload expected from students was delusional. The midterm exam had a suggested word count of 3500 words, and was intended to be done in 1-2 hrs. I felt bad for the TA's who had to read the nonsense that is produced when a college student tries to cram such volume into a time frame like that.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were pretty good though - Prof. Snyder has a very methodological approach to thinking about 20th century history that is lacking in most scholarship on the topic.",
                "Professor Snyder's podcast lectures were great, and his books are fantastic. The content of the course is something that isn't focused upon enough in history education and it brings a new perspective to understanding the core events of the 20th century. The exams were challenging, but the chronology was just a bit of a chore.",
                "Strengths - fantastic lectures, fascinating content, good pacing\r\nWeaknesses - only received feedback on the midterm and chronology draft, so it was difficult to know where I stood in the course grade-wise",
                "Weakness: (unnecessarily intense/tedious workload)\r\n\r\n1. The course required submitted notes for each lecture, and each reading weekly. These notes were graded and had to be handwritten. This was an enormous burden in terms of workload. \r\n\r\n2. The chronology assignment - the final assignment was to create a chronology of 100 dates between 1914-1995 we thought were most significant. With 150 word descriptions for each date, this meant the assignment was 15,000 words! We had a final exam to top it off. The chronology was cumbersome and tedious- citations for each date were required but ONLY from the course packet. So i spent hours scouring the pages to find the relevant date and reading. If this assignment is to be offered in the future, I would recommend not requiring citations from the course readings, but from any readings. The course packet is pdf of scanned pages, so you cannot search for text or highlight in most cases. At the end of it, I came out feeling like I didn't learn from the assignment at all, and spent 36 straight hours trying to get my citations in order. \r\n\r\nStrengths -\r\n\r\n1. The TA was great, and made the discussion sections as innovative as they could. They came up with new ways to engage with the material each time and section was always fun \r\n\r\n2. Professor Snyder has a knack for story telling and explaining very complicated historical events, and details in a manner that can be smoothly taken in.

This is the ENTIRE point of reading week!

I also really enjoyed his lecture style, though I wish he dwelled a bit more on post-2014 developments in the region\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's a big challenge to complete all the readings with lecture notes each week. Some readings seem very narrowly focused and require background information to follow, usually the earlier readings in the course packet",

                "Strengths: lectures were very engaging, TA was very responsive and helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not easy to connect with Professor Snyder; the instructions for the first exam and the major assignment (chronology) were not super clear; the readings were so long and heavy some weeks that it felt like you weren't even absorbing the material but rather just trying to get through it; citations from a poorly-scanned PDF document that did not even include proper page numbers on many of the pages made assignments way more stressful than need be",

                "Unfortunately this was one course that despite amazing course content and lectures, did not provide a sufficient support given the ongoing COVID pandemic. Professor Snyder overloaded the reading amount. This is supposed to be an intro survey lecture course but I have never read more than I have for this class-- sometimes over 500 pages a week or 200 pages per lecture (we had two a week). And despite the material being interesting, the most difficult part was Professor Snyder's requirement that we take handwritten notes on all the material and submit them to our TFs by section. While the purpose of this note-taking exercise is acknowledged by students, we all suffered from physical and mental health due to this task. As Yale students we are meticulous notetakers, especially since this was relatively new material to everyone. It was stressful to submit so much work on time when the readings were by no means structured for introductory lecture. Had this course been a seminar, and all of us hoping to become Eastern European historians/specialists, this density of work would have been understandable. But the pandemic continues and it just unfortunately seemed that Professor Snyder increased the workload rather than adjust it to the pandemic at hand. Of all courses that ever needed a midterm feedback form, this was one that REALLY needed one so that students could communicate with Professor Snyder that this approach was not working; he himself was never very available besides minimal office hours that were at difficult times.",
                "the recorded lectures were nice, but I also felt like I never connected with the professor, which is kind of sad\r\nAlso, I like the format of a 24-hour exam theoretically, but the assessments (final and midterm) were WAY too long and intense for 24 hours. I was up until 6am every time, after working all afternoon and evening, in order to finish them. Very stressful and exhausting",

                "Way too much work added for Covid. Handwritten reading and lectures notes, a new massive final assignment, and midterms that took entire days to do when Prof. Snyder said they would only take an hour or two. Fantastic course but really didn't like how much work was added during an already really difficult and stressful semester.",
                "I think a hybrid between podcast and zoom might have been better. The podcasts worked but I still don't really know what my professor even looked like which I find somewhat disappointing (not that that is important but it highlights the impersonal aspect of the class).",
                "This class became almost entirely asynchronous since Professor Snyder chose to make lectures in podcasts. His intention with this was for us to be able to take our eyes off the screen for a while and maybe take a walk. This was likely also meant to lower the stakes for us. However, we were required to take notes on lectures and turn them in every week.While I think it was well-intentioned, what ended up happening was that I would sit down with my laptop and pause constantly to take the notes rather than staying away from the screen and walking. I think if notes were not required for the lectures, this would have worked better. However, I appreciate that I can go back to these podcasts and refresh on the history.",

                "I thought the podcast form of lectures was great. It was very instructive and I was able to go back through the lectures to replay various parts I may have missed. I think the readings could have been more concise and chosen better as there was simply a mountian of literature to go over and not all of it felt particularily effective.",
                "The podcast format made for a welcome break from staring at my screen for hours a day of Zoom classes, and the flexibility of the asynchronicity made the work much easier to balance with my other courses. Being able to slow down or re-listen to the podcasts was incredibly helpful when navigating through complicated series of events. That being said, it would've been nice to have at least one live meeting with Prof. Snyder to bridge the asynchronous disconnect.",
                "Perhaps it was the virtual nature of the class, because of which Professor Snyder had to come up with a different way to grade participation and engagement with the course materials. Since there were no lectures, only podcasts, he had no way of knowing if we listened to them and thus required us to hand in notes for each lecture and reading. I cannot stress how much of a burden this was. People absorb information in different ways, and to be given a prescribed way to engage with the material was very difficult. \r\n\r\nI would suggest conducting virtual lectures, and marking attendance instead. Scrapping out the chronology assignment or making its requirements so that is doesn't waste so much time.",
                "Pro: Less time on zoom this was great and really helped alleviate fatigue; but would have loved to have video recordings of Snyder actually giving the lecture (would have felt more like a class and been more engaging). \r\nCons: Handwritten notes for all of the readings this helped with engagement for a little while, but by the middle of the semester they became quite tedious and unmanageable as other courses (like seminars that justly have more reading) began to pick up. It was also quite clear that some TFs were stricter on the quality of notes than others (not from the fault of the TF, but from Snyder being pretty checked out of Yale as he was in Austria all year). Pandemic Empathy Break Days were respected for the most part (lectures and sections did not occur on Break Days); however, because handwritten reading & lecture notes were still due regardless of there being a break day, you never actually had a meaningful break from the course. I don't know if this was a clear violation of Break Day policy but I would probably think yes. In general, there was low empathy for students throughout the course. Snyder had office hours twice a week (one in the afternoons on Thursdays which was reasonable and then another slot starting at 6AM on Fridays please tell me who is actually attending that). He was also completely unreachable by email (his yale.edu email) unless you were just looking to hire him for an event, find out how to purchase his books (of which he already made all of his students purchase two of them). I also ultimately ended up having to credit/d/fail this course because of the organization of the last 2 assignments (40% of your grade left up to the last week of classes) in which we had to turn in a 100 date chronology after having no checkpoints/checkins from TFs or Snyder the entire semester. The chronology was bad for a lot of reasons but the reason that was the most destructive for students & the reason many ended up not taking the course for a letter grade was due to it being due on the Monday of the final week of classes while requiring a quote/citation from each reading we did throughout the semester while not allowing us reading week to actually go through the course packet/novels/books with ample enough time to complete this assignment on top of the other assignments due during that time. This is the ENTIRE point of reading week! How can you have a reading load that includes a 589 page course packet (closer to 1000 pages of reading because of the scans), 3 novels (probably around 700 pages), and 3 books (probably around 800 pages) and NOT GRANT EXTENSIONS OR SET DEADLINES FOR AFTER READING WEEK??? This was a reading intensive course and there was no time to have that reflected because of poor course planning. \r\n\r\nI have so much more to say about this but in general-- It was bad given the pandemic. In any other year, I doubt there would have been the same problems BECAUSE Snyder would be forced to be in New Haven and be available to HIS students who he is being paid to teach and engage with. Really, really disappointed in this class, professor snyder, and the entire teaching staff. Students had a hard time in this class, and it's really unclear to me whether any of them cared.",
                "I liked the virtual lectures. I recommend that Professor Snyder assign the virtual lectures for homework next time he teaches the class and makes live class a q-and-a session.",
                "I would have preferred a recorded lecturer rather than the podcast format. My level of engagement was lower in part because it was difficult to remain focused on the material without actually seeing the instructor.",
                "I did not like the podcast-style lectures. While I understand the rationale of wanting the students to focus solely on the professors words, I think the lack of a live lecture, with absolutely no visuals (even just his facial expressions or hand gestures) meant it was hard to stay engaged with the lectures sometimes.",
                "See above. Additionally, I thought the recorded lecture aspect worked because it was helpful to go back and listen to them multiple times.",
                "I liked the podcast recorded lecture format, I think it provided a good amount of flexibility for students. Additionally, I thought that by submitting the notes by the end of the week helped me to not fall behind.

                "If you are planning to take this course post-pandemic and if Professor Snyder eases back the reading load by at least 50% I highly recommend this course. The readings are fascinating and Professor Snyder is a world-class lecturer. His scholarship is incredible. That being said this class has been single-handedly the most work I have ever had to do in my Yale career. Readings were over 500 pages a week for at least 3 of our weeks, and rarely below 200 pages. That wouldn't have been so bad had Professor Snyder not required timely, handwritten notes by the time section met every week. Like any Yale student, I appreciate when my professors bring their passion, expertise, and enthusiasm to the classroom. However this workload was simply overwhelmingly and often felt unmanageable. When I spoke with other students in the class I was glad to not feel alone, but if you take this class in the same format as it was taught Spring 2021 I would only advise taking it Cr/D. You will learn so much but it often feels overshadowed by the sheer burden the graded notetaking for this class is. Alternatively, I suggest you just buy Professor Snyder's books (Bloodlands and Black Earth) since he teaches a lot from them and they cover like 50% of the class topics/lessons. Amazing content, amazing lectures, dismal workload.",
                "Yes definitely! The importance of Eastern Europe in 20th century is so often overlooked, and anyone regardless of major should take this! But do be aware of the amount of reading (the reading is actually quite useful so you'd want to do at least most of it), so make sure you have enough time for it.",
                "Yes!!! the material is totally worth it, but make sure the rest of your workload is light because this is quite time consuming (mostly due to the weekly notes on the readings)",
                "Yes, Professor Snyder is a great lecturer, and this course would be particularly helpful people with or without a strong background in European history, since the region seems neglected. Hopefully Professor Snyder abandons some of the practices he put in place this semester once classes return to in-person settings.",
                "While I felt as though the course material was extremely interesting, the sheer amount of work nearly made it unbearable and being forced to submit your notes weekly felt tedious. The take-home tests meant to take 1-2 hours often took well into the night to complete. Unless something is done to make these expectations more manageable, I'm not sure I would recommend it.",
                "I recommend the course in its current format if and only if the student is concertedly interested in the subject matter and willing to dedicate time to a lecture course in order to learn and get a good grade. Otherwise, I'd only recommend it if the note-taking assignment is amended, because notes on every reading every week is just a lot with a full slate of other reading-oriented classes. The chronology is also very intense at the end, not to collect dates but to find citations and write paragraphs for EVERY date (mine was 25 pages single spaced), but better if you spread the work out substantially.",
                "Yes - it was a fascinating topic, and also taught me a very productive lens for looking at history",
                "Absolutely! I learned so much about Eastern European history.",
                "Yes, professor Snyder is an amazing lecturer but the zoom format of this class was too much and I would not recommend it to anyone if they are taking more than 4 credits.",
                "If you want a big lecture for a 4th or 5th class, NO. If you are genuinely interested in the region and prepared to put a large amount of time weekly into the class, yes.",
                "If they change from mandated notes and chronology, sure. Otherwise, yeesh",
                "Yes, the format this year was a little weird, but professor Snyder is an excellent instructor and the TA I had was also excellent.",
                "Yes, this is a great course. But, it's a ton of work. It's deceptively a ton of work. Writing notes by hand is terribly difficult and should be changed. There's so much reading, and the reading is often repetitive. The chronology is an incredibly difficult task. But, the subject matter is fascinating, and Snyder's lectures are incredibly engaging.",
                "this course teaches the student a lot, but the workload is very very high.",
                "This class is for students with a curiosity of Eastern Europe as a whole as well as nationalism, fascism, communism, peasant life, and on. We definitely did not just cover World War II. Beware, this class has hefty reading and the chronology is not to left for the last minute. Be prepared to skim through hundreds of pages a week. However, this course was extremely rewarding, especially for those of you who have never taken a history class before.",
                "I would recommend this course highly, as long as students are willing to put in the reading work. The course material is all incredibly interesting and insightful, but you will have to devote large portions of your week to completing the reading. \r\n\r\nOutside of that, this course has many strengths. Professor Snyder is a very engaging professor with great arguments and decades of experience. Snyder is a highlight reason alone to take this course. The readings are also great and much of the content has implications for understanding our modern world today.",
                "Yes, I definitely would. It's a great class and you'll learn an incredible amount about Eastern European history, with both a very complete overview of the period and intriguing connections to the present day. Professor Snyder is a great lecturer and it's also accessible to non-history majors. That being said, I'm not quite sure I'd put it in the \"ABSOLUTE MUST TAKE\" category, as the readings and final assignment (100 date chronology with a paragraph for each came out to dozens of pages of writing) are really quite hefty. And some of the lectures are hard to understand without the readings since they're so conceptual. But, if you're willing to put in the work you'll get a lot out of the course and learn a huge amount about our current world. This class changed how I see the world in a lot of ways.",
                "No, way too much work expected of students",
                "Yes! I had taken two courses with Professor Snyder this year and absolutely loved them both. He definitely assigned a fair amount of work but I learned so much about the history of Eastern Europe -- the two world wars, the postwar communist takeover, the Cold War and Soviet domination, and the fall of communism in 1989. Professor Snyder was a brilliant lecturer and taking this class was one of the best decisions I had made at Yale. \r\nThis class is not a gut, and you should only take it if you're willing to put in the work and effort.",
                "Yes-ish- if you are prepared to work, it is an incredibly rewarding class. You will walk out of very lecture having learned more information about an incredibly complex and fascinating region and time period. that said, it is a ton of work, and I am a history major who has taken many many history classes. You have to do 100+ pages of reading for each class and turned in handwritten notes on lecture and readings. These just took time, and didn't help my learning. The exams were very very long too.",
                "I think this class helps students to understand a really important and interesting history. However, the amount of work we had during a pandemic was outrageous. My TF was really kind and helpful, but at the end of the day I think students would get much more out of this class if it wasn't structured to be so overwhelming. Live lectures would have also helped - for the sake of engagement, being able to ask questions, etc.",
                "Maybe, if it was in person.",
                "NO! DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE...",
                "I recommend this course as a Cr/D. The lectures are well done, but you don't want to be stuck having to send in your notes every week and write a 6k word chronology on top of the exams.",
                "The course is good, but it was not structured well at all. Lectures were easy to follow but expectations did not match a normal course at Yale.",
                "Yes! I took this as a distributional and really enjoyed the content and learned a lot through the course.",
                "Yes - this is as important as any history course if you are looking to understand Europe. If you work on the chronology as you go rather than all at once at the end you will enjoy it.",
                "Yes! Prof. Snyder is a FANTASTIC lecturer and makes complicated historical events very accessible. I had no background whatsoever in the topic beforehand, and I came out with a strong understanding of not only what happened, but why and how. Be warned that there is a lot of reading for this course, so if you're not up for that, you should probably credit/D it.",
                "No, do not take this course, specially if it is offered online or the syllabus has been altered. Go through the syllabus before signing up, and make sure handwritten notes are not required and that there is more engagement with the professor. \r\n\r\nProfessor Snyder is a good lecturer, but his lectures make up only a minute part of the course work needed to be done.",
                "I took Hitler, Stalin, and Us (another Snyder course) in the fall and absolutely loved it. Sure, I had some of the same qualms with the style of presenting the material (podcasts instead of video lectures, handwritten notes became tedious, etc.), but in general the reading load was manageable, I learned a TON, and found the weekly essays challenging but very engaging/rewarding. I was excited to take another Snyder course this semester but had the exact opposite experience. I am leaving this course knowing the same level of thought/planning was not put in to executing this course on Snyder's part (repeated readings on the syllabus, no clear plan for Break Days, and an obvious lack of communication to TFs), and ultimately I am extremely disappointed. You will learn from this course (especially if it is not taught remotely again), but I think Snyder really dropped the ball this semester and students ultimately suffered because of his lack of care and engagement. \r\n\r\nHere are a list of complaints I wrote throughout the semester for more detail: \r\nNon-searchable pdf course packet (it was almost 600 pages long and we were meant to cite from these readings on the 100 date chronology & exams)\r\nReading assignments were completely unmanageable for a lecture course (easily fixable through better planning)\r\nAssignments due on break days\r\nMidterm exam took 7 hours outside of allotted class time (supposedly meant to take 2 hours)\r\nNo reading week, 40% of grade left up to final week of classes\r\nNo extensions granted beyond final week of classes\r\nDid not formally state that it would be foregoing reading week on syllabus\r\nRead his books on your own time\r\nFirst  of class repeat from other course\r\nHe will not answer your emails (it is an automated response; email him literally anything and that is what you will get)\r\n6AM OFFICE HOURS BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN IN AUSTRIA ALL YEAR\r\n\r\n**Also, just want to note that I usually don't leave this detailed of a course review but feel extremely strongly about this course and its effect on students. Trying not to be too upset about having to credit/d/fail a class for my major in the last week (& still completing every assignment and turning in high-quality work because I could not be granted an extension without doing so) & only include that information to be as honest as possible in this evaluation.",
                "Yes, but I recommend taking it credit-d if you don't want to spend 3-5 hours per week doing reading and taking notes",
                "Yes, but with a caveat. This course, as it was designed for this semester, felt like it had a lot of busy work (handwritten reading notes every week for about 150-200 pages of reading), plus an end of term chronology with 100 dates from those notes. If you dont want to put in the work, you will start to disengage from the course.",
                "Yes! I have taken both the fall and spring portions of this course and have loved them both. You learn so much and develop a rich understanding of European history from a perspective that you often don't get otherwise.",
                "If the course continues to be taught the same way as it has been during COVID and Zoom learning (e.g. required citations, really long take-home exams, extremely long readings with required submission of notes), I would only recommend this course if you are very, very interested in the subject or if you plan on Cr/D and want to take a course with Professor Snyder who is truly an expert in his field",
