                "This class encouraged thinking in a way I've never done before. Prof. Kachru is fantastic and engaging. I do wish we continued receiving handouts past lecture 3 -- I think they helped me follow along lecture better.",
                "Strength was flexibility of assignments, enough readings to learn but not so many that you end up skipping them. Professor was greatest strength. It was also good just once a week.",
                "The professor is quite kind and patient -- he's eloquent and engages with the class well. I just wish sometimes he introduced more new content into the class. Maybe studying the Mahabharata would've been a better option since we would've been able to study more content.",
                "Really interesting material - just wish we spent more time reading\/re-reading the Bhagavad Gita itself. Maybe reading the entire thing twice over the course of the semester.",
                "Strengths: TEACHER (cannot emphasize enough), TA, material\r\nWeakness: none",
                "This course was very effective in letting students find their own natural path with the works. The professor and TA were very effective in giving students space to explore (even if it was in the \"wrong directions\"). There were no glaring weaknesses of the course. It accomplished exactly what it says in the syllabus.",
                "The content of the course was very interesting and our discussions in class were thought-provoking. My main suggestion is to try to return feedback on the assignments earlier on so that students can learn from their previous work and improve on future assignments.",
                "A strength of this course pertains to the way in which this course covered many different topics relevant to the Gita, all the way from J. Robert Oppenheimer's famous Gita reference to climate change crises of the modern day. The course also investigates the ways in which the Gita is infused with philosophical thought, which I found engaging.",
                "I feel that the assignments (there are 4 short papers) were about good subjects, and were graded generally generously, however there would be no feedback on how to improve. While you could meet with the TA about a past assignment, the area of improvement I was pointed to was extremely general i.e. address the prompt more directly, which may be helpful to some students, but as the only feedback for the assignment, it left me submitting the same quality of writing for future work.\r\nI wish assignments were more spaced out, and introduced earlier to the deadline. For some of our assignments, there would be little to no discussion in class, and wed receive an email several days or a week before the deadline with instructions that still felt unclear. While Professor Kachru was flexible about deadlines, the last couple of weeks of the semester felt abnormally work loaded compared to the rest of the semester."

                "If you are interested in the Gita in any capacity, definitely take the class. It's more like a chill lecture than a seminar, but Prof Kachru is an engaging lecturer and you will learn so much about the Gita. We learned about many different interpretations of the text, but Prof Kachru also made sure that we always stayed close to the text and gave us many opportunities to reread certain verses in the Gita after having learned about the context\/interpretations of those verses. If you have never had experience with religious philosophy, theology, South Asian philosophy, it can definitely be challenging, but meeting with the prof in office hours is always a treat and you will definitely be able to handle your own in the course.",
                "Yes I would- it is a fascinating course that introduces really well to students the kind of monotheistic aspect of Hinduism. I also appreciated the weekly journal assignments for students to reflect o their readings. I have benefited a lot from writing these journals.",
                "Yes  if they were interested in learning more about Indian philosophy.",
                "Yes absolutely. Take it",
                "Yes, great gut",
                "Yes, best class at Yale and best professor.",
                "If the next iteration of the course has better feedback after assignments and more content covered, then yes.",
                "Excellent class. All of the readings (Gita in particular) were fascinating and my mind was consistently blown throughout the course. Kachru is a really engaging lecturer and I love hearing him talk. The assignments are pretty short and allow for a lot of creativity.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. This has been my favorite course at Yale because of Professor Kachru. He has an incredible grasp and ability to analyze and explain the material. I have learned so much from this class. Truly the professor makes this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that wants to engage with the Gita in a new way. The additional readings add new insights and new perspectives to it. The point to keep in mind here is that the additional texts are meant to expand the perspective so going in with an open mind is very important.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course because the Gita is a fascinating dialogue that is infused with philosophy. On top of this, Prof. Kachru does an incredible job of helping students bring their own perspectives to this text, instead of prescribing one objective lens for which the text must be viewed.",
                "As a gut, yes. I spent ~4 hrs\/wk on this course. I feel like there was not a significant depth in what we learned the main ideas of the Gita can be summarized pretty easily (do your duty).\r\nI enjoyed how Professor Kachru invites a discussion, and invites you to argue that God is wrong in his arguments in the Gita. Hes engaging, and prepares presentations that try to explain more difficult verses or apply the framework to important scenarios such as Oppenheimer. However, many times, I felt a little lost in what he was saying, which prompted me to take notes of exactly what he was saying to review later which I read later and still didnt understand. He wasnt using sophisticated language, it was more of many abstract terms together. I dont think this reflects bad on Professor Kachru, however, since this was my first class where topics of morality and what it means to be human was discussed.\r\nI dont think that I grew a lot from this class. The idea of do your duty may not always be a great framework, which is something discussed in class-- in other words the class did not really change the way I think about things as I had hoped it would."
