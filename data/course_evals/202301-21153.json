                "I learned a lot about interfacial phenomena, from colloids to suspensions, rheology and fluid dynamics. This class has it all, Capillary rise to the Cheerios Effect, among many other phenomena.",
                "This class offered more applicable concepts than any of the major classes (I took) at Yale. Now, everything in this world is covered in interfacial phenomena, with mathematic and engineering science dominates.",

Beyond interfacial phenomena, Prof. Vanderlick also developed some of our professional skills, and I gained an understanding of what working as an engineer might look like.",

                "Strength is obviously Professor Vanderlick and her passion for the topic. She has a unique ability to make topics exciting and grab hold of everyone's attention. She also cares so deeply about each student. The only improvement would be a little more connection between Problems and what was taught in class. Sometimes what was taught in class was very basic and the Problems were so much deeper. But overall, wonderful and fair class.",
                "Strengths of this course include Professor Vanderlick, the interesting content, and the no test/project based grading format.",
                "Professor Vanderlick is the best among all the professors in the ChemE department. Just take her class and you would know!",
                "Strength: Strong professor, fun class, relatively easy workload with fun projects \r\nWeakness: The office hour is limited (once per week), so it could scary to solve homework problems without aid.",
                "Strengths are Prof V! She is an amazing professor and her excitement makes you excited to learn.",
                "The format of this course is one of its biggest strengths. Because there are no tests, and the grade is only based on problems and projects, it encourages learning in a low-pressure, stress-free way. The subject material of this course is really interesting, and the way Prof. Vanderlick teaches makes every class engaging and fun! The only thing I struggled with in this course was the most of the workload in terms of project was concentrated toward the end of the semester, which lined up with when the most difficult material was covered as well as a generally busy time of the semester in most courses.",
                "The course covers a lot of material, but it is structured in a way that makes it easy to digest. The weekly problems cover class topics in greater depth, pushing you into thinking like an engineer. I think a possible change or improvement could be to have the projects spaced out over the semester instead of having them back-to-back near the end.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Especially for ChemE's, this is a wonderful elective credit that is well taught and a great addition to engineering skillsets. The grading structure is also great because you can do well as long as you do what is expected, and the lack of tests helps take the pressure off so you can dive into the learning. The material is also really interesting (though sometimes the math is tough to grasp).",
                "Even a non-Chemical Engineering major could take this class and understand it. The Computer Scientist in the class performed well and loved the class.",
                "100% You will learn so much about engineering and design from this course. I think it's super super important for critical thinking and applying engineering skills.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!! If you're an engineering major looking for an elective that is both interesting/enjoyable AND low-stress, look no further!!! The content is genuinely so interesting and pratically relevant -- we learned why folding pizza makes it more sturdy, why cheerios come together in milk when there are only a few left, how to calculate how big a drop of water hanging from a branch can get, and other things like that! Because there are no tests, you can learn all this interesting stuff in a very low-stress environment. Also, Prof. Vanderlick is the best professor I have had at Yale, and she makes even the least exciting material engaging and interesting.",
                "This class is a great elective that delivers engaging and very important material, even extending to topics like working in industry or academia. I would strongly recommend it to chemical engineering majors or anyone who might be interested.",
