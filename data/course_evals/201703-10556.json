    "This class discusses the wide variety of applications that isotopes have to studying chemical and biological phenomena. It emphasizes the importance of different isotopes in studying reaction mechanisms and reaction kinetics.",
    "I learned a few interesting facts about isotopes and carbocation structures, but really that I was it. I didn't learn much in this class. I took it mainly because I needed to take 5 credits, and needed a 5th class that wouldn't be too work-intensive. This class was suited perfectly for that, insofar as I now have a chemistry class on my transcript that required maybe 15 hours of my time through the entire semester. What little I learned, I've probably already forgotten.",
    "I learned a fair bit about isotopes: their discovery, how they're used in chemistry, medicine and other fields.",
    "This course offered a broad overview of isotope chemistry, both the processes involving isotopes and their history.",
    "I learned a lot about isotope applications and history. It's really interesting to be able to learn about so many different uses of isotopes!"

   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength of this class is the level of depth that it uses when discussing applications of isotopes in chemistry. There are many uses for them in chemistry that are never explained in other courses.",
    "Strengths: the professor has a wealth of knowledge not only about chemistry, but about the history of science and the contemporary context in which a lot of these findings were developed. It's probably because he was alive at the time, but nonetheless it's interesting to hear him talk about things that indirectly related to the subject. The stories he tells are always interesting and amusing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No homework or regular work was assigned, lectures were not engaging, midterm and final were a joke. Very little about this class actually resembled a normal class.",
    "The material is quite interesting, the lectures are not overloaded with information and the workload is very reasonable for an advanced chemistry course. Prof. Saunders is also a really nice person, and the oral final was a great opportunity to discuss chemistry with him.",
    "The material was really interesting, it just probably could have been organized better",
    "The material of the course is pretty neat, but I feel that the course could benefit from some additional structure to ensure that all of the students are fully engaging with the material throughout the semester.  Prof. Saunders has a lot of unique knowledge from his field, and it would be good if the class was set up to allow for more discussion about the material.  Perhaps hiring an assistant for Prof. Saunders would help include more student engagement in this course."

   "comments": [
    "I would take this class if you are trying to find additional chemistry electives. It is honestly a lot more interesting than the course title may lead you to believe and you'll learn a lot about an entire field of research that you may not have even realized existed. Professor Saunders has some very interesting stories to tell about chemistry too, which are not something you can get in any other class. The workload is very light. There is one in-class midterm and an oral final exam that takes one hour, and that's it. Definitely take this if you are trying to get some chemistry credits.",
    "Depends on what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nLooking for an interesting yet challenging chemistry elective to fulfill your major requirements and learn about the science? Absolutely do  not take. You will learn nothing.\r\n\r\nLooking for a class that you'll forget you're enrolled in, breeze through, and not be able to talk about with a straight face? You're in the right place. \r\n\r\nThis class is a nice 5th class as long as you're comfortable with the idea of putting in literally zero effort, and receiving as much back from the class itself.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you're a chemistry major who needs electives, don't hesitate for a second, take this class: it's interesting and easy.",
    "Maybe? I have no idea what my grade is right now. But there is very little work so it has that going for it.",
    "This is a pretty fun class. Lecture isn't always the most interesting, but there is a good deal of history and trivia peppered into the lectures, so if you like that you'll probably enjoy this. The workload is nonexistant, and the final exam is an oral exam, which was stress-free.",
    "Yeah it was a good class! Pretty chill but I still learned a lot. Not too much work (really just the final and the midterm). The oral final is a good opportunity to chat with the professor, and it's quite fun.",
    "Yes! Professor Saunders is great."
