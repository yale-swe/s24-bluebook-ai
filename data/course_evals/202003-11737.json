I think those moments are a good way to identify which parts of the lectures were a bit tougher to apply into real problems.\r\n\r\nI think being virtual made this course very tough. I felt like the course content could have been communicated in a much clearer manner.",
                "I don't think this course worked super well in a virtual setting. I had a very hard time following the lectures usually, and I think that having a set of lecture slides so that they were organized and the students could get the relevant information more easily could be helpful.",
                "New professor, fewer tedious problem sets, and a more generous approach to assessments are all needed.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Gave a comprehensive overview of ODEs and how to solve them\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lectures were disorganized and hard to follow\r\n- Most teaching in the course amounted to listing out methods of solving with lots of hand-waving and not a lot of proofs or even intuition\r\n- Feedback on exams and homework was often late, limited, or missing entirely",
                "Strengths: Very few. Grading is rather lenient, though.\r\nWeaknesses: Ariel was not very helpful at all, and he didn't record several lectures which made it difficult to keep up in different time zones. Moreover, he wasn't very responsive to emails.",
                "This course is not very well taught. The course covers various method for solving different differential equations, but the topics are not presented in a very interesting or compelling fashion, and the material becomes extremely forgettable. Lectures often felt pointless, like I could have just read about the material in a tenth of the time it took him to explain it in class and walked away with a better understanding. The professor just lists off different methods for solving ODEs, and then you practice those methods on different ODEs he assigns you. The way I see it, if this is all a professor does, then there is no point in having a professor at all. Problem sets were sometimes way too long and often we were left to teach ourselves the material."

                "Yes. The topic is interesting and Professor Jaffe really cares about having his students understand the content. ODEs  are actually pretty fun to solve. The lectures can sometimes be a little confusing because Professor Jaffe's notes can be messy but he is always willing to answer questions and review concepts after class\/in his office hours. You definitely need to be proactive in the class, in terms of asking for information, practice exams, or answer keys otherwise you will not get them. However, the topic is great for those who enjoy problem solving and not proofs and want to learn more about ODEs.",

Sure, differential equations are useful but it's not like you can't just look up how to solve one when you come across it.  If you have the opportunity to take literally any other math course instead, you should. Take this course only if you absolutely must.",
                "Let's face it  basically anybody taking this course is doing so because it's required for their major. If you need to take it, then take it; otherwise, if you really love ODEs, just go learn them from Paul's math notes.",
