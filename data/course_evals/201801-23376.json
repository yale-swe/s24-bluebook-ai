   "comments": [
    "Professor Adorno truly makes this course the fun, educational, and interesting class that it is; without her unique and informed perspective, the course would not have been nearly as engaging or accessible.",
    "I think that if this course is to be taught again there should be one version of the class taught in English and another taught in Spanish. As someone that read the works in Spanish, lectures sometimes were confusing because I had not done the English version of the reading and had very little experience discussing the works in Spanish before I was required to write about them. I think that the setup this way would facilitate improved student learning all around.",
    "I think this course has a phenomenal reading list and Prof. Adorno is both knowledgable and enthusiastic about the material, making this a great course.",
    "The course is very strong, a lecture\/seminar mix.  Professor Adorno could lecture even more, really.",
    "The course was great. I loved the combined lecture\/seminar format. Professor Adorno makes every class engaging and interesting.",
    "The professor was incredibly knowledgeable on the subjects at hand and would often lead us through meaningful conversation about the novels we read. Having the small class size also allowed for deeper conversations and more detailed understandings of the novels themselves."

   "comments": [
    "I would.  It is a lovely marriage of literature of the Americas north and south and a great professor.",
    "If Professor Adorno is teaching it, then always.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed reading works and comparing them and it was not an exercise I had really done before, so this was a great experience",
    "Highly recommend.  Great books, great professor.",
    "Of course! The professor alone might be a reason to take the course, but the reading list set up by the professor also captures the human condition that exists between north and south america and we can clearly see the influences on one another in this class."
