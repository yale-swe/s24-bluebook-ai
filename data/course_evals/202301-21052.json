                "Strengths: extremely well-organized. Weaknesses: would be better if we have more time for discussions",
                "The readings sometimes required specialized technical knowledge, but they were explained thoroughly and made approachable in class. Higher-level concepts and distinctions became very clear over time, like the subjective-objective divide, and the general definitions of each interpretation--a good introduction. More specific problems and distinctions were tougher to master, but that would make sense given my unfamiliarity with the subject. One note on the explanations is that some examples--like the often-cited decay of a radioactive atom--would have been easier to understand if I had more background knowledge in physics (even after I took two semesters of intro physics at Yale).\r\n\r\nThe best discussions were those in which students took the most active role, particularly frequentism and the applications unit at the end. The first (real) class, on the history of probability, seemed slightly extraneous to the more analytical content we worked with later, but it was still interesting. \r\n\r\nThe decision to swap out the problem set for a third paper was unexpected, and I would be curious to see what a problem set might look like, but the paper feedback was very helpful and I'm ultimately glad to have had the extra practice with a paper instead.",

                "Absolutely, yes. More specialized philosophy seminars like this one are great; they usually draw good classmates and it's always fun to work with contemporary readings/papers. This class in particular was no exception, and it was fun to think hard enough to write papers in an area of philosophy that I wouldn't usually explore. The class itself, thanks to Dr. Meehan, struck a good balance between complicated arguments and simple explanations. And probability is something we often take for granted, so it's ripe for philosophical examination.",
