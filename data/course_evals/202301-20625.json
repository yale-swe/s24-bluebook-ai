In other words, taking this course did open my mind to thinking about why we think about history, for example, in a \"global\" sense or a thematic sense. And, it made me think about the pros and cons of different ways of approaching the study of history. In terms of actual historical knowledge or background from the time period around 1800, I can't say I learned much from this course.",

                "Great overall course. Professor Semmel was a solid lecturer who skillfully weaved together evidence and examples from multiple areas of the world in all of his lectures, each of which focused on a different topic or theme with a global dimension. The weekly readings were usually good and interesting (the primary sources much more so than the secondary ones, as the latter occasionally appeared dry and slightly too long), the weekly discussion session was helpful in building upon the understanding developed during the lectures, and the major assignments (weekly reading responses, 3 papers, one quiz-and-ID midterm, and one ID-and-essay final exam) were very fair while not requiring too much time to complete or prepare for.",
                "strengths: professor stuart\r\nweaknesses: the TAs",
                "Lectures were sometimes hard to sit through and attendance at lecture was always low. I did not attend over half of the lectures and every time I did go, only about 1\/4th of the class was there. Prof. Semmel is a nice professor but often would go into tiny details that didn't seem important and often made his lectures hard to follow. You did not have to go to lecture at all to be prepared for section or to write the papers  perhaps they helped for the midterm and final, but you still didn't really have to go. The strengths of the course were Prof. Semmel's enthusiasm in teaching it, his communication and availability for students, as well as the discussion sections which were a little better engagement-wise. Personally, my TF was also fantastic in leading section and providing help and feedback to students on papers.",
                "Maybe slightly more linearity",
                "This class is marketed as something it's not. It's not engaging, and flat out not interesting. The class suffers from poorly prepared lectures that consist of lecture slides with little to no content on them. The professor just cycles through each one of them and reads off them, and rambles for a bit about each. Unfortunately, the professor seemed to know little about the history of many of the places discussed (which is fair considering how broad the scope is), but this makes for a fairly disappointing class as the professor can't add anything on past whatever the lecture slide says.",
                "Strengths: None \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The entire course. Lectures were boring and almost unbearable at times. Prof was monotone, mumbled a lot, and rambled on about random stuff. Not to mention we had a mask mandate which made it even harder to understand him. We had an entire lecture (50 minutes) about timber. Yes, literally about wood. While I can see why others would call this a gut because it's fairly easy to do well, it is not worth the awful lectures (which are also not recorded, btw). There are other Hu credits out there. Also, the lecture slides are useless so you have to attend lecture or get good notes from someone else.",
                "A strength of the course is Prof. Semmel and his commitment to creating a comprehensive course with the lofty goal of presenting a global history. His lectures are well prepared and given, and I was able to leave each one feeling like I understood the central message that he communicated. The workload is also very manageable, and the exams are simple and easy to prepare for. I do not see any weaknesses for this course.",
                "Strengths: Gives a balanced view into global history. Shows the complexity of history and does not offer monocausal explanations to gain popularity (as some history courses do). Exams were also very fair.\r\n\r\nImprovements: I think two essays is more than enough when there are two exams for a course -- the third felt a little overkill.\r\nWhile I understand how hard it is to teach this course -- sometimes a little more organisation could be useful. I often knew at the end of the lecture what the overarching theme or claim was but could be a little more organized.",
                "The strength of the course is that what is expected is very clear. Paper prompts and exam prompts align with lectures and readings very well. Main weakness is lack of planning from professor regarding what is expected.",
                "Strengths: focuses on interesting topics; covers a breadth of topics. Weaknesses: lectures were unengaging and had no clear focus.",
                "Strengths: Professor Semmel is a great guy but the class is just not organized well. I felt like I didn't learn much from lecture at all. I learned mostly from discussion sections. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were often very dry and hard to pay attention during. I understand that it was difficult to concentrate on one topic since it's a world history class, but I think it would have been helpful to go in more depth on certain topics. We also didn't cover Latin America much at all.",
                "The scope of this class is a challenge. Its also a really good component of the class. I think the fact that we wore masks really made it harder to pay attention than I thought it would. I thought, as interesting as it was, it wasnt quite rigorous enough to really pique my interest and keep me really engaged.",
                "Power point slides during lecture were not always super engaging, but the readings assigned were great. Short and sweet for the most part.",
                "I think the PowerPoint could have been a bit more structured and robust",
                "Strengths- easy history course for a non-major, interesting overview of world history, Professor Semmel is a good lecturer and has good TAs\r\nWeaknesses- course doesn't really go in-depth to any of the topics covered, might be boring for a history major, but section would be the chance to go more in-depth",
                "Strength are the variety of assignments to enhance writing skills.",
                "It was very difficult to synthesize the at-time random material although section did a good job of that. That material itself was very interesting though",
                "Half way through the semester, the lectures became almost impossible to follow at all.",
                "Lecture and discussion were both great, but the papers were graded based on writing style, not content.",
                "This course was well, but I would teach it more chronologically",
                "A weakness of this course was the lecture slides did not give enough information and were not clear.",
                "Strong in its messaging, but very scattered lecture. Readings were very good\/on topic though",
                "Strengths: The only history class I took was AP US History, so it might not be the same for everyone, but I learned so many things in this class that I would never have been able to otherwise. For example, learning about Britain, India, France, China, and Haiti's history was an eye-opening experience. Moreover, it challenged my views on history; for example, the current American Curriculum not elaborating on Haiti's contribution to US gaining Louisiana. Weaknesses: THIS IS NOT A GUT CLASS. 3-5 readings per week, a map quiz, a midterm, a final, and 3 essays, one of which is a final essay during reading period. I had to collaborate with two friends and make a 90 page Google Docs for this class."

                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any student, regardless of how many (if any) history courses he or she has taken at Yale already. The material is interesting, the professor and TAs (at least for this iteration of it) were good, and it was not needlessly work-intensive.",
                "i would not recommend this course to another student. professor stuart is an excellent professor and i hope to take a seminar with him in the future. however, the TAs grade extremely harshly. THIS IS NOT A GUT. this course is advertised to be accessible for non-history students so the TAs grade the STEM students wayyyy easier than the humanities students. so my piece of advice to future students of this course: lie and say you're a stem student even if you aren't. also, the TAs grade absolutely everything in the class (exams too) so if your TA doesn't like you...good luck",
                "If you want a gut and are ready to fully and wholeheartedly embrace the guttiness, this will work. However, if you want to be engaged in class and have classmates who are engaged in discussion section, this might not work. My TF was great, but sections were still sometimes difficult because not many people wanted to talk and it often ended up being the same 3-4 people carrying discussion. So, if you want to be engaged in the class and don't enjoy awkward silences in section, you could very well be frustrated by this class. But if you want a class with some interesting history and not much work, this course suits you.",
                "Yes, great way to get a insight on the world in 1800",
                "No. Poorly taught. Lectures are unengaging, chore to sit through them. Content tested is not clear, which made preparing for quizzes\/exams difficult. Papers don't help you learn history.",
                "This course is a nice gut history class for STEM majors, but the workload is not as low as it seems at face value. The readings pilled up around the middle of the semester, and you have to put some effort into the papers (if you are a beginner at history papers like I was).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who may be interested in the subject matter. The class is fun, relatively low workload, and engaging. The course material is also engaging and easy to learn.",
                "NO!!!! Save yourself. I dreaded going to class every day because of how bad the lectures were. Literally any other Hu credit would be better than this. Only take this course if you like timber and codified constitutions",
                "This is great class for any Yale student. A well-versed history student likely would not get very much benefit out of the simplicity in which the information is presented, but anyone else would learn a lot. It is a great introductory history course with workload on the lower end, manageable essays and reading assignments, and relatively easy exams.",
                "I would recommend to someone who has an interest in history and wants an overview of many different global events. This course covers many continents and no one event is covered in depth. If that is what you like that it will be good for you. The exams and papers are also logical and fair. Professor Semmel's style of lecture is also more thematic and philosophical which I enjoy.",
                "The material in the course is very much a hit or miss. Some weeks I found the reading very engaging and other times it was difficult to get through. Overall, if you are looking for a continuation to AP World with more primary sources, this is a good course.",
                "The workload is low and you will gain a strong sense of what was going on in the world around the year 1800. The essays are fun to write and teach you how to analyze sources well.",
                "I would not recommend this to another student if they are looking for a gut. I did not think this class was a gut with two exams, three papers, and weekly readings. Find another history course if you want to take one.",
                "Yes",
                "100%. Take the class. Get a world scope of the world and the class itself will not have you losing sleep. Worth it in the end.",
                "This course is a very easy, survey-level history course. If that's what you are looking for, take it. If you want something more complex and in-depth, I would look elsewhere. The writing assignments can be frustratingly simple to somebody who would like to go into more detail.",
                "Yes would recommend",
                "This was a very interesting course if you are looking for an introduction to either history or global history. The Professor is amazing and his lecture style is captivating. However, the material can feel very random and unconnected at times. The paper prompts are very basic and make it difficult to write strong analytical papers.",
                "I would but you have to be prepared for really hard to follow lectures because at some points I had no clue what the professor was talking about.",

                "If you already took global history classes before (like AP World History), then you may not learn as much or be as engaged. This class feels more like a global history class for someone who have never taken one before. Moreover, this class got a patch note buff and is not a gut class anymore. That said, I would give it a try during shopping period, especially if you have not taken a global history class before."
