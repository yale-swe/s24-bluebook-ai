                "Course materials are so expensive. I think it is very discouraging for most of the students.",
                "The small class size (capped at 15) is helpful, as you get more opportunities to engage directly with the professor and you get close as a class. Lots of work, but a lot of it is completion-graded and okay to keep up with if you have the time. The main weakness is that the textbook is super expensive. $150 just for the online textbook, and then a $10 novel and $35 for five 15-minute conversation sessions with a native Spanish speaker. So it's nearly $200 total, and that's if you're not buying the print textbook. This isn't the fault of the faculty/department at all, I just think since Yale has $42 billion, the institution could make it easier for their students to take Spanish classes, because knowledge of the language is a really good skill to have.",
                "Moves very fast, could slow down and add a few review days. \r\nStrength is taking time to learn about the culture and having mutiple forms of projects.",
                "I love the structure of the course but I think work on asynchronous days could be optional to make the course less stressful.",
                "The course was interesting and comprehensive, but it moved very fast. It could be improved if there were days for review because without them I found it hard to remember and use all the content.",
                "The strengths of this course were the lingua meetings and the projects, which helped my understanding of Spanish very much. One weakness of the course was that there was not enough grammar practice worksheets that I feel could have helped my understanding.",
                "The strength of this course was that since everyone was starting a new language, I could actively engage in class without worrying about saying wrong answers!",
                "The strengths are the amazing professors who are super eager to help us learn! I liked the way the course incorporated things like lingua meet, and daily exercises! However, this class is everyday and can get tiresome, especially if taken at the 9am slot."
