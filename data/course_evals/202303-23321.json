I loved the reading selections and the opportunities to also engage with film/media. I would have loved to read more on the technology side as I felt like a lot of our readings were centered around biology, but I still thought it was a great selection and we had a lot of good conversations.\r\nI especially appreciated when we got to work in pairs or small groups to discuss first because I felt like it gave more room to talk. Sometimes we weren't able to finish everything in a class session because student presentations ran long, so perhaps presentations could be more focused on facilitating discussion rather than just summary of the chapters.",
                "this class was amazing! Prof Valdez was incredibly thoughtful and insightful and was so committed to making sure the course was tailored to the students' learning objectives.",
                "strengths of the course are engaging readings, small classroom size which enabled us to have a good relationship with each other and with professor (we had two parties as a class) and the fact that professor Valdez is so knowledgeable on the subject and very kind as a person. our classroom was definitely a safe space for all of us, and we learned so much over the course of the semester."

Student thoughts and needs are taken very seriously by professor Valdez and discussions are always inclusive and intellectually stimulating. Assignments are thoughtful and fair with very helpful feedback. Cannot express how much I felt seen, heard, and appreciated in this class and would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about feminist thought and practices.",

                "yes, I would definitely recommend this class to any student, but only students who are willing to challenge their own thinking and be very vulnerable in a classroom environment and also students willing to engage with sometimes difficult course material and treat all subjects with grace."
