   "comments": [
    "Engineering analysis, dimensionless parameters, quantitative reasoning",
    "I was able to apply my prior knowledge about calculus to learning about the basics of chemical engineering and mathematical modeling. One of the main things that I learned was using dimensionless variables and the Buckingham Pi theorem in mathematical relations to represent various chemical processes. One other insight from the course that I found to be very helpful was the improv aspect, so that I can apply the mathematical modeling knowledge that I gained from this course to other problems in engineering and science.",
    "Dimensional Analysis, Mathematical Modeling, Scaling Arguments, Conservation equations, Transport Phenomena. Skills useful for any STEM major and good real world relevance.",
    "I learned a lot in this course I had a chance to explore my major and dive deeper",
    "I developed the skill of using mathematics to model different engineering problems, as well as the basics of chemical engineering. Specific topics covered include nondimensionalization of equations, basic thermodynamics, engines and fridges and nondimensional numbers (Reynolds number, Prandtl number, Nusselt number, etc.).",
    "given a broad overview of the analytical thinking behind chemical engineering, eg mass balance, thermo, transport problems",
    "I got a great general overview of techniques used in engineering, and was surprised with how powerful calculus is in solving engineering problems.",
    "I learned a lot about chemical engineering and the problem solving that's involved.",
    "I learned how to set up differential equations for engineering problems.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great caring professor\/TA, interesting content but zoom was inefficient",
    "I think that one of the strengths of the course was that collaboration was strongly encouraged for breakout rooms during class as well as Piazza for problem sets. Also, office hours to go over hard questions on the problem set was really helpful. I believe that both Professor Loewenberg and Rodrigo were very accessible and helpful.\r\nThis wasn't entirely a weakness, because it was pretty helpful, but I think that learning the majority of the material by ourselves through the pre-recorded lectures was a bit difficult. Overall, this may be just a fault with online learning as a whole but I found it hard to retain the new information and knowledge when I just had to watch a bunch of pre-recorded lectures in a row in preparation for our classes. I think that it could be helpful to spend part of our synchronous time together just reviewing the key information that we had learned from the videos before diving into examples. Also, one weakness of the course in my mind was that even though it is supposed to be an introductory course that even non-chemistry majors can take, I found it difficult at times to keep up with the at-times heavy math and notations. Especially in the last week, I was a bit confused with the partial derivatives because I had only taken AP calculus before this course so I was not familiar at all with multivariable calculus.",
    "Strengths: Prof Loewenberg was clear, patient, and accommodating of everyone, and a great lecturer. Rodrigo is an excellent TA. The dynamic between the Prof and the TA is really great and definitely a really enjoyable course overall. The flipped classroom format doesn't always work for some other courses, but in this course it worked well: lecture notes were posted beforehand so you could annotate them while watching the videos.",
    "Professor Loewenberg and the TA Rodrigo are prompt and very helpful. They make the course enjoyable.",
    "I felt like the course was taught well. Strengths would include the examples taught in lecture (helped a lot with understanding general topics), being able to apply concepts learned in different engineering problems through problem sets and the review of topics in office hours. While I had a really great experience in the class, I feel like the way group work was structured could be improved, given that the breakout rooms did not always provide the intended experience of being able to work with others in small groups on problems.",
    "The structure and overview of class content could be sharper and more organized, eg clear learning goals and example problems we should be able to solve",
    "The online version of this course could have benefitted from a half lecture half group work structure, since it was sometimes difficult if we did all practice problems or all lecture-type materials. One huge strength of this class were the lecture videos, which were incredibly clear and helpful, especially those that were from the classroom (which reinforced me wishing I could have taken this class in person, but I still loved it!)\r\n\r\nOne thing I'd recommend, which I didn't think of until I saw how effective it was in another online class, is forming study groups within the class which are also used as the default breakout rooms during class (which you can program beforehand in Zoom, as long as all students are logged into Zoom with their Yale accounts). This makes breakout rooms a lot less awkward, and encourages students to actually work together a lot more.",
    "I thought the lecture videos were helpful. I think it would have been helpful to go over confusing topics during one class (i.e. Monday) and then do practice problems on another (i.e. Tuesday).",
    "A strength is that the professor uploads videos before each class and I think that's very helpful.",
    "The flipped classroom model works well for the class environment, and the problem sets were extremely well designed. Exams were not hard, but problem sets arguably were, which is conducive to learning. If there were any weaknesses, it would be that Professor Loewenberg could have prepared for some classes better just because it felt impromptu at times."

   "comments": [
    "Yes for any STEM student since it introduces a new quantitative way of thinking",
    "Yes. I probably wouldn't recommend this to a humanities major because I found the math to be difficult at times even despite taking calculus. However, I think that it is a really interesting course so if I had a friend that I think would enjoy the course, I would recommend it to them.",
    "Yes: it taught me a range of skills necessary for any quantitative problem solver, not just for those majoring in Chem E.",
    "Depends, the course material is interesting, but it would've been better if it were extended over a longer period of time.",
    "Yes, the course helps if you want to pursue chemical engineering as a major",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Whether an engineering major, or not, the class was very helpful in learning to use mathematics to model many different scenarios. For engineering majors, the class provides a great foundation for problems in future classes.",
    "This course is not for non-stem people. For stem people who don't have to take it, ask someone who has taken the course for an honest review. You will not find one on this website.",
    "yes, given a full semester to take the course rather than a summer session",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone who's interested in mathematical applications to engineering. This course made mathematical modeling a lot less intimidating for me, which I really appreciated!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to student's interested in chemical engineering.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning about engineering. I think it serves as a good introduction.",
    "Yes, wholeheartedly. It might sound boring at first and challenging at last, but it is a really good survey introduction and reflective of the logic behind engineering princples."
