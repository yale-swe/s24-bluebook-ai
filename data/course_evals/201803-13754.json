    "I learned a lot about bureaucracy in Africa. The case studies were particularly enlighting.",
    "It was an opportunity to engage with content on a really incredible level of intellectual maturity that forces you to grow.",
    "The course gave insight into the institutions that govern the relation between the state and society. I also learned a lot from the incredibly high level of conversation in the discussion"

   "comments": [
    "It was a strong course, although I felt as though discussions always felt a little too formal. Sometimes I didnt feel comfortable speaking.",
    "The readings are fascinating and listening to professor Steinberg's articulations are profound. The final paper (20 pages) is quite weighty and there wasn't much support or guidance in terms of what exactly he was looking for. In some ways this was very freeing but, for those who did not have experience yet with a paper of this size and depth (focusing on bureaucratic institutions) it became slightly crippling. Class discussions aired more on the side of question-answer than discussion. I learnt a lot just from hearing professor Steinberg speak but it felt the students weren't brought out as much as would have been beneficial.",
    "Strengths: Very capable seminar leader in professor, and great readings. Weakness: Sometimes the bureaucratic focus felt poorly defined, and in other cases it feels like it pigeonholed discussion."

   "comments": [
    "I would, but maybe an older student. The class was graduate student heavy, which is hard sometimes.",
    "Yes. It is challenging and necessitates that you put in the prep work before each class otherwise you very quickly find yourself drowning, but professor Steinberg has a way of interacting with history and politics that is profound and almost poetic."
