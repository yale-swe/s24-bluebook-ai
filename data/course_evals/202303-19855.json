                "Homework length and difficulty were generally enough to be productive but still manageable. \r\nDiversity in projects and assignments was beneficial (between presentations, infographics, essays, videos, etc.)",
                "The upper-level Spanis curriculum I think could use some adjustments. This class was engaging but mostly felt like a slog toward the next unit project. Class participation was usually pretty lacking, and I think more could have been done to facilitate our speaking and listening skills. This class included a lot of writing and observing cultural phenomena in Spanish-speaking countries, which I enjoyed but at times the themes felt incoherent, and I would have preferred if the course worked thematically like an L5 course; with us spending the entire semester with a deep dive into an engaging fixture of Latin American life, rather than the fast-paced survey style of this course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Russell was a highlight, he always brought energy and passion to the class. He also facilitated discussions very well. The material was engaging for the most part, and people were willing to participate.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class could be stagnant at times if the material got repetitive. The writing was also a bit stiff sometimes.",
                "strengths: less focus on grammar/sentence structure and general focus on encouraging you to speak up/participate, content is most important which i appreciate\r\n\r\nweaknesses: feels rushed at times, not much time to truly engage with the movies or myths that are read",
                "Strengths: Very organized, very interesting, engaging projects and classwork, extremely helpful instructor, multiple media of teaching (visual art, movies, poetry, essays, etc), smaller class size facilitates greater collaboration and camaraderie. I especially enjoyed the cultural insights we gained about underrepresented and marginalized communities. \r\nWeaknesses (not many): Some of the daily assignments can sometimes feel tedious."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a great class if you want to improve your Spanish, and it creates a much more casual environment that emulates the real world. The grading isn't harsh either, so it really allows you to learn without focusing on the grade.",
                "yes - it is hard to learn a language, so getting to this point is super impressive and being able to participate in this class without hyperfixation on grammar/vocabulary made it much more enjoyable",
                "I would 100% recommend this course, as it is very engaging and will allow you to both develop your language skills and learn about the culture of the Spanish-speaking world."
