    "Greater fluency, grammar, and vocabulary",
    "I strengthened my ability to communicate in Spanish.",
    "I am better at comprehending, writing, and speaking in Spanish .",
    "My Spanish improved while both reviewing and learning more vocabulary and grammar.",
    "More so than Spanish 110 and 120, this class is an immersive experience that built my skill as a Spanish speaker, reader, writer, and listener. It develops conversational skills through group activities and offers exposure to the language through extensive readings and media-based assignments. I still wouldn't call myself fluent, but Spanish 130 helped me gain confidence in Spanish.",
    "I reviewed and improved my spanish grammar",
    "I developed a solid basis of Spanish and all of the verb tenses.",
    "A better understanding of the language and increased proficiency.",
    "I feel like my Spanish improved immensely during this course, both in speaking fluency and reading comprehension. I learned and retained new vocabulary and learned beyond the basic grammar of a language course."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Seymour was amazing. Clearly knows how to teach Spanish and made the class fun yet demanding.",
    "More practice with listening would be good. Other than that, it is a challenging and well designed course.",
    "This course was great and really challenged my abilities. At times it was a little tedious and required a lot of written work.",
    "The course ensures that you are practicing Spanish everyday, both verbal and written.",
    "This course's strengths are its level of immersion (I only heard my professor speak a sentence in English ONCE during the whole course and it was to thank a technician that repaired the TV in the classroom as he was leaving) and the focus on exposure to the language. Its main weakness, and I can't stress enough how big a weakness it is, is the extravagant expense of the textbook compared to how little it is used in the course. It costs upwards of $200 and maybe 15% of the assignments for the class actually utilize the textbook as a resource. It's really poorly planned in this sense, and more than a little bit exploitative.",
    "More time speaking would be great, though unless the class size were reduced, it is hard to see how that would be possible",
    "I liked the supersite homework. I felt as though the homework from the book and CC was not as useful. \r\n\r\nI also felt as though the grading of the redaccines were not the same across different L3 sections. Some teachers graded them a lot easier than others, as I had multiple friends with other teachers taking the same course.",
    "The textbook is VERY expensive and required to get the supersite code which is difficult to swing for some.",
    "Strengths: Professor Seymour was extremely encouraging and energetic, and she always started our very early class on a high note. The course was very organized, utilized Canvas well, and we had a lot of variety in class activities including discussions in which we were given roles, written assignments, and cultural literature and short clips."

    "Yes, with the right professor!",
    "Yes! Profesora Seymour is easily the best spanish teacher I have ever had in my life. She is fantastic at helping you learn while not making the concepts confusing. I 100% recommend Profesora Seymour if you're taking L3 spanish or any spanish.",
    "Yes, it is a great class to take to sharpen ones Spanish ability.",
    "Yes!",
    "Professor Seymour is a very good instructor. She is clear with her students and helps them improve in ways that are productive rather than embarrassing. The activities in class help your Spanish improve.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anybody looking to improve their Spanish skills. Of course, most people will take it to fulfill the language requirement for graduation, but it's honestly something that everybody--especially Americans--should learn. I didn't speak any language other than English before coming to Yale, and having a little bit of Spanish under my belt at this point makes me feel far more prepared for life after college.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone looking to learn more spanish.",
    "Absolutely! This course was a lot of work, but it was worth it to anyone wishing to improve their skills in Spanish."
