                "This is a very good course. I have no specific requests for improvement.",
                "The course has many strengths. The books we read cover important topics about recent developments in moral philosophy. I find the structure of the course - including the format of discussion and the response paper assignments - constructive to learning. Professor Darwall is a great seminar leader and really cares about what the students have to say (graduate and undergraduate students alike). His handouts are very helpful in framing the trajectories of discussions. I also think writing the three response papers is a great way to get feedbacks from him in a relatively low-stake setting (he gives comments but no grades on the response papers, which do count toward the final grade but at least you wouldn't get that nervous when he returns them).",
                "Darwall is a wonderful section leader, and its nice to have some of the class write a reading response each week. Sometimes we belabor certain discussions and then end up moving too quickly through others. But now Im nitpicking. Hes good at making very complex material accessible.",
                "The course was amazingly well taught. Professor Darwall is a a gem. The books he chooses can be written pretty dryly though, so just be aware."

Those who are not yet interested in moral philosophy but are willing to explore will most likely falling in love with moral philosophy after taking a class with him too. One should of course be prepared to engage deeply with the content and spend enough time on reading and writing for the course, but that time will most certainly turn out to be well-spent. I highly recommend Professor Darwall's seminars to those with some background in moral philosophy (e.g., DS, intro ethics) and are willing to put in the work.",
                "100%. Darwall is great, you shouldnt/wont stress about your grade, and the material is interesting IF youre already interested in moral philosophy. If you like ethics, TAKE THIS CLASS.",

The class is the perfect balance between work and fun, between doing normative work and working through what the thinkers we read thought, between being guided by Prof Darwall and talking about whatever we want to talk about"
