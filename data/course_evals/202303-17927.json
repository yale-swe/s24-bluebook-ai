            "comments": [
                "I really liked this course! Strengths: Professor Rutledge was great at explaining concepts, and was always receptive to unplanned questions. I thought the exams were fair, and for the most part, not designed to trick you. I also appreciated the workload - aside for studying for exams, weekly workload for the class was pretty low. Weaknesses: Because of the amount of content, we moved super fast in class, which sometimes made it difficult to follow along. I also wish he had highlighted anatomy more in the lectures, because there were lots of exam questions on that, and little time spent in class going over it.",
                "I feel like there was way too much content covered in such a short time span that we were expected to know. The lectures didnt always seem cohesive. I liked how the lectures were posted online with captions for studying but I felt frustrated by the fact that the only tip we got for the tests were to know everything that was said in lecture for 8 lectures that are over an hour each.",
                "strengths- quizzes every week did help with staying on top of the material.\r\n\r\nweaknesses- at times we were literally speeding through material in class and it would get moved over until the next lecture. It sometimes made studying a bit confusing. Also, the information on the slides were occasionally so dense it made little sense when looking back. Also, there wasn't much to help our grade. Closed quizzes and exams didn't prove to yield the class average expected",
                "Strengths of this course was the professor, how engaging the material was, and that there was no work besides studying for the exams. Also it was great that lectures were posted online. Weaknesses were that the exams are hard, there is so much material to learn (although it forces you to actually learn).",
                "The strengths was that Professor Rutledge clearly knew what he was doing and the content front to back, and is super knowledgeable about all the subjects he talks about. A huge weakness was that, for students coming in as a neuroscience beginner from Psychology, there is a sharp, sharp learning curve to understanding the beginning building blocks of technical neuroscience. At the beginning of the course, I had no idea what was going on and content was going by so quickly that, without rewatching lectures and going over certain parts several times, I wouldn't be able to understand a lot of the speedy slides going by  and even after doing so, Prof Rutledge's expectations of what we already knew and internalized a few classes in were quite high for a \"starter\" neuroscience course and natural science prerequisite to the psych major. Prof Rutledge seems like a really wonderful person and super knowledgeable professor, but he talks very quick and expects understanding rapidly so there's not any room, really, to fall behind, even during the lecture. Beginner psych majors, be careful!\r\n\r\nIt's a tough class, y'all. Be warned!",
                "The grade being entirely based on assessments made it quite difficult to display growth in learning - particularly for students who do not find their growth best displayed through examinations. A diversity in course assignments would have been helpful for the future.",
                "Prof. Rutledge is a pretty good lecturer, but often the slides would have a literal wall of text making it difficult to know what the important takeaway was. I also thought a weakness was the lack of non-quiz/exam grades. I think a variety of different ways of assessing students (e.g. reading responses, short essay) would be better.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures in the course and the material was super beneficial to my understanding of neuroscience studies and the field's current understanding of the brain.",
                "Wonderful, insightful lectures.  More review resources might be helpful and better responsiveness from TAs.",
                "no glaring strength or weaknesses",
                "Strength: Weekly quizzes are a good way to stay on top of content \r\nWeakness: There was no opportunity to improve grade other than exams or quizzes",
                "Strengths: the material is fascinating and presented in an incredibly organized way, no psets, only major work is really studying for the three exams \r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "It's a thorough course, but extremally memorization based. The class would benefit from some type of problem solving or more creative project.",
                "THe strengths are the very engaging lectures and the style of having a quiz every thursday forces you to review concepts so that when the exam comes it is not too overwhelming.\r\n\r\nthe weaknesses is that although curved, half the class gets a b plus or lower which in perspective isn't awesome if you are a mediocre test-taker",
                "Strengths - course was very well organized. TFs were amazing. Review sessions were very helpful. I liked having weekly quizzes and 3 non cumulative exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - feedback. We couldn't see what we got wrong on exams which made it difficult to ask for regrade requests.",
                "The strengths were the interesting topics and the weekly quizzes. The weaknesses were the exams. They covered the most minute detail and made this course incredibly frustrating as a student. Its hard to love the material of a class but be continuously disappointed after attending OH, review sessions and doing well in quizzes just because the exams were ridiculous.",
                "Strengths: I felt like we covered a lot of content in human neuroscience and liked the broad overview. I also liked that lectures and review sessions were recorded to let you go back and watch them in case you didn't understand them before the tests.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't like that the Thursday quizzes covered material from the lecture that same day given immediately before the quiz. I think it would have made more sense to have the quizzes the Tuesday after the Thursday lectures and only cover material from the last week. I also felt that the tests were more indicative of how well you could memorize the slides rather than how well you understood the material. Lastly, I felt like it didn't make sense why we couldn't look at our tests and only received a score - even if you booked an appointment to go over your test with a TA, you weren't allowed to look at the test at all. I wanted to know what parts of the material I didn't understand.",
                "The only weakness of this course is that there is limited practice material, so the workload between midterms is low but there aren't ways to properly revise beyond rewatching the lectures.",
                "All grading is assessment-based, it would have been nice if there were some assignments to help further our understanding by engaging with the content.",
                "Switch the textbook maybe with something a little more beginner friendly",
                "I wish there had been potentially more opportunities for graded work.",
                "A major weakness is the amount of content that gets crammed into each lecture. Some of the details we learn about certain processes appear way too specific for an intro course. It could be improved by making the course half a credit for 2 semesters instead (similar to the bio sequence structure) or by reducing the amount of content that is taught if it is kept as a 1 semester course. I felt like the only way to do well was to memorize and frankly I feel like I'll forget most of what I learned in the next few weeks because it was too much to keep track of. \r\n\r\nIt could also be improved by changing the grade breakdown and having it be more than just exams and in-class quizzes because this makes it hard for people who struggle with test-taking to excel in this class. \r\n\r\nA strength is the array of overall topics covered in the field of neuroscience.",
                "The only two strengths of the course are its accessibility and replay value. As the lectures were recorded and the slides had plenty of text on them, I was able to follow information long after the lectures had happened. The weakness of the course was the method with which our knowledge of the material was tested. Having weekly quizzes right after a lecture did not help me retain any information or properly reflect my knowledge of the material. I also felt that too much material was fit into one lecture, leading to the professor to ramble and for students to disengage.",
                "The new structure of 3 tests and the weekly quizzes that were all were all worth the same amount respectively made it more fair and allowed more opportunity to earn a grade you were happy with. The lectures being recorded was very helpful because I would need to rewatch all of them multiple times to study for the exams which tested your knowledge very closely. Weakness would be that sometimes Ruttledge would brush over a concept or topic for literally a single lecture slide and it would end up being on the exam, and you also don't get to see any feedback more than just the score on the exams which was quite frustrating looking back.",
                "There was a lot of interesting content but sometimes it was just said to us and not taught to us.",
                "Strengths: the class is recorded and the TAs are very supportive \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: you cannot review your quizzes as you study for exams because you dont have access to them and its sometimes hard to extract the most important themes from the class because so much is covered",
                "Strengths: really cool content and understanding of the brain's functions, recorded lectures being available the next day was really helpful for reviewing, reading the textbook is not necessary, exams were mostly very fair\r\nWeaknesses: lectures moved at a pace that was somehow both too slow in speech and too fast through content so no concepts were explained well, it felt more like the professor was just listing a bunch of terms we were expected to know; because the exams are so much of the grade, doing less well on one of them can really screw up your grade",
                "The weekly quizzes were effective in making me stay on top of the content. I also liked that we did not have a cumulative final; it would have been a monumental task having to memorize all the info for such a final. The exams for the class not only challenged my memorized knowledge but my understanding of the experiments we covered during lecture; this was effective. I also enjoyed the fact that I did not have homework; that way, I could focus on just learning the lecture content.",
                "The professor was amazing!! Very interesting content, but probably needed more explanation of brain areas",
                "Lot of material, study guides would have been great",
                "This class has a lot of information and the content is very interesting, but it's pretty dense to be taught in one semester. The lectures are compact and must be processed pretty quickly as topics build upon each other.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- The material is actually very interesting. Prof Rutledge used fun videos and cool examples to keep us engaged every lecture (not often enough to be wasting time but just enough to make everyone laugh and refocus)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The quizzes requried 2-3 hours to study for and often the questions were so specific that even that did not suffice. I think that weekly homeworks would perhaps increase engagement for those who cannot spend 2-3 hours on revision. However, having finished the course, I now understand why that is hard since the limited material can only yield so many questions and those need to be reserved for exams.",
                "Strengths: neuroscience is a very interesting subject. Weaknesses: 100% of our grade was quizzes & tests; only virtual office hours; no practice exams, so I was surprised by the pacing and style of the first exam; we couldn't review our past exams & exam regrade requests felt like they existed in name only, since we only had a 10 min Zoom session several weeks after the exam to hear our incorrect questions read aloud to us.",
                "I didn't like the only focus of the class revolving around exam scores. I was disappointed by the lack of options that helped facilitate student learning.",
                "Weaknesses: Grade distribution; your grade is highly dependent on exam scores.",
                "This course is so hard. I wouldn't say I got a good grade in this class even though I studied and worked really hard for it. I would like the course to be more rewarding in the grade sense if you work very hard, but if you ignore the difficulty of getting a good grade, the course is very well rounded and well taught. A weakness of this course is the fact that you do not get any exams back. The most you can do is schedule a 10 min meeting with a TF to talk about the exam but regrades aren't allowed and you do not get to see any of the questions. The TF will only tell you the kinds of topics you got wrong which isn't helpful since none of the 3 exams are cumulative and there isn't a final. It really puts you in the dark.",
                "There are many areas for improvement in the NSCI 160 course. In addition to it being a highly stressful course, there is no room for improvement or learning from mistakes. Once a quiz is taken, you can view them once before losing the ability to view it again. This makes it so that it is not possible to use quiz questions to study for exams. Additionally, after exams are taken, scores are released, however there is no possibility to view exams except in person during office hours. To improve, exams should be released, such that students will be able to improve on their mistakes from before. Additionally,  the weekly quizzes are highly stressful. I believe switching them to weekly problems sets and making them a larger percentage of the grade will provide more opportunity for collaboration and learning for other students.",
                "The lectures were very fast and sometimes it was hard to follow and stay engaged.",
                "The lectures go through material very quickly which can make them difficult to digest and understand. I'm not sure it could be improved on since there is simply a lot of material to go through. Homework might help make this course easier to understand.",
                "Strength: provided a base knowledge of the brain in a easy to follow format\r\n\r\nWeakness: fast pace with limited practice questions. Quizzes are locked after bejng taken so cant review wrong answers",
                "Strengths are that it goes in-depth into a lot of concepts. However, it is too fast paced. It was very hard to understand Prof. Rutledge at some points during lecture, and he taught concepts through experiments without going into the fundamentals first. I did not like how we had quizzes each week and then 3 midterms, with no portion of our grade going into PSETS. In the future, this course should have discussion sections weekly. They would help tremendously with student learning, as the TFs did a phenomenal job explaining concepts that were too difficult to understand in lecture.",
                "The Human Brain is fantastic in that most, if not all of the topics covered were extremely interesting to me as a prospective neuroscience major and are likely interesting to most others too. I wish there were more ways to practice and demonstrate knowledge such as PSETS instead of the weekly no-note quizzes. Lectures were good but difficult at the same time. Professor can talk extremely fast and covers complex topics oftentimes too quickly for one to understand the concept the first time. You also really don't have time to take notes in class if you want to try to fully understand the content.",
                "you learn a lot, actually maybe too much. it seemed like an information dump and you were supposed to make out the connections yourself which is fun if its being reinforced and repeated but it wasn't. Instead, it felt like a memory game rather than building a network of related information. Homework and section would be very helpful for this course, especially since it's a hard science masked under a psychology. The grading was very harsh"

                "Yes, I would definitley recommend it if you need it for a major or have an interest in the topic.

I would not, however, recommend this to someone who wants to take a science gut, or who is looking for a fun STEM class.",
                "Neuroscience students have to take this course for the major but if the class was optional I wouldnt recommend it unless they were credit/d/failing. I think you do learn somewhat from the lectures, but theres far too much work you have to do on your own to actually comprehend the material.",
                "obviously not if it isn't a major requirement. Yes, there were some lectures where I enjoyed the topic but that does not mean take the class lol. I cannot emphasize just how much material you are taking in, and how much of your time it can consume. There are probably other classes you can take if you're interested in the Human Brain, but not this one.",
                "Yes definitely. If you are at all interested in learning how your brain works and how it helps your body function and make decisions or actions or think I think you would love this course.",
                "yes if necessary for neuro major or on neuro track for mcdb/psyc/cog sci",
                "If you are a Psych major going into neuroscience cold, be prepared for a steep learning curve. Tentative yes  but it was very difficult, knowing little to start with.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course. Its not as nightmarish as some people have made it out to be, but I still didnt like it very much. Lectures are fine, not very engaging but not bad. The only grades are quizzes and exams, which might work for some people, but not for me. They claim that you only need to pay attention in lecture to do well on the quizzes and dont need to study additionally, but I definitely had to review lecture material to do well on the quizzes. I found the exams to be difficult but not unfair. TFs were great though. If youre deciding on cog sci breadth courses, I personally preferred CPSC 201.",
                "Yes! I think NSCI 160 is a great introduction to the neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science majors.",
                "Yes, most definitely.  Course material is the most interesting I've encountered at Yale.",
                "Yes. The content is interesting, there is just a lot of it.",
                "yes",
                "only if they need to take it",
                "Only if you need it as a major requirement",
                "Yes!! Excellent course and instructor.",
                "Yes!!! Amazing to take for the cog sci major and honestly a great breadth of topics. You get to really work a part of your brain you may not have here yet.  It is a little fun preparing the exams (which were fair). DO not take if you are bad test-taker since 75 percent of your grade is exams.",
                "Yes!",
                "Not unless its for their major as it is incredibly frustrating.",
                "Yes, especially for those who are interested in neuroscience and have not yet been for ally introduced to it",
                "Although this course is usually a prereq for a lot of other courses, I would wait to take it until after you've taken other science courses at Yale like the intro bio sequence. If you have to take it, try not to take it until your sophomore year or until you've developed good study habits for Yale STEM courses.",
                "Take this course! If it's a prereq, you'll take in anyways, but if not, take it because the material is genuinely interesting. You'll learn how the brain functions at a very deep level, and also be able to explain a large subset of human behaviour. While this course has a heavy workload, it genuinely adds value in learning neuroscience and perspective about ourselves in the context of how intelligence evolved. \r\n\r\nProfessor Rutledge is an amazing lecturer, and all his lectures are engaging and explained really well. He's also really amazing to interact with outside class, and has lots of advice for further neuroscience coursework. Course organization is in general great, and the Ed Discussion was super active and helpful. \r\n\r\nIf there's one reason to take this course, it's that we study not just a textbook, but actual research papers. Since this is a new field, you're pushed to the brink of what neuroscience has to offer in one semester, and you can broadly see areas where we simply don't know enough about the brain. A lot of the research was done by Professor Rutledge and other Yale professors, and this is definitely a challenging but rewarding experience.",
                "Yes, you will gain a familiarity with a range of neuroscience topics from the level of the synapse to social interactions. There is a lot of content and I struggled to learn and retain it all, and the exams were stressful, but it was worth taking. Be prepared for a lot of studying. You will have a much better time if you're proactive and create study materials for each lesson within a day or two after lecture, rather than cramming for the tests, which took me several all-nighters and was not fun. And sleep deprivation is bad for you (you'll learn all about that). The assigned textbook reading doesn't seem to be worth doing--very dense and time consuming, and nothing from the textbook will be on the exams if it wasn't also covered in class. Maybe ask ChatGPT to summarize it for you so you have some familiarity with the topics prior to lecture.",
                "Yes because the content is really cool",
                "Not really because it's really stress-inducing but if you're a neuroscience major then you don't really have a choice.",
                "I would not if they have no former background in the brain. The format of rapidly going through several neural aspects at a time with only having quizzes and exams to determine your competence is not suitable for people new to this material. Many students who are majoring in psychology, neuroscience, or cognitive science have no choice but to take this course to fulfill their prerequisites.",
                "Absolutely should take this class if you are interested in the brain. It was extremely difficult but so rewarding.",
                "If you want to learn about the brain and are willing to work hard and study a lot I would say yes but if not then don't take it.",
                "I would if you have some background in the subject matter. Taking this as a first year will be hard.",
                "Yes because the content was really cool BUT be warned that the lectures were not great, and I found it difficult to understand the more complicated content of the course, especially the details I was not already somewhat familiar with from other neuroscience courses. The TFs did a better job actually teaching/explaining content during the review sessions than the professor did during our lectures. Professor Rutledge is very kind, reasonable, and knowledgable, but I just didn't find his explanations or organization of the lectures to be effective",
                "This class would definitely be one of the difficult classes you take during the semester. It has some very interesting topics and is indeed a robust and broad intro to Neuroscience. I definitely recommend setting some time during the week to make study materials from the lectures: flashcards, practice problems. This class really challenged my attention to detail.",
                "Yes, I loved this course but it was really challenging",
                "Yes if you're interested and it helps your major",
                "You will learn quite a lot in this class, but the grading system stressed me out. The weekly quizzes were meant to be easy for those who came to class but I did not find this to be the case at all. Some of the quiz questions asked about minute details on a random slide in lecture, which is more exam-like content. Also it's pretty difficult to get in depth feedback about your exams because you're only allowed to schedule a 10-minute virtual slot to go over it, and they don't even share your exam with you, they just run through bullet points of things you got wrong. Some of the lectures were denser and harder to understand but felt rushed.",
                "Yes! It's a great surview of a lot of topic which later classes in the neuro and psych classes focus on so you can learn what interests you the most. Although it is a huge amount of memorisation, that is a given for any non-research biology class!",
                "No. If neuroscience seems like a topic you're curious about, look at other NSCI or PSYC options. I came into the class already having enjoyed studying neuroscience, and I still felt demotivated often throughout the semester. I think it'd be much harder to enjoy it when this is your first experience with the subject. If you're required to take it, I'd recommend taking in your sophomore fall or later, ideally after a different neuro course you enjoyed. Hum Brain covers many fundamentals, but it's not an introductory course that will inspire many to pursue neuroscience who haven't already chosen to do so.",
                "I would. It is a challenge of a class to do well in, but once you get into the groove of learning how to memorize the lecture material it is an incredibly rewarding experience. I find neuroscience fascinating which helped my performance, but there's a lot to learn about everyday life through this class that can interest any student, and trust, you will have it memorized by the end.",
                "Not unless it it a requirement.",
                "Yes, to learn alot but you have to expect to not get a good grade.",
                "Yes",
                "No. The course is highly demanding and stressful.",
                "If they are interested in neuroscience, then yes.",
                "This was a very interesting class that would recommend to almost anyone. The material taught in this course is invaluable.",
                "Its hard",
                "Yes, for a basic knowledge and a great professor",
                "I would, only because it's a pre-requisite to the neuroscience major.",
                "The Human Brain is an extremely challenging class. The amount of content and memorization necessary will likely be far greater most other courses. However, if you are truly interested in psychology and neuroscience and are up for a challenge, this class will definitely be an interesting and engaging experience. I would NOT recommend this course to FRESHMEN simply because of the amount of work required to do well in this class. I took this as a freshman and I was overwhelmed by the amount of work necessary and was definitely not used to this sort of class commitment. However, if you're as interested in neuroscience as I was and am, consider taking it, but just know that it's not gonna be easy.",
                "Well you have to if you want to major in neuroscience but hard no, if you're doing it for curiosity."
