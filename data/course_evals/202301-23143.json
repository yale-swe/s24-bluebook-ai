                "Learned about the basic principles of design and entrepreneurship, heard the stories of so many successful entrepreneurs, and got hands-on experience building a novel product from nothing. This was probably the most rewarding learning experience of my Yale career.",
                "1) what it means to be an entrepreneur\r\n2) what it feels like to engage in faculty members who genuinely care about your education\r\n3) how to build something\r\n4) what it takes to turn your ideas into reality",
                "I learned how to build a product and the trails and tribulations of startup life!",
                "learned about how products are designed and how decisions are made from the prototype to the polished product stage.",

Working in a small team on a prolonged project was also an incredibly fulfilling and insightful experience; I learned the place I want to take on a team and the type of cofounders I want."

                "Strength: really fun to work on projects with talented people. Weakness: didn't feel like I learned anything tangible",
                "I think this course would really benefit from a pre-requisite course that is taught in the CEID and gives students the skills and knowledge to use the CEID resources. I really liked going in-depth with the speakers and learning about their stories of how they made it, but that takes away time from learning how to fabricate, manufacture, and create a good product, and having a supplementary course could help cover that lack of prior knowledge that would be extremely useful to this course, and to other advanced fabrication courses taught in the CEID.",
                "I have shared my thoughts already in my feedback form for the course, but this was a fantastic class, and I wish I had taken more similar courses at Yale. The course begins quite slowly but picks up very subtly throughout the course of the semester. Overall, it is a great opportunity to engage with other passionate, creative students, and to spend time in a fast-paced and innovative environment. Every skillset is welcome, and if you're passionate about anything you will have the chance to use those skills and create something really cool.",
                "more time spent on building our final project. more hardware coaching",
                "Strengths: Joe and Haven worked SOO hard to make the course a success. CEID is obviously a strength. Guest speakers, project based nature. It's all great. I had a really nice time in the class.\r\nWeaknesses: To me, the clear weakness was the timeline of project selection. Because we had no classtime to brainstorm projects together, people all came up with last minute project ideas the night before it was due in class. So the ideas overall were not as good. I also think it would be better to have all physical projects, because the teams that did not have physical projects did not get to take advantage of the CEID as they could've with a physical project. What would be great would be a class period devoted to coming up with project ideas so we could collaborate and discuss on what becomes a super important decision.",
                "I think the guest lectures were not super helpful and sometimes a little boring. I think we would have also benefitted from starting our projects earlier in the semester to give us more time to develop a functioning prototype. I think Joe in general is a strength because he is a great resource for innovation/CEID related things.",
                "Classes and guest speakers are engaging. More time to work on the projects would be greatour team got very invested in it and would have liked to take it further.",
                "This course would be MUCH better if there were a technical sister course; so many students are lacking in hands-on skills that are essential for prototyping. This course should be CS50 with the various coding languages being replaced by learning to laser cut, 3D print, vinyl cut, metal work, wood work, solder, etc.\r\n\r\nThere should also be more time for either ideation or final-group work and a class on intellectual property. And a Tsai fellow to explain their resources in person. And an early emphasis on pitching (elevator pitches so the idea is easily communicated to friends, etc.)."

                "Yes yes yes! Joe is fantastic, the group of students he selects is fantastic, the speakers that come to talk to you give such unique perspectives, and the course was just a great culmination of Yale.",
                "Yes, this has been the most fulfilling class I've ever taken. I came in with relatively little project-based experiences, and learned so much throughout the semester. The work is definitely concentrated on the final project aspect of the class, with the first part of the semester involving much less intense work. However, depending on your specific project, this class will be extremely time consuming during the final few weeks.",
                "If you love making things (in any sense of the phrase), then yes. Definitely one of the highlights of my Yale experience.",
                "yes! great opportunity to dabble into building physical projects, and learning from a diverse cohort of peers",
                "Yes. Be prepared for a lot of outside of class work! Specifically, a lot of outside meeting times with Joe and your team. But it's a great experience if you like your team and project.",
                "I would recommend it but know that the projects are a lot of work and it really depends what team you are on because that can affect your excitement/engagement with the course.",
                "Yes! A fun class that really lets you to exercise both design and engineering skills.",
                "Yes! Working on a project in a team is extremely fun and rewarding. You also learn a lot in the process.",
