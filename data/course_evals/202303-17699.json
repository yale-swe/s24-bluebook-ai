I was able to gain significant insight about the nature of classical storytelling across generations and varying cultures. I feel that I have left this course with a significantly deeper understanding about the structures and components of stories, which I hope to continue to incorporate for as long as I continue to write.",

                "This course's main strength is the structure of the classes that allows for significant discussion to take place. I personally thought having consistent feedback about my ideas from the professor and other students was very helpful in developing my own thoughts. I also believe that the course helps facilitate learning through experience. Because students must observe the nature of stories themselves, through their own commitment to watching movies and evaluating stories, the content material from the professor is very easy to apply."

It helped me gain a more profound appreciation for stories, and helped me explore interesting Western screenwriting from before the 2000s, which I admittedly had limited exposure to. This course could be taken by any student in any major and be a positive experience for that student, through and through.",

It was definitely an interesting and fun gut where I got to explore something outside of my major that I was still interested in to fufill a humanities requirement. I know this course is popular to take as a FYS, so I would only take it if you have an interest in the material and not just for the gutiness because that takes away from other students who really want to take this course."
