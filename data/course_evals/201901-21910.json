    "I learned a lot of new Chinese vocabulary and grammar. I learned how to write a lot of characters. The specific lessons we covered were about weather, giving directions, attending parties, dating, travel, dining, and getting sick. The vocabulary we learned was extremely useful; I look forward to using it in China someday.",
    "I learned how to speak, write, and understand Mandarin Chinese in a variety of situations, including dining in a restaurant, dating and what to say, and going through an airport. I also learned a lot about Chinese culture, such as the meaning of radicals in characters, some of the most famous historical sites in China, and cuisine like eating bao zi."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is well structured for constant exposure to Chinese. However, sometimes it felt that instead of actually working to learn the material, important topics were sped through in class. The individual tutorial experience for the class is very helpful for helping to improve understanding and comprehension of the language.",
    "Daily homeworks and daily quizzes make the class really tough - but that's probably how it works.",
    "The course is very fast paced and you get to learn a lot throughout the semester.",
    "Strengths: students learned a lot of material. \r\nWeaknesses: There was a focus on memorization over comprehension.",
    "The course is intense, and the way it's set up makes it so that students cannot fall behind. I do wish writing characters was a bigger focus for the course. I like the textbook the course uses; it's somewhat funny and always good at teaching. The professors are smart and welcoming and offer a lot of feedback. This section of the course was a little bigger than normal, which meant that individual speaking and participation was at a minimum. That was unfortunate.",
    "The Chinese program at Yale is one of the best in the world. The undergraduate teaching is unparalleled - the teachers are incredibly engaging, funny, and just incredible at what they do. They know how to explain grammar points AND be amazing, kind people. Chinese 120 is just another course in the gem of the Chinese department.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I wish that the course could improve are the oral tests, which are often very unpredictable. I wish we could do more preparation for them in class. Other than that, the written exams, homeworks, and presentations are all very fair, and the teaching standard is very high."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely. The CHNS 110 - 120 sequence is absolutely amazing and will change your life.",
    "Yes, Chinese is a very challenging language yet very rewarding.",
    "I only recommend this course to students intently interested in learning Chinese. This is not a class that student can take casually and be expected to do well in.",
    "I would definitely recommend other students to take this course.",
    "Yes, because you can improve Chinese significantly in a very fun way.",
    "Yes! It is an immersive way to learn Chinese.",
    "Yes, for sure! If you're committed to and interested in the course, you will learn SO MUCH. There's homework every night, and it can start to become annoying after a while, especially if you take the course at 9:25 a.m. every day like I did. But you soon realize that the homework is usually not busy work; the translation exercises really help you learn how to speak Chinese. Know that the focus of the course is not writing characters, but being able to form sentences while speaking. Also, all of the CHNS 120 professors are funny, superb, good at teaching, and have a lot of personality. You just won't regret taking this course. Just keep up. It's fast-paced and intensive.",
    "I highly, highly recommend this class to any student at Yale. Yale Chinese is a GEM, and if you took CHNS 110, CHNS 120 is just as good."
