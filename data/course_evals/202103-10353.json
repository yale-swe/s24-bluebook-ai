                "In this course, I believe the greatest takeaway was that I learned how to critically evaluate the political role of the English language as a tool of imperialism, analyzing \"Anglophone\" post-colonial texts with an eye to both their unique stylistic use of the language and their engagement with its history.",
                "This course was great for providing historical and theoretical context for literary texts. I learnt how to understand a text as a product of and response to its time, and to incorporate theory into literary analysis.",
                "I developed skills required to write critical essays with complex theses and to formulate an argument. I also learned extremely in-depth about different types of post-colonial literature, the politics and ethics of reading/audienceship, how to read for literary agency, and important themes such as the necessity of imagination/fiction as historical texts within the context of colonialism/imperialism.",
                "I became much more aware of the plethora of English-language books beyond England and America. I got much better at reading analytically, and better at communicating that analysis, verbally and in writing.",
                "I became much more skillful and adept at incorporating theory and outside research to formulate arguments and generate insights about the texts we read. I also became better at recognizing points in my own writing which could be strengthened.",
                "I learnt to read literature deeply and critically and to read theory and think of texts within those theoretical frameworks (but also to challenge those theories and push my understanding of them). Steph and her selection of texts really awakened a new and deeply felt interest in postcolonial literature, and she encouraged us to engage with and discuss these texts through many different lenses."

                "Great course! No glaring weaknesses, although I would have loved a touch of historical context for more of the texts  even just 5 minutes at the beginning of class would be great for grounding us in material.",
                "Strengths:\r\nSteph is probably the nicest professor I've ever had. She also gives very helpful suggestions before writing an essay and clear feedback for how to improve after the fact. The syllabus is also great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes the class felt a little abstract. I wish it had been slightly more grounded in the text and less in theory.",
                "I think the syllabus of this course was fantastic, as was the seminar style  having two seminars on most of the texts was valuable and fostered very rich conversations. In terms of changes for the future, I will say that I really appreciated it when we had an outside session with an arts history scholar due to the necessary background that it gave us for that week's text; having a few more of these contextual grounding lectures/Q+A sessions even outside of class would be great.",
                "This course was incredible. The main strength was Stephanie, a brilliant instructor with a deep knowledge of her texts' historical context and place within a literary tradition and one of the best seminar leaders I've ever had. She got the class comfortable and engaged from the first lesson, and the structure of the class is pretty flawless. I wouldn't change a thing.",
                "This is the best English seminar I have ever taken --- there are practically no weaknesses except for the fact that it was too short! I wish we could have spent more time with all of the texts; however, Steph does a wonderful job facilitating riveting and engaging discussions.",
                "I loved professor Newells ability to lead a classroom discussion. It was an excellent seminar full of great ideas and discourse.",
                "The biggest strength of this class was the feeling of community that Steph fostered in the classroom. I felt totally comfortable all the time, which I think can be really important in a literature class with many sensitive topics, like this one, and I made a lot of friends. The conversation was always engaging, and the material was enjoyable and challenging. \r\n\r\nThere were a couple things that frustrated me about this class. For one, I felt the constant discussion was a double-edged sword. There was so much participation that, if I had a thought I wanted to contribute, I'd have to compete with four or five other students. Steph often made a queue, but by the time my turn came along the conversation had shifted. I think the major problem of this system was that the conversation could feel disjointed, especially at the beginning of the semester, with each person making an individual point rather than responding to each other. By the end of this semester this was a lot better, but I still found it a challenge.",
                "ENGL 128 is strong for its large array of diverse texts. If you've taken a class focused on a specific region of literature taking ENGL 128 opens the door to a variety of new authors, texts, and depictions of colonial violence and oppression. The class is also strong with addressing questions head on; most of the texts are those which have been written in English or have been translated into English and our class discussions focused on what is lost in translation and on the impact of imposed languages.",
                "Strengths: I loved having the canvas discussion thread before class/during the week  the questions posted + other people's ideas definitely helped me to collect my thoughts before our discussions in class, I also really liked having presentations before papers because it was useful for thinking about how I might frame an argument for my paper. Of course I also loved the selection of texts, Steph's insights and how she guided the discussions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think it can be a bit hard to keep up with all the reading, but I do think Steph was very kind in ensuring we don't feel too stressed about completing every single book. I wonder if there would be a way to further condense presentations somehow or have them be in video form maybe so that longer texts like Banjo and The God of Small Things could have two week. That being said, I would definitely hope that at least one or two presentation weeks stay in the course."

                "Yes! Steph is great, and its a cool survey of world literature.",
                "Yes! Take it for Steph. She is wonderful. Meet with her before and after essays. She gives really good feedback that I think English classes sometimes lack. She is also very flexible with regard to the syllabus. We requested she make changes, and she always listened to what we had to say. She really respects her students which is a breath of fresh air.",
                "Yes, definitely. This class completely changed the way that I think about the English language, even challenging preconceptions that I had about the study of literature overall. The seminar discussions were always completely engaging, and I think part of this was because the texts chosen for the course are truly incredible. I think that every  student in the class would always come in excited to talk about what we had just read, there really was never a dull moment.",
                "YES!! Take anything with Stephanie Newell, she is one of the best instructors at Yale and one of the few who focuses on non-western texts and histories. She is an amazing seminar leader and curates a classroom environment that's both inclusive and challenging. Despite the limited amount of time in which to engage all of 'world literature', Prof Newell gave us tools to think about post-colonial writing, what it means for post-colonial writers to have to engage via English, and the various feminist/ecocritical theoretical frameworks you can read a text through. This course changed the way I think about post-colonial literatures and gave me the confidence to use theoretical frameworks in literary analyses",
                "Absolutely! Please, please, please take this course. The reading material was so carefully curated and a necessary supplement to a lot of the American-centric literature/courses out there.",
                "Yes! Its one of the only classes in the English department with diverse reading texts, and for that I am so grateful.",
                "I would recommend this course to non English majors and English majors alike. For English majors this is part of the introductory sequence and although you only need to complete 3/4 introductory courses I would recommend taking this course for the framework it provides in theory and exposure to texts outside of the Western canon. For non english majors this class helped improve my writing and the texts were all engaging!",
                "Definitely! It really shaped my writing and analytical thinking and I think the way Steph framed our discussions also made us think about our positions as readers, as well as theory and criticism about these texts. Most importantly, I found that postcolonial literature is something I want to pursue further, particularly with encouragement from Steph to think about environmental/animal criticism, and gender and physical/public health lenses."
