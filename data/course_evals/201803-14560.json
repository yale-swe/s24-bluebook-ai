    "presenting, talking in class discussions, blog posts",
    "I learned thoroughly about each of the four conflicts in which we studied to the point where I feel comfortable talking about the conflicts, their causes, and the biggest events within each in a more formal setting. In a more broad sense, I learned a lot about the realities of human rights work and the difficulties presented in trying to bring perpetrators to justice.",
    "Over the semester, you'll study four conflicts in close detail. In the fall of 2018, we covered Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, and Rwanda. You will leave the course with a fluency in each.",
    "This course was focused on four conflicts of the nineties: Bosnia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Kosovo. Beyond helping students gain an in depth understanding of all four of these conflicts, the class delved into the nature of the UN, humanitarian interventions, and violent conflict as it occurs today.",
    "We delved into four conflicts: Bosnia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Kosovo. We focused on the causes, human rights abuses and aftermath of each conflict. We thought about the successes and failures of humanitarian intervention and also discussed the concept of just and unjust wars.",
    "By taking this course, I learned how to think critically about past atrocities (the Bosnian and Rwandan genocides, for example) and understand why they started, what factors enabled these atrocities to occur, and why they weren't prevented. This course gave me insight into how peace negotiations and processes occur, and factors that either prevent them from being or allow them to be effective. I learned crucial information about four major world events (genocides and conflicts) that I believe is extremely important to know, whether one is interested in pursuing global affairs academically or not.",
    "I learned the history and lasting effects of four human rights conflicts. I also learned how humanitarian interventions can fail or succeed depending on a confluence of factors. We finally learned how to effectively give a presentation and write journalistic or research reports.",
    "This class covers the conflicts in Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, and Kosovo, including the background to each conflict, what happened, and what were the resolutions if there were any. The readings were very interesting, and the class discussions about them were interesting as well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor di Giovanni is superb. She provides such a wealth of otherwise inaccessible information through her experiences and the guest lecturers she brings, all of whom taught me a great deal about their specific area of expertise. \r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps more in-depth discussion and more readily available feedback and ideas about your academic standing within the class.",
    "A slot of weekly office hours would be helpful.",
    "I consider myself very, very lucky to have taken your course. Every conflict (but especially Sierra Leone and Rwanda) was fascinating, and Professor di Giovanni's on the ground knowledge made every seminar a masterclass in war zone reporting. I do wish we had a few more vocal people in class to make discussions more dynamic  but that's a not in any way a weakness of the curriculum.",
    "I enjoyed the use of multimedia and a wide variety of sources throughout the course. Watching documentary films and short clips during class after doing more in-depth technical reading about the conflicts brought each topic back into perspective. Professor di Giovannis personal stories also aided me in understanding the conflicts not just as historical events, but human tragedies. I walked ino every seminar looking forward to the session ahead, and out feeling like I had learned something valuable. \r\n\r\nOne change that might facilitate student learning would be laying out the expectations for the final project\/presentation more clearly. There was some confusion about how closely the content for each should overlap. Perhaps providing an example of a past student project in greater detail would help with this. In addition, some readings were not available online in advance, but not enough notice was given to order the materials in print.",
    "I enjoyed the readings and class discussions. They allowed me to reflect on the events leading to the conflicts, the effectiveness of international intervention, and the aftermath of these conflicts. Learning about Janine's personal experiences was enlightening; she gave us a very unique perspective on the conflicts. Listening to and interacting with the guest speakers was amazing. I never thought that I would ever discuss these issues with Andrew Gilmour, the Assistant Secretary General of UN Human Rights. \r\nI wish that we had discussed the readings more in-depth though, and that each class had a very specific focus point. This would have helped me reflect on each aspect of the conflict better. Additionally, it would have been great if each student was given feedback on their performance and participation throughout the semester.",
    "N\/A",
    "A strength of this course was the professor, professor di Giovanni had a great amount of experience and expertise on the subject and was willing to share this with students. However, I felt the class at times struggled to find its focus, at times veering down tangents or not quite delving past the surface level of discussion. Towards the end this was less of an issue as I feel we began to build up a baseline knowledge of humanitarian intervention, just war theory and human rights, but it may have perhaps been better to front load these more theoretical subjects so there might be some common ground before we delved into each of the case studies."

    "great class, lots of discussion",
    "Yes! Prof. di Giovanni is amazing.",
    "Yes. 100%. Yale is exceedingly lucky to have Professor di Giovanni on campus. Take the class if you can get in.",
    "I would strongly encourage a student interested in journalism, human rights, or conflicts such as the ones we studied to take this course. I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and feel that I benefited greatly from taking it.",
    "If another student is lucky enough to be able to take this course, I would say without a doubt, take it! It was the best course I've ever taken.",
    "Yes--Professor di Giovanni is extremely warm and will try to understand your goals both in and outside the classroom. Her insights from her 25 years of experience as a human rights journalist shine through in the classroom."
