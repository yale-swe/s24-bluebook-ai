Proofs of some results given, and derivations for forms of e.g. bias and estimators presented and expected that we would know them, though these proofs are not the body of the class.\r\n\r\n More specifically, we covered basic results in asymptotics (e.g. continuous mapping theorem and delta method), learned about best linear predictor, conditional expectation functions, used those to introduce OLS and then covered various OLS properties including estimation and testing. Learned a little bit about LASSO, learned about Diff-in-Diff regressions, then covered endogeneity with omitted variable bias, measurement error, simultaneity, how to address this with IVs and Panel Data, and then also some binary choice (e.g. probit and logit) models.",

                "The second half of the course spent too long viewing small modifications of the same material. It would have been more helpful to see the bigger picture more, opposed to the same nitty gritty details again and again. I also think that including homework that analyzed how to interpret economic studies would have been very helpful, especially given that the exams focused on that aspect.",
                "Maybe a little too focused on the nitty-gritty and not the practical applications.",
                "The strengths are Professor Kitamura - very organized, very funny, and very knowledgable.",
                "Strengths: A really clear presentation of many of the key ideas in econometrics. I think I do now have a sufficient understanding of these to be able to read papers using these techniques and understand what they are doing and how they arrive at their results. Went slowly enough to really solidly understand each technique we used and practiced each of them. Gave presentations of the formulas for estimators and other stuff which was super helpful for building intuition and building confidence with the basic mathematical moves. Lots of practice coding on the PSETS which is good given how central this skillset now is for economics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Went too slowly. The presentation of material was so good that it felt like a wasted opportunity to not have more stuff covered. Also felt like we really repeated the same set of basic moves many times, and so this would have allowed some faster presentation if we didn't go over that full detail each time. Also feel like the course could just generally have been more intense. The HWs got too easy at the end of the semester, and again it felt like the course could have been even better and more educational with just another step up in difficulty (though my math background may be relatively stronger than most in the class).\r\n\r\nOverall this was a truly excellent course, but paradoxically was also super disappointing: With slight changes (e.g. faster pacing and more problem solving on HWs) this could have been a near perfect course since the professor and TFs were so good, so it feels like a missed opportunity.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kitamura's teaching is stellar, weekly p-sets helped me stay on top of the material (compared with the less frequent p-sets in ECON 135), lectures had a perfect balance of theory and applications. Weaknesses: while the lectures covered some proofs, formal definitions, and relatively challenging material, the course was overall way too easy and not math-heavy enough. Especially given how strong Kitamura is as a lecturer, I feel like I could've gotten a bit more out of this course if it had been more challenging and I'd been forced to engage with the material a bit more.",
                "Strengths: Yuichi is really sweet, and he generally is a clear lecturer (even if a little scattered sometimes). The exams are really fair, and the psets are manageable and teach you some Stata\/R.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Section is pointless.",
                "Strength: the Professor truly does try to make the content as interesting as possible and adds unique anecdotes, the TAs were helpful in doing the psets and there were many office hours\r\nWeaknesses: class wasnt recorded nor were noted uploaded so if you missed a class for any reason you fell behind",
                "The contents are very useful and well-explained by Prof. Kitamura. Everything is organized and everyone can follow well. The Psets contain helpful exercises in applying the methods (and the guidelines are clear)",
                "PSETS and Exams felt much less in depth than lecture. I would have enjoyed being able to practice on problems that were a touch harder, allowing me to better retain information from lecture.",
                "The material is taught very clearly by the professor.",
                "Professor Yuichi is very kind and the material is presented very clearly. A tough part is that the exams are all fairly doable if you've been to class and studied, which unfortunately can mean that little mistakes can cost you a ton grade-wise. Personally, I would have liked if the exams were a bit more challenging, allowing for grade differential to be more based on intellect rather than attention to detail, etc.",
                "strengths: nice professor, weakness: boring content",
                "Strengths: it doesn't require too much knowledge of economics before going into it! It's very student-friendly and you just need to know basic statistical concepts in probability theory. I particularly enjoyed Prof. Kitamura's lectures; he's a very engaging lecturer and I love the stories he tells. It's also a very organized course, and the TFs do a great job.\r\nWeaknesses: at times, it can feel hard to understand what the point of what you're learning is, or to get muddled into the statistical calculations. For the most part, it's great though! One of my favorite classes in the Econ-Math major.",
                "I think it could be improved by a slightly more stable pace - the first bit of class felt a bit fast paced but then it slowed considerably, too much so in my view. I would have liked to see a more stable pace and faster in the middle\/end while a tad slower in the beginning.",
                "There is little to no structure in the course and Professor Kitamura doesn't really explain concepts so much as show their mathematical derivations. At times the material could be really confusing. The material was extremely interesting, however, and Professor Kitamura clearly cares a lot about econometrics. It was my favorite course of the semester.",
                "There are no strengths of the class. Sure, it covers important econometrics concepts, but there are better (and more foundational) ways to learn these topics.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it seems like we could cover more interesting topics if the lectures weren't so convoluted and unclear. I never understood the big picture of what we are discussing, and the punchline of every concept that we discuss is hidden below lines and lines of useless material. This course needs to be streamlined and more organized. Lectures can NOT just be a stream of consciousness from the professor. As I take notes duringclass, it feels so disorganized and sporadic.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the exams need to better capture a student's understanding of the material. Especially considering that this course is curved, it is outrageous for a single True\/False question to count for 5% of you *total grade*. There needs to be more questions so that each question is worth less and so that the curve can accurately stratify students based on their actual understanding--not luck or trivia-like questions.",
                "Strengths: I've taken many math and stats classes, but this class was the first one where I feel I now have an understanding of how to do data analysis in the real world and how to deal with the real data challenges that I will face. Other stats classes will teach me how to run regressions and why certain coefficients are the way that they are. This class teaches about connecting the theory with other aspects of analytics like measurement error, omitted variables, collinearity, etc. The topics covered are all very interesting. The Psets and exams are both fair. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes we went too far into the math where we would spend 30 minutes just showing that an estimator was consistent. That is something that we could take for granted in classes, have a proof referred to from the book, and spend that time seeing how it is used or reiterating how that one concept connects to other topics covered in the syllabus. Wish we got more feedback.\r\nImprovements: We sometimes covered an example of how the topic that we were learning was used in a certain research study. However, this was brief and infrequent. I wish we did more of these.",
                "Strengths: professor Kitamura does a great job explaining how the econometrics works and why it matters. I really feel like I understand what's going on without needing to go into too much detail on proofs. Weaknesses: sometimes felt repetitive--we did the same decomposition of covariance showing endogeneity many, many times. I feel like we could have covered another topic and moved through some other material more quickly.",
                "I like how we learn things pretty rigorously in class but explore its application in psets. I wish that there was more of a connection between lecture and section, and that the exams are harder (though it seems like the curve is pretty good)."

                "yes, to understand econometrics. But make sure you take econ 135 or the equivalent, or else be ready for the first few weeks to be rough",
                "Maybe, if they're interested in regression of market data or econometric questions.",
                "Given that the course is required for most who take it, yes. If not, careful with the overlap - especially for a lot of the first half of the course, the material probably has shown up in some other stats course you have taken, with some exceptions and adjustments.",
                "Yeah absolutely. A course which covers, in a reasonable pace, many of the key ideas you see referenced in econometrics. It both provides a high-level intuition for these topics as well as getting into enough of the gritty details to give you a reasonable enough understanding and also to give you some confidence in actually reasoning about the material for yourself. The HWs aren't very hard, closely follow techniques covered in class while also giving exposure to coding methods, and the exams are reasonable. Note, though, that the HWs being easy enough and the exams not being too difficult either means that the curve could potentially get pretty rough...we'll have to see. (more details in other answers)",
                "Yes -- if you're at all interested in econometrics, Kitamura is the professor to study it with. This course is incredibly well-taught. Lectures were clear and enjoyable. That being said, the p-sets and exams were not very challenging, which made the grading stressful, and it seems likely that there will be a substantial downward curve. The p-sets (especially the problems from the textbook) sometimes felt a bit like busy work.",
                "Yes. The class is a good introduction to statistical estimation and inference in economics, with a big focus on model identification and dealing with endogeneity. Its pretty low workload, and the class material builds clearly throughout the semester.",
                "Yes to anyone who has a background in basic econometrics (135 \/ S&DS 241 & 242). The class materials are definitely not hard to understand, and things are more mathematical and theoretical (which could be a good thing since only conclusions will be tested)",
                "Yes! It's a great way to start understanding the mechanics of applied economics research.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in empirical work.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is very excited to learn (and perhaps willing to suffer a bad grade to do so). I think I have learned more in this course than I have most others at Yale and really enjoyed doing so; however, I am guessing that this will also be the worst grade I've ever received at Yale. So, I would recommend it to someone willing to accept that tradeoff.",
                "Only if you need it",
                "Yes! It's interesting, and a lot more clearly taught than I had expected. It also teaches you how to use R and Stata more, and it's interesting to see the application of lecture concepts in empirical studies that you'll get handouts about.",
                "Yes. I enjoyed the class and would recommend it over taking a less rigorous sequence (117\/123). It was enjoyable, and not too high workload.",
                "I think this is a very holistic econometrics course that I definitely recommend. You get a lot of the mathematical  intuition as well some opportunities to work with data. Yuichi is wonderful and obviously cares a lot about the topic. He and the TFs are always willing to answer questions and explain topics in depth.",
                "If you are ready for a challenge and are okay with a low-structure course, then take it! The material was really fun and Professor Kitamura is always telling anecdotes about his experiences in econometrics. Nevertheless, it didn't feel like there was much structure to the course until I looked at my notes afterwards. Professor Kitamura doesn't really explain what topics we'll be learning at the start of class or why we should learn themhe just goes right in to the math.",
                "NO! RUN AWAY. THIS CLASS IS COMPLETE TRASH.\r\n\r\nAs someone who knew all of the material before the course, it was extremely apparent how BAD Yuichi is at teaching new content. Simple concepts like difference-in-differences and instrumental variables to measure causal effects were made so convoluted and unintuitive. Even simple linear models were made to look like the most complicated (and scary-looking) equations with little explanation or insight (please take S&DS 312 for your own enlightenment). These were concepts that I already knew--and even I was getting confused by listening to Yuichi try to explain them. It seems like he shows up to class and then just rambles through his stream of consciousness. By writing down and saying whatever comes to mind, the content is not presented clearly nor in a logical way. Rather, the explanations are extremely verbose and it takes so much effort to distill it down to the actually important parts.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets seem like busywork and exams are random trivia questions that do not accurately test your understanding of the course material. You are probably better off taking the 117+123 econometrics track and statistics classes. This course in its current state does not properly teach you the foundations needed for econometrics. It will be infuriating and confusing. You will miss the intricate beauty that econometrics should be.",
                "Overall, I would recommend this class. The material is very important and very helpful to know. As the fourth class in the metrics sequence, the students taking the class are all very smart, so the curve gets tight near the top unfortunately.",
                "If you really want to understand econometrics or do actual economics work (or read papers), take this course!",
                "Yes! Heard 117 is bad so if you know a bit of linear and are decently confident in math this class should be pretty easy. I am an Econ stats double major and was taking this class concurrently with 242, which turned out to be the right move since the class didnt really require any stat background (Yuichi will teach you everything) and that some concepts overlap (delta method, continuous mapping theorem, probit\/logit mle, Zhous pset touched on standard OLS and robust OLS)."
