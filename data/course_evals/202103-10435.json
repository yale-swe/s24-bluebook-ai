Super important skills to be able to critically evaluate research, and the above-and-beyond training that will set up people to take this class to not just \"follow along\" with stats but to critique and have a high enough level of understanding of stats to poke holes in others' research",

As my first Quantitative Reasoning credit at Yale, I am coming away from the course confident in my ability to continue in statistics and in using statistical packages.",
                "This course was my first introduction to any type of stats class so my starting point was zero. This class covers so much ground.

            "comments": [
                "Strength would definitely be JT. He's an awesome guy and really keeps everybody engaged and tries his best to make class interesting. Weakness is the way problem sets are formatted. They're quite long and dull and often the directions are vague. The TA's also are quite hit or miss.",
                "Strengths: JT is a super cool guy\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures are quite boring, while that is the nature of the material sometimes but they could be more engaging.\r\nThis class is HARD. No peer tutors. No full examples of problems in lecture or in slides. No study guides or structured review sessions.",
                "The class moves quite fast and I feel like I was often teaching myself material that had been breezed over during lecture. My TA would sometimes tell me information that would prove to be incorrect on the problem sets, which was frustrating for me. Lectures were a bit dry, but I understand that that comes with the material and that JT does his best to make it engaging.",
                "I found the slides very hard to follow. It was often unclear to me what the main points were after a lecture because we spent so much time on details that the important ideas were lost. I thought that the slides were not organized in a clear way that made sense and facilitated learning, and the sequencing and layout made it hard to follow where the important information was. The presentations themselves were also often titled seemingly arbitrarily, and when studying for exams, I found it difficult to figure out where certain ideas were mentioned. Because of these things, I felt like I spent an unnecessarily long amount of time working on the problem sets and studying for exams because I was scrolling through hundreds of slides trying to figure out the main point. I feel that this should not happen in a class where small details can make or break your grade.",
                "The structure of the course was very well organized",
                "This course is so dry. JT tries his best to make the content interesting, but it is just not. The TA's are sometimes confused about the right way to approach certain problems, which was sometimes pretty frustrating since the Pset grading for this class is by far and away the most nitpicky I have ever encountered. The math concepts themselves are not very hard to comprehend, but the emphasis on having the exact right wording/assumptions for each test is incredibly discouraging as time goes on.",
                "There are no strengths about this course that make it stand out. What does stand out is the fact that sometimes we could only do half or less than half of the pset before the weekend, then after lecture on Monday we were expected to use the material we just learned to finish the other half of the pset in one and a half days before it was due. This is unrealistic as is but even more so considering that JT does not respond to emails, including ones asking for extensions. There was also an extreme lack of office hours, and the far and few office hours were ineffectively run. Many TFs and JT had 10-minute office hour slots instead of one big group. This means that students are limited by time in the questions they ask when they could have benefitted from hearing a student have the same question as them if the office hours were held in a big group.",
                "The lectures were well organized, although sometimes it felt as if students were being called on a lot to explain the concepts and as a result the explanation was not necessarily as clear as if JT would have explained it. The Stata tutorials were very helpful and discussion section was somewhat useful, although sometimes it felt like not very much was covered and the focus was not on the most difficult concepts.",
                "The strengths are obviously the professor: he is knowledgeable, caring, funny, and super engaging. He is probably the most entertaining professor I have had. The biggest weakness of this course are the TAs. With the only exception of Jasper Vaughn, the all of the TAs are absolutely horrible. Not only are they not engaging, but worst of all they are incompetent and do not even know the subject material very well.",
                "Strengths: Professor is sweet and understanding just not much wiggle room on late Psets\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many tutoring hours available and no peer tutor",
                "Strengths: very well taught and nicely paced (I never felt that we were going too slowly or too quickly); the PSETs were long but helped review the concepts; our TA Sections were super helpful as were the STATA tutorials that were uploaded online.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the PSETs were very long and sometimes tedious to do",
                "The lectures were taught in the most engaging way possible, giving the actual content was fairly dry. I was usually able to get a good understanding of all the material after a week of lectures, section, and the pset. Biggest disappointment of this class was the \"applied\" aspect. There are very few applications of the material we learn, it's basically a continuation of your standard high school statistics course. Also it was frustrating how much extra time we had to spend on psets formatting the material in stata, then in a pages document, then tidying up our written work... the psets seemed much more time-consuming than they needed to be due to all the formatting requirements. The formatting of the psets actually took a 45-minute video on Canvas to explain.",
                "Strengths: Problem sets were challenging yet manageable and prepared us well for the exams. Mastery of the problem sets led to mastery of the class as a whole, which is not always the case in quantitative classes like AQA. Weaknesses: Not suitable for students unable to find a strong study group as the strength of the study group really factored into success on the problem sets and therefore success in the class as a whole.",
                "I felt like the TAs were sometimes not helpful in addressing questions I had in a timely or clear manner.",
                "Strengths: JT is great and his office hours are fantastic, the material is clear, useful content. Weaknesses: if you are a visual learner and are very bad at taking in auditory information like me, there will be a lot of important material that you will have to memorize that won't be on the slides, which made it somewhat difficult to study and know that I've covered everything. A lot of it is in the textbook, but at times the lecture material is organized in a different way than in the textbook, which makes it hard to know what to focus on - some questions require very specific phrasing to get right (and you might not know what that phrasing is until you get it wrong on the pset). The problem sets were helpful, but could also get repetitive with several almost identical questions on a single concept.",
                "I really struggled in this class. There are some people who seem to come in already very interested and good at stats, but I was definitely not one of those people, so it did take a lot of work. JT is very passionate, and I know that most people found him to be an engaging lecturer. I really struggled to pay attention. That could be because of the subject material, but I was also very overwhelmed this semester and was struggling to pay attention for other reasons. Occasionally, it felt like JT and the students who raised their hands most often would go off on brief tangents way beyond where I was able to think. I know that JT really wanted other people to raise their hands, and I know he actively waited for new hands to go up. I worked really, really hard on each problem set, which is the only way I am walking away from this class with an okay grade. As I studied for the final, I had to go back through all the lecture slides to try to figure out how many significance test and confidence interval processes wed learned, and in some cases, it was really hard to figure out exactly what formulas, estimated standard error calculations, assumptions, test statistics, etc. pertained to each test/interval. I ended up making my own guide of the steps to each test/interval as best I could, but I think it would be helpful to design the lectures in a way that makes it easier to understand how each new significance test fits into the context of the other ones we learned. Also, though I know it didnt end up working like this once we went online for the final, but I dont think it makes any sense to make people memorize assumptions. I spent many, many hours memorizing assumptions, which are just as easy to look up in the real world as the equations on the formula sheet. That was time I could have put towards studying the actual material and underlying theory that mattered. Generally, this subject includes so much vocabulary and so many symbolsstandard deviation, standard error, estimated standard error, etc. and then the formulas are different for large samples and small samples and proportions and large sample proportions and small sample proportions, etc. It would really help to focus more throughout the semester on contextualizing each new test within the context of the other ones. However, I do think JT is incredibly kind, caring, and everyone really loves him!!",
                "As a non-stats, non-econ student, JT is very engaging and good at explaining the important of the material. I learned a lot, and the psets definitely prepared me for the midterm. One downside was that psets being graded electronically made it harder to understand feeedback from the TAs.",
                "I think one of the biggest strengths of the course is JT. He's one of the most engaging and enthusiastic professors I've had at Yale, and his lectures made the content some of which could be dry at times very interesting. Also, the course seemed to have a very organized structure and flow to it, and I could see how all the material clearly built off of each other. There are three main weaknesses I can think of the first is that JT's slides often weren't organized in a clean, easy-to-understand way. For example, they tended to be clunky and quite verbose more streamlined slides would be helpful. Secondly, I wish there was a greater emphasis on the applications of the content we were learning, such as real examples from current research. All of the \"applications\" felt very hypothetical, and given the fact that this is an applied course, I didn't feel like I walked away with a clear sense of the read-world implications of the material. Finally, I wish we had learned more Stata. While we learned some basic commands that were used on the problem sets, I wish I could walk away from the course with a greater level of proficiency with the software.",
                "Weaknesses: Sections and TFs are pretty disorganized. While they go over general concepts its more as if its a Q&A session instead of a thorough review. Thus only the students who already understand the concepts really gain from it. It would be better if they had sample problems or something to go through so we could actually apply the concepts. Similarly office hours with TAs to ask questions about problem sets arent very helpful. There arent enough available hours so lots of people end up crowded at one session. Questions jump around and since TFs are trying so hard to not give you the answer, they end up not really teaching you anything. Sometimes they also tell you the wrong thing. Feedback on homework doesnt always explain why you got something wrong and what would be correct. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Office hours with JT are much more clear and efficient. I understand more from asking JT questions for 15 minutes than two hours with the TFs",
                "I found that the psets were graded extremely harshly to the point where I was getting better problem set grades than other students who objectively had a better understanding of the material which felt like the grading was missing the point. I felt that either I should have had a lower grade or my peers who understood the problems should not have been docked for not using exact precise language or making small mistakes, however, overall a good class! I am simply bad at statistics so I think I need to improve and not the class!",
                "I found the class to be quite difficult at times, and I think that could have been helped by a different teaching format that utilized practice problems more than lectures.",
                "This is one of the best-taught courses I have ever taken. I was so engaged during every single class, I genuinely looked forward to it every monday and wednesday. I love how JT is very real and starts class off by helping us get back into gear and asks some simple questions to get my mind back in the headspace of significance tests again. I thought the progression of the course made sense, and maybe we could whiz by the stuff in the beginning a little faster before we learn about a sampling distribution and get to the complex stuff. I love how interactive the lecture is! JT does a great job validating students who speak up and it feels nice because it can be nerve-wracking to answer questions you're unsure about in a big class. One piece of feedback might be to not totally validate someone who says the wrong answer, because everyone copies down what that student says and JT might say \"that's great\" to help the student feel better, but then he would actually say the correct answer and not directly say \"well not quite, Suzie...\" so Suzie doesn't feel bad. If that makes sense.",
                "The course could be improved by offering more opportunities to improve grades. I think the 35% midterm, 35% final, and 30% problem places two much weight on just two assignments, the midterm and final.",
                "This course started really slow with very little challenge, and then became difficult very suddenly. Perhaps the difficult concepts could be spaced out a bit more. Also, the problem sets sometimes felt unnecessarily long, especially when there were two or more of the exact same (time consuming) type of questions  perhaps there could be one of each type of question necessary, and then extra practice available for those who decide to do so",
                "The strength of this course is that it teaches the fundamentals and the intuition behind the tests really, really well. I have only a couple of critiques. First, for me, the class would sometimes go so slowly that it would make things that I had understood just fine confusing again. Professor Thomas would ask us rhetorical questions that we all knew the answer to but since he was asking, we would start to second guess ourselves because then we thought it must be a difficult question. Second, It would have been helpful if our approach to the assumptions for each test had been a little more consistent with some structure to make it easier to see the continuity. As I was studying for the final, I made a table of all of the methods and their assumptions and compared them side to side it finally all clicked in my head because I could see what changed and what stayed the same when, for instance, we had to use a small sample. I noticed in the slides that sometimes the same assumption would be called a different thing and while those kinds of differences were small, it really would have helped me in the class if I had that side-to-side comparison as I was learning it.",
                "JT is a great instructor, and the course rides the wave of his enthusiasm that he brings the class. The class could never be the same without him, and he was absolutely the highlight. That being said, I think his teaching became slightly more difficult to follow after the midterm, but that could be due to the content getting dramatically more difficult. Con of this course is almost definitely the relativeness of the TA's. Having a good TA can dramatically boost your understanding of the content, and unfortunately had many friends who weren't as lucky and I consistently shared my section notes with them to help them stay afoot.",
                "The course materials were thorough and extensive, including the slides, and the problem sets were designed well to test your knowledge of theory and methodology. They also were representative of what was expected on the tests.",
                "The different modes of seeking help in this course were a strength. Any students could schedule office hours with the four teaching fellows or JT, which allowed for clarification when it was needed. I appreciated the feedback on my problem sets, and each note I got helped me grow in my analysis skills with each assignment we did. Since there were four teaching fellows with different styles of feedback, there would sometimes be more elaborate comments for certain problem sets.",
                "This course was not well designed. The lectures moved way too slowly - often the reason we were behind pace - in a lecture class that big, too many students asked unnecessary questions. The problem sets were way too long. The psets also required us to use Stata which wasn't even used on the exams and did not really give a great understanding of how to use statistical software. Also, not sure why Stata was used for this course and not R, from what I've heard, Stata is basically useless.",
                "While the psets are long, working with people in the class really helped keep our group engaged and ready to learn. JT's lectures can be engaging but sometimes can get off-track which would make some of us zone out at times. Overall, this is a great introductory statistics class.",
                "Sometimes, the possibility of cold-calling intimidated me to the point that I was hesitant to come to class. Other than that, JT was an engaging instructor.",
                "Strengths: good lecture slides, clear presentation of material, fair exams\r\nWeaknesses: the biggest weakness by far was the availability of office hours!! Sometimes it was very difficult to sign up for office hour slots because they filled up so quickly. It would've been better to have TFs hold group office hours rather than individual meetings because many students had the same questions. The class had over 100 students, and diving one 60-minute office hour period into four 15-minute individual meetings was a very inefficient use of time and made it much harder for students to talk to the TF's.",
                "Sometimes, it felt like concepts were getting overcomplicated in order to attempt to explore a more nuanced take. Obviously, nuance is important, but it seemed like more time could be spend on foundations. Feedback on Problem Sets also often seemed overly punitive, and people who hand-wrote their PSets tended to get more points taken off than those that typed them.",
                "The PSETs took me a long time to do, but I thought that they really helped me understand the material from lecture. JT is a great, engaging lecture, but I did find myself getting lost sometimes.",
                "Strengths - Lecture, understandability, enjoyment, professor, depth and width of information.\r\nWeakness - Possibly section and material covered in section. Grading for accuracy instead of understanding.",
                "Good lectures that helped a lot. Well organized too. I think it might have helped to have an overview of the direction the course is heading in from the beginning. That way you I could know what to expect. Also submitting psets online was a big hassle.",
                "Could be improved by more office hours and at better times, both from the professor and the TFs. It is ridiculous that the professor only offered office hours for 1 or 2 hours a week, on zoom and the sign up on canvas was released day before for 10 or 15 minute slots. The times were highly inconvenient and you had to fight to sign up on time. Also the TF office hours were terrible as well, and were not very helpful either. Psets were very lengthy and time intensive, didn't need to be that long, and they could be very difficult. They were graded slowly, and often not before the exam. The midterm and final were super hard in comparison to the psets, included random theory questions, and the grading scale was not forgiving either. The final exam was made intentionally so that students wouldn't finish the exam, which is super messed up. How can we demonstrate our knowledge accurately if we are given 2 hours to finish an exam that is longer than a pset (which would take me at least 10 hours to even finish). Very frustrating class!"

                "Yea its probably better than taking econ 117",
                "No, it is incredibly challenging.",
                "I would tell another student to only take this class if they need it as a requirement for their major or if they have taken other Stats classes in the past. I often felt like I was at a disadvantage because many of my peers had taken several stats classes in high school while I had not, and it was a bit difficult to keep up with the pace of the material.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course to those who are interested in the statistics and would like to use statistical methods in research in the future. We are taught to understand the logics behind the statistical methods we used - not just learn how to do it. The problem sets are useful in checking my understanding. The sections are also very helpful. The professor and TFs help me clarify the concepts that I am not clear. They are the best!",
                "Not unless you're taking it as a requirement or genuinely love statistics. It's just hard to engage with the material, regardless of how it is presented. I think more math-heavy stats classes would probably be better because this class had way too heavy of an emphasis on having the right words.",
                "I would not recommend this class to anyone. Only take it if you HAVE to take it (global majors). If you're EP&E, take S&DS 230 instead to fulfill your econometrics requirement. If you're trying to get into an introductory stats class, look elsewhere. This stats course is supposed to be contextualized within public policy but it really does not matter what context you learn stats in, the basics of the statistical tests you learn are all the same.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who needs a QR or a stats credit, but is definitely not the easiest QR you can take. It is however an employable skill and I think what you learn is more directly applicable than intro micro for example.",
                "I would recommend the course if you are interested in statistics at all. It is definetely the best intro stats class at Yale, but it is challenging.",
                "I would recommend the class if you're a prospective global major, but if not, I would recommend taking a different stats class.",
                "I would! AQA is a requirement for a couple of majors but I think it is worth it. The concepts are interesting and if you pay attention in lecture, the PSETs won't be difficult. However, you do need to go to lecture for this class because JT often mentions things that are not in the slides but come up in the exams.",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to get an introduction to Stata and build upon what you may have learned in a high school stats class. I wouldn't recommend it for the \"applied\" aspect.",
                "Would recommend if you are looking to go into a field in which a background in statistics is helpful. Exam questions were never surprises and mirrored the problem sets extremely accurately.",
                "If you need to for your major.",
                "Yes, with some caveats. JT is a great lecturer, the TAs were quite helpful, the STATA components were clear, and overall I learned a lot of useful stuff! However, doing well in this course requires memorizing very precise wording, which is fine, but sometimes this wording is mentioned in lecture once and never appears on the slides (which is bad news if you are more of a visual learner). While the things that aren't on the slides can sometimes be found in the textbook, reviewing for exams is still quite difficult because you're not quite sure what to focus on / which parts to memorize exactly. Overall though, I would recommend - it has a lot of useful content and gives you a solid foundation.",
                "If you need to take Stats or are applying to the Global Affairs major, then yes!",
                "Yes, definitely. JT is great and the course is a good intro to stats.",
                "I would recommend this course, especially to global and EPE students. JT's a very engaging professor, and there are a number of resources offered to support students in the class. Especially for global students, where GLBL 122 is required, I would specifically recommend taking this course instead of the other intro stats substitutes (i.e. 100-level S&DS or ECON 117) because this course directly flows into 122, so taking 121 gets you a feel for the teaching style and the types of problem sets and exams.",
                "If its a requirement. Its probably one of the better options for EP&E",
                "If you need to take it then it will be fine! I had friends who were taking it for fun so if the material interests you then I would recommend it as well, especially if you like to think about stats from a conceptual perspective.",
                "Only if you have to take it. The professor is incredible, but the content can be fairly difficult at times.",
                "YES!! This was one of the best courses I have ever taken. JT is so passionate and unbelievably smart. He explains things SO WELL. I don't know how he knows what we are struggling to understand but he just does and he walks through every step so precisely, and sees where we might be getting caught. \r\n\r\nYou should definitely take this course if you plan to do any work in public policy, government, pharma, academia, science, or anything that uses research. SO CRUCIAL! \r\n\r\nAlso the class is so fun and I love thinking through these complex concepts that really stretch my brain and then when they finally click it's so rewarding. Love love love this! JT is also so engaging and makes lectures super fun. He starts every class with a funny story and he really cares deeply about helping students.",
                "Yes. I would recommend the course for someone, like me, who might not be a STEM major but hopes to gain an elementary understanding of statistics.",
                "If you need to take it, yes",
                "This course is great for understanding the theory behind statistics.",
                "Definitely to anyone who needs the credit, this is the stats course to take if its one of your options (I took it to fulfill EP&E). Also just a really interesting application of stats to really relevant data.",
                "I would recommend this course as it provides a clear relationship between the content and practical applications one might see in the real world when they are assessing research.",
                "I would recommend this class to any student who wants a very strong background in statistical analysis. The content in the lectures, textbook, and sections all offered different methods and perspectives to certain types of analysis. The first few weeks sets a strong foundation in statistical terminology before diving into methods, which is very helpful. The problem sets for this course also emphasize important skills and every question is very intentional to foster learning.",
                "Yes! You do not need to be a global affairs/EPE major to take this class. It is interesting and incredibly useful for all different fields. I think it is a great class to credit/d/fail so that you can just focus on learning the material. JT is a great lecturer and so it is one of the few lectures you want to regularly attend.",
                "No, not unless you really have to take this course (aka Global Affairs majors). Statistics is a pretty dry subject, and if you want a more engaging course on the subject and more fun with data science, I'm sure there are plenty of better options.",
                "Yes! For Global majors that need to take 122, especially.",
                "If you are an EP&E major, this is definitely the best class to take compared to the other options. JT is a phenomenal professor and lecturer and truly cares about his students. JT also does a great job explaining statistics so even if you have never taken stats before, it is definitely manageable.",
                "Only if they were willing to work hard and were motivated to learn stats.",
                "Yes, but only if you have to. The material itself was not particularly interesting, but it gives you practical skills for social science research. There was a ton of memorization and tedious, repetitive number crunching in psets. That being said, for EP&E majors, I'd still recommend taking this class over ECON 117 because the material is a lot more accessible and the professor's great.",
                "Yes!",
                "Overall, I think this course would be beneficial to most people.",
                "Yes, I would, I think it provided me with a good understanding of statistics. Also, you kind of have to take it if youre a global major.",
                "Yes. The professor is awesome! Amazing at teaching and engaging the students. The information taught in the course is valuable to all people and professions.",
                "Yes I would. A great applied stats course. Very practically useful.",
                "I would absolutely not recommend this class to another student unless you absolutely need to take it for Global or EPE."
