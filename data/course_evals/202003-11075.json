We were all beginners and it was so cool to see how everyone progressed from saying only basic greetings to doing PowerPoint presentations and skits, so you really improve a lot in a short amount of time. We learned basic grammar, mostly focusing on the basic polite form of verbs, and we also practiced vocabulary on food, locations, family, clothing,  numbers\/counting, and activities.",

                "strengths: Yamaguchi sensei is the BEST! She really puts time into her job and makes herself available all the time if students need help. She's extremely caring and down to earth, and takes student feedback about the class seriously. Professor was also very familiar with Zoom and Canvas so we didn't have to waste time on technical difficulties. I also LOVED my classmates because they are so fun and engaging, they really want to learn Japanese and did their part. Even though this semester was virtual, the level of engagement in this class is so high that I really got to know my classmates and professor well through zoom. The curriculum is well designed and very interesting, textbook is colorful and comprehensive, we also have Japanese clinic where 2 students meet with an upperclassman tutor for 1 hour each week to practice speaking which was very helpful.\r\nweakness: probably the class size. I had 13 students in my class, which is not bad but for a language course we would have had more time to practice if there were only 5-8 students.",
                "Strengths: very well organized, format of the class is great, homework and classwork go well hand-in-hand to facilitate the best learning environment, not overwhelming, but also not an easy class. Weakness: Nothing.",
                "Strengths - you learn a lot in a short period of time, and seeing the progress that you and your classmates make is a really cool experience. We got to practice reading, writing, speaking and listening through a variety of assignments and activities, and I found it engaging to learn a bit about Japanese culture through the different readings from the Tobira textbook.\r\nWeaknesses - it's a lot of work, but that's to be expected from an L1 course that is very different from English! I struggled with kanji throughout the semester, because I had no previous experience with them, so there is a lot of memorizing to do.",
                "The format of this class was great (synchronous and asynchronous). I liked the routine of week-to-week assignments, quizzes, and tests. Class was super fun and engaging. I wish there was a way to work through the weekly homework at your own pace. It is possible, but it would be difficult if you front loaded the homework because you wouldn't address that topic until the day after the homework was assigned. So, it would be harmful to get ahead. Daily homework got kind of overwhelming. But, I don't think this is necessarily a problem that can be fixed; it seems to be a requirement of language course of this caliber and frequency.",
                "The strengths included a level of focus and care among the other students in the class, and the amount of time spent to make sure we actually learned the material. Weaknesses involved learning outside of class and the modules that had to be completed before class every day. I can't think of how this could have been improved with a virtual class format.",
                "I thought the course was strong overall, especially given that it is a language course being conducted online. The digital classroom dynamic was surprisingly enjoyable. The homework assignment were always constructive, and aided in my retention.",
                "This course utilized 4 synchronous days and 1 asynchronous day every week. I think this format worked quite well, as it gave us time to do things like tests or longer projects each week. We also got a lot of opportunities to practice in class."

                "professor being familiar with Zoom and Canvas was very helpful. Course practices that allowed for virtual engagement are calling on students, give clear directions on an activity and then putting students into breakout rooms, professor jumping from breakout rooms to breakout rooms to give feedback was also helpful.",
                "The four synchronous and one asynchronous format worked very well for me and would like to keep that!",
                "Despite the virtual classes, I honestly felt like this class did the best job out of any class in capturing the in-person learning experience. We were always talking, asking\/answering questions, reading out loud, doing pair or group work, or repeating after the instructor. The small class size helped me feel more connected to my classmates, who became good friends over the semester.",
                "The asynchronous Wednesdays was super helpful. The engagement in collaboration via group work and breakout rooms fostered a cool class environment. The Japanese Clinic was a bit overwhelming to me. I am aware that the clinic occurs during a normal year, and every other week may have worked better for this year. But with Zoom fatigue, the clinic was another layer of virtual stress that seemed pointless at times.",
                "It was very successful altogether for a virtual language class but I thought the outside class learning was maybe the most challenging part.",
                "The addition of casual free talking and Q&As at the beginning of class really helped replicate that organic opportunities for practice that you would have in a physical classroom. The digital Japanese Language table and Japanese clinic sessions also helped with this. I'm actually a bit astonished at how effective the course felt given that it was conducted completely via zoom, Prof. Yamaguchi did a wonderful job!",
                "I think breakout rooms succeeded very well. I found them to be very beneficial to my learning experience, and the teacher would always check on each group and answer any questions we had. I also think the asynchronous day was beneficial."

                "Absolutely, if you're interested in Japanese! You are able to learn enough to engage in basic conversations, which is awesome.",
                "Yes, absolutely! I was excited to come to Yale and take a language I had zero experience with, and it was by far my most engaging course this semester, even if it was virtual. You improve a ton in a short period of time, and the class atmosphere was always really fun and encouraging  there were some absolutely hysterical moments during class where everyone was just laughing together over shared difficulties or confusion. There is daily homework and you need to make sure you are staying on top of the grammar and vocabulary because otherwise participating in the class to the fullest becomes difficult. However, as long as you put effort into the class, the progress you make is extremely rewarding.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to others that have a strong interest in Japanese. Like most\/all language courses at Yale, Japanese definitely had a heavy course load and was fast paced. So, I would recommend taking the language that students like because it is super satisfying and motivates you to keep going in the class.",
