                "I gained knowledge relating to a broad variety of neural network architectures. The course was somewhat of a survey course of Neural Networks, so it seemed the priority was to familiarize students with a breadth of models.",
                "I was able to understand the basics of how Neural Networks works, and more broadly how that connects to Artificial Intelligence. We learned topics such as layers, pooling, activation functions, algorithms, applications of neural networks, etc, as well as different types of Neural networks such as CNNs, LSTM, perceptrons, etc. We learned how to build learning networks ourselves through guided homeworks, and learn how to read papers and implement our own project at the end.",

                "I gained more intuition on the purpose and design of lower-level machine learning concepts as well as experience for what it's like to train and test your own ML model. ML lectures covered topics from regression, gradient descent, and loss functions to CNN's and hardware design. As part of a group, we chose, read, and presented on a ML paper. For the final project, we implemented something related to the ML paper, presented on a demo day, and wrote up a 5-page technical report."

                "Strengths: You will learn about many different neural network types. Weaknesses: Professor Panda is not a fantastic lecturer. The lecture material is far too dense and is presented on slides that are completely full of text, diagrams, and equations; making note-taking very challenging or impossible. I did not feel like I gained a very deep understanding of neural networks since the priority of the class seemed to be learning about as many types of networks as possible instead of gaining intuition or understanding about them in general. The assignments did not help me gain a deeper understanding of neural networks since they felt like guess-and-check fill-in-the-blank challenges. I certainly gained familiarity with the subject in this course but would have rather learned the subject in a very different way.",
                "The strength of this course is that it goes in-depth into theory.This course could have been improved if the professor explained both the theory and the algorithm\/programming side of the course. The lectures were very thorough; however, I would have enjoyed learning more practically about how to implement these algorithms, instead of just fumbling around on the homeworks.",
                "The homework assignments go from very easy to difficult instantaneously with little feedback, and then on the final project you are kind of on your own and it will take a lot of time. Workload fluctuates a lot from week to week because it depends on whether or not there are assignments due that week. Prof Panda is one of the best lecturers in the EE department and explains very clearly but material can move kind of quickly.",
                "strengths: student presentations are interesting and prof is clearly passionate about the material. weaknesses: foundations of NNs aren't super well taught and at the beginning we tended to breeze by foundational material that would've allowed further class engagement throughout the semester. instead it steadily declined. More alignment between class material & psets may have also helped",
                "Overall great course.",
                "Already very structured",
                "I wish the homework wasn't from coursera... tuition is way too high for the homework to be something I can do online",
                "Strengths: class is on the smaller side, so it felt easier to engage with the professor and ask questions during lectures than many other courses. Topics were well-motivated and built on each other. Presenting a paper and implementing an idea from it for final project was enjoyable, engaging, and highly instructive. Weaknesses: while workload for the psets was very low, preparing for presentation and final project was like writing a final paper."

                "I would not necessarily recommend this course to another student. It is an elective for EE\/CS so it is not required for anyone to take. I felt frustrated much of the time while taking this course and thought that the assignments and lectures were both poorly constructed to facilitate learning. Additionally, going into reading period, I had only received 20% of my grade for the course back.",
                "Yes. It is a good course for getting down the basics of Neural Networks and learning. Note that you get out of the class is how much you put into it. If you put effort into understanding the steps of your assignments and applying what you learn in class, you will learn a lot. However, the vice versa holds true.",
                "I would recommend because it is a rather low-workload, interesting course that is pretty relevant to current topics in tech. Plus, you get to add a good project to your resume. It can get rather difficult without sufficient skills in Python.",
                "not really. NNs are very cool but tbh I learned very little from this class. it's easy and if you're super self-motivated it might do it for you but it really did not for me",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes as this is a great opportunity to learn and present",
                "Not really... I think there are other classes at Yale that do a better job at teaching you this stuff and pair it with relevant homework so you actually learn",
                "If you have a little machine-learning experience and want to do a project, this course is a great opportunity with its paper presentation and final project. Most of the workload is in these two parts and not in the psets, though you do get practice with training and running models. I would recommend this as a CS elective for anyone in the major who wants to do more ML applications. The class's smaller size is also refreshing"
