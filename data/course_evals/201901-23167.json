    "This class taught me to learn\/reflect\/converse\/write about poetry alongside political and theoretical contexts which was challenging but also extremely important given the topics we discussed. I learned that a lot of indigenous work is tied to the historical\/political but that it should never be defined only as so. I also learned the importance of engaging with a U.S. colonial past in the context of indigenous peoples and what that looks like now.",
    "This course connected Indigenous poetry and politics in ways I had never before understood. In offering an array of mixed-media literature, some creative, some theoretical, and some political, this class had excellent groundwork with which we as a group collectively worked to understand the political effect of poetry, and the effect of politics on poetry.",
    "This course gave me a whole new vocabulary and theoretical framework for understanding Indigenous rights and political movements. I also grew a lot in my ability to read and appreciate poetry.",
    "So much about close reading and about the very nature of reading and academic analysis and academia in the first place - I was constantly re-interrogating the frameworks through which I viewed the world and the works I was engaging with, and challenging and confronting the colonial preconceptions that I had learned throughout my years of studying literature & existing as a settler.",
    "I expanded my reading list greatly, as I was exposed to Indigenous authors Ive never heard of. This course helped to show me Indigenous life in the 21st century as it explored topics like language reclamation, sexuality, environmental justice, and more. Further, I expanded my essay writing skills as this course had us put many poets in conversation with more critical pieces.",
    "I learned how poetry is used as a medium of political resistance for many distinct Indigenous communities. That poetry encompasses visual representations, spoken word, videos, and written within a larger collection. Also how theories within Indigenous studies are linked to poems created by Indigenous authors and the importance that they have in contextualizing or framing the creative project as a whole.",
    "I learned a lot about Indigenous poets, decolonization, and what settler colonialism actually looks like\/destroys\/how it can be worked against. I also learned how to talk about these questions while engaging with my own positionality as a white Westerner."

   "comments": [
    "The course has great reading selections and is extremely diverse with the authors we read but also the theory. The theoretical texts aligned well with the collections of poetry. I do however think class discussions sometimes can focus more on the form of the poetry!",
    "This course was wonderful! I especially appreciated the requirement that every member of the class lead discussion. When preparing my own discussion, I learned a lot about the ways that teachers choose what is important and ask questions that offer points of access into rich conversation. I also really enjoyed the ways that the class moved between mediums, from books to videos, and the diverse range of literature; I think that engaging with theory and political literature alongside poetry really helped me to understand the broader intellectual goal of the class. I do wish, personally, that there had been a bit more discussion of the poetry alongside the complicated political literature, just because I really enjoyed all of the collections we read, and wanted to read and discuss them more than there was time for.",
    "A strength of this course was Professor Hickey's thoughtfulness and genuine investment in her students. Professor Hickey clearly put a lot of intention into every aspect of the course, and she created a great seminar environment. I liked that each student led a discussion, and I appreciated that we all got to discuss our final projects at the end. One weakness was that I think the ratio of theory to poetry was sometimes uneven -- some classes we'd only have a theoretical piece to work with, and I would have loved to have read more collections of poetry. I also think some of the theoretical texts went a bit over my head. Maybe in the future, it would be helpful to have a list of guiding questions or key terms as we're doing some of the more complex readings.",
    "Loved it\r\nCould have been a bit more organized in terms of timings and due dates and receiving feedback",
    "The course hugely encourages class participation, questioning, and deconstruction of the work we're doing. It would have been fantastic to have some slightly more thorough support when it came to encouraging alternate forms of writing, but overall I have virtually no complaints.",
    "Strengths: the reading list was the highlight of this course along with Professor Hickeys teaching; she never pushed a certain interpretation onto us which allowed us to come to our own conclusions.\r\nWeaknesses: it would have been beneficial to have an intro class day discussing terminology and basic Indigenous history for the students less familiar",
    "I like how this course emphasizes what students are most interested in within Indigenous Poetics and I think this allowed the conversations to be more enriched with what people genuinely cared about talking. I also think a strength in the course is the design of the syllabus that puts theoretical works in conversation with the poetry to lead to a reading of the poetry that was not depoliticized, but rather exposed students to Indigenous peoples and issues that affect them to contextualize the readings. As a result, I think every student came to a more informed understanding of distinct Indigenous peoples and their poetry.",
    "Strengths: varied syllabus, wide-ranging discussion. In terms of improvement, I think our discussions could be a little more focused--they tended to be a bit wandering.",
    "This course goes through really cool poems and critical pieces that challenge you every week. The course also gives voice to students and, more importantly, Native students, which was a really special space to be in twice a week. I think because students have so much voice, the discussion sometimes really meandered, so a bit more intentional structuring every day could have been helpful."

    "This course has been one of my favorite courses I've ever taken at Yale. It is an English seminar that teaches you history, theory, and makes you read important and unrecognized collections of poetry. It redefines the ways we think about American literature\/writing and what is allowed to fall under this category or \"should.\" Professor Hickey is a great discussion leader and extremely helpful in office hours about the class\/writing assignments. The class has interesting reading and does not have excessive amounts of work. Also, more courses like this should be offered at Yale, especially under the English department! It is important to study indigenous history and literature!!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in engaging with politics in literature. The syllabus is wonderful and diverse, and the discussions are led with open-ended questions that allow the students to direct the learning in ways that are empowering and helpful. I think that this class really demonstrates the ways that Indigenous literature and experience tends to \"fall of the map\" of traditional Western academia, and critically engages with this habit and whether or not it really is a bad thing. It's complicated to take an academic approach to Indigenous culture, politics, literature, and history, especially at a colonial institution like Yale, and deeply respect the ways that this class recognized and grappled with these complications. In general, I think that students interested in learning more about Indigeneity and the political and poetic discourse with which Indigenous scholars are grappling with modern experience should take the class.",
    "Yes, I loved this course! Professor Hickey is amazing and we had really great discussions. The readings are incredible.",
    "Yes!!! I learned so, so much from this class. A lot of my preconceptions both about poetry and about Indigenous literature were challenged. I'd never heard of most of the poets we read and I'm so glad this course required me to read their work -- I'll definitely read more of their poetry in the future. This was probably my favorite class of the semester.",
    "Absolutely, yes!",
    "Absolutely! It's an incredible starting point for thoroughly examining Indigenous issues through a literary but also thoroughly politically grounded lens.",
    "Yes!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because Professor Hickey is an incredible professor who genuinely cares about every student in the class, both for furthering their knowledge on the subject and writing skills, but also cares about students and what they are passionate about outside of class. The syllabus is very well-organized and the course itself is also a special opportunity since there is no other course on campus that allows students to engage with so many Indigenous poets, and no other professor who would teach it quite like Professor Hickey.",
    "Absolutely! This is a wonderful class that combines theory and poetry, and over a topic that everyone should study!",
    "YES! Incredible course, loving and engaging professor... you learn so much, are challenged a ton, and undergo a transformation of thought and understanding of this settler colonial state."
