                "This course combined political economy and game theoretical understandings of international conflict to provide a comprehensive analysis of international relations. While the course material was extremely interesting itself, Dr. Michael-David Mangini was able to explain very difficult game theoretical concepts to those who had no background with ease. The course was the perfect culmination of my previous semesters studying political science. My writing and analytical skills have never been so positively influenced by any class.",
                "- we extensively discussed bargaining dynamics on an international scale. We engage with various ranges that factor into conflict negotiations and garnered a vast understanding of the complexity which is involved in foreign affairs.",
                "Developed a better understanding of some of the models which can explain or predict conflict. Strengthened analytical approaches to models and theories, as well as honed skills for effectively reading and interpreting political science research. Expanded my approaches to conflict by putting different themes in conversation with each other to see how particular theories or ideas may replicate themselves or complicate other theories.",
                "This course helped me to develop insights into the complex and nuanced world of international conflict along with all of the intricate mechanisms that help to facilitate its promulgation. I developed the skill to critically analyze and compare pieces on international conflict among each other by placing them into conversation and connecting their similar themes.",
                "I learned helpful tools and frameworks to help me interact with current events and international law.",
                "I learned about different concepts of international conflict and how they may overlap. I also learned how to read political science research papers and how to the math translates to application."

                "This course was well organized and built off the readings and discussions of the prior weeks seamlessly. The material was easy to grasp and that which was not was well explained before entering into a discussion. I really don't see any way this course could be improved. The material is difficult yet with Dr. Michael-David Mangini in charge understanding the material seemed easy.",
                "strengths; \r\n- large, class debates\r\n- small group discussion\r\n- range of reading materials\r\n- professor's curiosity and engagement",
                "Strengths: extremely well-organized; wide-ranging topics and approaches that allows for good depth in what the course covers; knowledgeable professor who has a really strong command over the assigned readings; workload which promotes intellectual engagement but doesn't overwhelm; extra background and in-class breakdowns were provided for more challenging concepts to make sure everyone was on the same page\r\nWeaknesses: the grading system for weekly assignments is a check-based system rather than letter-based, so it's not always clear what grade track you're on; generally the reading load was the same from week to week, but there was occasionally an assigned reading that was way longer than normal and pushed the reading load for that particular week a bit over the mark of manageable for a single class",
                "I think that the weekly papers and their length could be changed.",

                "There is no class I would recommend higher than this course. I don't think I would be able to say I came out of the political science department at Yale with a strong understanding of international relations and specifically international conflict if I had not taken this course. I think that this course should be part of the core curriculum of Yale's political science department and those who do not take it are missing out on one of the most well thought through courses at Yale. I would particularly note how, for me, this class finally applied Political Science theory in a way that was both interesting and convincing.",
                "Yes, anyone interested in the study of conflict should take this course. You develop a deep understanding of the unique perspectives that are prevalent in the world of negotiations and conflict management.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. The class is focused on the concept of international conflict specifically, but it approaches it from a variety of angles and using a multitude of subjects, so you really gain a more well-rounded understanding of conflict and how it operates globally. The workload is overall extremely manageable for a seminar-style political science course (weekly readings which aren't over-the-top, a certain number of reading responses that gives you flexibility in when you do them, and only one large paper at the end of the term). The fact that the workload wasn't overwhelming, and that the assignments were supposed to be rooted almost entirely in the readings for the week, really allowed me to engage more deeply with the class itself and I think I got more out of the course than I have others as a result. The class is really well-organized and designed for student learning, and Prof. Mangini is great about diving deeper into some of the more complex concepts during class to really make sure everyone comes out of the week's topic having grasped the concepts. He's also really eager to talk during office hours, and that was super helpful. Overall, I think I learned a great deal from this class (both with regard to intl. conflict, but also with regard to reading and analyzing political science research more effectively).",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student because of the various insights I developed concerning international conflict.",
                "Course very heavily leaned on readings and political theory, especially game theorytake this class if you're interested in that! Mangini is a growing pioneer in the field of international conflict and he has a wealth of knowledge on the subject. Very good person to talk with after class, and an extremely friendly person. The class is very much a seminar, with a need for high participation.",
