                "This was the first time that I felt like I really successfully had the chance to do an \"investigative\" story. This class pushed my farther in terms of reporting skills than any other I've taken at Yale (or reporting for student publications), and it was just a real gift to have the time and space for this kind of reporting (it is REALLY hard to do during the school year when it's not one of your classesit's hard anyway, of course, but it's particularly hard then!) Prof. Stillman is incredibleI feel like I learned so much about craft from her and from other students in the class. If you think you might want to write these kinds of stories, you should 100% take this class.",
                "Learned so much abt long form and abt journalism in general. I had never read journalistic pieces for craft before this class, but loved the chance to analyze those pieces like I would in a lit class.",
                "This course really throws you in at the deep end, but Prof. Stillman is there to help!! I learned how to report, how to best cold call people, how to interview, how to write long form narrative, how to be a compassionate journalist.",
                "How to write long form pieces, reporting strategies, hypothesis oriented reporting, human centered writing.",
                "How to write longform! And how to interview people about sensitive topics. Its one of those writing classes where you learn a lot just by doing it, so its hard to say precisely what I learned since I pretty much learned how to write in a genre I didnt know before.",
                "This class was so well structured to allow us to grow as journalists. There was workshopping of each other's work, close reading and more broad readings of different journalistic works. It was fantastic and perhaps my favorite journalism class I've taken at Yale.",
                "ENGL 480 taught me the skills that go into the writing of quality longform narratives  from writing ledes to learning interviewing techniques. We read examples of outstanding works, and then had two opportunities to try out and workshop our own.",

                "I greatly expanded my skill set as both a writer and (specifically) a journalist. I learned techniques for approaching and interviewing sources, and I learned how to read journalism for craft."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Prof. Stillman, again, is incredible at teaching this class. The reading list is varied and fantastic. I felt really, really supported by the group of people in this class, too. There is often a lot of pretension\/quasi-competition in advanced writing classes at Yale, which is a shame. Prof. Stillman engendered an environment that was truly supportive (and I know we all got lucky to have the classmates we did, too!) Academically, this was one of the writing classes I feel like I've gotten the most out of at Yale, but what was most unusual about it was how supportive and honest it felt.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This wasn't really a weakness this semester because it was an aspect of the course that Prof. Stillman altered partway through, but doing two investigative\/reconstruction\/long form pieces, AND revisions of both pieces is a LOT of work. Prof. Stillman adjusted the course to allow us only do one revision, which was an absolute lifesaver. This was a pandemic adjustment (we were all super, super burnt out, and felt comfortable talking about it together), but I frankly have no idea how people in past years accomplished this, even during a normal non-covid year. I would personally really recommend that this change stay in the future (especially because so many revisions involve really extensive additional reporting). I felt like I could really give my all to the revision of the piece that I didit would have been nowhere near as good if I was essentially simultaneously revising another piece.",
                "Ok I loved Professor Stillman and had a just amount of respect for my fellow students. But this was one extremely anxiety\/panic inducing class. I felt extremely unprepared for it and generally dissatisfied with my work, though that might not be a problem with the course but a me problem.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Stillman is incredibly dedicated to the class. She builds community, she makes herself available at all times, and she tailors the syllabus to the class needs\/wants. The readings are great, and the opportunity that it gives you to do a real deep dive is awesome.\r\nWeakness: this class probably involves more work than any class Ive taken at Yale. Not really a weakness if you want to really commit to it, but I wouldnt take the class if you are looking for a laid back semester.",
                "The course is incredibly well-taught by Prof Stillman and her expertise is invaluable. The workshop format is helpful and effective to help us improve. No weaknesses!",
                "Prof Stillman is a huge strength! Shes such an excellent person and teacher and she cares so much about her students. Honestly taking this class remotely with anyone less compassionate and cool than Stillman wouldve been awful, but she made it such a meaningful experience. I guess one weakness is just that its a ton of work so its hard to spend all the time on this class youd want to if youre in other hard classes.",
                "Professor Stillman gave me the most careful and thoughtful feedback on my writing and ideation, more than any professor I've had at Yale. And she's commenting on long pieces! I loved that about the class, combined with how our peers care so much about each other's work through workshopping. The class created a really strong bond between all of its studentsall of whom were amazing writers and journalists!",
                "This course has so many strengths. Prof. Stillman is first and foremost among them: she's deeply invested in working with your writing and learning your interests, and pushing you to be a better writer, but is also (and this was especially relevant this pandemic year) caring and understanding and empathetic. As long as you put in the effort to improve your own journalism, she'll more than reciprocate.\r\nBut the course also gives you a wonderful and intimidatingly talented community of writers to learn from and with. I was always mindblown by the quality of writing from my peers, and they were often models to learn from right next to me!",
                "The strength of this course lies in its workshop format and in Professor Stillman, who is a wealth of knowledge and care for her students. The weakness is mainly that it is a LOT of work and that it plunges you into reporting. It is certainly not impossible to take this course without some previous reporting experience, but I imagine it would be difficult."

I think the workload expected of us initially was far too high at a time when we were all struggling with the demands and stresses of the pandemic, but Prof. Stillman was quick to recognize that and tailor the course to our needs. We also had fun short writing exercises, occasional breakout rooms, and a good set of practices for healthy workshopping while online."

                "Absolutely, if this kind of work is something you're interested in doing, either in the future or just in this class before you graduate. I would definitely not take this class if you were taking five classes or had a particularly demanding semester for other reasons.  I wrote it while writing a thesis (as I think many of us did), and I don't think that was a dealbreaker and would do it again in a heartbeat, although at times I really had to set aside work for either this class or the thesis and focus on the other, because both were just so hard and intellectually demanding.",
                "Yes, this is one of those unmissable Yale classes. If you are at all interested in long form journalism, you should take this class. Prof. Stillman is the best. I met so many interesting people during interviews for my stories, and built relationships that will outlast my time at Yale.",
                "Absolutely would recommend this course. It is the best class to take on reporting and long form writing and learning from Stillman is an incredible privilege.",
                "Yes!! This class is wonderful. If you take it the same semester that youre writing a thesis though, be prepared for that to be very difficult. Itd be nice to take this class in a semester where you can really dive into it and spend a lot of time reporting and writing your pieces.",
                "This class had a lot of work (two long-form articles) but Prof. Stillman and our peers guided us through it so wonderfully. I also ended. up. being really proud of the work I produced, so it felt very worthwhile and intentional. If you are in any way interested in journalism or writing, take this class. It is a must take. I felt so intellectually challenged but also looked out for as a student in a way that made me want to do my best possible work. COVID was tough, but Professor Stillman checked in and adjusted our class work to make sure the work was never too overwhelming. I learned so much from her!",
                "Yes, absolutely! Be prepared to invest a huge amount of time and energy into this, but know that you will get much out of this if you do  from the readings, your Professor, your colleagues, and a chance to be reflexive about your own writing. At times the course was overwhelming in its workload, but this was also exacerbated by the difficulties of learning and reporting during such difficult times. But do make sure you are ready to commit time and energy to it - if you do that, this course will really help you improve your writing.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course is in my top three courses taken at Yale for sure. Professor Stillman cares for her students and is an absolute genius."
