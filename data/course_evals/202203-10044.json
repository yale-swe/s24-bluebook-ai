                "I learned a great deal about the cultural effect of the atomic bomb and fear of communism. There was an excellent discussion on racism and civil rights in medicine in the 1950s and 1960s. We also studied the polio vaccineand fluoridation campaigns. I now understand better how civil rights and medicine intersected. We also learned that vaccine controversies are not new and have existed as long as vaccines.",
                "I learned how to think about history deeper and step into the shoes of our sources.",
                "I gained a good sense of the overall \"arc\" of US healthcare during the Cold War, as well as a broader understanding of socialized healthcare movements, transitions away from institutional psychiatry, the development of the anti-polio crusade, etc. It was a pretty far-reaching seminar but I also gained a good sense of how to analyze cultural products (i.e. films) as indicative of domestic cultural trends. Honed writing skills.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of American medicine and how to analyze primary sources, along with writing clearly.",
                "I learned a lot about how to write a strong research paper, analyze papers for discussion and close reading papers, and synthesize primary sources for discussion.",

                "Strengths: interesting course material, class discussion, feedback on papers, multimedia (we watched several topical films along with readings)\r\nWeaknesses: none identified",
                "Professor Rogers is very knowledgeable and intelligent which makes class discussions fruitful. I also liked the readings and movies picked out each week. It would have been nice to have a rubric or other guidelines for writing assignments, but this is also a 400-level class so I understand why there was less emphasis on that.",
                "Strengths  extremely knowledgable professor who put together a great syllabus with interesting content and a good narrative arc. Weaknesses  I do think we could have engaged a little more with the readings individually think the class would have benefitted from discussion posts/online forum. Prof. Rogers is great; she expects finely polished work and pushes you to be a better writer, which I really appreciated.",
                "I think taking a 5 minute break during the seminar would be nice! The strengths are definitely the sources, the instructor's passion & knowledge about the material, and the content.",
                "I think the selected readings and layout of the course were very strong. I think it could be improved by making it more clear which were primary/secondary sources prior to reading and an order be given to read the assigned readings of the week.",
                "it is a great seminar where you have a lot of time to contribute your thoughts if you want to.",
                "Professor Rogers is a wonderful discussion leader and does a great job engaging everyone in class discussion. The syllabus was well structured, and the films and readings were all relevant and manageable. The two small writing assignments helped work towards the final research assignment. Professor Rogers provided detailed feedback that helped improve my writing. Only suggestion would be to have the final week of class be dedicated towards tying a lot of the themes of the class together in a more intentional way. 45% is also a lot of weight for a final paper, but still a fantastic course."

                "I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone interested in the 1950s and 1960s. It covers diverse subjects and provides an excellent review of medical politics in that era, civil rights, fears of communism, the atomic age, controversies over population health initiatives and other topics. As well, Professor Rogers integrates all these subjects to provide an encompassing view of the Cold War and American Medicine.",
                "Yes if you are interested in medicine and the cold war. I did not previously consider myself knowledgeable nor drawn in by cold war topics, yet this class showed me how many interested moments in history there are. 1945-1960 is an incredibly colorful period full of interesting anecdotes and movements.",
                "Yes, if you have a specific interest in healthcare and healthcare policy during this era. Prof. Rogers is great but it is a very niche class  it gives you a great narrative of the 50s and 60s through a different lens than most other classes and on the whole I really enjoyed it. I did realize about halfway through that I am not really a HSHM major but even if you aren't there's a lot to get out of it.",
                "Yes, definitely! It was fun and a good history seminar, although a little strict.",
                "Yes, the material was very interesting and worked well for people both with an interest in medicine or history in general and was an interesting lens to approach this time in American history.",
                "I think some of the prior reviews have not been accurate. I think this course has very fair grading. As long as you do the readings/ watch the movies, which does not take long, you will have a good time in the class.",
                "Yes! Super relevant and Professor Rogers is a gem. Great opportunity to improve your writing."
