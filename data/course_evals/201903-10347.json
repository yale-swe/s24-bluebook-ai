    "I learned to lead seminar discussions, write book reviews, and analyze ethnographies. The course gave me insight into the world of reproductive health in different cultures.",
    "This course helped me improve on my reading and discussion skills. I had to learn how to balance large amounts of reading and participate in class discussions based on those readings. This class also exposed me to ethnographies and how to write academic book reviews.",
    "I learned a lot about anthropological methods, social science, reproduction and reproductive health in both the developed and developing world",
    "I learned a lot about various cultures and how women encounter the same basic reproductive experiences. In regards to skills, Ive learned how to read quickly and efficiently as this course required me to read a book a week. I also learned how to write book reviews.",
    "It helped me understand what anthro seeks to discover",
    "I learned so much in this class!! It genuinely changed how I look at the world. You really learn about contemporary issues in reproductive technologies and how they differ on a global scale.",
    "By taking this course, I was introduced to ethnography, a critical facet of anthropology. I learned how to better analyze sociocultural factors that dictate women's decisions about their families and their bodies. I also discovered the role medical technology plays in shaping the public health landscape.",
    "Close reading, concise seminar contributions, book reviewing"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Interesting ethnographies and very informed professor\r\nWeaknesses: Discussions felt forced at times and revolved around similar topics\/ideas.",
    "I think the course is incredible! There is a lot of reading that can sometimes be overwhelming and it is often difficult to finish a book review before the first class where the book is discussed. It would be great to work on the timing and scheduling but otherwise the course is great!",
    "I liked that this class was reliant on participation and didnt require much preparation besides reading and understanding the books.",
    "This course was amazing!! Marcia is so knowledgeable and supportive and the content is SO interesting. Be prepared to do a ton of reading though; we read roughly a book per week.",
    "The strengths of this course was the student led discussions that allowed for us to have an engaging discussion about what we gained from the ethnographies. I may have just gotten lucky with the group of people that were in my seminar, but every person was equally engaged and passionate about the content and it showed in how lively our discussions were.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses to this course for me was the heavy reading load; along with my other humanities class it turned out to be a huge strain to have to read one book every week, but if I had chosen my classes with a more balanced workload, I think that one book a week would definitely be manageable.",
    "The strengths of the course include the quality of the books we read. Each one was fascinating, and each opened my eyes to various cultural practices and values around the world. One weakness of this course is that the structure eventually gets a little repetitive. The entire class is reading books and discussing them with very little variation. However, we did occasionally watch movies.",
    "Strengths: quality of reading, assignments thoughtfully curated to develop specific skills, marcias Expertise, student-led seminars\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: workload sometimes meant depth of analysis was sacrificed"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course only to students who are passionate about medical anthropology.",
    "Yes! I would absolutely recommend this course to other students both stem and humanities. I would also recommend this course to male-identifying students because I think it could make an impact.",
    "YES, if you have any interest at all in reproduction, anthropology, societal systems, why people make decisions related to religion, family, health, marriage etc.",
    "I would recommend this course because it gave me a lot of insight as to issues not frequently talked about but are important nonetheless.",
    "Yes!! Marcia is amazing, and the course content is so relevant and important",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course if you are interested in anything that has to do with women and gender studies, anthropology, or the medical sphere in general. This course was the highlight of my first semester at Yale and I fell in love with the content of this course and how encompassing the content was in terms of culture, perspective, and methodology.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in anthropology (specifically medical anthropology), public health, women's rights or religious studies, I would highly recommend this course. I learned so much from Marcia and the other anthropologists we read. I would easily take it again.",
    "I would highly recommend it. Marcias enthusiasm is infectious. The selected books were excellent. The wide survey of subjects was engaging."
