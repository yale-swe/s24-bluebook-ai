                "Marla is a great prof and she curated a great line up of lectures for this course. Everything was solid, although easing up on the psets would be great for the future -- it certainly felt like a marathon at times. the TAC meeting at the end of the year is also nice, but we were all so tired by that point that I don't know if we all got too much out of it.",

                "I would have liked a little more emphasis on programming rather than astro.",
                "Professor Geha is an absolute delight to work with. She is very personable, and generous with her time and feedback. As for the course itself, it was well-structured with weekly coding problem sets that were good methods of practicing what was learned in lecture. The final project was especially useful, and I have a much more nuanced understanding of what makes for good science writing.",
                "Strengths: The course was really good at teaching (which is special, and unique amongst courses in general!).  In every lecture and every assignment, the prof made herself super variable for questions of any kind, which was really helpful. This was an astro class where I really learned things.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Mmmmm maybe that a lot of the stuff we learned in class wasn't necessarily relevant to the telescope proposal? But that's barely a comment, this was a great class",
                "Strengths: straightforward, interesting, and relevant content for astro majors.",
                "the course was also organized well. no major weaknesses",
                "Strengths: Exposes students to data science tools in Python (valuable to not only astronomy, but also other fields), good overall pacing, good class size, unique final project that teaches science writing skills.\r\nWeaknesses: Very few. Grading for a few assignments was a bit slow, though this was an unusual semester for all involved. A bit more initial guidance on the requirements for the final TAC project might have also been helpful, though most questions were eventually resolved in one-on-one meetings and over Slack.",
                "The class is jammed packed with information most astrophysics and astronomy majors should know. Both the basics and a lot of the advanced ideas are discussed and you learn a lot from doing the problem sets. Sometimes, I felt the problem sets had ideas that were not discussed fully in class, but going to office hours and getting help from the Professor and TA was extremely helpful.",
                "Strengths: great overview of optical astronomy and introduction to data processing in python. Weaknesses: didn't really cover error\/uncertainties as much as we should have, but this was due to the online format and zoom-exhaustion. Would also have been nice to learn better practices, functions, and more flow control in python to improve our code.",
                "This is a very good course",
                "Its main strength is the enthusiasm and helpful environment created by Prof. Geha. I also really enjoyed how the course gives hands-on experience in python and in scientific writing.",
                "I thought this class was well suited as a virtual lecture, and Prof. Geha did a great job explaining how to break down science research data both theoretically and practically. However, I sometimes felt that the slides and materials in the course were a little vague, which was especially apparent when working on the problem sets. Some fundamental, objective information taught in the class became very vague and confusing when reviewing the slides. Finally, I really thought that the research proposal was a very cool final project to work on, as it gave us valuable insight on the research process that no one really seems to talk about."

Prof Geha met with us one on one, which was super helpful in getting know her, feeling engaged in the class, and actually feeling like I could understand what was going on. Slack was a great tool to stay updated on deadlines and communicate easily with other students in the class. Lectures were synchronous, which was good because that forced staying on track, but if you were having a bad day or something you could keep your camera off and not have to be totally on top of things, which was also good. I think this was a perfect example of physics teaching during a pandemic.",

                "The instructors adapted well to the pandemic situation. They used Slack to communicate with students (extremely helpful) and were responsive to questions. Additionally, the professor was understanding if extensions were needed (transparent extension policy in the syllabus, quick to respond to extension requests, and gave clear announcements to the class if the deadline was changed for all students).",
                "The class had a live lecture, but also had the lectures recorded so students were able to watch later if they could not attend class or were in a different time zone. The class did have a participation grade based on a spreadsheet where you could ask questions you had about that day's lecture.",

I loved the use of slack, it made asking quick and simple questions really easy (like if I saw Prof. Geha at office hours or ran into her), and made it so I didn't feel like I had to write a formal email for every little thing. Also allowed us to see other's questions and work through pset issues.",
                "I think the class was really accomodating for the current environment, especially with getting help in office hours and creating a seminar-like environment where I felt comfortable participating digitally.",
                "I really appreciated how the lectures were recorded, and how Prof. Geha also allowed students to ask questions both during recorded lecture and after she stopped recording, so that their questions would not be saved in the final recordings. It really encouraged us to ask questions. Near the beginning of the course, we needed to prepare questions before class or create some questions after watching the lecture, but I felt that the questions proposed were forced and not very helpful. Because these questions were tied to students names as a way of gauging participation, it was time consuming and often stressful to make sure good questions were asked. Deadlines were also flexible when times were busy, especially in the latter half of the class, which really helped with stress and scheduling."

Additionally, the TAC final project is a unique assignment that teaches students how to improve their science writing skills. Even if a student is not planning on majoring in astronomy or physics, I recommend this course. The non-astronomy\/physics student may occasionally need to do a very small amount of extra reading on their own and\/or ask classmates for help with astronomy concepts, but this does not detract from the course overall, as lectures are quite accessible.",

I  went into this course knowing nothing about coding or python and now feel as if I have a very solid foundation and understanding of how to use it in astronomy.",
                "Absolutely! I believe it is a required course for astro majors (and registration preference is given to sophomore and junior astro majors), but it's a lot of fun and you should try to take it anyway if there's space in the class and you're interested in learning cool (and employable) applications of python or are interested in the process behind making pretty space images :)",
