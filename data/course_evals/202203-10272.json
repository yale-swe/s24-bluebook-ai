                "I learned a lot about how different mental health disorders present in native communities and ways in which Native American mental health has been understudied. I also learned about practices in Native communities and the history of mental health conditions amongst Native Americans and how that relates to the U.S.'s treatment of them.",
                "This course is so incredibly necessary. I learned so much about Native American mental and physical health, such as depression, anxiety, and diabetes. Moreover, I learned about the conditions that contribute to these health concerns and what research has been done to reveal and tackle these concerns.",
                "I learned a lot about Native American history and how it plays a role in mental health. I also really enjoyed the discussions with classmates, with Professor Cutter and Professor Beitel, and the wonderful speakers we had the chance to learn from."

                "I enjoyed the guest speakers!",
                "strength: This was a great course that welcomes people who have no knowledge about the subject! The professors were great at encouraging discussion and helping students express their thoughts\r\nweakness: there was a lot of reading to do but not all readings were discussed in class,",
                "I think the course was good overall, I think that the discussion of cognitive behavioral therapy was extremely helpful in visualizing what mental health counseling looks like. I think more demonstrations would be helpful to better understand other mental health counseling techniques. I also think that the readings were mostly interesting, but they were extremely hard to find in canvas or via google. The readings should also be discussed more in class as sometimes it was unclear how they related to that day's lecture material, and without discussion, I often forgot some of the key concepts they were trying to teach. \r\nThe structure of building a strong final essay was helpful and I thought I gained new skills from doing that assignment. I think meeting with students early on in the semester would be very helpful to give them a game plan on how to tackle the rather big project. I also think that there was pressure to know what you were writing about when we entered the class, but a lot of what we could write about we did not yet discuss in the lecture, so it was hard to know if that was truly something we were interested in. I think that a discussion about what different kinds of papers could be written and what the options are early on would help students who can write good papers but don't know what to write them on.\r\nThe guest lectures were quite fantastic and the people brought in were incredible. I would suggest some short assignments of reading about who the guest lecturer is or what they do before meeting them and bringing a question or two to class to better engage the guest lecturer.",
                "No weaknesses. \r\nStrengths\r\n-engaging\r\n-professors are very considerate of our positions as busy and tired students\r\n-covers a variety of health concerns while giving the history of how these concerns might have worsened\r\n-two professors so diverse opinions \r\n-time goes by quickly\r\n-laminar style that is conducive to discussion \r\n-guest speakers involved in the field",
                "I think a strength of the class was how comfortable the class felt. We were able to ask questions and discuss pretty much anything, which is great because of some of the heavy topics in the class. I do wish that there was a set time for office hours, or maybe a way to sign up for slots."

It's clear they want their students to succeed, and they are willing to do what they can to help their students get to success. The final paper was a strong component of the course and the professors helped students through every step of writing it, so the end product was quite polished.",
