All that I have learned has helped me establish and support my position in prison abolishment. Ive learned to think critically about the systems in place that have actively worked to push and segregated the black population.",

I did every single one of them without feeling overwhelmed and truly enjoyed them. Really liked the symposium aspect as well. \r\n\r\nCan't think of weaknesses!",
                "All the discussions and readings were interesting and relevant to the course subject. However, the course was too heavily focused on discussion. While I understand its a discussion based class, when each class was the same as the last (discussions of the readings) it becomes a routine that can prevent engagement.",
                "I thought that this course was organized well with a good amount of readings for each meeting. Sometimes I felt the readings were a little dense and it would've been helpful to talk about what was being said before talking about why they said it. I thought it was very well organized.",
                "The syllabus for this course was really interesting and engaging. The in class discussion really depends on your class. Of course having things on line was a drawback and made people less engaged then they might normally be.",
                "The syllabus was well organized, but more structure in the course discussions and assignments would have helped students synthesize the information."

            "comments": [
                "Yes. I think everyone should take a course like this that truly reveals how our current institutions are reproductions and continuations of past racist institutions. It really helps you make sense of America's racist history and things that are ongoing today such as mass incarceration, racial profiling, and movements that resist these racist institutions. This class strengthened my prior understanding of systemic racism and white supremacy while teaching me about so many new concepts that I had not quite grasped before.",
                "Yes. It is a great course to begin to understand the position of black people in America. Not only does it explain how the plantations Ghetto and prison were established but how they interacted and connected between each other. A much encouraged course to those who wish to understand the flaws of the prison system.",
                "I would recommend, there is a lot to learn here about institutional and structural racism that I think is important for anyone living in the modern day."
