You learn about memory in theory vs. practice, individual memory vs. collective memory, memory of atrocities/war/violence in really nuanced and insightful ways, with great texts serving as case studies for how memory functions.",

            "comments": [
                "Strength: Prof. Allen is very good at guiding discussion and posing questions. The readings are fascinating. Some of the more theoretical scholarship is a little hard to get through, but Prof. Allen does a very good job of breaking things down during class. Memory studies is also very interesting and very important for historical scholarship.\r\nWeaknesses: The grading is very harsh compared to most other history seminars. The short response papers at the beginning are only two pages each, which I found a little too short to develop my thoughts, and I thought they were graded harder than the research paper. I went to office hours a lot but still found it hard to gauge the expectations on the writing assignments. The papers are all relatively short but I probably spent double or even triple the amount of time I usually would on papers of those lengths. Prof. Allen did give us a chance to submit a revision though, which was nice. Overall, expect the grades to be lower than what you usually get. Cred/D if you don't need it for the major.",
                "Strengths: Professor Allen is an excellent seminar leader. Great balance of argumentation and class participation. The time given to discuss ideas with another class mate is great, and I haven't seen that technique used elsewhere at Yale (across 8 seminars). The material is excellent. The assignments, while significant and intensive, are well-crafted and come together to form an excellent syllabus that demands constant participation. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found the severity of Professor Allen's feedback to be generally helpful, but I can't say I was not saddened at some points. Looking back though, I think this she is one of the few Professors I have ever had who will call bad writing what it is. The feedback can definitely break you out of complacency if you've been enjoying easy A's on papers (with minimal feedback) throughout your academic career and have never actually interrogated your skill or sought to improve.",
                "Strengths: Prof Allen provides great feedback, texts are well chosen which facilitates good conversation, assignments were a nice mix of formal and informal work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None, just be prepared to have many assignments.",
                "Strengths: good topic, good reading list, interesting writing assignments, good discussions, good guidance, et cetera. Overall solid, well-designed, rich course. Weaknesses: Overly inflexible feedback and grading that lacks holistic review. Prof Allen doesn't seem to recognize how being hyper critical could be destructive rather than constructive. Is deep learning and engagement the goal or is it a fixed, unreachable standard of perfection? This isn't clear in the course. Unfortunate thing to have as a takeaway from an otherwise rewarding and already very demanding course.",
                "strengths: Allen encourages you to do high-level work and really commit yourself to assignments. She's an honest (but not unfair) grader, which means you do really need to work to do well. As a result I genuinely cared about the stuff I was turning in and could feel proud of my investment in the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there's a lot of reading and a lot of assignments; it's ultimately manageable but you will probably find yourself skimming or not doing all the reading some weeks. The class is certainly a lot of work so just make sure you can commit to it. Also I would have preferred the research paper to be due during reading week / finals week rather than the week before, I think the timeline's too compressed as it stands.",
                "Prof. Allen is known for her focus on improving writing, but it felt as if that has put pressure on her to always give another thing to \"improve\" on rather than allowing something to just be good. It often felt as if Prof. Allen's comments were given to maintain a critical quota for each paper. While many were helpful, some appeared to have been given for the sake of giving comments. If you feel as if your writing skills need a focused workshop, this class would be ideal. However, if you and your other professors are content with your writing abilities, taking this course for the writing critique would likely be unnecessary self-flagellation. \r\n\r\nThe selected readings, class discussions, and office hours are all excellent.",
                "The course content was highly theoretical and philosophical, which served as an interesting starting point for understanding memory in history, but I often walked away without an understanding of how to apply these theories. The class discussions were typically devoted to summarizing the readings, which I appreciated, but at times, felt limiting.",
                "This is a very well-organized class and everything about it is very intentional. I think because the comments on writing assignments were so extensive, more of a drafting/rewrite process would have been nice, because sometimes it was sad to receive such in-depth comments but I couldn't really implement the feedback. Professor Allen allows one short paper rewrite, which I think is moving in the right direction."

                "If your goal is to grow as a writer and thinker, definitely take this course. Memory is a really tricky, but incredibly important concept in understanding our world, and this course provides a thoughtful, nuanced introduction to memory studies. You are pushed to write insightfully yet clearly as a writer, and think about abstract ideas in both philosophical and concrete terms. It's a challenging class (though it's definitely not impossible to get a good grade), but you'll come out a much stronger thinker.",
                "Yes, if you have a high pain tolerance or you don't really care that you do well in the course. This course makes you work too hard without many chances to see positive results. Partly because there are way too many assignments and the feedback & overall grading is very rigid. I've seen it cause burnout and indifference in some students. Sad to see how a course that seems so promising can weigh down students' confidence and encouragement in pursuing a topic that many find very interesting.",
                "Yes definitely. if you're at all interested in how societies remember painful pasts, how memory of particular events becomes untrue or non-factual or just changes over time, it's a fantastic course. One of my favorites I've taken at Yale and great for anyone curious about how history is recorded and recalled, what it means to remember something, to honor victims of a crime, etc.",
                "The course would serve as a strong starting point for reading highly theoretical texts, but I felt like I was writing to adhere to the instructor's standards rather than to explore ideas and engage with the material in a way that was interesting to me (though I am sure other students felt differently and connected in a more personal way than I did). If students are interested in a theoretical background for memory studies, I would recommend the course, but I wonder if the course could incentivize students to grow rather than to write and read in a highly particular way that, to me, felt restrictive.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course to other history majors because I find the topic of memory and memory politics to be fundamental to the study of history in general, and the topics you learn in this class are easily applicable to anything you study within the discipline. That being said, this class is a lot of work, and sometimes the feedback you get on your writing is harsh, so if you take this class, you should definitely be able to dedicate a lot of time and energy to it, otherwise it will be easy to fall behind."
