It's clear that Hodgson has a deep passion for the topic and is very knowledgeable about all things internet markets related. I think the class did have trouble engaging some of my peers but that might be because it's a senior seminar so it's the fault of students rather than the professor, who seemed like he was well-meaning and wanted more participation from us",
