A great primer if you're in need of a basic understanding of doctrinal differences in Islam, or contemporary theological debates, or a canon course of Islamic history. I liken this (and I know it will merit some groans amongst people) to the historical and political thought section of Directed Studies, except this class actually takes care to discuss a canon that is well-made and actually makes sense given the context of the subject it talks about."

                "In general, I thought this course was incredibly strong. It was always engaging and interesting, which I was initially skeptical about because I had never taken a theology, religious studies, or philosophy course. This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. However, I have two points of criticisms. First, I felt it was a little jarring for the last couple of weeks of school when we jumped from discussing Islamic theologians and philosophers from the 1200s to modern Islamist thinkers from the twentieth century. I think it would have been better if we had an acknowledgment or a deeper conversation as to why the professor decided to skip over hundreds of years of history. However, I don't think this fundamentally detracted from the course or the material. Secondly, I was disheartened and somewhat peeved at the fact that we had both a final paper and a final exam. Especially in the era of COVID-19, tackling both assignments was incredibly stressful and felt, on a whole, pointless. Working on one assignment took time away from studying for the other, and having both, in reality, felt unnecessary. This course was so great, but the added unnecessary stress and work at the end of the semester to tackle 2 finals for one course (when most other courses have 1) felt like a slap in the face. I really hope Professor Griffel reconsiders having both, as it frustrated me, even though I had spent the semester believing this was my favorite course. I enjoyed writing the essay because it helped me dive deeper into a theologian in a way that would not be allowed within normal class time in the semester but studying for a semester's worth of material after physically drained me.",
                "I am very satisfied with the course and I really learnt a lot from it.",
                "Strengths: Professor was fantastic and is the foremost al-Ghazali scholar; lectures were superb; TAs were super nice and responsive; Professor Griffel took the time to cater this class to Zoom; and he's a nerd too and it's wonderful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't have much here; class goes a bit fast, but that's par for the course with a survey canon class."

                "I appreciate Professor Griffel offering in-person lectures once a week; they were refreshing in that I was able to interact with a professor in person and engage with the class in a way online classes do not allow. However, I would say that I would have preferred the professor to be a little more strict or at least more explicit about the testing protocol for those engaging in in-person learning. As an undergraduate student, I was mandated to get COVID tested twice a week, whereas graduate students voluntarily test themselves whenever they want. Moreover, we had an auditor in the class of who I received no information about her testing regimen. Though I abstained from attending in-person several times for fear of spreading or catching the coronavirus, I would have appreciated if Professor Griffel had inquired about our test results or had stated that we would only be able to attend in-person class if we were tested regularly or at least before the class.",
                "I think the overall mode of learning is great and I can't think of any improvement to be made.",
                "Success: We did half of the class online and half in person, and the in-person part was superb (and the online was great too). Because the class is a lot of lecture it went quite smoothly. And Professor Griffel is very good at keeping people engaged in my opinion. \r\n\r\nImproved: maybe our TA session. I think this is an across the board fix, though; our TA was wonderful nonetheless."

                "I cannot recommend this course highly enough to anyone seeking to understand the Middle East or gain a have grasp of the region. The information was digestible, Professor Griffel is an incredibly talented and engaging professor, and the material single-handedly synthesized my pre-existing knowledge of the Middle East. This course should be a core requirement for all MMES\/NELC majors because it is so foundational yet so easily understood. Everything I learned was not only interesting and incredibly new to me, but it underscored everything I had previously learned about the Middle East's history and politics. I cannot stress enough both how great and necessary this course is for any one seeking to study Islam or the Middle East.",

                "Duh. Take this course; it's wonderful. Not only do you learn about a canon that few people really have a good grasp of, but you do so with one of the foremost al-Ghazali scholars in the world (you'll learn who he is if you don't know when you take this class). I came in knowing almost nothing about Islamic theology and philosophy, and came out knowing a ton (I have a lot to learn). I can't speak to people who come in knowing more than me, but it seemed that my classmates at that level also came away with a lot from the class."
