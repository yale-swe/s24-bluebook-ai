                "This course covers all of the material in great detail, but problem sets can be unnecessarily long, and we receive extra long problem sets when we have breaks, which can be stressful. However, I appreciated the organized structure of lectures and I liked the choice of textbook for this course.",
                "- Allow lectures to have more interactive elements\r\n- More sketches of proofs so that we can get to more",
                "The main weakness of the course is twofold: first, the material of the course was a little abstract, and could have benefited from more geometric applications, second, the Professor could have motivated the course with more discussions of the uses of mathematical concepts.",
                "Strengths: Raja, the TF. Weaknesses: This class was probably no different in difficulty than 226 and made me want to pull my hair out regularly. Teaching was okay, but not great, and psets regularly involved concepts we hadn't learned or got to on Monday/Wednesday of the same week (due Thursday).",
                "Strengths\r\n- proof writing workshops and the ULAs were so so helpful especially as someone who did not do competitive math\r\n- lots of office hours\r\n- pablo was funny at times\r\n- engaging lecture, not in terms of the lecture being more of a discussion but moreso it being easy to follow along\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- psets felt like busy work sometimes. especially after the second midterm, when Pablo gave a pset that was twice as long as usual to do over break, that was not very nice. however the psets help greatly for studying and understanding concepts and you are encouraged to work with people so yeah",
                "Weakness: No slides/lecture recordings/files posted which would be helpful to review. Very late grading; last 3 Psets were not graded, and would've helped a lot with studying for the final.",
                "Challenging material and very informative lectures.",
                "Strength: found office hours/TAs to be helpful\r\nWeaknesses: very fast paced, difficult problem sets and exams, harsh grading on exams, especially difficult final exam",
                "The course did a great job of taking students with no proof writing experience and making them at least proficient at writing proofs. I found the weekly assignments to be needlessly challenging however, with some of them taking over 15 - 20 hours to complete. I don't feel as if the extra-long assignments appreciably improved my understanding of the material.",
                "I feel I learned more about proofs than linear algebra. I wish we got to see more examples in class of the applications.",
                "I feel I developed a strong understanding of the course. Lectures were hard to follow because of the speed of the lecture, but the professor was very good at explaining the concepts in a one on one situation.",
                "Strengths: The exams and their grading were quite fair. More importantly, the ULAs were the main strength of this course. When everything was dark, they were the light. They were so helpful and also funny and cool. We built a community fueled by suffering and commiseration during the ULA office hours. I love you Noam and Raja. \r\nWeaknesses: Where do I even start. The pace of the lectures was quite brisk. It was difficult to take notes or even follow what was going on. The few days when we had substitute lecturers, I was able to follow and understand the material much better. Additionally, the PSETS for this class were a living hell. They were incredibly difficult and it was virtually impossible to complete them without help. Even with office hours, I averaged around 15 hours on each weekly PSET which was fairly normal for this class. Lastly, it oftentimes took several weeks or even months to receive grades on PSETS and the feedback was generally very limited.",
                "Strengths: The TAs and people running office hours were generally excellent. Weaknesses: The lectures were difficult to follow. The professor seemed inexperienced as a teacher, however brilliant he may be. The problem sets were not just long & difficult but practically impossible to do on one's own. The office hours for the professor, TAs, and peer tutors were always swamped.",
                "This course offered a lot of opportunities to learn the basics of proof writing. However, as more questions became application based, it would have been better to have more application-based examples in the earlier material.",
                "Weakness: The professor was not the best, especially the way he structured the course and how he taught certain stuff out of order. The ULA and TA during office hours were not helpful at all\r\nStrengths: The course is ok",
                "A bit fast paced especially as a first year, I didn't really understand the materially wholly at the start and that hindered my progress because everything builds on itself",
                "The course focuses a lot on abstract objects within linear algebra. I would only suggest exposure to more concrete applications.",
                "The ULAs were tremendously helpful, conducting each session with patience, enthusiasm, and encouragement.",
                "While the course tries to teach the foundation of proof writing at the very beginning and then works up to the actual content of linear algebra I feel it struggles in making that transition. This is why the first 3-4 weeks of the course feels like you're in a roller coaster that is out of control. Once you do get the hang of it and things settle down around week 5-6 then it starts to lighten up and start to click more (at least for me). I think if there was a clearer message on what we were trying to achieve before we started each new topic it wouldn't have felt this way. Finally, while the point of this class is to stay in the abstract realm of math instead of limiting it to what we already know it would have been nice to have some concrete examples and visuals. Once I did my own research and developed some visual intuition to what was actually being talked about things started to click a lot more.",

                "Not for non-math majors. For reference, I am an astro major. I took this course for the proofwriting knowledge. Just take a logic or philosophy course instead. It's similar enough. Past that, the proofwriting got in the way of learning how to actually use linear algebra. I wouldn't necessarily recommend against it, but I absolutely would not actively recommend it. Strongly consider 222 instead (but I haven't taken 222 so I could be very wrong; \\_()_/ ).",
                "Take 222, for the love of God. Or take 225 with someone other than Pablo.",

The PSETs were absurdly challenging at times and often included topics that were much more advanced than what was ever mentioned in class (I.e the Vandermonde matrix). The class was entirely proof based but the exams were mostly computational (which we never practiced in class). Waste of time and effort if youre not planning on pursuing more pure math.",
                "Great class for learning how to write proofs. Familiarity with vectors and basic matrix multiplication/addition is pretty helpful",

You will find 222 much easier and more familiar, and probably come out of the class with a better understanding of how to apply the results of linear algebra to areas you are interested in. Only take 225 if you are genuinely excited about learning the proofs, and are willing to devote significant time to it.",

                "yes, professor was very good, problem sets were challenging but not too challenging and prepared me well for the exams",
                "Yes, but not with this professor.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this to any mathematics-focused student. If a student likes theory and proof-writing, this will be a good course. Although, I would suggest somewhat familiarity with linear algebra beforehand (at least with the tools for problem-solving), like matrices and vector spaces.",
                "If you're not interested in abstract math and proof writing and see no interest in the theoretical side of math then probably not. If that does intrigue you but you don't feel like changing your entire view on math and developing a new way of thinking about then I would still not entirely recommend it. If after all that you're still interested and what was mentioned excites you then yes I do recommend it. I found the content very interesting coming from a Mechanical Engineering as I've never seen math like this and probably won't see it again. My more applied view point made this class much harder than it needed to be and I had a really tough time getting my bearings but this was still one of my favorite classes just because of how different it is to what I've seen. That being said it is not for everyone and maybe I should've dropped it when I had the chance so do be weary if you're taking this course for fun. If you're not and its a requirement then look up 3Blue1Brown on YouTube and I'm sure you'll be fine... probably.",
