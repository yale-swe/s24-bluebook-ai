                "I learned how to write for the entire orchestra - strings, winds, brass, and percussion, mainly through scoring the works of composers past, though one also has the option to orchestrate their own composition for the final project.",
                "I learned a lot about individual instruments like their range and colors, and I also learned how to use Finale in the process of doing my assignments. I also learned how to balance instrumentation to make the orchestrations that I wanted which is something I had never thought of doing before.",
                "This class taught me not only the unique sounds of each instrument and their capabilities, but also how to think about a composition in terms of what should be heard most clearly, and how to combine instrument pairings. I learned how to use the program Finale and a bit of Dorico.",
                "How to score for specific instruments, make big orchestrations, and what specificities go into each instrument.",
                "I learned how to score small pieces for full symphony orchestra.",
                "I learned so much about both instrumentation and orchestration in this course. Professor As structure is incredibly helpful to learning this material. I not only learned how to orchestrate, but learned about every instrument and category of instrument. In addition to instrument ranges, I found learning about the techniques of instruments to be very beneficial."

            "comments": [
                "The biggest reason to take this course is to get feedback from the TFs. Ben Webster was super great to work with, his kindness and experience made this class worth taking. There are two big weaknesses in this course: the restrictiveness of the assignments and the lectures. Having to cover multiple octaves for every instrument in the orchestra in a 14 bar excerpt is insane, and isn't how any good orchestrator would actually do things. I think instead we should be allowed to pick specific instruments to focus on for each project. The lectures are basically useless, since it's just Dr. A. reading from the textbook. Such a wasted opportunity when instead we could be doing deep dives into great pieces. I would've learned a lot more from this class if we'd spent the whole semester studying Jeu, Pictures at an Exhibition, for example.",
                "Strengths: get to work on really fun orchestration projects that you get really invested in + weekly labs in which you have chances for 1-1 feedback and learning directly from peers. Also Dr. A is great!! Weaknesses: maybe I'm just used to the absolute freedom of comp seminars, but I would have loved to have another free-choice project (even if smaller scale) just to be able to work on something that I'm specifically interested in in addition to the Bartok/Menotti/Debussy excerpts. Would have also been interesting to talk about how orchestration has changed over the years, and especially modern orchestration! (We did talk about extended techniques, but would love to have talked more about each instrument's specific role, how non-classical genres are challenging traditional roles, etc.) Note this weakness section is less a weakness section and more a \"I wish we had more time to talk about these things\" section.. the class itself was super enjoyable",
                "The projects for the class started off more restrictive and then opened up at the end. Our last project was basically open-ended and it was a lot of fun. The weekly lab acts more like an office hour, where we get a chance to work on our project and ask questions if need be, but usually, it wasn't very structured. For this reason, I think the class might be better if the lab was shorter or maybe optional, since it was very useful some weeks and not so usual other weeks when I was already finished with my current assignment.",
                "Strengths: Almost everything about this class is great! Dr. A, the TA's, the assignments, and the techniques that we did learn in class were all enormously helpful. Seriously, if you're interested in this class, I strongly recommend you take it!\r\nWeaknesses: This is just my personal preference, but I wish we talked more about the nuances of orchestration - namely, how orchestrate in the style of classical-era composers, compared to romantic-era, modern-era, and film scorers. Additionally, while most of the quizzes were quite reasonable, the quiz on brass was much harder than the rest! I hope this differential in difficulty is less pronounced in the future.",
                "It's really fun if you make it fun and enjoy what you have to do. A weakness might just be that it takes a little while to get feedback on assignments and sometimes it's a little stressful when a scoring project is due. You definitely have to spread out times or find when you're most creative to work on bits and pieces of you orchestrated piece, but I loved it nonetheless.",
                "I really appreciated the organization of this course and the small class size. My only recommendation would be that it could be nice to meet twice a week, for a shorter time period so that we could have more days during the week when we were building our skills. I think that this class which is so focused on listening, could benefit from a multiple days a week format.",
                "This is a great skill course for any musician. It allows you to gain respect for instruments in an orchestra, learning how to write with a knowledge of how the instrument works. The final project is a great opportunity to do what you want with the material. I feel like a much more professional and better musician and composer!",
                "Strengths: super fun projects; everyone in the class seemed to be an accomplished musician, meaning we were able to get a lot done and explore complex ideas\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the 2-hour weekly seminar, I think, could have been more engaging as a 1 hour class twice a week."

                "I'd hesitate to recommend this course. While I enjoyed my discussion section a lot, I would've rather not gone to almost all of the lectures. 90% of the content was just in the textbook, and Dr. A's teaching style didn't help. I think she's really nice one-on-one, but in the classroom she emphasizes students she already knows in a way that made it a very uncomfortable experience for me. In a space that was for people of all experience levels, choosing the same people (who were also mostly male, adding to my discomfort in a class that had an overall 50/50 gender ratio) to call on and present made me feel insecure and unwelcome, even though I wasn't inexperienced. If that's not going to bother you and you're fine with doing projects that require you to essentially orchestrate via a checklist, go ahead.",
                "YES! If you're interested in orchestration and learning about the ranges/timbres of each instrument in the orchestra and how to pair instruments/write for large ensembles, this class is for you!! You really, really get to practice doing these things via the four scoring projects, and labs are a great time to get 1-1 feedback from the TA.",
                "Absolutely, but if you have no experience with orchestration or at least working in notation software it could be very daunting.",
                "Anyone interested in music composition, orchestration, or arrangement should take this course! This workload and grading is really reasonable, and you learn quite a lot!",
                "I would recommend this course if you're ready to be creative. So much thought goes into your assignments but they're all really fun.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants to get started on composition or build their composition skills through a deeper understanding of the capabilities of each instrument. Dr. A, Jack, Ben and Sasha were all so willing to help answer any questions that came up and fostered a really supportive creative environment.",
                "Yes! Take this course if you want to learn how to orchestrate well. It will take some time though.",
                "Yes! Very fun advanced music course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in orchestration. It is a such an incredible foundation for orchestrating. Dr. A is very thorough and makes sure to provide orchestration information for all instruments. Not only do the assignments encourage the usage of various instruments, they often require the use of specific instruments. This is super beneficial in making us learn how various instruments orchestrate. Every assignment was returned with thorough feedback, that I found incredibly beneficial."
