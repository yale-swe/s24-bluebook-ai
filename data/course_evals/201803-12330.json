    "There was lot of material covered in the class. I have never been in a class where all of the core material and all of the additional topics, depending on student interest, that were in the syllabus were covered. This included the standard theory of sigma algebras, measure, measure spaces, probability spaces, integration of measure spaces, L_p spaces and norms, functionals, the Riesz representation theorem, and the Radon-Nikodym Theorem. \r\n\r\nAdditional topics were the Banach-Tarski paradox, the weak-* topology and the Banach-Alaoglu theorem, the Haar measure on topological groups, amenable groups, and martingales.",
    "A greater understanding of Analysis and Measure Theory. After taking Math 305, this was a great class to continue with Arie. Many results about the lebesgue measure were extended onto general topological spaces especially locally compact Hausdorff ones."

   "comments": [
    "The course did a great job of covering a vast array of material in short periods of time. However, the downside of this was that come the final exam, there was a lot to study with little direction as to what would be on the exam. It was almost as if one got lucky on the exam by having studied the correct material. This was especially troubling given that the final exam was worth 65% of the grade, while problem sets were graded on completion because there was no grader.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I finished the course feeling like I learned a great deal of material that I would not have learned elsewhere! Furthermore, the problem sets were very fun and a good level of difficulty.",
    "Strengths were the intuition and clarity of the presentation by Arie Levit. I felt particularly interested in the intuition set by Professor Levit. A perceived weakness was the lack of resources for the class. There was not a grader for the class and only one exam. Grades aside, the material was wonderful."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is interested in pursuing graduate-level analysis. It is a good introduction to some topics in analysis at a graduate level.",
    "Yes especially after Math 305, it clarifies and expands upon that knowledge."
