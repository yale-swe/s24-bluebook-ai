I learned a lot about how charter schools operate, what it's like to cover the DoE, and got to hear from and speak with a number of incredible education journalists working in the field.",

I would also say that this course broadened my understanding of reporting of a 'bread and butter' topic like education and reframed it as a more experimental subject in my mind.",

                "Strengths: Great readings and fantastic discussions (Karr asks great questions, always comes prepared, and guides incredible conversations with guest speakers), challenging but manageable assignments and deadlines, wonderful feedback and revisions. The readings were super interesting. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Karr is often brutal but has a huge commitment to making sure that you succeed.",
                "Strengths - good group of students, thorough feedback from professor on writing\r\nWeaknesses - work comes in spurts, sometimes heavier workload sometimes lighter workload.",
                "The assignments were great, as was the peer editing process. We could have discussed the readings more in seminars, as I enjoyed doing them outside of class. To incentivize people doing the readings, fewer readings could be assigned so we could go in depth on what we do tackle.",
                "Consistent and timely feedback from Prof. Karr on assignments, explored topics that I wouldn't have otherwise.",
                "The course was good in its very defined, predictable structurewe always wrote rough drafts, submitted them, and then worked on our final drafts based on professor and peer edits. This was a good format, as it allowed me to see how I was progressing in the course, and the peer\/professor edits were inevitably great. The class setting was not as welcoming as other zoom seminars courses I attended, though this was at least in part bc of the virtual format.",
                "Strengths: Real journalism experience. We actually got to choose our own topics for each paper (an op-ed, explanatory article, and long-form feature) and then interviewed experts.\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of rubric!",
                "Professor Karr is very attentive and we took time to workshop each student's ideas and pieces before we wrote final drafts, so those were all strengths. I think the only issue I had with the class is that I would have preferred we read more local journalism and fewer New York Times pieces, because while I respect the Times and its work, other voices would have been appreciated."

                "Meeting more than once a week would be helpful, since I assume the 2hr slot was in place for travel to New Haven. But the content is so interesting and there is a wide variety of readings per lesson that could be better addressed with a few days to acts as buffer for thinking instead of the 5 minute break to mitigate Zoom fatigue in the middle of the two hours."

You will get a wonderful opportunity to research subjects of your choosing, receive great feedback, and build your skills as a writer. Especially with interviews and readings, the class may require more dedication than some other classes, but much of that is dependent on how much effort you want to put into it.",

                "I would recommend the course to students who want  a good inside look into the world of journalism because they are interested in journalism, or to students who are interested in education studies. I would not recommend the course to students who are interested in writing and see the course as a way to flesh-out their writing skillsit teaches more about the thinking, story-chasing, and knowledge behind education reporting than the writing itself.",
                "Yes. If you've never done journalism before, this is a GREAT way to start. The education beat itself is very lively, and it was amazing to hear from prominent education journalists and authors about their own experiences.",
