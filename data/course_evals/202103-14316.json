                "I learned how to closely read dense and often obscure texts, as well as draw connections across various works.",
                "I learned to read closely by analyzing similes in ancient texts that evoke certain universal themes. I also had the opportunity to find connections between multiple texts that build on the same literary tradition.",
                "I improved my skills in reading literature closely, reading literature quickly, and discussing literature productively. I now have an intimate acquaintance with so many of the defining works of the Western intellectual tradition, from Homer to the Gospel of Matthew.",
                "This was an incredibly formative class in which we were taught of the finer complexities of close reading and intentional writing, through working with some of the most formative Western texts.",
                "I not only learned about the content of the books we read, but I also learned how to really analyze a piece of text and draw meaning from it.",
                "I think the readings for Literature were by far the most joyful of DS readings. It was semester of stories, but closely read and contemplated. I learnt about the nuances of translation, how to recognise literary themes, and trace motifs across passages, all while reading some super cool books.",
                "I learned how to participate in seminar discussions and close-read classical texts for analysis of theme, language, and storytelling at a higher level.",
                "This course challenged me to see how small details in a text can carry immense meaning, not only within that one literary work, but for all those which come after it. The discussions in class, the writing of the essays, and the professor herself taught me how to look for these significant details with a new eye, and enabled me to see the layers of significance in the patterns and references across all the works we examined that I would not have before. My writing and analytical skills were significantly sharpened, and I noticeably developed my ability to make cohesive, complex, detailed arguments and observations about the texts we studied."

            "comments": [
                "A weakness is that we were often told to read entire works, but not given much direction as to what to look for or certain passages of note, making it sometimes overwhelming to sift through an entire book looking for significant passages.",
                "The course challenges us to synthesize our ideas about a large amount of reading in brief comments that contribute to a class discussion. It introduces us to a variety of authors who are essential to understanding our cultural, political, and economic heritage. The choice of texts is excellent and feels complete. The main weakness emerged during the lectures. Some professors spent the majority of their time discussing obscure elements of the text which will not necessarily be useful for students who do not major in a literary discipline. This was especially the case in the literature track, where I would have appreciated more interdisciplinary extensions.",
                "This class revolved primarily around discussions in class, which were always appropriately engaging and enlightening. This course offers a fabulously rich dive into many foundational texts.",
                "As quite literally the only female author we read in the fall term of DS, Sappho should definitely have been given some more time to be explored. Other than that I really enjoyed it.",
                "Strengths: brevity, depth and structure of course i.e. discussion sections and lecture\r\nWeaknesses: at times, the sacrifice of depth for covering the texts quickly - especially Dante",
                "Strengths: discussions were well-structured and the readings were relatively varied in genre. It is clear that Prof. LeVen loves teaching and genuinely cares for her students. She is always willing to meet with students, and provided extremely detailed feedback on our papers to help us improve. \r\nWeaknesses: As is the case with all the DS courses, sometimes the weekly readings were a bit too long and I found myself having to skim them. For literature especially, this is an issue because so much of the class is focused on analyzing textual features/stylistic devices.",
                "I thought the syllabus was really well organized and the exploration of the connections between the texts was really well-done. I thought the volume of reading outweighed that of the other DS courses to the point of being unmanageable at times.",
                "This course was very well structured, in terms of the order of the texts and the specific texts that were selected. It was clear how each reading fit into the chronological narratives, and the ways in which we studied them enabled me to build upon existing skills and develop new ways to interact with literature. All the lectures were particularly a highlight of this course, as they always offered new and fascinating insights into the texts which bolstered my understanding of the readings, as well as offered challenging complexity."

                "Yes. Professor LeVen is a goddess.",
                "It is impossible to recommend this course individually since it comes with other DS courses but in my opinion it felt the most detached from the DS curriculum. Historical and Political Thought overlapped frequently with Philosophy in intriguing, engaging ways whereas literature sometimes felt like it was floating separately from the other two tracks until the end of the semester. When reading the Greek tragedies, I struggled to find connections to my other classes since they are so heavy in mythology. Other readings like the Aeneid and the Inferno, however, accomplished this task.",
                "I would recommend this to every student who loves reading; this class will let them do so much of that, and do it of some of the most monumental texts in history--texts forming the foundation of so much of our cultural consciousness.",
                "Directed Studies is an extraordinary opportunity to discover an incredible host of texts with some of the brightest minds around.",
                "If they felt they were a good fit for DS, yes.",
                "Sure, especially if you're NEW to the Western canon (internationals from non Western countries who like reading and writing, CONSIDER DS - it kinda needs you!!). As long as you can keep up with the reading I totally recommend. Also, Lit papers are the funnest.",
                "I would recommend it to any student with an interest in the humanities, social sciences and Directed Studies. I would not recommend it for STEM students as for those I have spoken to so far it costs them too much in time and courses.",
                "Yes. This course provides an excellent foundation for the years to come, as I have no doubt that most of the works we study are covered in other writing and literature courses at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. I thought it was really interesting and a lovely introduction to classical literature.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The readings are all incredibly engaging, and carry a lot of significance in works of literature written after them. It is a genuinely fascinating experience to enter and explore this world with peers and a professor who always offered helpful and interesting inputs on how to approach the text, and what to look for in analysis. The workload is demanding, but is definitely worth it, and I came out of this course with a new appreciation for these foundational works."
