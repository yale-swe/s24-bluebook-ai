I also gained a greater appreciation for the technical aspects for both media. The variety of course readings helped me to synthesize historical perspectives, literary tropes and broader philosophical discourse in analyzing individual art objects.

                "The strengths were the discussions. Usually I get bored with open discussions but the student presentations were awesome and we got really luck with a great group so every person's contributions were interesting and additive. The readings are dense and there are a lot of them but if you engage with them you will learn a ton. There are not many assignments and they are all manageable but they take a lot of thought and engagement. I would not say that this class is easy at all so do not take it if you are not willing to put in the work. One other weakness is that there were weakly practicums that required a lot of time and energy and then we never talked about them.",
                "A definite strength of the course is the variety of readings, which included Classical poetry, book chapters, research papers and contemporary reportage. Each week presented several approaches to the discussion theme, so I was always engaged with at least one of the readings, which were relatively atomic and easy to critique individually. Another strength was the student presentations to introduce the seminar, which anchored discussion around specific objects that, as a whole, gave a lot of variety and individuality week-to-week.\r\nOne weakness was the lack of interactivity for the weekly practicums. I found the weeks with structured peeer-to-peer feedback to be the most engaging.",
                "I loved the weekly module assignments. I feel like everyone put so much thought into them and so I wish there was more of an opportunity to discuss them in class. Really engaging and helpful readings. I think at times, there was a lot of work with the modules, essays, readings, and presentations -- mostly because the modules often took more time than expected and some of the readings were challenging (in a good way) and so required re-reading."

                "Having a slightly shorter seminar meeting period was definitely helpful. The discussions were compact yet insightful, without feeling unfinished. \r\nOne of the biggest disappointments of course was not being able to see the art objects in person. The \"virtual in-person\" session to view prints at the Arts Library was awkward at first, but gave a much better intuition on the scale and tactility of the folios in discussion.",

                "I would recommend it to a student who wants to engage with the material and has the time that the class will require. Professor Fiduccia is truly one of the smartest people I have ever gotten to meet and she will expect you to have thoughtful comments. The readings are long and often dense but rewarding if you give them the time they deserve. You will see art in a whole new way and you will be challenged to think deeply about it. I would say definitely take it if you have some art history background and you know that it will require a good deal of time.",
                "This was a delightful course that well balances contemporary critiques and historical reexamination of photography and sculpture. There were plenty of avenues to broader themes in aesthetics, as well as interesting literary connections. Some of the photographs and sculptures discussed or covered in readings are well-known, but there were also photographic (or other imaging) devices that I encountered for the first time. Although the source materials for the course are quite rich and wide-ranging, discussions were focused and grounded thanks to the student introductions that brought specific objects to discuss. A good balance between breadth, depth and purpose.",
                "Yes, somehow we touched on so many different subjects without them feeling disconnected. I think all of us were pushed to think outside the box."
