Really interesting poetry from both East & West. Weaknesses: felt like we read a lot of poems to only discuss a few, but the poems were good so still personally fulfilling",

My only note for improvement might be to change the amount of reading we had each week and/or how it was approached during class-time, as we often looked so closely at certain poems and did not have time to cover everything we had read."

He is so passionate about the material, and is able to communicate this passion in such an exceptional manner, that you cannot help but feel inspired yourself. The class discussions are so vibrant and the course reading is just so wonderfully chosen as well.",
