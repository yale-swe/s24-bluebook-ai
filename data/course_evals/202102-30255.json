                "Despite the course being over Zoom, Anna and Deborah (the instructors) took the time to get to know each of us, and used breakout rooms a lot so that we would get to know the other students in the class as well. They made sure we understood each of the grammar sections before moving on.\r\n\r\nIt might have been nice to get to read stories or other texts outside of the textbook, but this isn't a big deal.",
                "The speaking practice is wonderful, better than any foreign language course I have ever taken. The instructors (Anna and Deborah) are intelligent, funny, kind, and extremely helpful. As an intensive class, it feels good to be really immersed in the language and cultureI think it is a much more efficient method of learning compared to taking 3-4 other classes in English at the same time.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is difficult in five weeks to really internalize so much vocab, as well as other material. It can become a game of only focusing on the most recent material at the cost of the material learned a week or two ago. I am sure that a dedicated student can overcome this by taking lots of notes and frequently recopying them. The hardest aspect of the course, however, were exam daystaking an exam, writing a presentation, recording a presentation, and editing and uploading it all before midnight is a lot for one day.",
                "it was great even over a virtual format. deborah and anna are both really amazing, I love how deborah uses the chat on zoom to show u words while we talk and anna does lots of fun kahoots. This class is such a pleasant experience",
                "This is a great course that introduces you to the Italian language. Everything is well-explained and there are enough practices to help you understand. There are also various activities through which one can understand the Italian culture.",
                "course was very fast paced",
                "The class covers a lot of material which is great but often times does not go back to review past content. Obviously, since the class is condensed, there is less time to do so, but sometimes when it comes to topics that can be easily mixed up such as conditional tenses or pronouns, it can get confusing.",
