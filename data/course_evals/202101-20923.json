                "This course really helped me gain a stronger foundation in Japanese and helped me build on it, however, there were many times were the workload was overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: NISHIMURA SENSEI!! She is so amazing. She was so flexible and willing to go out of her way to help students, even meeting outside her office hours if we had any questions. She also adapted to the virtual format really well, and managed to keep the class engaging. Weaknesses: This class is quite a lot of work, significantly more than L3. There is a lot of kanji, vocabulary, and grammar, and sometimes it is difficult to retain all the information we learn.",
                "Strengths: Teacher is fun and engaging; The syllabus was easy to follow and content was easy to review; Breakout rooms discussions were fun and helped improve speaking alot.\r\nWeaknesses: The homework assignments were often dull, some more creative freedom within assignments would make homework feel less like a chore.",
                "I love this course and really appreciate the contribution of our lecturer to combine different forms of teaching. I hope we can spend more time in the class to go over the grammars. The quality of practices in break-out rooms are not very high, because the mistakes could not be spotted by the teacher who is busy visiting different break-out rooms. Also, the part about pronunciation is a little bit difficult for me. As I'm still trying to learn the basic grammars, it is hard to consider the pronunciations as well. And it would be great if we can have more reviewing practices and summaries led by the teacher in class, especially before tests. \r\n\r\nI also think that practices of translating can be very beneficial. Our practices in class and for homework were highly focused on talking/writing with our own examples. But sometimes it is hard to think of our own examples, and translating would be much more convenient to master the grammar and usage of words."

                "This class was so great on a virtual format. Sensei made us use the breakout room throughout class so that we could practice both grammar structures and using vocabulary with our classmates. It was a great way also to get to know our classmates, despite being virtual.",
                "Breakout rooms were great for practicing speaking, the 1 on 1 time with other students combined with the small class size let us get comforgtable enough with one another that we could speak without any nervousness so the iconic question of, 'if 2 students are alone in a breakout room do they make any sound?' could always be answered with a yes in Japanese class.\r\n On the other hand breakout rooms make it hard to ask the teacher question...",
                "I think the tasks were too much for a virtual class. And the amount of homework was not stable. Sometimes I spent 3 hours doing homework for a single day. As a result, I had little time left to do the reviewing work by myself."

                "Absolutely! Nishimura sensei is a real gem. She was always so supportive and enthusiastic, which made our daily seminar always fun and interesting. Considering how difficult this past semester was, Nishimura sensei adapted to the online format really well and tried to make it as engaging as possible for us. I honestly don't think she could do anything to improve. She's the best!!",
                "If you got through JAPN 130 you can get through this course; the format of things is mostly the same but I'd say the workload is higher (not ridiculously so but you'll definitely notice that you spend more time of homework than in 130). Overall, I'd say that JAPN140 was my most work heavy course this semester and honestly the mandatory once a week 'language clinic' (essentially a 1-on-1 discussion section with a peer tutor) was rubbing salt in the wound. Basically if you like Japanese and want to continue the track, take it, even if the workload annoys you the teachers are pleasant enough that you'll get though it. That said I can only strongly recommend it if you're super enthusiastic about Japanese. The content isn't necessarily hard but the volume really is tiring. . . In fact because of the fast pace you'll probably forget noticeably more from this course then you did in 130. \r\nTLDR: If you like Japanese and spending around 1.5 hours per day on JAPN homework an=long with the daily classes and mandatory discussion section then, then have fun. If that sounds like a-lot, then maybe don't take it, or at least don't take it in 5.5 course load like I did. I was practically banging my head against the wall by the end of the semester.",
