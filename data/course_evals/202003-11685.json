                "Strengths: the mastery-based format of this course allows you to engage a lot with the material, and it is easy to find places where you need to improve. You get multiple attempts on all assignments, which lets you learn from your mistakes and gives sufficient opportunities to catch up on material. Weaknesses: feedback took a long time toward the beginning of the course, so the mastery-based learning system was difficult to understand, but this cleared up toward the second-half. This class felt a little too easy at times since we are given so many attempts on quizzes.",
                "In general, the \"mastery\" system was good because we got multiple opportunities to show we mastered a skill\/subject. However, towards the end it became more difficult because there were fewer opportunities as the material got harder. We started off the year having to get double mastery in 4 attempts but at the end, we only had 2 opportunities to gain single mastery. I also didn't like the flipped class format (where we learned the material on our own and then practiced during class). We didn't really go over the material in class so classes were basically just working on problems (either as a group or in breakout rooms).",
                "A strength of this course was the pre-class assignments and quizzes that ensured you watched the material before lectures. This system was effective so students came to class with questions already in mind. A weakness was the uncertainty throughout the entire semester about the nontraditional, mastery-based grading system. While I enjoyed having this grading system, the professors were unclear at the beginning of the semester and it was difficult to adjust to this structure.",
                "I really like the grading system. Mastery can be easily tracked on Canvas and all work was accessible.",
                "The professor (Malinovitch) taught things that were tangentially related to the things we were actually being taught in class. His worksheet problems only confused us more.",
                "Strengths: Good amount of time alloted to complete assignments. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Messy grading system. It was confusing to evaluate how i was doing and specifically how to warn mastery in the mathematical practices",
                "This course was definitely very controversial this semester. The \"mastery based\" grading system, while helpful, was often very unclear as people weren't sure how to get the grade they wanted and whether they were on track. In order to sort of do so, you'd have to go back to each individual assignment you've completed on Canvas and add up the points, which isn't impossible, but a bit inconvenient. Overall, however, I'd say that this course gives students a really good shot at getting the grade they want (aka an A) if they're willing to put in the work. For each content mastery, we had around 5 quiz retake opportunities (though fewer towards the end, but they required fewer quizzes), which honestly, is a lot kinder than probably any other math class you could take at Yale. That means that even if you get 0 on 3\/5 quizzes&HAMs for each content mastery, you can still leave the class with an A (because you only need 2 mastery points for each topic). If that's a bit confusing, it's because the grading system is confusing at first, but after a while you start to get used to it. Also, the PSETs are graded for EFFORT, not attainment, which really helps. I will say though that a common theme amongst different sections is that lessons are often unclear. I think Tal is one of the better teachers of the course, but be prepared to teach yourself though khan academy. A lot of the time, topics come up on PSETs and HAMs that we have not covered whatsoever in class but are expected to understand. Even the peer tutors at office hours noted that this is a problem. My final note  if you aren't a fan of math and don't have a calc\/precalc background, I would not recommend this class. Take a gutty QR credit because this course is the opposite of that. I think that the course description is extremely misleading my saying that it's an introduction to differentiation and integration because while we technically start from the beginning (with proofs, etc.), we are expected to pick up the material pretty much instantly. If you do need this course for your major, though, office hours with your teacher and peer tutors will be a life saver I promise."

                "On the online quizzes, when you get a question wrong and it's been graded, it doesn't usually show you the right answer, which is extremely inconvenient. In some cases, the answer that it shows you as correct is actually wrong (which I verified after checking with a peer tutor). This is extremely frustrating as when you're trying to improve, you're unable to find your misstep without going to office hours and asking, which isn't always possible."
