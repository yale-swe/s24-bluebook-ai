    "This was an engaging class on a range of important topics, even for non-psychology majors!",
    "Great lectures on topic",
    "This was a nice supplement to Abnormal Psychology in that we learned about how the family influences the development of psychopathology. I thought this was really useful in a developmental psych\/clinical psychology context, but also because it taught us healthier ways of interacting with our own families. It's not often that a college course helps improve your interpersonal relationships! It was also interesting to learn the extent to which your environment and upbringing can affect the way you approach the world as an adult.",
    "I have learned all about psychopathy and how it relates to families. Each week we would cover a different topic and how it effects families from mental illnesses, to adoption, to attachment styles. It is very interesting if you are interested in the effects psychopathy can have on the family.",
    "I learned a lot about family patterns and the ways in which families affect the development of mental illness.",
    "Ive learned so much about how to be a good future parent, and how different family structures impact children."

    "Awesome weekly response, good workload",
    "I thought Professor Lockhart was an asset to the course, she's very warm and very knowledgable. I also liked the format of weekly thought questions. They weren't a ton of work but I thought they kept me engaged with the readings. I also love that there are a lot of readings listed (even though you definitely don't need to do all of them) so that students can further explore topics they are particularly interested in. I didn't love how much time we spent on student presentations and would have preferred to hear Professor Lockhart lecture more. I think the thought questions and the final paper would have been enough to evaluate us without the presentation.",
    "The seminar is basically just a two hour lecture. The course could be GREATLY improved by having Professor Lockhart engage with the class more. It got really boring to be talked at for 2 hours with no breaks.",
    "I think the setup was very good. It was cool to have a different topic each week and it allowed for us to cover a lot of material and also hear information through student presentations.",
    "I thought this was a great class. The lectures and student presentations were engaging, and the weekly responses were thought provoking. Overall I thought this was a great seminar.",
    "Good reading response questions every week- thought provoking and allowed me to get a solid grasp on all of the material."

    "Yes",
    "Yes, I think it's a great course. I learned a lot and it wasn't a ton of work. The required work served a purpose and I didn't feel like it was busy work. It is a seminar course so be warned that it's often reserved for senior psychology majors, especially the majors that are using the course to fulfill part of a senior requirement.",
    "Interesting content, but be warned that the seminars are very hard to get through\/pay attention the whole time because it is just a two hour straight lecture.",
    "Yes, this is a wonderful course and professor Lockhart is truely amazing!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. All of the topics were extremely interesting, and the seminars always flew by. The class included great conversation and I learned a ton throughout the semester. If you are at all interesting in the connection between families and mental illness, definitely take this course.",
    "Yes, would recommend to senior psychology majors especially!"
