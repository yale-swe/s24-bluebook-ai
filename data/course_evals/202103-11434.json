                "I learned about Renaissance music and the types of instruments that were used in the performance of these pieces. I also improved my sightreading skills, my ear for listening for if something is out of tune, and overall music theory and singing technique.",
                "Learned about historical performance and tuning systems",
                "I learned how to sight read really challenging music and how to sing with an ensemble of instruments",
                "I learned how to play the violone, a baroque viol instrument.",
                "I learned about Monteverdi's sacred and secular music as well as 17th century music performance practices.",
                "I learned a lot about Renaissance composer Monteverdi and his compositional techniques. He used word painting, prepared dissonance, and polyphony to create revolutionary music for both religious and theatrical purposes. I also learned a completely new instrument- the soprano recorder.",
                "Knowledge of early music",
                "Insight into music of the time period we focused on and both the theory and instrumentation of the era.",
                "In this class we learned about early music and music theory. A lot of people had the opportunity to learn new instruments as well that were unique to early music.",
                "I learned a lot about early music and different instruments used, as well as music theory",
                "I developed fluency playing a period instrument, realizing basso continuo parts, and performing music by Monteverdi.",
                "I improved my sight reading, and learned a bit about composition techniques and the way instruments are tuned.",
                "Musicianship and techniques used in Renaissance and Early-Baroque Period",
                "In this course you not only have the opportunity to learn beautiful pieces of music, but you also get to learn about the theory that helps enhance meaning and performance of the work.  We learned about different systems of tuning and how each could be applied.  We also learned about concepts such as prepared dissonance, which really helped our performance.  As a long-time choir singer, this course provided a fantastic opportunity to move beyond simply learning music toward understanding it.",
                "Learned a ton about early music and performance skills! Also vast improvement of my musicality.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: an experience unlike any I had ever had during my undergraduate career at Yale. This course is kind of like band class, in that you work together to rehearse and practice songs each week. I was very impressed by the talent of my peers! I'm from primarily a stem background, so it was great to know that some of my peers are super talented in things beyond memorizing random facts. Weaknesses: I wasn't really sure how I was being graded throughout the course since some of the assignments on the syllabus we just did not do. No worries, though, since this class is not stressful at all.",
                "I would say a strength of this course is its access to the Beinecke for the performance and its access to real early instruments that students can learn as a part of the class. A weakness of this course was perhaps the lack of vocal instruction. Some of the sections just didn't know their notes sometimes and we just kept plowing through anyway, which I feel like could be conducted in a different way.",
                "Overall, this class is very accessible to musicians of most skill levels and was not too difficult. This was the first music class that I've ever taken in my life and I felt like I could keep up with the class. I wish the singers got to warm up before singing and that we had more time to practiceall the other instrumental sections had dedicated time for that. In addition, it would have been helpful for us to have a more dedicated time to go over the music theory information at the end of the semester so that we had a better understanding.",
                "Great experience playing historical instruments, low workload and lots of good experience",
                "This course was so fun and engaging and I loved getting to sing in the Beinecke at the end of the semester! Only weakness was that it was hard at times to learn the music, but that was part of the challenge",
                "This course is fun and welcoming. It really encourages engagement with early music, which is a genre that a lot of people don't really know much about.",
                "This course is really fun since it's really just an ensemble. There isn't much work for the class outside of learning the pieces, and we spent most of class time rehearsing the music. Grant is extremely knowledgeable and very passionate about early music, so it was really fun to learn from him.",
                "The course is very fun and relatively low workload. Just practice and stay engaged with the material. There isn't really a weakness besides, perhaps, how long the class is.",
                "Strengths: Grant is wonderful and class was fun! I enjoyed playing the music and performing in the Beinecke.",
                "Great course that was both very fun and engaging. Good breakdown of material learned while also maintaining enough time for rehearsal.",
                "I thought this was a really unique course and appreciated the opportunity to play music on instruments I hadn't tried before. Overall it was a great class!",
                "- Strengths: Very hands-on, performance based course. Everyone noticeably improved as performers over the course of the semester. Grant is a great teacher who is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about early music.\r\n- Weaknesses: Although we had some short theory segments during class, I would have appreciated more material on that topic (e.g., homework assignments with theory exercises).",
                "Strengths: The pieces were challenging but fun to learn and sing, and the expectations were extremely reasonable. The workload was very light, and Prof. Herreid is a fun and engaging professor with a great sense of humor. The highlight was definitely the final performance in the Beinecke, it felt very special. Weaknesses: The information about composition\/tuning\/instruments\/etc. was presented in a slightly disorganized way",
                "overall this course was good. I wish we were able to play other music from the period as well (our theme for this semester was Monteverdi so we only played music composed by him)",
                "The course assumes students will be able to learn music quickly, which allows us to learn a variety of different works.  At times, the sight-singing demands can be challenging, and we didn't have time to cover every aspect of each piece.  However, Professor Herreid is really funny and inspires students to get into their performance.  Additionally, the pieces Professor Herreid chooses are beautiful and really fun to sing.",
                "No weaknesses whatsoever! \r\n\r\nStrengths: best class at Yale! Grant facilitates and encourages learning in an incredibly special way.",
                "Strengths: hands-on approach\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes long stretches of idle time"

                "Absolutely! This class is time to vibe and perform some cool music and is really not too much work at all which is lovely.",
                "I would for sure recommend this class if you want a fun class that only meets once a week and has a light workload. This class is historically a class that people in a cappella groups on campus like to take, and for good reason!",
                "Yes, definitely, especially as a 5th or 6th or 7th class",
                "If you're a vocalist this is a great way to devote 2 hours of your week to singing. You'll be expected to learn the music on your own but the pace is not fast and you will be okay as long as you have a bit of music-reading experience. It's also a unique opportunity to learn about early music which Prof. Herreid has a great skill for teaching.",
                "Yes!! If you like to sing this is a great class for you",
                "I would recommend this course. Of course, I would probably only recommend it to musicians, because it does require some musical skills, but I would certainly recommend it. The music is great, the process is fun, and it's an experience that is probably pretty rare for undergraduates.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It was really fun to learn about and perform early music, and Grant is a wonderful professor. It is also not a lot of work, so it's a good course to take if you're looking for one more easy credit to add to your schedule.",
                "Absolutely! This course is a great fourth or fifth credit. It's pretty easy and quite fun!",
                "Yes!! This class was so fun. You get to learn how to play old instruments that you won't get to play anywhere else, and performing in the Beinecke was a cool experience. I can't recommend it enough.",
                "Yes. Grant is wonderful and if you want to keep playing music in college without joining a separate group this is a great place to look into!",
                "Absolutely!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Its very enjoyable to play with the ensemble and especially if you get to learn a new instrument.",
                "Yes! It's super cool and performing in the Beinecke was also a wonderful experience",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in early music. As far as I know, Yale is one of only a few schools that offer undergrad early music performance classes. Grant is a fantastic instructor, which makes the experience all the more worthwhile.",
                "I would definitely recommend it, especially for singers. The music is fun (though one of the pieces we did this semester was very challenging), there's a relaxed vibe, the workload is light, and the final performance is really cool! I will probably take the course again.",
                "Yes, if they want to have experience performing early music",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as long as they were musically competent and interested in performing early musical works.  The pieces of music you get to learn are beautiful.  Professor Herreid is funny and offers really interesting insights into the composition, technique, and historical context of these works.  The other students in the class tend to be musically inclined and are excited to learn and perform new music.  Professor Herreid puts dramatic emphasis on dynamics and performance style, which is very rewarding.",
                "YES! A must take before you graduate. Most amazing class and Grant is the most kind and passionate professor on this campus.",
                "Yes, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play a baroque instrument!"
