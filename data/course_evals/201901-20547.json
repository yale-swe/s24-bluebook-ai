    "A greater ability and confidence in my artistic ability.",

   "comments": [
    "This was a very well done course, I think the hardest part is that it met for 4 hours on a Friday. But overall, a really good strength of the class was the professor's proficiency in other contemporary animation artists and the breadth of talent that we got exposed to over the course of the class.",
    "The strength of this course lies truly in the students. The course allows for students to interpret animation from their own artistic background, ranging from virtual reality to sculpture animations. This made the class experience much more meaningful, because I had the chance to see what my contemporaries were up to in their own practices. However, this is also a weakness, because there is no formal teaching of the concepts of animation. This was exacerbated by the professor's absence most of the time. I believe with more structure and a professor that is more present, the class can improve.",
    "Great course with incredible guest visits. Professor was very helpful"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to other students if they are willing to take some of the class's learning into their own hands outside of the classroom.",
    "definitely a fantastic way to increase your engagement and develop your comfort with building an animation comfort level.",
    "Yes. Because of the time involved in making an animation requires the structure this class offers, especially if you're working towards developing your own voice. You need the loose structure for the time to see labor intensive processes through and time to react to the discoveries.",
    "This class was mostly an opportunity to develop a relationship with Fed, who is a successful artist in nyc right now."
