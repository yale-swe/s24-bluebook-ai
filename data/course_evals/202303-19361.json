                "Strengths: Interesting books. I really liked the creative essay prompts. Professor Williams is very supportive of students and provides good feedback. I also loved that we had a guest speaker.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There wasn't much discussion, it was more of a lecture. Some of the classes were cut short (but that wasn't Prof Williams's fault).",
                "Strengths: great selection of books, prompts of the 3 essays are challenging but ultimately gets you to be a better writer, and the professor is fantastic at facilitating conversation + very understanding.\r\nWeaknesses: Moby Dick is a very hard, long read, but nonetheless rewarding. Try your best to keep up or go ahead as when you fall behind, you might not catch up."

                "Ab-so-lutely. And for a few reasons. 1) if you are taking this course not just as an English credit but as a way to learn a little American history, you will be happy to know how much the historical angle is highlighted in this class. For example, our second essay required us to analyze a passage we had read under the lens of a real historical document from the archives. 2) Professor Williams prompts (especially for the third essay) are extremely creative, thought-provoking, and engaging; I learned as much about myself and my perspectives on literature as the literature itself, and without at all taking away from my engagement with the text. 3) Professor Williams himself is an absolute gem. I cant speak to other ENGL 127 professors, but I have to imagine that he is one of the most enthusiastic people that the English department has to offer. His approach to seminar is very kind and relaxed, which I personally thought only added to the class ability to introspect and come together as a community. In one sentence: take this class, but most of all, take it with Professor Williams.",
                "Yes, it was a good class. But don't expect too much discussion.",
                "Yes! It is a great course and it helped me to actually start reading again. Otherwise, I have struggled to try and read on my own.",
                "Yes, definitely! Take this course to be a better writer, reader, presenter, and discussor."
