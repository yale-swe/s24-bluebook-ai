Professor Hirsch was very patient, engaged and gave very clear feedback on all writing assignments on ways it can be improved. This course teaches you how to summarize results clearly and how to communicate research very concisely and clearly. One weakness of the course is that deadlines for larger assignments were often not spaced out enough to allow time to submit drafts."
