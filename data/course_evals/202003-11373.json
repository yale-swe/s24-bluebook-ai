                "I learned how to see and talk about beauty differently. This course helped me think more about concepts I originally thought to be simple (or not as complicated), like justice, beauty, and evolution. I learned to listen and digest others' thoughts.",
                "Mainly, we practiced reading more perceptively and writing more intentionally. We did learn about different philosophers' and scientists' interpretations of beauty, but we also learned about the precision and purpose of language.",
                "Understanding of a vast range of sources relating to beauty, spanning from literature to philosophy, poetry, art, and evolutionary biology. Very interactive and engaging course with integrated, multi-disciplinary learning. Discussion- based; studying with other students from a wide range of backgrounds and academic interests gave me a very well-rounded idea about beauty and its different meanings in peoples lives.",

                "I learned to think and write essays in a more logical and precise manner. The concept of beauty is full of fascinating twists. I think in high school, many of us learn that it's enough to have an idea that sounds smart. With Professor Kastan, you learn that smart ideas aren't enough if you can't say it in a meaningful way. This was the most illuminating class I've taken, and I feel it's helped me become more thoughtful in daily life.  You don't realize the imprecision of language until you start questioning it. Everyone in the class was wonderful as well, and I feel we learned so much together, and enjoyed it along the way. If you want to learn to say something meaningful, take classes with Professor Kastan.",

                "Strengths: Interactive format, encouraging instructor, variety of readings, students bounce ideas off of each other\r\nWeaknesses: Difficult for someone quiet to get a word in! (I blame the virtual format)",
                "The greatest strength of the class was the quality of our class discussions. The whole class got better at analyzing and talking about the readings as the semester went on, so we had some great seminars. Also, the guest speakers that joined us for some of those seminars added new perspectives. The greatest weakness of this class was that we didn't write very many essays, and we rarely formally revisited essays after we received feedback on them. For a first-semester freshman seminar, I would have liked to get a little more writing practice.",
                "Strengths: the discussions were immensely engaging and made virtual learning (which was very hard as a freshman studying remotely) engaging and enjoyable. The small class size allowed for these discussions to be more intimate and meaningful; the personal contributions made the class so much richer. The material was often difficult because the language was so refined\/old fashioned, but this was always made accessible through discussion and Professor Kastans clarification and help. Very clear feedback regarding my writing; I was challenged to really get creative and innovative with traditional paper writing and was pushed to put real pressure on my style and content, which helped me improve. \r\nWeaknesses: the first paper was a bit tight time-wise and I wish we had had time to discuss some sources more deeply (like Schiller and Warhol).",
                "The seminar format was very engaging and I was always excited to come to class. The discussion posts every week were manageable but also held me accountable.",
                "An absolute strength of the course is the opportunity for discussion with other students in an academic setting. Most classes make one feel like he\/she is a part of a unique and meaningful conversation. Another strength was all of the tremendous guest speakers brought in by Professor Kastan.\r\n\r\nThe virtual setting, unfortunately, did affect the course's ability to reach its full potential. Many in-person activities that were supposed to be part of the course had to be canceled.",
                "Good diversity in materials and great class environment. Good flow of conversation even on Zoom.",
                "The greatest strengths were the enjoyable community and the skills that Prof. Kastan teaches. You learn how much work it takes to say something that not only sounds right, but means something to other people.  The weaknesses were far eclipsed by the strengths, but it might have been nice to have a better sense of grading. One final strength was that Dr. Kastan would be willing to meet 1 on 1 or 2 on 1 every week if you asked him, for up to an hour or sometimes more, to discuss anything that was interesting or on your mind or bothering you.",
                "class discussions were great! Some readings were very long though... it may be more beneficial to give shorter readings so that students can read it fully and think deeply about it instead of skimming 30 pages."

                "The virtual format did not impede the learning; the discussions flowed well almost always. I especially found the Q&A sessions with Katy, Bryon, Professor Scarry, and Professor Prum were very intriguing and very helpful. I found those to be invaluable opportunities to engage directly with the authors\/creators of the course material. The one-on-one meetings with Professor Kastan  about my writing were extremely helpful as well, facilitating my individual growth as a writer, which is especially important to me as a student in the humanities. The discussion prompts kept me on my feet and ensured that I was thinking critically about the readings. I found these interesting because I enjoyed reading other students responses; throughout the course, I found myself challenged and enriched by the array of interests and perspectives represented in the class.",

                "Yes. Anyone who cares about humanity or about what makes our world beautiful should take this course. It has made me think harder and to ask difficult questions. Even if I wasnt able to answer those questions, it taught me to go out of my comfort zone and embrace the complex nature of beauty. It has improved my writing immensely, pushing me to really put pressure on my style and mechanics, as well as how I integrate my creativity into paper-writing. It has exposed me to the overlaps between multiple disciplines, making me a more well-rounded and curious student in the humanities.",
