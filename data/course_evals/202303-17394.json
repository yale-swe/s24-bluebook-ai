It allowed each student to take responsibility for their time, and I think the looser structure really helped me find balance in the research and coursework. Additionally, each class meeting was productive and fulfilling."

The ability to explore the museum was incredible, the instructors and mentors are beyond available regarding everything from the content of your independent research to the transition to college life, and the experience is invaluable to anyone interested in the environment, paleontology, archaeology, or adjacent fields.",
                "Yes, if you are willing and excited to create your own research project and carry it out with high levels of independence. The mentors understand students' skill levels in the various topics and help guide them through their individual processes. Students essentially create their own schedule and timeline for their projects, so they have some autonomy over their engagement in the class.",

                "100%. As a non-stem student, I was very intimidated by research and didn't really understand what it looked like within the humanities. This class totally demystified the process and made it more accessible. I'm leaving this class with a research paper I'm proud of as well as connections in my fields of interest. I can't think of a more worthwhile learning experience."
