                "This class and course instructor was amazing. Craig is a fantastic and enthusiastic professor who genuinely seems to care for his students. The material is naturally engaging and the course was structured in a way that steadily progressed toward the more challenging, complex papers as the class developed as writers. The focus and meaning of the seminar units were relevant and complimented the focus of the course. A minor weakness is that a few of the writing workshops felt rushed, but I feel that is more a statement about the inherent time restrictions of the course than a weakness of the class structure.",
                "Interesting discussion, collaborative.",
                "Strengths: Craig is really nice, course is highly accessible to everyone, workload is very manageable and you get a lot of help through everything\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly none other than it's a writing class and I'm a STEM major so I wasn't naturally comfortable but that isn't the course's fault",
                "The course was not too stressful and Craig supported us at each step of the writing process. While the final research paper may seem daunting, the curriculum breaks it apart into smaller chunks (multiple drafts) so it never felt overwhelming. \r\n\r\nI do wish we read more creative pieces, especially given that the class is about narrative, but I understand that ENGL 114 is about developing academic writing.",
                "One of the biggest strengths of this course was the engagement of Professor Eklund as well as the wide variety of topics this course covers. One way this course could be improved is by spending more time with the material from the beginning of the semester.",
                "Strengths are that you learn about really interesting topics in narrative psychology; weaknesses are that the class wasn't really what I expected from its title. \"Telling Stories\" made it seem like more a creative writing class when it was really nitty-gritty in terms of narrative psychology. Overall though, it is a wonderful class and the content was really interesting."

                "Yes! Craig is a fantastic and enthusiastic professor. He provides extensive feedback and seems to genuinely care about the development of his students academic capabilities. The focus of the course made it really enjoyable, and I feel like the information that I learned was pragmatically useful or applicable in everyday life.",
                "Yes, great class to take as a freshman.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class. It was always enjoyable. Professor Eklund was constantly engaging and available for questions about our papers, or anything covered within the class. He provided all the tools possible for a student to improve their writing. A perfect class.",
                "Yes, absolutely, and especially with Craig. He's very forthcoming about his expectations and grades fairly as well. (He's very open about what you need to do to get an A, for example.) An all-around great instructor and person to be around twice a week. The writing assignments were as you'd expect with ENGL 114, as they're pretty much standardized through all sections (three papers: 4, 6, and 8 pages, the last one is a research paper), but I really liked the stories theme (we also had a short fun paper at the end). For someone with a strong background in high school English the writing assignments are extremely accessible and the workload isn't bad at all (a relieving prospect for me as a STEM major with crippling workloads elsewhere). You especially get lots of time and help for the research paper. I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone hoping to improve their writing in a fairly low-stress but still highly intellectual environment. The perfect WR credit or general writing class.",
                "Yes! The class was a great writing credit for a non English major, and it wasnt as intimidating as I thought it would be. Craig is also very friendly!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student seeking to improve their writing skills as that is the biggest skill I developed throughout the course.",
                "Yes, definitely a great English 114 seminar to take. Professor Eklund provides great feedback and teaches the class really well."
