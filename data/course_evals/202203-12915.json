A brief treatment of cosmological models. Most problem sets focused on straightforward calculations, and mostly served to develop skills in tensor arithmetic rather than physics.",
                "I learned concepts from general relativity and some of the mathematical topics behind them: manifolds, covariant and contravariant vectors, tensors and derivatives, the Minkowski metric and other metrics of spacetime, Einstein field equations, Ricci and Riemann tensors, Christoffel symbols, etc.",
                "This course was a survey of concepts under the banner of relativity, including special relativity, manifolds, differential geometry, einstein's equations, black holes, and cosmology. It was my first exposure to working with manifolds, topology, and tensors, so it was also an introduction to these mathematical areas."

                "I mostly enjoyed the mathematical material, and the discussions of how to develop mathematical formalizations which account for our basic postulates about the physical world. Prof. Moncrief is good at explaining mathematical concepts. One area that could be improved in the future is to better organize lectures so that we would have time to look at how some of the solutions to the Einstein equation are derived.",
                "The material was interesting and presented in a logical progression, and the problems sets were helpful in understanding and processing the concepts from class. The professor was receptive to student input, and was accommodating of the varying mathematical backgrounds of everyone in the course. At times the material was very abstract and hard to grasp, especially because it required such advanced math, but I think that's just the nature of general relativity.",
                "The course was well organized and paced, and the material was well explained. I felt that the biggest weakness of the course was that studying relativity requires a deeper mathematical background than the course can reasonably provide. It would be excellent for students that have some background in the mathematical concepts already."
