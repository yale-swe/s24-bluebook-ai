I especially think that the workshop style of the course was one of its greatest strengths, and really let me dig deeper and fully flesh out one of my pieces in much greater depth than I expected.",
                "This course was fantastic. I appreciated the fact that every student had the chance to present a story, some of their work and their perspectives on the works that we read. I also appreciated building relationships with my classmates through small workshop breakout rooms. I also appreciated Professor Choi's commitment to the well-being of the students and her willingness to share about her own personal experiences in the industry!",
                "The strength of this course is the class and the professor. The professor gave specific feedback on writing exercises each week, which was very helpful for improvement. The class discussions were also a high point, as each student got the chance to explain their perspective on the week's reading and analyse how the writing was effective. I also liked the lengthy focus at the end of the class on expanding and revising a single story, as we were able to produce a refined work."

It helped me gain confidence in my writing abilities and was a great way to keep myself motivated and write stories throughout the semester. Each week, we received a new prompt and had a new opportunity to create a world through fiction. The readings were super interesting, and you'll meet incredible writers dedicated to improving their work.",
                "I would recommend this course. The professor was great, the readings were inspiring, and the exercises each week were a rigorous way to improve writing over the course of the semester. The final workshops on a single story were valuable opportunities for reader feedback and resulted in the completion of a final work."
