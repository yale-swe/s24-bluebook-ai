                "The way the course was taught this year, it was extremely unclear what assignments were due and when, to the extent that sometimes up to half the class would not have done an assignment we were going to discuss in class on a given day. There was a large amount of repeat material from L1 - vocab and grammar - and I felt that my pace of learning Hebrew really slowed down this semester compared to last. Finally, the course could be way more focused on speaking. There are a lot of reading comprehension assignments, which is great, but I wish I had more of a chance to speak in class and get corrected at the moment to fix problems (we did speaking assignments for homework where our TA would give corrections, but only days later).",
                "The course was very well organized with a very clear pattern, however it was not an engaging class. The professor (Orit) was not very engaging, seemed  shy, and it often felt like a small lecture instead of a highly interactive class like L1 was. There should be less English and more discussions in Hebrew for practice.",
                "The structure of the course grew on me...I ended up really enjoying asynchronous assignments. To be honest, I think I would like more homework. And more feedback on our writing."

                "Yes absolutely. Hebrew is so much fun to learn and speak. You get really close with your class, and by the end of the semester, you're able to speak pretty decently with each other.",
                "If you want to learn Hebrew, the Yale Hebrew program will successfully teach you the language. This is not in itself a particularly great course, but it is absolutely effective at continuing the foundation of L1 and if you do the work and practice the material you will absolutely improve your Hebrew language skills.",
