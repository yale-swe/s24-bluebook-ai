                "In this course, I learned, in my estimation, how to effectively speak the Italian language over the course of a single semester. While it may be true that the extent of my knowledge of the Italian language could obviously be extended, I feel as though I could effectively carry on a conversation with a classmate, read a piece of Italian journalism, or compose short pieces of writing on any of a number of topics. In this, I also gained a sense of humility which I feel is true of many introductory language courses. However, what I found to have stood out about this class is that the environment created by my other classmates and especially by my professor allowed for this sense of humility to feel natural as opposed to being the sort of awkward, forced feeling that is true of many of those other classes.",

                "So, so, so much Italian! We basically went through the Sentieri textbook cover to cover and learned plenty of vocab and grammar in the process. You additionally learn so much about yourself as a student and a learner, as it really takes you back to the high school mode of doing a bit of studying and work every night. Quizlet will be your best friend in this class. Truly you will be astounded though by how much you learn and by after just a month in class, you're able to carry on a basic conversation. By the end of the course, you will feel like you could go to Italy and speak and understand enough to really get by."

                "This course was strong in all facets. Michael Farina's teaching style of exercise-based learning with commentary allows for a clear communication of information that was initially covered individually, helping to clear up any confusion as well as to further and deepen our knowledge. The leniency of class assignments also allowed us to practice as much as we so desired without being too overbearing or being busy work. Farina's understanding of the necessities of workload and teaching style were well-demonstrated in this class, understanding the level of work needed to thoroughly learn the material without swamping us in work. This balance was ideal, and I find that to have more work would be of detriment to the pace at which the class operates. I have no suggestions for improvements.",
                "No weaknesses, it was amazing, take it.",
                "Strengths: energy, excitement to go to class even at 9:25am. Weaknesses: at 9:25am...",
                "The NUMBER ONE strength of this course is the instructor, Michael Farina. I believe him to be the most talented educator I have ever met. Being an effective instructor is difficult enough, but I think there is a layer of difficulty added when teaching a language. The class is incredibly engaging because of Michael's energy and he quickly creates a comfortable space where we all feel like we can try. In our class, any mistake just gets us closer to being better. \r\nWhile I am sure outside observers think that the time commitment of the class is a weakness, it is actually a huge strength. Putting in nearly 10 hours of active class time a week makes it so that you really learn so much. You become very comfortable with Michael and with your peers and just get excited about how much you are learning. I also think the daily quizzes are a huge strength as they are very low stakes and give you a good sense of what you should be studying to prepare for the test."

At Yale, you really have this unique opportunity to learn languages you haven't been exposed to before and really become proficient. The intensive elementary courses are especially helpful for just tossing you into the experience and making sure you really have walked away with a decent ability to communicate. By taking this course you will have the chance to work with a phenomenal professor and learn to speak the beautiful Italian language."
