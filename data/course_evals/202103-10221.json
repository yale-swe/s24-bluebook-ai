                "I absolutely loved this class and Professor Menon is an amazing teacher. The one weakness of the course is that sometimes, class discussions would slow down, and could have been pushed along a bit more to get things going.",
                "I loved the concepts and readings that we dealt with, and the organization of the class (weekly presenters + discussion leaders focusing on specific topics) was nice. There were a few times when student discussion leaders had difficulty engaging the class, and I would have liked if Professor Menon stepped in more during those moments  she always has great things to say that were helpful in getting the class back on track, and sometimes I felt she let those pauses/silences go on to long. But mostly it was great!\r\n\r\nMy favorite classes were the ones where we were discussing a book  it was easier to work at the core concepts of the course when discussing a single body of work, as opposed to a few separate but connected readings. I felt sometimes that in trying to hit every reading we cut ourselves short in other good conversations, and that happened less when we were discussing a book. \r\n\r\nThe visual class exercises that we did (on the boards, or when a student led a more visual exercise) were very helpful for me. Some of this stuff can be very abstract, and seeing it in space was very helpful for my understanding",
                "No weaknesses. Readings were great. Loved my classmates. Professor Menon was a great professor. There were weekly memos, but I thought they were great for keeping me engaged in the course.",
                "Enjoyed interacting critically with sociological theory, enjoyed seminar discussions, memos helped me clarify my opinions and assessments.\r\nWish we could have been more clear about definitions. I think it would have helped to keep a running list of theories and definitions to build on concepts more.",
                "Professor Menon is chooses really diverse readings for discussion, and encourages students to pursue open answers to very complex questions. She brings in sociologist perspectives while combining them with more day-to-day examples of the interactions between racial classifications, personal and community health and identity, and technologies.\r\n\r\nWhile this could be seen as a strength, the discussions typically aren't moderated by the professor, which can lead to tangents from the students in regards to discussion.",

This is clearly a passion class for her (many of the themes and concepts are directly related to her own research focuses), which means she is very familiar with the material and can lead very interesting discussions no matter which direction the class takes. Really excellent content and great readings. Take this class!",
