                "Topics: What do we want from democracy? What do we want from institutions? Elections, accountability, representation, political parties, alternatives to electoral democracy, reviewing James Madison's views on separation of powers, presidentialism vs parliamentarism, controlling the administrative state, bicameralism, reforming upper chambers, legislative organization, judicial review and independence.\r\n\r\nThis course takes all of your assumptions about political theory and political institutions and questions them. Are we sure that a high bar to amend the Constitution is a good idea? Are we sure that having two houses of Congress is better than one? Are we sure that judicial review promotes democracy? What about independent agencies (like central banks)? What are we even looking for in \"democracy\"? What does \"representation\" actually mean? All the questions that 99% of social science classes will assume away instead of actually diving into.\r\n\r\nThis course is an excellent opportunity to engage directly with instructors who are studying and writing about these issues (and in Shapiro's case, has studied and written on them for much longer than we've been alive). Shapiro also knows all of the other authors\/readings extremely well; many of the other authors were colleagues at Yale and co-authors or co-editors in other material. So you are getting the scoop straight from the horse's mouth, in the best possible way.",
                "The course was fantastic. As far as I remember, it is the only undergraduate class at Yale that explores comparative constitutional design in a comprehensive way, from electoral systems to judiciary. Having two instructors was also great since both of them complemented each other really well. The readings were all interesting and up to the point. \r\n\r\nThe class discussions were also great. Student actually did the readings and were knowledgeable about the material, as well as eloquent in their arguments. This quality of seminar discussions is rare at Yale these days.",
                "This course greatly improved my understanding of political theory and institutional design. I learned to think rigorously about these issues from first principles: e.g., instead of taking for granted that judicial review is justified to 'protect minorities,' does it actually do this? Are there other solid reasons for judicial review? What might alternatives look like? One big lesson of the course is to be wary of second-order effects. i.e., Institutional reforms often have harmful side effects that weigh against their intended benefits. As a result, perhaps surprisingly, this course helped me appreciate the American political system more. To be clear, it is not perfect: there is no good reason for the Senate to be structured as it is, American courts perhaps shouldn't have so much power, etc. But there are also myriad ways it could be worseall of these decisions involve a series of tradeoffs. This course also significantly changed my views about a number of topics, including direct democracy.",
                "Textual analysis, effective engagement in a discussion, and critical thinking on many levels of political science",
                "This course was a really good marathon through different topics in Democratic theory. I signed up for this course because I liked PLSC 118 and Professor Shapiro, not really having an idea what it was about. I left with complex opinions on political parties, electoral systems, presidentialism, and bicameralism. Therei is always more reading to do, but Prof Shapiro dropped great recommendations almost every single session.",
                "The course was a good, broad introduction to the legal and political science literature on democratic theory and institutional design, with a particular focus on the American context. Key topics included Dahlian and other first-principles arguments for democracy, Condorcet jury theorem, Duverger's law, veto players theory, rent seeking, policy bundling, multiparty vs. two-party systems, districting vs. proportional rep, Linz's theories of presidentialism, presidential vs. parliamentary systems, upper chambers and bicameralism, judicial review, second opinions. Learned about the content, as well as how to comprehend and skim dense and technical poli-sci and law literature, and how to argue and write about it."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The course is co-taught by Sterling Professor Ian Shapiro, who... well... if you don't know who he is, look him up. He's possibly the pre-eminent active professor writing and teaching on topics of democratic theory. Also the Moral Foundations of Politics (MoFoPo) professor.\r\n\r\nThe other co-professor is David Froomkin, a recent JD (YLS) grad and as of this writing a fifth-year PhD student. He and Shapiro often have informal mini-debates between each other in class which is fun to watch. This is his area of study. He is really good at leading the discussion while also spending more time on specific topics or case studies that students are interested in.\r\n\r\nThe discussion is VERY student-led. That said, since only four reading responses for the whole semester are required (setting aside the midterm and final papers), it's easy to \"forget\" to do a reading. Don't forget! You will be like a lost puppy if you don't do the readings and it'll be obvious. It's probably 100 (maybe 125?) pages per class -- and the class meets once a week. So very reasonable. Reading responses are a great way to participate in addition to the discussion because the professors read them before class and incorporate them into the discussion.\r\n\r\nThe professors are very open to having their views challenged in class. In fact, if you don't challenge them in some way, you probably didn't do the readings.",
                "The main strength of this class is its global focus. We looked at democracies throughout the entire world and compared how different institutions are similar to each other. The US didn't comprise the majority of our case studies. Yet, here comes the biggest weakness: the course was written for a US audience to acquire themselves with other democratic institutional models. Many of the topics covered were skewed to the interest of a US audience, such as two lessons on bicameralism (which is quite rare) and only one lesson on presidentialism vs. parliamentarism (which is the main contention point throughout most democracies). Many readings were still focusing on the US.\r\n\r\nYet, this class did push the global focus much further than any other comparable class at Yale. I'm glad there is such a class in our college now.",
                "Strengths: I thought the professors did a great job mixing their own comments about the topics with student discussion, and always came with highly interesting and relevant discussion questions (i.e., they were related to the readings but in class, we challenged the readings and attempted to build off of them instead of just summarizing them). The syllabus is fantastic, covering important topics in institutional design from a fresh perspective. I appreciated how the professors challenged student comments and were clear about their own views. The professors were a real strength of the class.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion would be perhaps cutting the readings a bit for some weeks. In terms of actual assignments, the workload was very reasonable.",
                "Strengths: Very well-organized, structured to facilitate learning, compelling discussions on a weekly basis, interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: Quieter voices were sometimes left behind in the conversationthat is to be expected in a seminar setting, but I wish more effort was made to engage the entire class as there were a lot of interesting perspectives",
                "Strenghts: Great reading list. I honestly learned so much, and gleaned even more as I reviewed the readings to write my papers. I received great feedback on my papers, both before and after writing them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The discussion was somewhat dominated by a few voices, but the professors did try to bring in other people, given that they raised their hands.",
                "Strengths: It's a great class, and I think anyone interested in democracy should take it or something similar. The syllabus is strong enough that you'll get a pretty concrete understanding of the key issues involved in contemporary democratic theory. Shapiro and Froomkin were both approachable, knowledgeable, and fun. I'll miss their weekly debates. It's not an easy class, since the material is so tough, but if you put in the work to read carefully, you'll get the chance to think more deeply about some of the most important questions in political science than you ever have. The course changed my mind about what reforms are necessary and what democratic framework is most desirable. Course structure is good, with weekly discussion posts and 2 ten page essays. Grading more than fair, and both Professor's feedback was generous and useful. Felt intellectually valued as a student.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the course material was too focused on America, not on theory. I would have appreciated either a more comparative or more abstract approach, both because democratic backsliding is a global phenomena and because America's constitution is particularly difficult to amend, whereas applications of the course material make more sense in other places. I think some weeks were repetitive, esoteric, or unnecessary (the week on reforming the administrative state, for example). The course usually assigned a fair amount of reading, but sometimes it was too much. There were probably a few too many whole 80 page law review articles on the syllabus. I also think too many of the readings were law review articles. They over-technicalized and over-complicated questions and issues. There is great, approachable writing about institutional design and democracy in the popular media. I also wish we had discussed applications of the material more in class, not just in the essays."

                "I strongly recommend this course to students interested in political science, EP&E, political philosophy, global affairs, or anything related. You can take this course in any direction you want, by evaluating specific political institutions or paradigms in a given country or more theoretically. The course is a good combination of normative thinking (what kind of democracy do we want to build and why?) and more pragmatic application (how can we reform certain existing institutions given the reality that we can't start from scratch?)\r\n\r\nImportantly, it goes far beyond the usual platitudes of New York Times op-eds. For example, we read arguments saying not just that the US Senate is undemocratic because it overrepresents Wyoming vs. California, but that all second chambers are inherently undemocratic even if their representation seems fairer. We read arguments saying not just that the Supreme Court is undemocratic because it's filled with partisan hacks, but that all judicial review is undemocratic, even if it ostensibly \"protects minority rights.\" (There are better ways to protect minority rights.) We read arguments explaining not just \"Brexit bad,\" but that all referendums are terribly undemocratic. Even referendums about minority rights. (Again, there are better ways to protect minority rights.) You *do not* have to agree with anything you read or hear in class, but you are encouraged to think deeply about your own preconceptions in a way that most social science classes do not push you to do.\r\n\r\nThis is a course where you will challenge your own beliefs, and you will encounter substantial cognitive dissonance in doing so. This is not a course where you will hear ideas everyone already agrees with, only to nod your head and say some vague stuff for participation brownie points. So if you enjoy genuine intellectual challenge, take Designing & Reforming Democracy.",
                "Yes! Professors Froomkin and Shapiro bring a lot of depth and breadth to this course on democratic theory and institutional design. The debates and discussions were also very engaging; I was very egger to come to class every day.",
                "Definitely, the two instructors were fantastic, and I loved the course. One of the best I've taken at Yale. Take this course, especially if you are interested in learning how institutions affect politics and policy, which is crucial to understanding any country's political system.",
                "Yes! The professors are amazing and the course completely changed the way I see the American political system. It is one of the two courses in my time at Yale that has helped me intellectually grow the most (alongside Intro Ethics with Shelly). For those willing to put the time and effort in, you will really get a ton out of this class.",
                "Yes! It was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes, especially if Professor Shapiro is a part of the teaching team. He just has great insights and is one of my favorite professors in the department.",
                "Yes. If you're interested in democracy, you should take the course. Seminar quality was incredibly high."
