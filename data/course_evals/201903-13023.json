   "comments": [
    "I have a general understanding of writing different kinds of academic papers, skills of analyzing texts and further using it in my paper.",
    "I learned to analyze documents and read critically. I also learned to write in a structured way",
    "I developed a much better way to write essays and to look at essays in a much deeper sense. This course also taught me to to look at the language of writings and essays.",
    "My rhetorical analysis skills were significantly improved. I can say that without a doubt Dr. Tazudeen was the keystone factor in this improvement.",
    "During this course, I learned various writing skills that will help me throughout my time at Yale. Also, being in a seminar it made me participate and speak my ideas which will also help me in the long run.",
    "I learned more about the English language, the philosophy behind noise and listening, and how to behave within a seminar-style classroom setting.",
    "In regards to skills, I developed my ability to closely read texts and deconstruct\/construct arguments. These skills were developed in concert with close listening to a variety of music\/sounds through the lens of different theorists. This was particularly useful for me because, as a musician, I was more comfortable analyzing music that I was analyzing text. This class helped me to gain confidence in my ability to understand and analyze challenging text as well.\r\n\r\nRelating to the content of the course, It broadened my understanding of a wide range of music as well as the many interrelations between music and cultural and societal forces. This course also increased my awareness of the different modes of listening and the dynamics of sound environments that constitute the modern age. I understand music and ambient sounds, within a broader historical framework that is enriching to my experience.",
    "Sound: I further developed my skills as a writer and became more comfortable breaking from the five-paragraph essay mold, while still having organization and clear essay structure. I also became more aware of the sonic environment around me, and I now think about sound through a more critical lens.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think there should be more attention paid to the writing process: maybe holding writing session during classes and discussing structure of paper more closely. Even though we had workshops for writing papers, but they were hold after we had submitted our first drafts, so those workshops were not that useful. I think they should take place 1 class before the deadline of that paper, so that we could work on the structure, arguments before submitting our first drafts. Essays were really complicated to read often and even discussions in class did not help to understand them.",
    "This course is quite philosophical, so it requires a lot of thinking I was unfamiliar with. Rasheed is AMAZING!!",
    "My writing was a weakness before I got into this course and my improvement throughout the year was huge.",
    "The course material and Dr. Tazudeen's teaching style are huge strengths for Sound. I think starting with a reading that isn't Barthes \"Listening\" would be a good idea because that is quite a difficult essay to read.",
    "A strength of the course is that it was on a very interesting topic. A weakness of the course was some of the readings got tedious at times. Overall, more strengths than weaknesses.",
    "This is a very well taught course that engages students.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is its flexibility with regards to the musical interests of the students. Each of the theorists we read can apply to a variety of music and non-musical contexts and thus the material is engaging for those with a variety of musical preferences. Additionally the wide range of music listened to served to encourage broad application of theory. Personal preferences in music serve engage students in discussion which in turn encourages greater articulation in their critique. I very much enjoyed the independent nature of the research paper and the paper and the final creative project.  The freedom of these assignment allowed me to chose topics I found interesting and was excited to work on.\r\n\r\nA strength and weakness of the course I think lies in the listening exercises at the beginning of class. Each day another student would bring in a short piece to listen to and discuss. This was a strength of the course in that a very diverse array of music was presented, and because the pieces brought in were meaningful to the presenter very thoughtful discussion followed. The only weakness in this was that discussions would occasionally run longer than intended, which left less time for discussion of assigned materials. However, oftentimes discussion of the listening exercise tied in very nicely assigned materials.",
    "Sound: This course is good because it allows students to think critically about a subject they all are interested in while developing writing skills. I wish there was more instruction on the writing itself, though the discussions and readings are the most exciting and interesting part of the class."

   "comments": [
    "This class is ideal for students who are very passionate about music, playing musical instruments or sing. Even though topics in general are not that connected to music, this topic comes up quite often and without proper background information is not that interesting\/understandable. this class gives a nice grasp of what academic papers are, but for sure essays we had to read are very very complicated and hard to analyze.",
    "Yes!! The professor is incredible",
    "Yes the professor was engaging and smart. I enjoyed going to this class and discussing the readings because they were very interesting.",
    "One hundred percent would recommend this course. in fact, I already have.",
    "Yes, this course helped understand writing more and would recommend this course to someone else.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to others. The professor is wonderful and the subject matter forces you to reconsider what is thought of as normal in relation to sound and absorption of sound.",
    "I would, and have, recommended this class to a lot of my musician friends. It is a great was to connect a wealth of musical experience and understanding to academic thinking and writing. It broadened my musical perspective and provided me new tools for understanding that I can apply to my study of music and the cultural dynamics of the world.\r\n\r\nAlthough I cannot speak from experience, I feel this course does a good job of introducing non-musicians to these concepts as well. It is taught in such a way that is accessible to advanced technical knowledge of music and intuitive experience of the non-musician.",
    "Sound: I would highly recommend Prof. Tazudeen's ENGL114: \"Sound.\" The course is well-designed, the readings and discussions are engaging and interesting, the professor is very knowledgable and gives very helpful and specific feedback on writing.",
    "Absolutely would recommend! Dr. Tazudeen is open to many topics, and can be very helpful in suggesting directions for personal projects."
