This class made the campus make sense and gave me a whole new perspective on the university I attend.  I also developed my visual literacy skills -- in general and for identifying architectural styles and features.",
                "I never knew that I would be the kind of person to look at the architectural integrity of a building and notice things like window support, brick patterns, and veneer but now I am. I am a huge history person and I loved learning all the stories of Yale. I absolutely devoured the Pinnell readings each night. I also had the chance to explore a different college campus that I was interested in which I really appreciated. Overall, a great course."

I also would have enjoyed spending a little of the first day on an introduction to architecture -- talking more about what architecture is as a discipline, how architects think and design, how to look at buildings, etc."

I spent the whole summer telling everyone interesting facts I learned about campus buildings. \r\nI realized how much Yale's architecture was fooling me before this class.  Honestly every Yale student should take this course to gain a better familiarity with the behind-the-scenes stories on campus.",
                "Absolutely! This course was the perfect course to take during summer session. It was my first in-person class here at Yale and it really helped me to get familiar with the campus. I learned so much about the school and its history and not just through lectures. Summer sessions are very quick so in five weeks there is only so much that you can uncover, but I felt that we did a great amount. I think that the workload of this course was ideal and exactly what I signed up for."
