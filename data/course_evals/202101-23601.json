                "This course covers a lot of material, which makes it both intellectually stimulating but also gives you a lot of reading. I think the blog post format works really well, but I wish that our class was smaller so that we could have less mediated discussions.",
                "I enjoyed the discussion format.",
                "well structured course, sometimes the discussion would be hampered by a massive queue which disjointed the conversation. but it was very inclusive, interesting, and enjoyable class meetings",
                "it was a great course. I really liked that the reading schedule was based on week rather than on every class meeting. I really liked the course blog format and the agency we had in deciding our final project.",
                "Strength:\r\nthe in class discussions themselves\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-The format of the in class discussions. Because the class had ~25-30 we had to form a queue in zoom chat to speak. Oftentimes it would take 15 minutes before you got your chance to speak so it never felt like a class discussion but rather everyone fighting to make their point for their participation grade.\r\n-You don't really know you're grade until after you turn in your final paper.  \r\n-The course blog site is awful from a technical standpoint. Please use another website. \r\n-An insane amount of reading. You don't really know what you have to read until Wednesday lecture. Then you have to finish your reading to make a blog post by Sunday. You essentially get 4 days to read 100-300 pages (sometimes a full book). Realistically, people just aren't going to do all that within such a short timeframe which leads to surface level discussions.",
                "Awesome course, understanding instructor. Really interesting and engaging course material which clearly shows greater learning goals for the course!",
                "It would be helpful to get more feedback on blog posts and responses (at least for lead blog posts) both to improve our writing/engagement with the material/etc and to have a sense of how we're doing in the class.",
                "I found that most of the time the ideas and thoughts of other students would be so unnecessarily long and confusing while also including paragraphs with and overwhelming amount of academic jargon  that it made it difficult to actually understand what the class was talking about. While we were dealing with heavy text, no one in the class wanted to actually simply it, except Prof. Adams.",
                "This course benefited from a great reading list and class structure, and the creative use of a course website which served as a platform for student thought and discussion. One way the course could be improved is by either limiting the amount of students to a more conventional seminar size, or shifting from a discussion format to a more lecture-based structure that could accommodate more students.",
                "I found the structure of the discussions to work very well and generate fluent and interesting discourse. Obviously, having in-person discussions would be better than via zoom.",
                "Professor Adams is wonderful and has curated an unbelievable list of readings. The discussions are so engaging and the format is engaging but not stressful.",
                "The course was very strong.",
                "this course was extremely engaging i loved the class discussions that took place every class",
                "Strengths: This was such a good class.  Prof. Adams was so kind, caring, and understanding of the fact that we were living through a pandemic.  All of our discussions were really interesting, and I was always excited to do the readings.  I loved how open and flexible the discussion was, and having students lead each week was a really good idea since I got to see how my classmates interpreted the readings as well.\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, there are not many weaknesses of this course.  Sometimes it felt a little intimidating to participate because the class size was bigger than a normal seminar, but the comment-chat system worked well.  I would say that the weaknesses of this class were due to the limitations of Zoom/online school, not the class itself.",
                "This is an absolutely incredible course. Professor Adams is brilliant, warm, and engaging, understanding of student time and challenges, patient, and flexible. I was originally skeptical of the class format, which is like a seminar, but with close to 30 students. However, Professor Adams runs the class in a way that enables all students to get a chance to share, while still leaving time to unpack the theories we discuss. She strikes a wonderful balance between free flowing class discussion and ensuring that the major points of the theories did not go undetected. The reading load is manageable and the final project provides flexibility for students to engage with the parts of the course they enjoyed most. My favorite parts of classes were her brief summaries and the questions she posed to the class-- I think the only possible improvement would be for her to spend a little bit of time summarizing the main points or asking some questions that ensured students pulled out the most important parts of the theories at the end/middle of class, not just at the beginning."

                "The zoom discussions worked well, and lining up in the chat with comments was a good way to structure the discussions, as everybody was able to make their point. However, this also sometimes made the discussion a bit disjointed or circular, as people were returning to previous subjects with their comments after others had moved on (ie there was a lag due to the line).",

I also enjoyed the course blog format to organize our thoughts about the readings.",

Students should be ready to participate frequently in open discussions with others about the course readings, and to take the initiative to bring their own ideas and insights to the table.

I definitely got a glimpse of all of those things, and the robust class discussions were such a fun way to talk about topics that can seem intimidating on their own.  This class reminded me of how much I love reading, learning, and questioning the world around me, since it was a low-stress environment that was much more focused on discussion rather than grades.",

Regardless of interest or discipline, this course exposes students to theories and thinkers everyone should have the opportunity to explore before leaving college!
