                "Strengths: Clearly organized use of class time (usually Tuesday = discussion, Thursday = coding\/software demo). Elegant structuring and synthesis of lectures + homework + quizzes (homeworks generalize lectures, and quizzes generalize homeworks, and they all connect nicely). Highly interesting and thought-provoking content. Exposure to new ways of thinking about speech production and perception. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Almost no consequence for skipping some of the readings. Maybe a more explicit check-in about the readings, either could manifest as a quick, weekly reading-response type assignment in addition to the exercises, or perhaps as a stronger push from the instructor to engage the students in conversation about that week's reading material.",
                "The professor was great and obviously knew so much in the field. He had lots of practical examples for every lecture, and the information was really interesting. He was super accommodating and was very willing to help any time you needed it. Very likable and great teacher.",
                "strengths: lots of detailed explanations of theories behind speech and a lot of examples and walk through of the models in class, which were very helpful towards applying them outside of class. The theories also built on top of each other in a manner that makes a lot of sense. the professor is also very helpful during office hours.\r\nweaknesses: students would definitely benefit more from the class if they have prior taken another linguistic class or coding class, but those are not necessary."

Jason is a great professor and truly cares about his students and the subject. This course honestly made me consider double majoring in linguistics for a sec",
                "Absolutely. You'll have a great time and learn a lot. I am not a linguistics major, but I found this course accessible and very interesting. Jason is a great lecturer and knows so much about this field, so it's one of those opportunities to take a class with one of the experts on the subject material, plus he's a great teacher. Best of both worlds. the workload is not bad, so you don't have to worry about stacking it with other challenging classes. If you have any prior programming experience, much of the work will feel familiar and accessible, and if you do not, Jason walks you through it at a steady pace, so you can still learn and work it out.",
