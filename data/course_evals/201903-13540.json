    "This class is mainly a Naval history course: we learn about the \"maritime affairs\" or essentially, history of the US Navy from the American revolution to the modern era. We learned about Naval tactics and strategies that are used in wars and battles, which are interesting.",
    "Naval history",
    "Learned more about naval history and how it has shaped the US Navy as it is known today.",

    "Captain Grasdock did a good job of explaining all the information and telling us which information he would test us on. There's no guessing: the things he said would be on the test would be on the test, so we were easy to get prepared.",
    "I really liked when the class began with sea\/shore stories.",
    "It was straightforward and the professor was very reasonable, and willing to to engage with students. He also very much understood and respected our time.",
    "Access to PowerPoints was a big help, as it allowed me to review important material before exams. No weaknesses for me!",
    "Strengths: Engaging instructor who was constantly in communication with the midshipmen regarding class preparation. Learned much about the famous admirals and individuals who shaped our Navy today. \r\nWeakness: Obviously for zero credit, one does not find the 8AM class to be ideal.",
    "Went over the important details and very clear on what would be on tests, felt rushed a few times"

   "comments": [
    "Outside of NROTC midshipmen, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning more about Naval history. The course load is very little and your whole grade is dependent on the midterm and final, which is good because he basically tells you everything that's on it. The only thing that you would have to consider is the time; it is usually 8am or earlier but the Captain is very good at accommodating to students who can't make it that early.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes!",
    "It is a good course, but it is only offered this one time because sophomores not given option to study Mil History of the West."
