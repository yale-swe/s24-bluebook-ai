    "Yes if you read through the syllabus and like particular novels or authors. These works are supposed to be representative of modern J and B literature, and the course still has a survey course feel to it, but in-class discussion could certainly be very interesting. For comp lit & humanities people who have to take a course like this, I came in really didnt expect much from this course, but it grew on me and now Im so glad I took it. Prof Jacobowitz is so good at starting and keeping the discussion engaging.",
    "Yes; however, you get as much out as you put in (i.e. you don't have to read very closely, but it is a good selection of books)"
