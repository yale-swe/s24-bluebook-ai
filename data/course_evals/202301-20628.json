                "Learned about Native American history through an Indigenous lens and in contexts not usually known, gained skills in analysis of critical historical contexts.",
                "I learned more about Native American history and how it is integral to the formation of the United States and how America functions. As a Native American, I knew some of the topics discussed in class, but was surprised to learn about other topics and was introduced to historical events and legislation that I did not know about. I really appreciated the depth of which Federal Indian law was introduced with the Commerce Clause and the Marshall Trilogy. By taking the class for a writing credit, I was able to work more on limiting my passive voice.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths -- thorough slides and lectures, good network of support from TFs\r\nWeaknesses -- this class was structured weirdly. The lectures were very, very dense, and we were expected to take note of basically every single thing that Professor Blackhawk said and presented, which made it a little stressful to keep up with the lecture. We were given a sit-down midterm exam that was entirely dependent on memorization, so I didn't feel like the content was being taught in a very nuanced way - I would have preferred a take-home essay.",
                "Strengths: The class was not that much work and you can put in not that much effort to get a decent and even good grade. Professor Blackhawk is clearly very educated on Native history.  It is a very easy WR credit you probably do more writing in some non-WR classes. Also, the guest lecturers were AMAZING! I loved hearing from Native scholars.  Weaknesses: the lectures were so dry and boring and it felt like there was no reason to attend.  Attendance was not very high for the lectures, and you only needed to show up for the discussion section.  I was really interested in the subject and I honestly was disappointed with that aspect of the class.",
                "This class is designed to be a survey, so you cover a lot of time periods and cover a vast amount of material. It is very easy to follow along, but lectures can sometimes be a little drab. Otherwise, this course is excellent.",
                "This course could be improved by giving more in-depth PowerPoint notes that guide listeners and lists important concepts to take away.",
                "Super nice set up! Allowed me to focus on learning and enjoying to learn about material",
                "Strengths of this course include the TA's and Professor Blackhawk. No weaknesses of note.",
                "I think this course could improve through its accessibility. The lectures were not recorded and the lecture slides were not provided. Other than this it was a great course!",
                "I cannot think of any weaknesses in this course. I attended every lecture since I was so interested to learn through a chronological order of the history Prof. Blackhawk taught. I think the introduction of legal perspectives into the classroom was particularly fascinating since it defines much of the relationship between the U.S. government and Indigenous people.",
                "Biggest weakness was lecture it was honestly so boring and difficult to follow. Would not recommend. You could read the book and learn everything from lecture",
                "No weaknesses.",
                "Extremely important topic. Low workload which I really appreciated. Lectures were a bit dry not the most engaging lecture-style. I loved having the potential IDs/themes on the board at the beginning of each session; this made studying for exams very easy. Readings were engaging. My biggest critique is that lecture was pretty monotone despite the excitement and passion from Professor Blackhawk about his subject material.",
                "The lectures definitely could've used more structured. I felt like the first 50% of each lecture was on the first ID or two, and the rest were usually hurried.\r\n\r\nI think the strength is in the professor's knowledge of the material and the unique perspective it brings to American history. There's a lot of potential for this to be a fantastic course, and I think some more structured and engaging lectures could get it there.",
                "strengths: broad overview of an interesting historical topics. very good readings \r\nweaknesses: not very engaging lectures and many of the writing prompts were hard to understand.",
                "I would have appreciated more assignments in general beyond the first paper, midterm, and final. Otherwise, it was well taught and structured.",
                "Great Tas. More engaging lectures.",
                "It can be hard to stay focused during lecture, Professor Blackhawk talks about really interesting material, but his lecture style is not very engaging.",
                "Lecture is very boring and feels aimless. The professor also did not seem the most organized.",
                "Professor Blackhawk teaches through different mediums (powerpoints, his own book, guest speakers, films, etc.) which was great. I wish the powerpoints had more text on them, but if you pay attention during class, you'll get plenty of notes. He's really thorough in his content",
                "I found it very difficult to stay engaged in class. Strengths are giving us a roadmap of the class right before it starts. This class can be improved by the professor sharing his slides before class (it can even be moments before class starts, that's' ok) so I can follow along on my computer as it is on the big screen. It makes the material more accessible to me, because i can see it close and be more engaged to take more quality notes that way."

If you need a WR credit, TAKE IT YOU DON'T DO THAT MUCH WRITING!!!  If you want to learn about Native history in a good amount I would also take it because I believe the content of this class is so important to learn that it is worth it even though professor Blackhawk is a dry lecturer.  Also, Sergio is an amazing TA take his section!",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student--everyone should be literate in Indigenous history. It is an excellent way to get a writing credit or humanities credit and you practice critically examining sources. Professor Blackhawk and the teaching fellows also make sure everyone is able to explore Native history as it related to the present-day.",
                "Yes. This class gives a very insightful, reorienting look at American History that puts Native Americans in the forefront. It was engaging and enlightening.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course! Native history in the context of the US is so important to learn in full and this is the course at Yale that does that the best currently. The workload is manageable and this is also a good course to fulfill a writing credit.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The readings in this course provide a lot of insight and information. Professor Blackhawk's new book was very helpful in learning the content and contextualizing what was discussed in lecture. Additionally, the readings from Vine Deloria Jr.'s \"Custer Died for Your Sins\" and the article about Tribal Gaming were very helpful and important, as well.",
                "I think this course should be necessary for all students to take. I have told every single friend of mine about this course and strongly recommended it. Professor Blackhawk has a genuine style of teaching where he wishes to connect with the students and his joy in teaching comes across in the classroom.",
                "No, you may think the course material is interesting but the lecture is so boring you will wish you hadnt. Best recommendation is read the book",
                "Yes, without a doubt. Very interesting class.",
                "Yes, the themes were very important. I'm really grateful to leave Yale with a MUCH better understanding of Native American history.",
                "Yes purely out of subject material interest. I know there are some people who aren't interested in long lectures, and I would definitely not recommend them this course if that was the case.",
                "If you are interested in the topic, yes.",
                "Yes, I would. Professor Blackhawk's passion for the subject is contagious and incredible to witness in lecture.",
                "Yes- good class.",
                "Absolutely - the course is taught by a professor that leads in telling the history of the United States from the perspective of American Indians across centuries. The class is well organized, and my TF was fantastic and made the class worthwhile. Professor Blackhawk is a great man to meet & learn from!",
                "The teaching style was a bit difficult to acclimate to, but I would suggest this course to non-Native students who are looking to get a general sense of Native history. It's a good survey course if this is your first introduction to Native history.",
                "I would because I think the material covered in the class is very important and needs to be discussed more.",
                "Yes! Indigenous history and politics are so buried in this university, and the work that this class does is urgently needed. I know that many folks take this for the lower workload and have issues with the content presentation, but if you stay present for the lecture, there is much to learn. Professor Blackhawk is generous and he is really thoughtful in his teaching.",
                "A lot of people really enjoyed the class. I am not one of them though. I was interested in native history and wanted to learn more, but the class wasn't engaging and I lost interest.",
