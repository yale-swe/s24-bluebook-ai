    "Semi-advanced spanish grammar, improved writing\/reading\/speaking skills",
    "Developed my comfortability speaking, writing, and listening\/understanding spanish",
    "More than anything, my Spanish speaking skills were developed over the course of the semester. Since no English is ever spoken in class for 50 minutes a day there really is no other way than up when it comes to speaking. And since speaking eventually came easier, these skills carried over into writing too.",
    "Yes my spanish developed.",
    "I got a lot of practice speaking, reading, and writing in Spanish. Grammar was mostly review, although there were some new concepts, especially towards the end of the semester.",
    "I learned more about Spanish vocabulary and grammar.",
    "I learned advanced Spanish grammar. Pretty much all the grammar skills to more or less be considered fluent."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength is varied class activities and content (ex. movies, books, articles). Weakness is the significant amount of relatively useless busywork the class makes students perform.",
    "Prof. Njera was great, though I felt at times she was stuck with an unreasonable course structure that she did not create herself. The end of the year got a little ridiculous with somewhat useless assignments piling up.",
    "This course provided its students a daily opportunity to totally surround themselves with Spanish, leading to a steep learning curve in the students' abilities. Also, test formats allowed students the freedom to show their control over the language through their free response questions. As for weaknesses, there was a constant feeling of doing busywork and tediousness at times but understandably so as it is a 1.5 credit class. Also, while the class time seemed balanced between speaking to the teacher and between peers, I feel as though the latter was more beneficial to the development of speaking skills, since speaking directly to the professor may deter some students from dialogue.",
    "This course was very structured I felt like I was being taught by a robot who was scared to do anything against the course packet at anytime.",
    "The course provides a good space to learn and practice Spanish. One of the difficulties seems to be that the syllabus is developed by DUS and does not seem to leave that much leeway for individual professors to build their class. My professor was new to the program and thus did not seem to have full knowledge\/control over the assignments. Additionally, some of the assignments are not very clearly explained in the syllabus and course packet, which can make for unpleasant surprises during the semester.",
    "It was helpful to speak Spanish every day, but sometimes the discussion questions or activities were not really engaging and I would get bored.",
    "I believe this course achieves fluency at least on paper of students; however, the amount of content and the speed with which it is covered is a massive weakness in that I feel students are not given enough time to gain a comprehensive understanding of concepts in class. You get into class, start working, and all of a sudden class is done. I hoped that I wouldn't have felt rushed through the many many tenses we learned."

   "comments": [
    "As an L4 class it is necessary for those seeking to learn Spanish at Yale. It isn't a blast, but it is not remotely bad enough to justify switching languages.",
    "For students who need to take it to fulfill their language requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to make serious improvement in the language at the cost of constant assessments and busywork.",
    "If you are willing to dedicate a lot of time and be a little bit bored you can learn spanish this way.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone looking to learn Spanish. To fulfill a language requirement alone, it is not the easiest course, but if you put in a little time every day and participate in the class, the course offers a real opportunity to improve your Spanish. Without daily practice and planning, however, those who have never been in an all-spanish class before (like me) may find it challenging to perform well on the exams and larger assignments, even if daily ones are not as difficult.",
    "I would recommend the course because you can speak Spanish and make some good friends.",
    "Yes, but I would tell them that it requires a very high level of commitment to get results from."
