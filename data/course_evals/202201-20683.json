Nothing valuable was gained during lecture time, and the time would have been better spent taking any other course. We somewhat covered drawings, statics, and materials, but what was learned was different than what the actual statics class 280 taught. It was the same material, but taught in a much more confusing way. A common thought was to not use what was learned in lecture, and instead use what online resources taught. Overall, the material covered in this class SHOULD be interesting, but it was not taught in that way at all. Ive heard from numerous sojurces to take this course with Professor Kramer instead. Do not take it with Professor Dollar.",

In addition, it deepened my understanding of statics through the various ways we applied statics calculations in problems, as from those problems, I was able to gain experience solving for forces in engineering-specific situations. The course also introduced the area of materials science by introducing the ideas of strength, yield, and deformation and applying those concepts in calculation problems. In the weekly labs, I gained experience CADing and designing using a laser cutter, and I had the opportunity to apply the concepts I learned in class to projects.",

                "Strengths: The labs are really fun, and a lot of the content is genuinely interesting. The workload is generally relatively low, and getting a good grade is quite achievable. Weaknesses: The course was definitely somewhat disorganized throughout the entire process. Due dates, assignments, and labs would often change and would be due in batches with long spans of minimal work in between.",
                "Strengths were that it had many interesting labs and topics. Weaknesses was that it was poorly organized and lacked structure as well as practice.",
                "There is zero consistency in this course in terms of workload, lectures, and examinations. The grading scheme feels completely randomized. However, the course content is diversified and interesting for the most part.",
                "I'm a physics major, and this course confused me about the fundamentals of physics. I think more detailed walkthroughs of how to solve statics problems would have gone a long way towards helping me understand the course material more. As it was, I feel that almost all of what I learned was self-taught.",
                "Strengths: Material was interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were often confusing because the professor often had trouble doing the problems in front of the class and the labs were often very boring because we just sat around for parts to be laser cut for us for about 2\/3 of the lab session.",
                "This course was great. I really enjoyed that there were so many assignments so that messing up once did not destroy your overall grade. I believe the Professor did a great job lecturing, specifically during the materials science unit. Hector, the TF, was amazing. He never failed to help out a student in need during the lab. Overall, I think I also had a chance to apply my learning in a tangible way I never have before. The grading was generally fair, and I believe working hard allowed you to achieve great grades in the end. Problem sets are also great preparation for exams.",
                "Teaching is kind of a mess, Professor clearly doesnt really care about the class.  The way that labs are competitions just fosters an unhealthy environment and is kind of discouraging.  Psets arent scheduled and are due whenever the Professor wants.",
                "I think the lecture time could be more helpful as a lot of time was spent doing problems that most of the time didnt explain how to apply our concepts clearly.",
                "Not as much communication (especially in advance) as I might have wanted. Good level of difficulty and engagement though.",
                "The weakness of this course was Professor Dollar and the support of this course. In plain words, Professor Dollar just does not teach (well). It often seems as though he has come to class unprepared and is winging it. The board is always a mess with equations because he chooses to immediately plug in for unknowns rather than leaving things in variable form and plugging in at the end. Therefore, the work on the board is often wrong. The other biggest weakness was the lack of support in this course. There were NO ULAs to ask questions, and no office hours. If one needed help, there was no one to turn to except classmates and YouTube. Professor Dollar himself also refused to help. Finally, while the lab component of this course could have been fun, it was not planned well. Every lab required using a laser cutter (I would have enjoyed using numerous machines rather than just the same one), but we didnt even learn how to use it. Instead, we would sit there for hours in lab waiting for our TA to laser cut our parts out for us. It was not a good use of time to sit at lab from 7-10pm waiting for the TA to laser cut our parts.",
                "The professor clearly did not care about the course and did not have a great plan for the curriculum.",
                "Strengths: Hands-on experience\r\n\r\nWeakness: Wish labs had more real-life applications.",
                "There are no strengths to this course.\r\nAnything that wasn't a \"weakness\" was mediocre.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are many : \r\nProfessor Dollar did a poor job of explaining\/demonstrating example problems in class. He also was dismissive towards students questions, which made it pointless to ask him things. Most times he didn't solve the entirety of the solution out, and there were times were he himself got confused and sorta gave up on a problem altogether. \r\nNeither the professor nor the TF held any office hours, nor were there ULAs, or peer tutors. The psets were fairly difficult and confusing, and the lack of additional help definitely affected our ability to learn or understand the concepts. In addition, Dollar did not have solutions for the psets, or an appropriate number of peer-graders which meant that we didn't get to review our homework against a solution sheet or get feedback until ~3 days before our exams, when the TF would grade our psets or post a solution sheet he had made himself. Most of these things could all have been helped if the professor had planned out the semester's content - the labs, potential times for office hours, psets and solutions - before the semester began.  \r\n\r\n3\/4 labs we did this semester were just laser-cutting acrylic; the labs could've had more variety. On top of that, we ourselves never learned to use the laser cutter; in a majority of our 3 hour labs we spent the time waiting for the TF to cut the acrylic pieces out so we could test them. If we had learned to do this on our own, or the pieces had been prepped outside of lab, we would've been able to devote more time to improving our designs.\r\nThat said, the TF didn't have time to do this, and he was the only person to run 2 3-hr labs for ~30 students. He was definitely overworked, and I feel that he alone carried the course this semester.  There should have been another TF to help run the course.",
                "The strengths are the labs which are very fun and engaging and relate well to the topics discussed in class. A main weakness could be the pace of the course, which at times felt very slow for some units while sped up for others.",
                "Professor didnt know exactly what was going on",
                "The strength of this course are the lab projects taught by Hector, the fantastic TA who saved this course, and the shop training done by Nick (the metal working shop manager), who is one of the best people Ive met at Yale. The weakness is Professor Dollar, who made it very clear that he did not care about this course, his students, or our learning.",
                "The material in this class is not very cohesive and the labs were sometimes fun but mostly unhelpful.  What we learned in class did not apply to them in a meaningful way.",
                "I think the strengths of this course are its wide range of topics covered and its lab aspect. The wide range of topics covered allowed students to gain a good understanding about the field of mechanical engineering and it made it so that students could tackle projects in the labs where focusing deeply on only a few topics would have otherwise prevented them from doing so. And I think having the weekly labs was extremely helpful to learning and it provided a way for students to apply their learning. The labs gave students the chance to take what they learned and expand upon it, and it emphasized the real-world aspect of engineering by helping to develop skills of designing and testing. A weakness in my opinion was the section on statics. The material was taught in a way where the professor presented only one or two problems a class and spent the whole class working through those problems, which I think was not the best use of time as not only were we not able to get through a lot of problems but it also did not encourage a high level of engagement from the students. I think one thing that could be tried is to have the students work in groups on a list of problems after the professor goes over the general concepts to better promote engagement. Another weakness was that assignments were often not returned in a timely manner, which made reviewing for mistakes difficult.",
                "The lab portion of the class was great and led very well; the class portion was often unorganized and didn't lead to any substantive knowledge."

                "Yes, I would. The class has an interesting structure in which you cover three different units across the year and learn a lot about all three. You have an awesome opportunity to use the lessons learned in lecture in the lab setting. Although the midterms were somewhat difficult, you could study hard for them and still perform well. This class is very unique, and I enjoyed it. Throughout the course, I did sometimes feel very anxious regarding how I would perform on assignments, but the professor and TF did an excellent job in helping all students prepare so they could do very well.",

                "No. Even if this is a required class for Mechanical Engineering students, I would recommend all students just take 280 and 400 instead so that they'll be unable to take this course. Those classes are more comprehensive and respectively, they give students a deeper understanding and better practice with concepts\/problems of mechanics, statics, bending, and Solidworks.\r\n\r\nThis class felt like a waste of my time and efforts, and it contributed a lot to my own stress and anxiety. I regret taking this course, because I have gained nothing from this course, from the labs or the lessons, that makes me proud to have taken it.",

                "Take this course when anyone except Aaron Dollar is teaching it. I arrived to this class every day with hope and left angry every time. I think most students in the class could have done a better job teaching it. The labs are quite fun and Hector is great. The material is interesting if taught by someone who cares at all.",
                "I would not recommend this class to another student.  It seems like this class covers material which could easily be covered in other, more advanced meng classes.  I do not think it should be a requisite of the degree.",

The course gives a lot of information on different areas of the field and as an introductory class, it has a large focus on applications through its weekly labs which promotes a high level of engagement."
