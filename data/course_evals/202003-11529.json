Extensive readings of primary sources also allowed the class to study the causes\/impacts\/reality of these trends.",

I also appreciated having the option of either taking a final exam or writing a research paper.

I did not know a lot about France or French history going in, but I was interested in history and European history in particular. Without some type of broad interest going in, you might not like this class. Second, for a lecture class, this courses workload was a bit on the heavy side. About 150 pages of reading per week, a discussion section, two 6 page papers and a final research paper\/exam, so if youre not interested in the subject matter the work might seem even greater than it is. That being said, I found the workload manageable and the course fascinating. You get to study Louis XIV, slavery in the New World, Protestant virtue, and other interesting topics.",
