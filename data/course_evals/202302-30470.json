This class also provided a review of some of the concepts that I had learned in previous classes. For example, I had an improved understanding of gyroscopes after this class. \r\n\r\nI think the primary weakness of this course was the pacing, which was likely a result of this being an accelerated summer course. For instance, sometimes it would be difficult to receive clarification on feedback (between lab reports due within a few days of each other), especially at the beginning of the course."
