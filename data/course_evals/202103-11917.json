            "comments": [
                "A strength is that there's a good spread of difficulty on p-sets: most p-set problems are straightforward, but there are \"funzies\" for an extra challenge/additional exploration that are interesting but entirely optional.\r\n\r\nA weakness is the pacing  at the beginning, the pace was definitely \"intro to proof\"-worthy, but for the sake of covering the content it entered maybe-slightly-toned-down-from-\"standard\" math class pace, which I think caught a lot of people off guard.",
                "Everything about the course was amazing. The way Pat taught, the material he covered, the assignments he gave were all amazing and helpful for my understanding of linear algebra. The only way it could be improved is making more problems for us similar to the type given on the midterms, as I think that some of the PSETs had nothing to do with the midterms and it was hard to figure out good problems to study.",
                "The course is taught extremely well and has a phenomenal support system. Pat (the instructor) was very good at explaining during lectures and was always available outside of class to help out. Plus, the course encourages collaboration which is great for figuring out how all of the concepts fit together. A decent amount of work does need to be put into the problem sets but, if you do that, the concepts all fit together very well and it makes a huge difference.",
                "Strengths: Pat is great! Lectures were fun and problem sets were extremely well-designed. The workload was manageable. Undergraduate Learning Assistants (ULAs) did a great job. Everyone (professor, TFs, ULAs) was very supportive. Weaknesses: PSET grades came back super late - I think student graders were procrastinating on it, and Pat probably took over in the end... Pat doesn't respond to a lot of emails so just talk to him after class!",
                "Supportive teacher and ULAs",
                "The work load was balanced, and the lectures were fun. No weakness.",
                "Strengths: Pat, Pat, Pat..is awesome. One of the best profs I've had a Yale, and definitely the best teacher of any quantitative subject I've ever taken. The man should win every teaching prize at Yale.\r\nWeaknesses: The psets at the beginning of the semester were too much. Pat scaled them down half way through, but it made managing my other courses very difficult.",
                "The course was well taught and Pat is a great and engaging teacher. Some of the assignments weren't graded until a long time after I submitted them, though, so the feedback would have been more useful when I remembered the problems better and could use the feedback on my other assignments.",
                "This class assumes no experience in writing mathematical proofs, which helps make doing math feel more accessible as an FGLI person (!!!) and less elitist (i.e., favoring those who had access to math opportunities and resources in high school). Indeed, the first few lessons are dedicated solely to teaching you how to write a rigorous proof, using examples that assume no linear algebra knowledge whatsoever (just basic stuff with integers). This philosophy of inclusion among Pat and the ULAs lent a warm, welcoming atmosphere to this class that really helped me settle into math as an FGLI person who had really bad impostor syndrome. (I eventually decided to major in pure math because of this class and because of the huge support system Pat and the ULAs foster! :) At first, the workload was extremely unmanageable since Pat was essentially recycling psets from the discontinued MATH 230 and 231 (which largely assumed proof-writing experience). After a while, advocacy from Matt (the best ULA!!!) helped bring the workload down to a more manageable level more befitting of an introduction to writing proofs, which this class is and should be. Of course, Pat and Matt wont be at Yale anymore next year, but I wholeheartedly hope that whoever teaches this course in the future will continue to foster the welcoming and inclusive learning environment that Pat and Matt did.",
                "Strength:\r\nPat is very kind and funny. He's generally flexible about ddl. Pat uploads his notes and lecture recording to Canvas which is really convenient.\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\n1. The class is not very well organized. There are some very important concepts that only or first appear in pset before appearing in lecture. There isn't much transition or explanation between different concepts, at the end of the semester I just felt lost and didn't know why this is important.\r\n2. I have many strong complaints about the lack of feedback in this course. There are 9 pset this semester, 1-3 covers the material on midterm 1, 4-6 on midterm 2, and 7-9 on final. However, I did not receive any feedback of pset 3-7 before midterm 2. No answer key, no graded assignment. This really messes up my review because I don't even know whether I did right or wrong on my pset. Pat did grade Pset 3-8 during reading period, but I haven't got my pset 9 feedback yet. I'm sure Pat is a nice professor, but as a student I need more than having fun in class, I need feedback so that I know how did I do and how can I improve.",
                "Weaknesses: The workload at the beginning. Assignments started out hard for the sake of being hard, and many of us would spend sleepless nights ripping our hair out on the questions.\r\nStrengths: Everything else; Pat's receptiveness to feedback, his dedication to support his students, the ULAs, etc. Fortunately, Pat noticed how daunting the work was, and he lightened the pset load after a few weeks. After this, the psets and exams became doable, even enjoyable on some occasions. Overall, Pat is an incredibly engaging lecturer. Every class he puts on an amazing show, and his post-lecture notes are incredibly elegant. I have to applaud the amazing support system the class offered. Pat and ULAs would hold office hours every afternoon to evening where classmates could meet each other, work together through the math problems, and walk out as new friends. \r\nImprovements: I guess the only improvement would be to keep the workload manageable from the very start. Other than that, MATH 225 was a phenomenal course!",
                "Strengths: Learn a lot of math. All information seems to be presented pretty elegantly and intelligibly, I could often grasp course content quickly. In case you get stuck, there are so many safety nets (your peers, Pat after class, office hours, Ed, TAs, textbook, etc). \r\n\r\nWeakness: We didn't explore applications much. Where possible, I would give applications a 1-2 minute acknowledgment at the end of lectures. Nothing major.",
                "Strengths: GREAT GREAT GREAT PROFESSOR PLEASE YALE NEEDS TO HIRE PAT FULL TIME. Weaknesses: At the beginning Psets were a lot, and there is frankly a lot of work you need to do outside of class to really internalize the concepts. Also, this course can feel a little removed from reality so if you prefer that 222 is probably a better fit. However the strengths are also the really collaborative environment and how well the course is broken up into really digestible bite size pieces.",
                "Strengths: Attitude towards mathematics and math culture. The course fosters collaborative learning and collective understanding of the key concepts. Peers in the class don't feel like competitors (which is THE big issue in many STEM courses at Yale), they feel like partners working to achieve mutual understanding. I enjoyed this course more than any other math class I have ever taken and more than any other STEM course at Yale. The professor is largely responsible for creating this environment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Office hours are mostly for working on problem sets with other students; I feel that students should be comfortable asking questions about the material or more advanced topics in the course during office hours.",
                "Strengths \r\n- Fun psets\r\n- Very manageable in terms of time\r\n- Fair exams",
                "Classes went fast, but they were accessible. Notes were always posted online which was very helpful. Pat's energy and enthusiasm made this class very fun and always a joy to attend. The psets were originally very hard and time-consuming, and I would spend my days in office hours. Then, Pat made the psets less intensive, and they no longer overwhelmed my life. However, I became less and less comfortable with how the material on our psets related to what we were learning in class, or what the concepts were that we were supposed to be taking away from our psets. One weakness of this class is the lack of feedback on psets. Many were only graded at the end of the semester, and it would have been nice to have the feedback. However, going to office hours was also a very good way of getting feedback and understanding how to improve, and I did not often feel the lack of feedback from psets.",
                "Strength: Pat is amazing\r\nWeakness: content is a bit elementary",
                "At the beginning of the semester, the workload was very intense because you were being introduced to new concepts while also having to figure out how to do proofs at the same time, but if you have prior background this should be easier for you. This is also not the fault of the professor, who was absolutely incredible, but it takes a very long time to receive feedback on homework.",
                "Psets difficulty in the beginning",
                "The course is well organized and the notes Pat post help a lot. The last couple pset could get pretty bashy in terms of arithmetic though.",
                "The course goes at a nice pace and the homeworks and assessments are fair. The course can be challenging working independently and it is important to have peers you can work with.",
                "Strengths: Pat is extremely passionate about teaching. Many OH and each TA and TF was super helpful. Pat is the best professor in the entire department. Hes very organized, knowledgeable and supportive",
                "The course is generally well-taught, well-paced, and well-structured. I do wish we had gotten a bit of a better sense of how all the concepts tied together and the other implications, especially geometric and spatial, of the ideas and definitions we were dealing with.",
                "No real weaknesses and Pat is an amazing teacher and makes every class fun and exciting",
                "Sometimes, treating the material casually, as if it's no big deal, makes it approachable, actually does, in fact, make it easier. Sometimes, though, it makes you feel like you're an idiot for not getting it. It seems hard to distinguish. Err on the side of caution.\r\n\r\nOh, and feedback on assignments MUST come earlier.",
                "Strengths  covered material, lots of help available\r\nWeaknesses  fast-paced, large time commitment",
                "The course was a consuming amount of work once the proofs switched from introductory to linear algebra focused. Pat is very reasonable, and he lowered the workload after he realized that it was taking us over 15 hours a pset, but it proved very discouraging when it happened. I would also have liked a few more application-based problems. Although I feel like I gained a really strong theoretical understanding, I do not feel as confident in being able to apply that knowledge to other subjects.",
                "Pat was very engaging and the problem sets were very enjoyable to do.",
                "This course was great, it made me feel very welcome and comfortable. The psets and exams were rewarding and reasonable.",
                "Strengths: Pat is a great professor and does a good job at teaching the class. There's a lot of support from TAs and you get a lot of rigor in understanding proofs. Weaknesses: Problem sets took a long time to grade, the psets would occasionally be way too hard. Some aspects felt rushed as well.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Pat is extremely engaging.\r\n- From the \"daily warm-up\" to the problem sets, the material is put together so so fluidly.\r\n- Pat gives detailed feedback on exams.\r\n- Pat adjusted the workload mid-semester to accommodate his students. Absolutely stellar dude.\r\n- TAs were AWESOME. Seriously. Best TAs I've had.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Exams are tough.\r\n- PSETs are graded very late, so make sure you do your work on them on the front end, because the feedback you get won't be until much later.",
                "Pat is an amazing teacher (I know he's leaving though, so I won't dwell too much on this). The class was definitely very difficult for me, but I found a good community at office hours, so struggling through psets and making concept webs for exams was actually enjoyable...in a sort of masochistic way.",
                "I would say that a strength of the course was the fact that all the notes/lectures were uploaded to canvas allowing for easier review. Office hours were also extremely helpful. I would say that a weakness could be that the problem sets in the beginning of the course often felt excessively challenging, but in general, I would say they were fair. I would also say that slow grading was a significant weakness of this course that seems to be a recurring problem every year.",
                "I think the psets take a little long to grade, and having those grades back before midterms would be helpful for studying.",
                "Strengths: content is easy to follow, good support system for students, clear expectations and structure, but also not a cakewalk\r\nWeaknesses: grading is somewhat slow but it doesn't affect the learning experience in any significant way",
                "A strength of the course is the sequence of material, as each unit relatively builds on the last making very logical leaps in understanding which aids the smooth learning process. A weakness of this course is the subjectiveness of it, as no concrete answer is ever given for non-arithmetic based proofs and therefore feedback is difficult to receive and comprehend.",
                "Professor Devlin conveyed this complex material in a step-wise accessible manner. As I explained in the previous question, I felt like this course was an excellent introduction to proof-based math which can be intimidating to approach for the first time, and Professor Devlins logical approach to teaching this central skill was effective in allowing students to build comfort with increasingly complex content. At the top of each problem set, Professor Devlin wrote, you are STRONGLY (in all caps) encouraged to collaborate with your peers, which became one of the highlights of the course  I felt like I learned so much and got so much more out of the course by learning from my peers than if I had tried to struggle through the material myself.",
                "The strengths are definitely the organization of the class and the professor's liveliness while teaching it. There weren't many weaknesses apart from very time consuming problem sets towards the beginning of the course.",
                "This course is rigorous and (in my opinion) meant for someone who has already taken linear algebra and is looking for a more advanced understanding. This means that it goes above and beyond any beginner-level math course, but does not take time to assist people who are learning linear algebra for the first time. A major weakness of this course is how frequently important topics would be mentioned briefly, and then we'd be expected to have them ready to go in our back pockets on problem sets, without any example problems or practice with the basics. The people I knew who succeeded best in this class were people who had already taken linear algebra or similarly advanced math. The most recent math class I had taken was multivariable calc, and I always felt behind.",
                "Pat is an amazing teacher, very engaging, and accessible for help outside of class. Max and Matt were awesome TAs. The course moved very fast at first and was very hard to keep up with. It got more reasonable throughout the semester, and Psets were finally more manageable."

                "If you've never done proofs before and you'd like to give it a shot, this is the class for you.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the topic or want to try proof based math you should take this course.",
                "Yes. For anyone who has the slightest interest in proof based mathematics I would heavily advise them to take this course. It was absolutely amazing.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in math or linear algebra (especially if you might be interested in proofs). The course is taught very well and the work is satisfying to complete and does not feel like too much.",
                "Yes, if you're excited about proof-based math! And any of Pat's courses in general!",
                "I would recommend students take this course if they are willing to spend additional time internalizing the fundamentals of linear algebra. Especially after Pat modified the psets halfway through the semester to make them less time consuming, I felt like I had a much worse intuition for why linear algebra worked, and I wouldve preferred we stayed with the original style of psets in order to develop a better intuition for linear algebra",
                "Yes! Love Pat.",
                "Absolutely, yes. It seems to me that people take this course for one of two reasons: (1) they are a math major or considering a math major, or (2) they have to do it because of physics/economic/cs etc. I was in camp (2). I was dreading this course, and it completely surpassed all of my expectations. I've never considered myself a \"math person.\" Full disclosure, I'm a junior and I haven't touched math since BC calc in high school. But Pat teaches it in such a way that you don't have to be a \"math person\" to feel comfortable in the course. Yeah, the first few weeks were sucked, and this course took over my life. But I was lucky to have a fantastic pset group (Pat will help you find one if you don't have one) and slowly, it got easier and I became more confident. Once you start to realize you CAN think in this way, it becomes really exciting. I remember the first time I solved a pset question on my own (without OH or my study group) and feeling so accomplished. By the end of the semester, while I certainly wasn't walking out of exams after 1 hr like some people, I was doing the thing and not doing it terribly at all. This is really all because Pat teaches the material in the least intimidating way. He really wants you to understand and LOVE linear algebra. I would also plug 3blue1brown's \"essence of linear algebra\" youtube playlist. That was crucial for my geometric intuition, along with Pat's excellent teaching.\r\n\r\nOverall, please don't be like me and be scared to take math at Yale just because you're not a math prodigy. As Pat will remind you literally every day, you are awesome, and you should be in Math 225!!!",
                "Yes! Linear algebra is really interesting, and this was a great way to get better at proofs. Also, Pat is really cool!",
                "I gained so much out of this course as a pure math major and would unreservedly recommend it to anyone considering the major (it solidified my decision to major in pure math, something I as an FGLI person had been having second thoughts about before taking this class!). My friends majoring in physics also got a lot out of this class. Meanwhile, Ive heard from friends in more applied majors like S&DS, economics, and computer science that the mathematical rigor in this course and its theoretical nature may be a bit superfluous unless youre also considering majoring in math; the psets in 222 are lighter and more computational, which might better suit what youre actually trying to learn linear algebra for. For humanities majors other than philosophy, I would not recommend the course unless youd really, really like to learn about this stuff and are prepared for the workload.",
                "Only yes if you only care about having a fun, flexible, nerdy professor. No if you care about getting feedback.",
                "Not sure. Since Pat is leaving, I would proceed with caution. Whoever the next professor is to teach the course, I guess look at their evaluation history. Though they may not be Pat, if they are able to engage students and teach material well, then by all means go for it! Linear algebra itself is a beautiful subject. Regardless, I would be mindful of the workload. A first proof-based math class can be a time sink for many students. Definitely shop the MATH 225 and try out the assignments before you decide on taking it.",
                "Yes! It's a really elegant proof-based math course. It's necessary for any Math major, STEM people would benefit from the knowledge it provides, and everyone should try at least one proof-based math course. So much fun!",
                "Yes, I think its a great course to introduce yourself to proof-writing!",
                "Yes, but only if you're really really sure you want/need it. This is not a course to be taken on a whim, there's probably a lot of other ways to stress yourself out. If you do need it it is really not as bad as other required courses so that is good, overall would recommend as a good way to get your mind thinking along the lines of proofs and get yourself into the world of linear algebra if there's a reason you'll need it later.",
                "Absolutely. If you want a solid introduction to proof-based math and an excellent learning environment, take this course.",
                "Absolutely, the class is taught extremely well and provides a deeper look into the real world of mathematics",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It is an accessible course to anyone, whether you are planning to major in math or not, and Pat and all the teaching assistants will make you feel welcome and supported! I took this class on a whim and had a really wonderful time. It is very work intensive, so do not take it if you know you will not enjoy proofs, or if you already have an overloaded semester. I took four classes, and this class is what kept me stressed.",
                "Yes. You learn a decent amount. Pat is great. the TAs are great. Problems are fun",
                "I would recommend this course to someone with Pat as the professor.  It was a great introduction to proof-writing and linear algebra concepts taught in a very accepting and friendly environment.",
                "Yes, Pat is great!",
                "Yes, this course is great for understanding linear algebra and mathematical proofs, and Pat is a great professor.",
                "Yeseven for non-math majors this is a good course to adjust your thinking mathematically and learn an interesting area of math.",
                "I definitely would if Pat teaches it",
                "No",
                "Sure! If you think you like proofs, logic, and spatial reasoning, then 100%. If not, might be tougher and less fun. But it def has the capacity to be a hard yet interesting and fun math class, and Pat and the TAs are very kind, very understanding, and very passionate about getting the material into your head however works best for you.",
                "Yes! Its so amazing and especially with Pat teaching the class its a 11/10.",
                "If you want to do higher level math, of course.",
                "Yes, but only if you're seriously interested in math or are a math major  it's too difficult otherwise.",
                "This is necessary for many people, so lots of people dont have a choice. I think so, but as long as they recognize its a lot of work. I was lucky with Pat, but I dont think he will be teaching the course again.",
                "Yes! This course was very interesting, psets fun and Pat was a great teacher!",
                "If Pat were still teaching, I would recommend this course with my full heart and soul. As it is, I think the material is still great.",
                "If Pat teaches the course, I highly recommend if you are looking to get into proof-based math and a more in-depth understanding of linear algebra along with planning to explore more math classes. If just needed as a requirement, you should probably take a computational linear algebra.",
                "YES.",
                "I'd really recommend it with Pat particularly, but regardless, yes. proofs are interesting to learn--more difficult, perhaps, but primarily just very different than the math I knew in highschool. I think it's nice to take a proof-based class once.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Linear algebra is a great math subject, and the professor was really engaging.",
                "Yes, because I think learning to write proofs is really important no matter what someone is studying.",
                "Yes. Linear algebra is pretty important, and this course is a good way to learn it. The content and structure are quite clear, and the challenge level is gonna be just right for most people. You won't glance at a pset and know right away how to do it, but if you work at it you will generally start to understand better and know more. Also, there's a lot of office hours and the TAs are solid. For anyone interested in what's going on beneath the hood of linear algebra, I'd say 225 > 222.",
                "I would recommended this course to another student as the concept of math based proofs is important to u sweat and for higher math and that area of the course is taught very well.",
                "I already have! This is a fantastic course with a manageable workload that gives students a solid understanding of, interest in, and passion for math. And Professor Devlin was the highlight of the course. I highly recommend that anyone with an interest in math take a course with him.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student looking to get an introduction into proof writing and the world of mathematics. It serves as a good introduction without getting too deep into a lot of mathematics content to test the waters a bit.",
                "I would not recommend this to people who have an interest in math but do not plan to major in it. This class made me feel like I didn't know anything, and stamped out my previous love of math. Perhaps this is my own personal experience of not understanding the class, but I think everyone should be warned that a quick understanding of the material is required to succeed. The lectures are entirely the professor giving us new information, and then we are expected to immediately apply that knowledge on the problem sets. This means that if you are struggling during lecture, you will have to attend lots of office hours to get through the problem sets. For people who love math, office hours can be a fun opportunity, but they quickly started feeling like a chore to me. You should be prepared to put in a good amount of work into this class, but success if definitely possible for those who are committed.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course as a challenging math class and great intro to the math major. However, it is very challenging, be prepared to do a lot of work."
