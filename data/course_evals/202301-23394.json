From this class, I feel much more capable of tackling a senior thesis from proposal to data analysis. Additionally, was exposed to a wide range of sociological research.",

                "Prof. Menon put a lot of effort into the course material and making great slides. The quiz structure was refreshing and assignments were well paced. Sometimes the readings went a little too over my head and I would have loved to take a step back and break them down a little more without assuming a lot of previous knowledge and understanding.",
                "Good for sociology majors. I now feel prepared to do interviews/surveys and write a proposal for the IRB. Readings felt a bit random, to the point where sometimes I felt like I learned very little from the course. There have been other methods courses (like Visual Sociology) where I felt like I learned more.",
                "honestly almost all strengths. Subject matter was super cool, most of the readings were interesting or engaging. The only real weakness I felt was the lack of in-class coverage of the actual nuts and bolts of writing the proposal. We kinda just read some proposals and a thesis and left it at that.",
                "Very broad overview- glad that it exposed me to so many methods but I wish we had been able to dive deeper into case studies! My favorite part of the class was reading and analyzing other social science works.",
                "One of the strengths of this class was that the class was often broken into mixed partner work and lecture which made it easier to engage in class. The quizzes for mere check-ins were also helpful for refreshing our knowledge without fear of demerits. I also liked that we could design and interview and survey ourselves and receive feedback on it. Overall the course felt very organized!",
                "I appreciated the hands-on focus of this course, that it focused a lot on reading real papers and applying those ideas in class activities such as the group interview, and that it was fluid and covered a broad range of research as a survey without feeling superficial."

                "Yes! I knew nothing about SOCY before taking this class and now I feel much better equipped to explore the field more. I know this class is meant for junior SOCY majors prepping for their theses, so don't expect to get in easily, but if you can weasel in you'll love it.",
                "Its required for the major, so yes. But overall course was interesting! Talking about all the different methods can get a little tedious, but loved the leminar format and the end of the class, where we all talked about our own projects and different ideas, was fun and engaging. Prof Menon is great. Would recommend.",
                "Only if they are in the sociology major or interested in qualitative research methods for another field of study, like Urban Studies.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone that wants to conduct any type of research on societal phenomenon. It provides the basic outline for how to organize a research project and gives you a deep understanding of tools you would need along the research.",
                "I already have recommended this course to other students, contingent that if they should take it for a solid base in sociology, that they should strive to take it with Professor Menon."
