                "I absolutely loved how this class was led by student presentations every week. We were able to learn in depth about one topic and then present it to our classmates. Then, we could discuss with each other and ask questions. Professor Lockhart was always ready to ask us questions and engage with us!",
                "I liked how engaging and fun the course was. Every week, a couple students presented on one of the \"ABCs of learning,\" which included mechanisms like using Analogies (A) and Just-in-Time Telling (T). The presentations were really interactive, with psychological experiments, quizzes and discussion questions embedded. I feel like I will remember practical use cases for many of these mechanisms far in the future because of how well-done the presentations were! The only drawback is that we didn't have much of an opportunity to apply what we learned, which is something I would have liked to see. Our final paper was a mock curriculum, but it would have been cool if we actually had a chance at some point to practice teaching via one of the mechanisms.",
                "A strength of this course was a strong syllabus of readings as well as an intuitive and helpful sequence of topics.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was the over-reliance on student presentations. Each class consisted of nearly two hours worth of student presentations.",
                "Strengths: Easy to follow format, very engaging with EDST scholars, balances psychology and education studies fantastically! Easy to manage workload. Love that it met once a week; classes seemed to fly because of how interesting the content was and being able to apply personal experience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More direction on final assignment.",
                "Absolutely flawless class.",
                "I wish more of the teaching was done by Professor Lockhart! She is very knowledgeable and clearly has a lot to share. The format of the class meant that every class was a student presentation. While this allowed us to all be teachers ourselves, it also meant our quality of learning was up to the presenters of the day.",
                "Strengths: the thought questions always felt very relevant and interesting to write about, and the student presentations were very engaging + helping in  understanding what the actual learning mechanisms we read about looked like\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the different assigned readings were a little repetitive in content",
                "Professor Lockhart is clearly an expert in her field! Unfortunately, this is somewhat overshadowed by the abundance of student presentations. I wished I could hear more from her, rather than my classmates."

I think though that this is Professor Lockhart's last year of teaching, so I suggest that you research the future professor thoroughly, because there are definitely ways that the material can be dry if the professor isn't intentional about making the material engaging. You will learn practical skills that you can apply in the classroom or even for yourself as you're navigating student life!",

                "YES! I am so sad the professor is retiring, but I hope this course will continue to be offered. If it isn't, I think the Schwartz book should be a required reading for first years the summer before they arrive at Yale, because the mechanisms are meant to be applied to strengthen ones own learning just as much as it is to design an effective class/teaching style. The class itself is such a nice place to be where it's very evident that learning and student engagement are a priority. The reading response questions were really meant to get you to think, and it's a privilege to be able to be taught by classmates who are also interested in the field of Education.",

The workload is manageable and the material really requires students to think about how best they learn individually and do a lot of self-reflection. I loved this course and I would definitely recommend it !",
                "Yes! This is a great course to take, especially if you are interested in becoming a  teacher in the future. It is also a great course because it helps you become more critical about your own learning experiences + helps you consider how you can improve your learning on your own with different techniques.",
