                "Philosophical thinking;  grounding in some of the most important voices in Judeo-Christian thought, a foundation in religious studies; learning how to write reading responses at Yale; religious thought presented in an incredibly interesting and historical way; thinking historically about the evolution of intellectual thought; exposure to a wide variety of theories on law, from Philo of Alexandria to Plato to Moses Mendelssohn to Ronald Dworkin to Augustine to Maimonides; exposure to thinking about ideas in historical context; close-reading very difficult thinkers; a different way to think about the world, religion, and the relationship between man, the world, and God. \r\n\r\n(Anecdotally, the understanding you are getting in this class of thinkers like Augustine and Aquinas absolutely blows what is being taught in DS out of the water. You are really fully immersed in these theologians and philosophers, and it's amazing. Professor Hayes is a great pedagogue, easily the best professor I've had so far at Yale).",
                "It really gets you thinking about human nature and our place in the world through the perspective of divine law. You start with the Stoics and end up with modern Jewish scholars, going through the Ancient philosophers, Paul, Maimonides, Aquinas, Luther, among others. I feel like I have a much deeper understanding of religion, philosophy and the history of ideas. I always left class with new reflections on my place in the world. Very cool.",

                "I gained so much from this course. I learned how to not only analyze a variety of primary and secondary sources, but also see and draw connections between them. I learned how to trace a single idea throughout thousands of years of history, which gave me a deep understanding of and appreciation for the multidimensionality of the concept of divine law.",

This course is structured expose us to the works of some of the most prominent scholars in history and, whether were religious or not, take as unbiased of a look through all of the angles they have to offer.",

                "Amazing course with an amazing, talented, incredibly caring, intimidatingly intelligent (in a good way!) and kind professor\r\n\r\nStrengths: 1) Professor Hayes' amazing teaching. The style of the course, which was kind of a lecture-seminar combination. For the first several weeks, we would all do the reading, then come to class, where Professor Hayes would lecture in tandem with questions asked of the class, which would often become incredibly interesting conversations about the content. Professor Hayes has a gift for stimulating enthusiasm and conversations about relatively abstruse material and debates, and really brings color to every single philosopher and thinker being discussed. The second part of the course involves each person being assigned a particular question for a particular reading (say, a certain concept Aquinas is expositing) and describing it to the course. Both parts of the course were absolutely electric in terms of the classroom's intellectual energy. Professor Hayes really did well to cultivate this excitement. I just remember leaving the classroom every single day excited to return the next, perplexed and amazed by the ideas being discussed, being on the edge of my seat every class meeting. 2) Classroom discussion was some of the highest quality I've seen so far at Yale. Just amazing, and Professor Hayes deserves full credit for fostering such a space.\r\n\r\n3) Perfect workload in my opinion. The readings were hard at timesvery hard at times, especially towards the end with thinkers like Dworkin and H.L.A. Hartbut always accessible with the knowledge you had built up from previous sections of the course. The \"study guides\" offered for later readings were super helpful. I estimate the most a reading took me was 4 hours. A previous review said some readings should be \"cut\" and that there was \"never enough time for us to fully digest each piece.\" I disagree with this contention strongly, and think that the number of readings was perfect. The workload was if anything, relatively light!\r\n\r\n4) The structure of the course, as mentioned in another part of this eval, was spectacularly done and the perfect format for a first-year seminar.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) through no fault of Professor Hayes, some students had varying levels of participation, or had clearly not really done the readings in-depth, leading to Professor Hayes having to fill the cracks a little more than usual. That said, no real way to remedy this. 2) More time for the final paper would have been nice. I am currently composing mine and while I feel confident, I wish we would have received the prompt earlier, especially since my grade hinges on the essay. Maybe the process could have began slightly earlier, with meetings to discuss topics occurring a couple of weeks earlier? Don't let this sole weakness discourage you from taking the course, which is otherwise flawless. :)",
                "Professor Hayes is the biggest strength, she is totally awesome and clearly loves the subject and cares about her students. She was always enthusiastic, helpful and super understanding of all our different circumstances. One of the best teachers I have ever had and everyone would be lucky to learn from her. On our reading responses, she would often write feedback and thoughts longer than the response itself. The course was also very well organized and the chronological order of scholars we looked at made total sense. The readings also felt relevant, and although they were hard to understand on your own, Professor Hayes made everything super clear during class and she never expected anyone to understand everything.",
                "This course is organized very well with weekly readings (usually 2-4 hours) and questions to think about while reading, as well as 3 short reading response papers that help you engage with the professor and the material. The course is a deep dive into a very particular subject, so one must have genuine interest.",
                "No weaknesses. I enjoyed the organization and talking points a lot.",
                "Professor Hayes' wealth of knowledge is easily one of the biggest strengths. Another strength is the course's structure, all of the material builds on past material and the chronological order makes what would've otherwise been extremely challenging texts much more comprehensible. One of the weaknesses is that there isn't as much room for discussion as I expected when I went in. The class is taught more as a \"leminar\" than a seminar. Although I think that style works well given the subject matter, if you're looking for a first year seminar with lots of opportunity for discussion, this class is not it.",
                "Professor Hayes is a brilliant instructor and incredibly passionate about the topics at hand. The readings were very diverse  I had opportunities to read a plethora of philosophers and thinkers spanning multiple millennia. The course material touches on so many subjects, from political science to legal studies to religious studies to ethics, which makes it highly accessible to any student. I wish there had been a few more opportunities for discussion and debate at the beginning of the semester, but I learned so much from all of Professor Hayes's lectures.",
                "Strengths: This is a captivating class. The material is fascinating and Prof Hayes is a wonderful instructor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "I think this course may improve with more discussion in seminar. Occasionally this felt like a lecture rather than a seminar.",
                "Well organized, interesting selection of texts, sometimes the notes written on the blackboard were not very clear, very abstract and not always that useful, although not sure if that can be fixed. Course is quite fast paced, covering a lot of material in a short period of time, so it can be easy to feel lost and not fully understand the material. However, Professor Hayes seems to know this and noes not make it harder for you than it has to be - the course and the material is there, and as a student you are welcome to engage with it as much or as little as you want as long as you are getting something from it and putting in a reasonable amount of effort.",
                "This course is seminar-style, so you get to hear from classmates who may bring up points which shed new light on a work that was not originally part of the coursess structure. Overall, the course and the course material itself is very engaging. There is a lot to be said and a lot to go over, however, so it does take a bit of effort to find a means of note-taking that is able to grasp all the important information that both the instructor and other students are sharing (especially because most of the course is facilitated through conversation). The course benefits from study guides and questions which makes it much easier to organize our thoughts and structure notes to better takeaway important ideas, however it does get a little challenging towards the end in terms of trying to distinguish between different thinkers because the course is so expansive.",
                "This is a great course! Professor Hayes is kind, encouraging, and interesting. The classes are always engaging, and the readings are very manageable in size because Prof Hayes takes time to cut them down to their interesting bits.",
                "The class is very engaging and I like how Professor Hayes presented it to us. She is really excited about presenting the class to its students and when asked questions she really takes time to explain them to students.",
                "Strengths: this class feels almost like a firehose of information. You'll acquire a very thorough understanding of key thinkers and how they respond to one another. Weaknesses: class discussions revolve mainly around presentations, where each student presents an analysis of an assigned section of the course readings. However, this format is also very effective for making sure you've correctly interpreted the material.",
                "The course was excellent. I think the only thing I would slightly change is that in the course description I would make it clear that the course will not be a classically fully discussion-based seminar, as a lot of the class is more of a lecture format. That said, I enjoyed the lecture format because it allowed me to learn as much as possible from Prof. Hayes, who is brilliant and always allowed for questions and comments. I think the syllabus was very well constructed, although I wish we had had more time to spend on the modern legal theory at the end of the class (although I know it was not so central to the course)."

                "ABSOLUTELY. TAKE THE COURSE. RANK THIS FIRST!\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in law, religion, philosophy (honestly, it's less of a philosophy course and more of a \"intellectual history\" course/religious studies course, but still!), histories of ideas, or pretty much anything intersecting with the thinkers this course examines, take this course. \r\n\r\nIf you are a first-year looking for an interesting seminar, take this course. It is amazing. Professor Hayes is incredible. It will change your outlook on Western thought, and it will show you the deep inroads between modern thinking and Judeo-Christian/Hellenistic understandings of law. Professor Hayes is seriously the greatest teacher I've ever had. \r\n\r\nIf you are wavering between this course and another, make this your first choice. It will be better than the other course. \r\n\r\nProfessor Hayes is an expert in her field, incredibly caring and understanding, and will change your outlook on law and make you consider becoming a religious studies major. It will also give you a solid foundation in religious thought on law throughout history, and expose you to some of the most important thinkers of all time (Augustine, Aquinas, Maimonides, etc.).",
                "Please take this class if you can. Professor Hayes is the most incredible teacher ever and she was super enthusiastic, knowledgeable, fun and chill. If you think the course sounds at all interesting, you won't regret taking it.",
                "If you want to dig deeply into what divine law is (hint: there's no single meaning!) and be exposed to many of the great thinkers of the western cannon, this is a great course. I would highly recommend shopping the course to determine if you are interested in the topic because it is very specific. This course is in many ways 'DS Lite' because you are exposed to many of the same authors as DS, but in smaller doses. Do note that you will write 3 small papers and 1 long final paper and not get a writing credit which really sucks! Professor Hayes, though, is incredibly knowledgable and dedicated to making sure you understand the course material. If you don't want to do the readings, don't waste your time in the class.",
                "Yes, if interested in theology.",
                "Absolutely! You will learn so much in this class and it's a great opportunity to take a smaller style class with someone who's an expert in their field. If you have any interest whatsoever in Judaism, Christianity, law, or really just Western intellectual history in general this class is perfect for you.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student. The readings and our class discussions truly changed the ways I view and understand religion, law, and morality.",
                "Absolutely. I learned so much not only about religion but also about human nature and our society today in this class. It was so good. Also, Hayes is an AMAZING professor. Shes incredible. Shes very focused on you learning and helps you so much. She prioritizes thinking/learning over worrying about grades. She is so smart and it was incredible to learn from her. This has been my favorite class at Yale.",
                "I would, Professor Hayes did an excellent jog of teaching.",
                "Absolutely, it's a real privilege.",
                "Yes. This course is fascinating and its one to get really excited about. The instructor brings a wonderful excitement and energy everyday and its a chance to explore intellectual territory that you really will not find elsewhere. The course also benefits from not being a topic which most likely any first-years are well-versed, so its a lot of fun getting to learn and interact with material as a group without ever feeling behind. Towards the beginning of the course however it is important to establish how you are comfortable with participating. For people who arent as comfortable with speaking like myself, its very easy to get caught up in what everyone else is saying and not say very much (though this courses structure integrates the assignment of questions later on which I found very very helpful in getting me to speak up).",
                "I would highly recommend this course! Its a welcoming environment for all levels. I was pretty nervous about critically reading and writing at Yale, but this class helped me settle in quite well. The course material is really interesting if you have any interest in religion or history.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. Very engaging class. The workload is not tough and the readings you do are interesting and not long. The topics you do will make you deepen your understanding of what constitutes the law. You will definitely learn something new and interesting.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course. I really loved it, and I think anyone at all interested in the Humanities, Religion, or Law would benefit from taking it."
