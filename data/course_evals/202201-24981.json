                "In addition to the content I learned about the various Jewish communities in late antiquity (and some peripheral information about early Christianity), this class was most valuable to me in how it asked me to think. It was really about linking big picture concepts about the meaning of ethnic/religious identity to the sparse archaeological evidence and complex (rabbinic) textual evidence that we have to try to reconstruct a picture of Jewish identity in late antiquity. Professor Hayes really emphasized thorough and critical thinking, not taking anything as a historical given, and I definitely refined my critical thinking through this class as much as anything else."

                "I'll start by saying that I loved this class. The primary way I could see it being improved is by shortening the class presentation component. I really enjoyed working on my own presentation, but I think having the entire class present for 30 minutes each took away from some of the really interesting discussions we were able to have about the other readings as a class. I think 15-minute presentations would still enable students to dive into their own individual topics, while also taking up less class time.",
                "The material was super interesting and well presented. I enjoyed focusing specifically on identity. I think the class could be improved with more primary sources.",
                "Overall this class was very engaging, and the readings and concepts were very interesting. I felt like I gained a lot from the questions that the other students in the class asked, especially because Professor Hayes is very knowledgeable and her answers very thorough, although I would have appreciated if the structure of the class were more based on engaging directly with each other (that is, the students) rather than the back-and-forth dynamic with the professor. Either way, though, I felt like I benefited a lot from the small size of the class and the ability to engage directly with the texts.",
                "The course is rigorous and highly engaging. The weeks of student presentations at the start of the course were an excellent way to cover the Diaspora. The weeks on Judaism and Christianity were fascinating and especially well done. I mean honestly Prof. Hayes could teach anything and it would be fantastic. As in her other classes, class time itself is structured so that each student participated equally and knows what they are responsible for. She teaches how  to read scholarship fairly and for argument, which is absolutely invaluable. Her expectations of students are really forgiving.  Occasionally it felt like the focus was too narrow or the readings were redundant, but for the most part Prof. Hayes was adjusting the syllabus to make sure that readings covered the material as comprehensively as possible."

If you have some background in ancient Jewish history and find the topic interesting, please take this class. I learned to approach the topic from new and exciting perspectives, and I was extremely engaged in the content throughout the course.",
                "Absolutely! The material was great and Professor Hayes was wonderful.",
                "If you're interested in the subject matter, I'd absolutely recommend it. The class managed to have both a lot of breadth and depth, and especially if you're someone like myself who likes to engage with big ideas and apply them to more niche history, this class will be very intellectually stimulating."
