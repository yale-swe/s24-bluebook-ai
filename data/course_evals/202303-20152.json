Beyond the foundations of the language, this course introduced me to French literature and film, and thus improved my oral skills through discussion in class about the books and movies we read and watched. The daily exposure to French built my confidence in my comprehension of the language and in my speaking abilities."

                "Strengths: You really are immersed in the language given that you have to come to class everyday. Rebecca was the most amazing and fun teacher. She made class so fun and entertaining every day, given us a taste of real french culture through weekly music videos and slideshows. Weaknesses: The course packet is totally useless. I really don't think I got anything out of the homework assignments each night.",
                "There was a lot of homework in this course, but I really enjoyed the class itself and feel it well prepared me for future French classes at Yale.",
                "Weakness include that there was a lot of unnecessary homework; it felt like it was all busy work and I wasn't really learning anything by doing them. Strengths include that there was very good communication. Whether on what was expected of us for exams or office hour options, I always knew what to expect from French.",
                "There is a lot of focus on grammar but less on production - there could be more speaking, writing, etc.",
                "I feel that that one of its major strengths is that it immerses you into the language. However, I feel that the curriculum is old and has some opportunities to be modernized.",
                "The strengths of this course are its immersion in French, its consistent testing schedule, and the exposure to French culture. However, a weakness of the course is its reliance on the course packet, especially to teach the students grammar. It would be more beneficial to transition these lessons into the classroom to ensure the students understand the content and are able to ask questions to the professor."

                "I would recommend this course. We had daily class and homework assignments which was sometimes a lot, but the class was engaging and fun to attend.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the class size facilitates learning. I liked the people in my class and I was never afraid to speak up or ask a question. I also really liked my teacher; she was relatable and caring.",
