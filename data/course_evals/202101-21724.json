                "The course is very well structured, and Prof Lin is very good at summarizing key learnings points and reinforcing them through tests and quizzes. Prof Lin is also excellent at making a wonderful class dynamic. I was so surprised to grow so close to my classmates especially due to the pandemic and virtual nature of the class, but Prof Lin really fostered a sense of community of eager and avid learners! I really felt like I was in one of those ancient Chinese classrooms (or my historically-inaccurate imaginations of them), where I could study with friends who also love studying!",
                "STRENGTHS: Dr. P/Professor Lin is the kindest person ever. Mick Hunter is absolute garbage and should not be allowed to teach whereas Dr. P should be given all of the awards. All of them. Give her everything. The kindest person at Yale. WEAK: quizzes are way too long, midterm way too much is asked of you, final project took forever, class got a little monotonous, never had enough time for anything and always went over. But what a colossal improvement from the sh*tshow that was CHNS 170."
