    "My speaking skills greatly improved from this course. This is partly due to my unique background having studied Japanese on my own in high school; however, this class was incredibly discussion heavy which helped to stimulate the improvement of that skill. I gained a greater understanding of how little I knew about specific aspects about Japanese, such as formal speech and the differences between writing and speaking phrasing, and was able to learn about Japanese culture, history, and societal characteristics throughout various periods of history. The reading assignments in particular lent to insightful discussions about historical events and the Japanese people's thoughts and opinions about them. I enjoyed relating our assignments to the real world through these avenues.",
    "speaking, listening, reading of Japanese and better understanding toward Japanese culture",
    "Learned about Japanese culture through reading various types of Japanese texts.",
    "I improved my knowledge of the Japanese language and Japanese culture, as well as learning several hundred new kanji."

   "comments": [
    "There were many opportunities to receive feedback about coursework, but the pace of assignments did not always allow for students to utilize feedback constructively.",
    "A strength of this course is that it is quite discussion heavy and aims to better the speaking skills of the students. Another strength of this course would be that almost everyone in this course is quite interested in the Japanese language, and they show deep thoughts and opinions about the topics we are discussing. However, a weakness that I see in this course is that, often times, there is a lack of explanation about various assignments, and I found myself constantly asking the upperclassmen around me, who had taken the course beforehand, how a particular assignment was supposed to be done.",
    "strengths: the textbook and homework are well-designed;\r\nweakness: some students try to dominate the discussions and too many irrelevant things discussed.",
    "This course can deeply strengthen your knowledge of Japanese if you are able to keep up with the workload and do all the necessary studies. However, it is very easy to fall behind in this class if you don't finish the work."

    "Yes, I loved this course as well as the professor who taught it. Although it has a heavy workload, for non-Japanese speakers, I was able to get used to it mid-way into the semester, and the discussions that I found difficult to participate in became much more accessible the longer I sat in the classroom. The class challenges you, but at the same time the stories and discussions are all so interesting and fun to read and listen to. Furthermore, the teacher's meticulous comments on each and every written assignment really challenged me to hone my writing skills, and I had the guidance to do just that.",
    "yes, the course structure is well-designed",
    "If you are willing to work and finish all of the assignments, I would highly recommend this course, as it will help you improve your Japanese very greatly."
