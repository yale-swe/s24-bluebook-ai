While the instructor made every effort to seek feedback from students, the course never managed to escape from a disaster in poor delivery and pacing. I lost count of the number of times the instructor said a version of I am not going to go through the math or quickly clicked through screenshot formula in his slides (from multiple sources that for too many times had inconsistent notations). As a result, quick qualitative takeaways that were meant to supplant intuition devolved into hand-waving checkboxes typically seen in a poorly written engineering textbook.",
