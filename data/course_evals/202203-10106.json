In the labs, I was able to write and interpret objects, being able to be imaginitive and taking small details to draw a larger story. It was a strong introduction to the archaeological methods. As a student interested in archaeology, I believe it was a strong introductory course.",
                "This was a great introduction to the field of archaeology.",
                "This course taught me fundamental archaeology methods (dating, analyzing artifacts, surveying sites, etc.) and provided a fascinating survey of archaeological research across the world. Not only did I learn more about civilizations I knew about (e.g., Mesopotamia), but also about places with new archaeological research, such as the Polynesian Islands.",

                "Strengths: Anne is a great lecturer and the class was super engaging. She made sure to learn our names and interact with us despite the course format. Assignments weren't too difficult and TF feedback was super detailed and helpful. Most assignments were in pairs, which I really enjoyed. \r\nWeaknesses: Some assignments had vague directions. For example, the paper prompt was just to evaluate a popular archaeology story. Many of us kinda struggled to find some direction from that.",
                "I found the course schedule to work really well. The combination of integrating the lab component into the weekly class schedule (and then also scheduling most of the work towards the beginning and middle of the semester), made the whole course feel more manageable. \r\n\r\nThe in-class discussions/debates were also very helpful to flesh out some of the concepts from the lectures.",
                "One weakness that I am unsure how this could be avoided due to its intergral nature to the course is the quick passing between different civilizations. It is difficuult to draw a continuity between the weeks and lectures because of how diverse the content is. I think it is good that we are exposed to different areas. But I wonder if it is possible to make more clear connections between the topics. Perhaps, more emphasis on building understandings about civilizations in general.",
                "I think one strength of this class is the mix of lectures, labs, projects, and essays. It kept the class engaging and was especially appropriate for the subject matter.",
                "Great lectures with an excellent professor",
                "Strengths: fascinating lectures, very committed professor and teaching assistants, enjoyable and educational labs, coursework is spread out evenly over the semester\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been helpful to have a rubric to know what types of things the instructors were looking for in grading papers and lab assignments.",
                "The strengths of this course are the lab exercises, which are very interesting and cool. Additionally, the professor is very engaging and kind. But, the course tries to cover too much material with 3 classes a week and discussing a new civilization essentially every class. I wish the numbers of civilizations was cut down in order to focus in on them.",
                "I enjoyed the lab opportunities in which this class gave to students",
                "i enjoyed the labs and the hand on activities, however i wish there was more student engagement during the lectures.",

                "I would like to see a more comprehensive history curriculum. I understand it is an archaeology course, and it does very well at being an archaeology course, but I think it would make it more engaging and more relevant if there was a greater attempt to connect the archaeology with more comprehensive \"history\" lessons",
                "I really enjoyed the labs and write ups, the material was fascinating, and the professor and the TAs were very accessible and helpful. I wish lecture slides had been posted after class, and I wish there had been more clarity surrounding instructions, especially for major assignments.",
                "The course had a very reasonable workload. The course could be improved if the lectures were not so similar. While the material would be different, they felt very much the same."

Professor Underhill is very committed to the course and the lectures are fascinating.
