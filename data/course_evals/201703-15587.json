    "Spanish grammar and vocabulary",
    "As an L1 speaker, I have been able to develop the 4 skills of language through many activities the professor provides and been able to speak confidently in a language that I just started. So have gotten the knowledge of basic Spanish and practiced well.",
    "I learned the basics of reading, writing, and speaking Spanish at a L1 level",
    "I learned a lot about the Spanish culture and how to speak, write, and listen to basic Spanish. I also learned a lot about how to study this kind of topic and which ways have been most successful for me.",
    "Beginning Spanish, grammar, etc., primarily conversational\/short sentences",
    "Reading, comprehending, and speaking basic Spanish.",
    "I started learning how to speak Spanish!",
    "I do believe that I developed a strong base for Spanish, and I feel ready to take on higher-level Spanish courses.",
    "I learned to use basic Spanish",
    "I learnt a basic understanding of the Spanish language.",
    "I gained the ability to communicate, understand, and read basic levels of Spanish. Fundamental grammatical and vocabulary were introduced, including the present and simple past tenses.",
    "I learned basic Spanish vocabulary, grammar, reading, writing, and speaking skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: good coverage of the grammar; lots of review; change up of activities\r\nWeakness: I think more listening and speaking would be helpful. You don't get as much practice in these as reading and writing, but maybe this was because I had a big class",
    "The strengths of this course is having a well organized and planned course that can teach effectively Spanish to beginners. By making students work on all skills of the language and continuous assessment, it has improved students' language level. Improvement can be for example having native speakers come for a day and challenging oneself to fully speak in Spanish and other methods to learn the natural flow.",
    "I think it was a good beginner class. I think they should increase the number of possible absences.",
    "I think the strengths of the course was that Spanish was spoken all the time which forced you to learn the vocabulary quickly and experience the language a lot more often. I think a weakness of the course was that we didn't do nearly as much reading and writing as I felt we needed to do. I struggled much more on the reading and written exams because it isn't as common in class. Maybe having some more written worksheets would be much more helpful.",
    "Strengths: Immersive class, small(ish), engaging, you cover a lot of material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: less reading, so harder to grasp syntax",
    "Everyday meetings are both a strength and a weakness. Perhaps diversify the times that this course is offered: classes later in the afternoon, for example.",
    "It's a very strong course as is.",
    "Strengths: The teaching, the exam schedule, the textbook and online practice, and the syllabus organization\/execution. I took pictures of the homework schedule on Day 1 and was able to follow that schedule with revision for the rest of the semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Attending this course every day (M-F) weakened my engagement, so maybe a M-T or MWF course would've been better for my motivation to attend.",
    "This course was very fast paced.",
    "The daily practice with speaking, writing, and reading was helpful in gaining proficiency in Spanish. I think more regular and small assessments could be helpful in structuring the class.",
    "Strengths: Since the class meets every day, concepts \/ vocabulary were repeatedly drilled in our memory."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! Don't be scared about starting a new language. I had never taken Spanish before and never felt like I was behind in the class. It truly is L1, but they move quickly so that you feel like you actually learned something at the end.",
    "Yes as it is a fun, well organized and sure to make a good Spanish speaker if interested in learning Spanish.",
    "Yes, because you have to take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students as the professors are very understanding and I think t can really boost your confidence with realizing how much of a language you have managed to learn in such a short amount of time.",
    "Well taught, you learn a lot in the first semester, but that being said still far to go to claim proficiency.",
    "Yes, for anyone who is interested in Spanish and wishes to begin learning it.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "Yes!! Great base for beginning to learn Spanish",
    "Although it was sometimes difficult, I felt like I learnt alot from this course, which was very rewarding.",
    "Yes. The course load was manageable but intense. Sonia Valle was incredible in terms of engaging with each student daily."
