Finally, I learned that econometrics is a rapidly growing field, and one that can explain cool phenomena not only in economics but also in politics and sports.",

                "I thought the paper selections was fantastic. It was really cool reading about Professor Fair's groundbreaking work in econometrics and the various problems and datasets he's collected over the years. I think the course could be improved by introducing and going over more applications of newer, more complex econometric principles such as logit and 2-Stage Least Squared. We spent a lot of time on regression analysis, and I wish I could have gotten a better understanding of how to read and write papers that use more different, more complex econometrics.",
                "The small seminar style of the class allows students to participate and be engaged with the readings and conversations each week instead of blending into the background of a lecture. The readings can be fairly detailed and sometimes use more advanced models so it can be more difficult to understand them and therefore discuss them in class. The topics were pretty interesting each week.",
                "I really enjoyed the feeling that I was actually contributing to a research topic, rather than writing a cookie cutter essay which is the case in many other classes. This class opens your eyes to what econometrics looks like in the real world, outside of the confines of the immensely boring intro econometrics classes. The course readings are interesting, Prof Fair has a lot of experience in the subject and the seminar format is engaging. A may have been useful to spend a bit more time going over selecting which variables to put into a regression, and how to properly format an econometrics paper (although this is pretty easy to figure out given you are reading 2-3 before every class).",
                "Due to the virtual nature of the course, Professor Fair used cold calling to create student interaction during discussion of papers. This was quite intimidating at the start, but ultimately, I am glad that he did it as it really did increase student engagement. I found myself reading the papers more closely to prepare for class, leading to greater absorption and understanding. Professor Fair was a great and interactive lecturer. The three papers allowed students to find spaces of interest that suited them and also build up to a larger project. I personally enjoyed the sports portion less than politics, but I think the course was pretty balanced between the two in terms of material. The only real weaknesses in this course were due to the virtual lectures, but I think Professor Fair made the best of the situation."

                "This seminar, because it was shaped as a discussion, was obviously impacted by being on Zoom. It was tough to sometimes discuss papers fluidly between peers. Professor Fair would call on students in order to engage the class, and while it did lead to more engagement, it felt forced at times. Because Professor Fair was able to share his screen, we would all follow along with the paper at the same speed and would go through the paper together as a class. This made the discussion points really clear. We were able to integrate recent news events into our discussion, which only showcased the power of econometrics.",
                "Zoom worked well to deliver a seminar-style class as students had the chance to speak in class when unmuting, ask the professor questions as he went along, and see everything when the professor showed his screen.",
                "Online seminar, worked as well as expected.",
                "As I said previously, I think in this case the cold calling worked out well for virtual engagement. In other classes I have seen professors do mandatory one on one meetings with students at the start and end of the semester, and I think that was beneficial as well.",
                "This course was extremely successful given the obstacles of remote learning. The class size was such that the students could have thoughtful discussions over zoom and present our own research topics and papers."

However, note that this course, due to the three major assignments all being separate econometrics papers, requires a lot of writing.",
                "I think that this was a fairly chill senior seminar with a minimal workload in the three papers you have to write during the semester and in the readings and brief section participation each week. If you did the readings, you'll better understand class discussions and even find the results and conversation interesting. The papers allow you to choose your own topics and explore something you're interested in. I enjoyed getting the opportunity to have more writing samples, and students who do an excellent job may even come close to writing a publishable research paper.",
                "This is a great economics seminar for people who are interested in actually writing papers rather than doing meaningless psets week after week. The material is very engaging and Professor Fair is a very interesting guy. The complexity of the papers builds very nicely, even if you have never written an econ paper you will feel ready to write your own econometrics paper by the end of the course. I would recommend having taken intro econometrics and a semester of intro stats\/coding before taking this class, as little time is spent covering regression math, and no time is spend covering coding. I looked forward to going to this class and found the online discussion to be engaging. You will get cold called in class but if you have at the very least skimmed the readings you will be fine.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The economics major involves a lot of courses dealing with econometrics, but few of them engage with that material in a space that is as modern and relevant as this course does. All students interested in the intersection between economics and politics will enjoy this class.",
