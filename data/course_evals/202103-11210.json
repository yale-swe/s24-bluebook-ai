I could list the different units covered to give a sense of the vocabulary taught, but that's what the syllabus is for. I will say that I learned a lot more about Deaf culture and the Deaf community than I had anticipated, and that learning ASL was one of the most rewarding aspects of the semester. Meeting new people and trying to communicate in this beautiful language as a beginner is very fun, and being aware of the ways it changes your perception of the world and the ways you think is wonderful. I decided to take ASL in part because I wanted to be able to communicate with Deaf people, but also, in all honesty, because I needed a language credit and wasn't so interested in the other language courses. But now I'm hooked, and excited to take ASL fully for its own merits -- language credit or no."

I also think clear instructions about each assignment should be provided on Canvas when it is first announced in class. \r\n\r\nThe strength of the class is how passionate the professors are for teaching and how user friendly the class is. They truly make class a welcoming and safe space.",
                "strengths\r\n- teaching style (incorporation of games, repetition of vocabulary)\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- sometimes the assignments and their deadlines weren't clear",
                "I thought that the physical class time was the best part of the class. Dr. Conlin was extremely understanding if we missed a sign or seemed confused - she always took the time to make sure that each person was following along. We often played games or broke out into small groups, which helped keep class interesting. I also appreciated that attendance was not mandatory. I did not miss class often (as I didn't want to get behind!) but not having to worry about missing a class because I was sick was extremely helpful in a pandemic. I do wish there had been more feedback on the assignments throughout the course, as I honestly have no idea what my grade will be  perhaps I should have been more active in seeking advice on my communication skills in ASL.",
                "Couldve been more organized with assignments (e.g. linking them all online, in a consistent location, with clear deadlines, instructions, etc.)\r\n\r\nBut wow. An incredible course.",
                "This course was extremely well organized and enjoyable. One great element was Fridays off -- that was really nice, and the opportunity to do asynchronous work was great. The workload outside of class was very manageable, almost too light, and the experience in class was engaging and effective. I only have a few small changes I can think of. \r\n\r\nWhile I am somewhat glad these changes were not implemented the semester I took the course, because they meant that it was easier to get by without doing some of the homework, I think they ought to be implemented to facilitate better learning: The homework assigned from the textbook was never checked, just an honor code thing, meaning that if things got busy, there were no direct consequences for not doing it. Maybe a twice-a-week check on homework would help with that. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the cultural response journal was only checked twice over the semester, meaning it would have been possible (but a terrible idea!) to wait until the day before it was due and write all the entries then, rather than reflect each week. Not the end of the world, but maybe better to have four or six checks, just more frequent checks on that as well to guarantee the work gets spaced out more. \r\n\r\nLastly, while vocab was reviewed quite frequently and it was for the most part easy to remember everything that was taught over the semester, some units seemed to pop up and then disappear. This makes it very hard to retain the newly memorized signs. So maybe adhering to a review schedule a little more like what is discussed here: https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED012150.pdf could be helpful -- just an idea! :) \r\n\r\nOverall I thought this was a fantastic course, really enjoyable, really effectively taught, and really rewarding."

                "I definitely would! Especially with Dr. Conlin. I was afraid to take a language at Yale (I had never been good at learning languages), but never felt overwhelmed in this class. I learned so much in such a short amount of time.",

ASL is so fun, and the community at Yale is very different from the other language communities -- once you start to learn ASL, in my experience, the people at Yale who are either also learning ASL or already part of the Deaf community are going to be excited to help you and take you in and teach you things about this amazing culture. There is so much to learn -- so many Sign Languages to learn! -- and ASL is a great starting point. The workload is very, very light, especially for a 1.5 credit. Most of the work happens in the classroom, and it doesn't even feel like \"work,\" but rather interesting conversation and mentally stimulating activities. 10/10 would recommend."
