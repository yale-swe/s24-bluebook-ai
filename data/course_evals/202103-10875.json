There was a lot of focus on carbonyl chemistry and other topics found in a standard organic chemistry II course, but it was put into the framework of biological processes. For example, you get to understand how glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, nucleotide catabolism, and more all work! I really enjoyed taking this class!",

                "The strength in my opinion was how I could learn the organic chemistry of what is going on in our bodies. Professor Crawford always brought in interesting facts too, which made lecture fun. There were so many strengths too this class! It was great. The only weakness I'd say is that some lectures were too based on powerpoint, which was difficult to follow especially when trying to understand mechanisms of complex processes.",
                "This course is great but struggles from a lack of resources at times. Since this is not the typical o-chem class, the textbook is obscure (its nowhere online), and is also a pretty bad textbook, being super confusing, and at times even flat out wrong. The one good thing about the textbook is that it follows the structure of the class really well. Other than that, there was no homework ever, and the practice/ optional worksheets were few and far between. Maybe this is a personal thing, but I would prefer to have at least 1 homework per week, or at least an ungraded or optional worksheet, as 50 minutes a class just isnt enough to get through all the material.",

                "Yes! Absolutely, definitely take this class. Just make sure to study a lot for the first midterm as all those topics will come up again and again throughout the semester",
                "Yes, however I would warn any student that takes this that it is NOT a biology course. It is an organic chemistry course that focuses on the chemical mechanisms of biological functions. It is not about explaining those biological functions. As a chem major, I would suggest taking this course instead of regular orgo II to anyone who is more interested in organic synthesis than other parts of chem, so long as it fits into your schedule. Personally, I really enjoyed this course and managed to do really well in it, however, keep in mind that it is absolutely necessary to study and practice on your own. However, if you put in an hour or two of personal study per week, this course really isnt too difficult, and is pretty rewarding from a chemistry standpoint.",
