                "I developed my overall writing skills and learned how to properly evoke music through writing.",
                "Learned how to write descripteively. Writing about music is hard so being able to learn that in this class made describing more tangible things easier.",
                "I've been a strictly academic/research writer for the last few years, and this class was able to effectively break that mold. Initially I found myself still wanting to stick to the strict compositional rules that I had been following, but through this class I was able to channel my more journalistic writing side.",
                "I learned to move past the caricatures of the people/artists I thought I knew. I now look for punchy, seemingly unlikely descriptors to put words to the sounds I hear. I realized how much I love reading about musicians and the importance of having writers I can both emulate and differentiate myself from. Most of all, this course re-affirmed that both music and writing are non-negotiable parts of my life."

                "A strength of the course is that Professor Sexton lets you submit an ungraded rough draft. His comments are super helpful, as are those of your peers if your essay is workshopped. Professor Sexton also encourages you to see writing tutors and grants a 24 hour extension if you do this.",
                "the discussion-based form made for some great conversations. Workshopping also allowed a cool focus on each individual member of the class.",
                "This course is brilliant. If you're someone who is interested in music and music journalism, the readings, assignments, and in-class discussions are incredibly enjoyable. The class is structured like a typical Intro English course--four essays, the last of which is a research paper.",
                "Strengths: class was very fun and engaging, no weaknesses",
                "Very fun class! The topics were all pretty open-ended and for the most part, you could write about what you wanted. The only weakness was I personally didn't like the second essay topic of having to interview someone, but from the interview process I made a new friend and learned a lot about how it is to write a profile on someone so I guess in the long run it was beneficial.",
                "Strengths - The structure of the assignments is great, and the readings directly reflect those and are effective at showing students different techniques and styles that might help in the composition process.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Sometimes readings can be a lot if you don't get on them right away.",
                "Strengths: class dynamic, selection of articles/readings, wide-ranging topics of essay assignments, draft-based style\r\nWeaknesses: could benefit from a more globally representative selection of music/musicians that we discuss"

I will say there are probably easier English classes where you are not competing for a good grade against English majors. But Professor Sexton is great and most of the essays were genuinely fun to write since you have lots of freedom to pick your own topic.",
                "Depends on your interests! If you're passionate about music, absolutely.",
                "yes 100%! i took the music writing section and it was one of the best classes ive taken. so engaging and interesting but i also learned so so much",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course! Professor Sexton is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject and being in his classroom was always a delight. The discussions he facilitated and the readings he chose truly transformed the way that I write and think about music. As long as you enjoy music, no matter whether or not you're a musician, I would recommend this course.",
                "Yes! The professor is amazing and if you like music, and writing, this class is perfect for you. If you're not a great writer it may be a bit challenging at first but you'll get the hang of it!",
                "Yes, I would. Even if you don't plan on pursuing anything related to this course, I would still recommend it as a creative outlet that challenges parts of the brain that are rarely challenged (\"Writing about music is like dancing about architecture.\")",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, particularly those who are musicians or lovers of music that may have never considered what a course specifically dedicated to the intersection between writing and this interest may look like (and the catharsis/challenge that it offers)."
