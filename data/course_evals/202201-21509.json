There's an essay each week along with readings you'll want to do plus other small assignments that require writing. But if you like the writing, then this class is so much fun and totally worth it.",

They are short essays, but it actually takes a lot of time and effort to be concise AND funny. Also there are points in the semester where the humor/language challenges feel a bit overwhelming."
