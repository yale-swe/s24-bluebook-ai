    "History of art senior essay gives students the chance to build expertise in any topic within art history that interests them, and to work with a faculty mentor on an essay. The course is writing-heavy, and provides excellent training in art historical writing. I also gained art-historical research skills, as well as skills in the presentation of art historical work to diverse audiences."

    "Strengths: enjoyed checking in with fellow students and getting to learn about their projects as the semester unfolded.",
    "The class is extremely well organized, with clear milestones that are designed to ensure successful essays at the end of the term. The two or three meetings that Prof. Bass hosts with other essayists are valuable for troubleshooting ideas, and having more of these (or encouraging students to meet and converse more frequently) could improve the class even more."

    "This capstone class was an absolute joy, and students who know they have a particular passion within the history of art should absolutely write a two-semester senior essay. Having the opportunity and support to dive deep into a research project is extremely rewarding."
