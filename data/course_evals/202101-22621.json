                "I think the course does a good job of taking students through a trip of the American presidency. It felt like a lot of theory, which was helpful context for my understanding of the presidency but I think it left a lot of the understanding of the executive as a whole to the students.",

                "I learned extensively about presidential power, American presidential history, and how this all applies to today's presidencies.",
                "I learned about the institution of the presidency, how it has changed over time, how leadership has changed over time, and what all of that can tell us about the presidency going forward.",
                "This course provides both an overview of presidential history in the United States and several models to analyze political authority over time. Professor Skowronek is a leader in the field and provides students with his model of political time, which finds that recurring historical patterns have a critical role in determining presidential authority. For example, Skowronek argues that Jackson and Lincoln were alike in their rise to power-- they both followed failed regimes and could serve as great repudiators of action. The class also details famous presidential power models, such as the one provided by Neustadt, and helps to elucidate the complex structure of the executive branch.",

                "Gained a really great and interesting perspective on the American presidency",
                "As my first survey political science course, not only did I learn a lot about the subject (the American presidency), but I also learned much about how political science is studied in general. Learning from an expert like Skowronek is awesome because you get to hear some of his own original ideas in addition to widely accepted ideas. Material-wise I learned less about the inner workings of the president / presidency and a lot more about the presidency's interactions with surrounding branches of government / institutions / the electorate.",
                "I learned about the history of the American presidency and the forces that shape the modern presidency",

                "This course mainly taught me how to critically evaluate American presidencies from a non-biased, informed point of view. I think I found Professor Skowronek's theory of political time to be most interesting in political trends through the executive. I also learned how to pull from a number of resources in order to develop a coherent argument. I think learning about presidents through an interesting and less fact-driven perspective was most interesting to me.",

                "I think the course set out what it was intended to do. I wish there was some more concrete history as opposed to theoretical exercises but I think that's sort of the point of the class. Generally, I thought the course did a good job it just wasn't exactly what I was looking for.",
                "Professor Skowronek's lectures are hard to follow at times and there was much more reading assigned than was necessary.",
                "Discussion sections helped a lot in maintaining engagement, but I think there could have been a greater attempt by the professor to connect with his students through questions.",
                "Hard to stay engaged with lecture over Zoom",
                "I really liked the themes that were covered in this course and section was very interesting. Lectures were somewhat slow paced, however, and the reading felt excessive, mostly because sections were too short to even discuss everything we read most of the time (or if we did, the discussions had to be rushed).",
                "Strengths: Professor Skowronek is a fantastic lecturer-- he lectures without slides and tells stories while ensuring he summarizes learned information several times. The texts cover significant breadth and spark interesting conversations; I found myself enjoying the vast majority of the readings.\r\nWeaknesses: the final format was rather taxing this semester-- three five page essays provided before reading period.",
                "It was perfect",
                "Lectures were engaging, as well as section. The reading load was a little too heavy some weeks.",
                "strengths: readings were interesting, section leaders were great, and professor Skowronek was a very talented lecturer \r\nweaknesses: lectures could have been more engaging with slides or other visuals",
                "Skowronek's profound knowledge, interest and passion for the subject is one of the biggest strengths of the course  you can hear his enthusiasm and investment in his voice during lectures. My TF was great so discussion sections were another strength of the course and they really added value to the course rather than just being part of the course that had to get done. Also, my TF gave me very detailed and useful feedback on both papers (another strength). Only \"weakness\" might be the amount and density of some of the readings, but it is not necessary to closely read every single reading in order to succeed.",
                "Strengths: Professor Skowronek is one of the foremost scholars in this field, his lectures were clear and easy to follow\r\nWeaknesses: Readings were too long, although most provided interesting insight",
                "Very interesting readings. Lecture was hard to follow sometimes since Professor Skowronek did not use a powerpoint or other presentation.",
                "The professor and TAs were a strength; the material was also interesting! Even though I attended live lectures, the recorded lectures were so helpful, because I could listen back to remember what was said.",
                "strengths: interesting content\r\nweaknesses: sometimes dense and boring readings, low engagement with the professor, monotonous lectures",
                "Strengths are the lectures and content. The weakness is the short turn around time for papers. The papers are not graded harshly but its very hard to get an A.",
                "Strengths: covers a lot of material and felt very timely and applicable\r\nWeakness: lecture and section material didn't always align very well, and I wish there were more diverse perspectives on the presidency (we didn't read anything written by women and POC).",
                "There was a huge amount of reading from week to week that sometimes obscured the central lesson to be learned for each particular unit. Overall, though, the structure of the course (i.e., starting with the Constitution and then building on historical theories) really helped demonstrate the ways that our understanding of the role that presidents play in American government.",
                "Strengths: The main strength of this course is Professor Skowronek his expertise and insight, coupled with his genius work on political time, provided such an amazing environment in which to learn. Additionally, the section leaders (TFs) were also so intelligent and lended great insight into the conversations that took place during discussion sections. Skowronek's theory of political time legitimately left my mouth wide open, and it was so awesome to be able to hear it directly from him.\r\nWeaknesses: Personally, the main weakness with this course is the fact that Skowronek spent too little time discussing his own work. Although I understand that it is necessary to paint a wide background to actually understand his theory, I found it to be most capturing when he discussed his theory. I really found his discussions of his book to be the most interesting part of the class, so I wish he would have spent more than two weeks discussing that  Yale is so fortunate to have him as a staff member, so they may as well let him talk more in depth about the work that made him such a renowned political scientist. The second, more minor weakness, is that this course is very reading-heavy. I felt that most weeks, the reading was far too overbearing, and it seemed nearly impossible to balance a thorough reading of the assigned texts with a schedule that also included other work from other classes. Cutting the readings in half would prove to be just as effective, I believe, because often, sections weren't even focused on the specifics of the readings  just general ideas from the authors.",
                "Really enjoyed lectures and section, but the readings were incredibly lengthy and sometimes hard to follow.",
                "The instructor had no slides which was not great; for an online class, I would recommend slides incase of any internet connection issues.",
                "The course material is challenging but very interesting. It can be improved by lowering the amount of reading due each week.",
                "I really like how Professor Skowronek would send our lecture outlines before classtime so we could follow him easily. The essay assignments were reasonable and always based off lecture. The final was pretty lengthy (15 pages), and I kind of wish it was shortened.",
                "Strengths: fantastic professor, very interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: if you cut down some of the readings slightly, it would be easier to pay more attention to each one, without having to skim it or skip parts of it",
                "One of the main strengths of this course is Professor Skrowonek's lectures. I think he is a very good lecturer and presents the information in a clear and understandable manner. It could be improved with more power points or a different visual aspect, since I found that when he used those I had a stronger grasp on the material. Additionally, by virtue of the online format, it was fairly easy to fall behind in class."

The recording of lectures was also key for people like myself who were not in the same time zone as New Haven. Being on the West Coast, classes were at 7:30am so sometimes it was easier to not attend lecture live and watch the recording instead.",

                "My only comment would be that Skowronek could maybe use more of a visual representation during his lectures. Towards the end of the course, he did actually use the whiteboard in his Zoom-space, but I would have appreciated more of that prior to the last couple of weeks. When there is nothing to focus on besides looking at his zoom square, I often found it quite easy to drift off and lose focus. That said, the information was often interesting enough to keep me focused, but I am definitely more of a visual learner. I think one thing that worked quite well was the ability to have interesting conversations in discussion sections via the \"hand raise\" feature, which made it so that no one interrupted someone else, and everyone was allowed to finish their thoughts without feeling pressure from other students. I do think that it was easy for a small number of students to dominate the conversations in discussion sections, so maybe instituting a limit on how frequent a student can respond to questions would be better in allowing for other students to speak up. That said, I think this course was well-carried-out over Zoom, and I hope there will never be another Zoom semester!",

                "If you want to learn more about the presidency-- its origins, its history, and its modern practice-- then this course is for you. Professor Skowronek is a great lecturer and first provides an extensive presidential history and categorization of earlier presidents in secular time: from patrician to party to pluralist to plebiscitary leadership. He then delves into another categorization system that he created himself to explain trends in presidential authority. Even for someone who has already studied the executive, Skowronek has a unique perspective to offer.",

                "I would recommend this course to any student, political science major or not, who is truly interested in doing a deep dive into the presidency. Because the focus of the course is pretty narrow, if you are not really interested in the subject matter, I would guess the course could turn into a slog pretty quickly. However, if you are truly interested in the topic, this class will be awesome and you will enjoy it a lot. I learned a lot of new things about something that I thought I already knew quite a bit about. Readings can be pretty dense and/or long, but it's not necessary to closely read every single reading. Lectures were really interesting and fun to attend, especially later in the semester. Overall, the workload is definitely not light, but it is pretty manageable. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course to another student as long as they know what they are getting into.",

                "I would not recommend this class unless you have some background in American Government, the Constitution or know about the American Presidents. It was hard to stay engaged, there was no powerpoint slides and for a majority of the year it was just the professor lecturing without any visual aids.",
                "If I wanted to listen to someone read directly from a script twice a week for 50 minutes straight with no powerpoint slides, I would've just found a podcast. This class was painful, and I'm still trying to figure out why a 200 level political science lecture expected so much from its students. Two harshly graded 8 page papers and a 15 page final exam with a heavy reading load every week is honestly more work than I do for my upper level seminars. The material is dry for most of the semester and Skowronek does little to make it interesting. My frustration was always building, but it reached a peak when one of our peers on campus took her own life and he made NO mention of it in class the next day. Didn't miss a beat. Acted like nothing happened. He has little sympathy for students, and that's also reflected in his strict deadlines. Making essays due at 10:30 on Saturday mornings is basically asking students to pull all-nighters. You want an extension when people are dying and we are all trapped on Zoom? You better have a solid Dean's excuse! Because that's the only way you're getting one. If you are looking for a nice political science lecture  maybe a fifth credit  do NOT take this class. I had a great TA, and I cannot imagine how much worse it would've been if I hadn't. You're taking a risk by signing up for this course.",
                "Yes! The professor is incredible, and the material is interesting and relevant.",
                "Yes, but only if you're highly interested in the political development of the presidency and motivate to engage with the material.",
                "I would recommend it just know the papers are not graded easily and that you have to keep up with the readings to do well.",
                "I would recommend this class for students who enjoy PoliSci and want to get a better understanding of the office of the presidency.",
                "Yes",
                "I would only recommend taking the class if you are particularly interested in studying the presidency as an institution, rather than studying individual presidents.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, the material was extremely pertinent but also very well taught. Professor Skowronek is unmatched in his knowledge on the subject and it clearly shows with every lecture.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone if they have either a significant amount of time to fully immerse themselves in the course material or if they are severely interested in the American presidency. If you are not a political science major and are just looking for an extra class, I would advise you look at some of the courses before signing up for this class. Not that it is boring, and not that it is impossible; it's just that it's certainly not a class that should be underestimated. The readings are tedious, and the essay prompts can be quite challenging to tackle. However, it was a really great class for what it's worth, but it just required more work than I anticipated. I think that your best resource is your TF, in that they can provide feedback on essay topics (and even drafts) before you are required to turn in a final copy. Despite all of that, if you are interested in learning under world-renowned political scientists: this is THE class for you. Professor Skowronek's insight and experience are second-to-none, and his theory of political time outlined in his books is simply genius. The only other thing I would say is that this course is very individualized, as there is little conversation between professor and student in class, and discussion sections are very \"present what you know and you're good.\" However, I'm glad I took this class, but it's not exactly what I expected no better or no worse, just different!",
                "Yes, great and necessary for poli sci students considering going into government.",
                "Yes! It was so interesting and I enjoyed writing the papers; the Professor gives you room to express your own opinions in every paper.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! If you are interested in American politics and the American presidency. It is still interesting for everyone but since the workload is high I would not recommend for people who are not interested in these topics.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! Pretty good course to take if you're trying to learn more about the presidency but don't have much experience",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students. I think it teaches valuable skills for assessing the role of the president, and that it will only become more pertinent to our lives as citizens of the United States.",
                "I definitely would. This was a fantastic class. The lectures are engrossing, the workload is manageable (only two 6 page essays and a final paper!), and I came away with an entirely different perspective on the development of the presidency. There is a substantial amount of reading, but if necessary you can get away with skimming it or only reading parts of it. Definitely read all of Howell and Moe, though -- it was the reading I cited the most in my essays (and it offered some incredibly interesting and provocative ideas, too). The grading seems very reasonable, too, and I never had a problem getting an A on the essays. Overall, a really solid class, and certainly one I'd recommend.",
                "I would recommend this course. It is an interesting poli sci lecture about a contemporary and pressing topic, and presents new ways of thinking about the institution of the presidency and the powers it can and should have."
