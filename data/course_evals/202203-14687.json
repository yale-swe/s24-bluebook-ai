Not only will you regard each author according to their own works, but you will also discover how they are responding to previous thinkers, often times revising their thought in subtle but crucially important ways.",
                "I learned so much about philosophy and about the process of philosophical thought by taking this course. I also learned how to use logic to analyze a philosophical argument and to critique its argumentation on a step-by-step basis. Lastly, I learned significantly more about writing philosophical papers, specifically about how to reconstruct an argument and challenge the validity and soundness of an argument by critiquing the steps of its argumentation."

                "Strengths: course material, course pacing, course structure.\r\nWeaknesses: portrayal of material in class.\r\nImprovements: It's very good to have long, impassioned conversations about small portions of any text, but given the short time we have to explore each work, this would sometimes lead to certain areas of the text being under-examined. Perhaps better pacing in class (such as a cut-off time by the teacher for certain topics) would help improve this relatively minor detriment.",
                "Strengths: Great professor. MDR is the best!\r\nWeaknesses: The nature of DS is that you have only one or two discussion sections a week to discuss works so you have to go through works quickly.",
                "The seminar style was excellent; I felt super engaged and I learned a lot. Also, it covered a lot of material, but I felt like it was just the right amount of work to be hard but manageable.",
                "The course was extremely intellectually engaging and comprehensive if western philosophical thought. There should be more diversity in the texts though.",
                "N/a",
                "The strengths were the quality of teaching, the quality of the fellow students in discussion, and the amount we read.",
                "The schedule of readings and the authors and works read were excellent. The Arabic philosophers, only added to the syllabus in the last several years, are wonderful, important thinkers, and they work within the same philosophical tradition as all the other writers on the syllabus.",
                "The strengths of this course is its comprehensive take on ancient philosophy and the variety of texts we read. In particular, the time spent on Plato and Aristotle, while about half of the total course time, is not only necessary but extremely beneficial to my development of philosophical thought. However, the major weakness of this course is simply that we have too little time to delve into the intricacies of all of the texts we read. In particular, while we read four or five works of Plato and Aristotle, we barely have enough time to discuss any of them in length, and for the post-Aristotelian philosophers we have a week at most to discuss entire schools of philosophy in the ancient world."

                "100%, although the reading was tough, the content was foundational and the seminars made me a more critical thinker",
                "I would recommend that any freshman interested in a well-rounded view of the Humanities participate in the DS program. The program as a whole provides a space and a community for those to explore the works that are foundational to our society. The beauty of the course comes not at the beginning, but at the end, when students are able to look back from the vantage point of understanding and enlightenment they have received over the course of their two semesters of enrollment. Beyond the knowledge the course provides, it is a great way to make friends in your first year, a time when securing relationships is incredibly important. DS builds in relationships from Day one with its shared classes and lectures, both of which are taught by world-class professors with incredibly deep knowledge of their subjects. Taking DS was definitely the best academic decision I made my freshman year.",
                "Yes! MDR is a great professor who really encourages students to think critically about the texts we read and form our own evaluations of philosophical works.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It just really teaches you how to think in a way you haven't thought before. It also opens up your mind to new things you didn't know existed.",
                "Yes! Extremely insightful",
                "Yes. Professor Della Rocca was wonderful and I felt that this was my most intellectually stimulating class, without it becoming overwhelming.",
                "Yes! Philosophy with Della Rocca has been my favorite class so far.",
                "Yes--DS is a wonderful survey of many aspects of the Western intellectual tradition; and it inspires such a marvelous sense of community.",
                "I would highly recommend this course (and especially Professor Della Rocca) to other students, especially those who are curiously to learn more about ancient philosophy. Although this course does seem to rush the curriculum by spending a limited amount of time on the seminal works of Western philosophy, it is well worth the quick pace and heavy workload as it provides a thorough introduction to the most important works of philosophy in history. More importantly, however, this course helped me develop a philosophical mindset and worldview by improving my philosophical analysis skills and my ability to reconstruct and critique philosophical arguments."
