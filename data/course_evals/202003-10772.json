                "I really enjoyed how the lectures had quizzes to help us become motivated to watch the lectures and the lectures were very well put together with the presentations. I also think that the final project instead of a final exam was much more interactive and knowledge provoking. It took a significant amount of time in a course of weeks to prepare the project and I believe it was a better way of applying our knowledge of the course materials than taking a test to just regurgitate information. In terms of weaknesses of the course, I think there was not really something significant to mention.",
                "At least online, the work was distributed fairly unevenly throughout the week. About 3 hours worth of mini lectures were assigned Monday and due Wednesday morning, the same time as the pset session (which made it difficult to read over the assignment beforehand). Then psets and benchmarks for the project were typically due on Sunday night with a quiz Monday morning.",
                "The quizzes should have been more about the knowledge gained.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. The addition of the final project and the group PSET sessions were very helpful.",
                "The remote setting was not ideal but this course had the best online structure out of most of my courses.",
                "This course gives you every opportunity to succeed. You can tell the professors are rooting for you, not against you. Expectations were very clear, and help was available at every step along the way. \r\n\r\nA weakness in this course is the inconsistency between professors. When I logged on and saw Professor Koelle, I knew that I would understand the material. With Professor Kabeche, I was not so sure.",
                "Strengths: Lots of assistance\/peer tutoring if you need help. Lectures are clear and understandable. Not hard to get a good grade in the class as long as you study appropriately.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a large workload, so it's important to stay on top of your work.",
                "Literally love prof Hartman and prof Koelle so much. they made the course so wonderful and fun",
                "Strength: Good communication between the students and instructors. Furthermore, the structure of collaborative learning eliminates internal competition, allowing students to focus solely on learning.\r\n\r\nWeakness: A slightly heavy workload and online lectures may sometimes become drawn out\/ unengaging. Lectures sometimes are spotty but that's understandable due to individual's WIFI connections.",
                "A major strength of the course was the emphasis on scientific thinking and analysis as opposed to memorization of facts. One weakness was that mini-quizzes had to be completed just two days after the video lectures were released, making for a crammed schedule early in the week.",
                "Though I originally did not enjoy the asynchronous format, in the end it worked quite well for me and was not an issue. The problem sets and discussion sets were productive as well, and the quizzes were completely fair in my opinion. I do think the collaborative PSet sessions could be structured differently, as I felt they sometimes got monopolized by a couple of individuals who had already completed the homework rather than actually being a space to work together.",
                "strengths  very clear assignment guidelines, professors and TFs definitely cared\r\nweaknesses  course was not challenging; definitely feel that adequately prepared students should be allowed to place out of this course",
                "The only weaknesses were largly with Corona restrictions. That being said I feel that the course should have but extra effort into facilitating bonding and study groups with the classmates. I think they may have realized this becuase there is a PSET collab session to meet people in BIO 102",
                "I think that the overall set up of the course was a strength in the sense that the material was reinforced at multiple points throughout a standard class week. I felt as if I was gaining knowledge naturally as the week went on rather than feeling like I had to cram the whole week's material into a weekend's worth of studying. The only weakness of this course, as a result of the online format, was that I found that some of the videos less clearly explored and explained the material than others. That being said however, the mini quizzes, homework, time in section, as well as the benchmark ensured that I understood the material before I was quizzed on it the following Monday."

Therefore, I would recommend this class to anyone who is willing to put in a little more work, but can still receive an A in the class.",
