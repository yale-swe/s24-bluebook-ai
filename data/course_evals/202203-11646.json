                "Wonderful course covering the following topics:\r\n Financial Instruments and Market Structure: Broker-Dealers\r\n Present\/Future Value and Returns: Annuities & Perpetuities: Many problems later on in the course hinge on this concept, that is breaking down assets into their constituent cash flows.\r\n Portfolio Choice\/CAPM\r\n Market Efficiency: Strong\/Semi-Strong\/Weak form hypothesis.\r\n Equity Valuation: Gordon growth model (we didn't spend very much time, here)\r\n *No Arbitrage and General Equilibrium Pricing*: This is one of the biggest focuses of the course, the \"no arbitrage\" principle of cash flows pricing. These problems may often involve pricing exotic derivatives (see 2020 practice final exam asking about a \"square\" derivative for an example). These problems make up the most significant portion of test questions on the final (although there is still a pretty even spread between topics), which I think is fair, since these problems tend to require the most intellectual dexterity and creativity compared to any other problems. A verbatim quote from Professor Davila from the last lecture: I love no arbitrage. :)\r\n Fixed Income Pricing (Bond Yields & Forward Rates): Very fundamental\r\n Options: Builds to the black scholes model of option pricing.\r\n Financial Intermediation\r\n\r\nI think that this was a very streamlined course. When I talked to students at other T30 universities, we were learning the same things at Yale. Therefore, note that you are learning fairly fundamental financial economics theories that you can take into any workplace. Everything in this course seems very relevant.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the syllabus topics covered, I will note that it seems that the course covered slightly more material (1 more block?) in Fall 2021 as opposed to this semester (Fall 2022). I think there was enough space for that one more block, but I think most other students would disagree with me.\r\n\r\nAs for topics covered, I really think the course would be better if we covered asset classes at some point. Not super extensively, but I think it would have been great if we briefly went over for example in the fixed income block okay class we have: fixed income munis, corporates, high-yield etc. And then you wouldn't need to test anybody on memorizing which bond is which, but it would have made the course a little bit more grounded if it was in the slides somewhere in one place or in a supplementary notebook somewhere.",

                "The course is very fast paced.",
                "There is a lot of content in the class and so if there was a way to slow it down that would be great but understandable if thats not possible. We learned a lot of major concepts in lecture but on the practice problems a lot of the questions focused on very pointed specific things which were not always covered in class",

                "The lectures were interesting, the slides were comprehensive, the psets were easy, and there were plenty of practice questions to prepare for the exams. \r\nThe structure felt pretty rigid and it felt like Prof Davila was sometimes just reading off of the slides. The course also leaned heavily towards the theoretical and academic side of financial economics -- sometimes I wish there was more direct applicability to the real world.",
                "The strengths are definitely the material taught as no other undergraduate economics elective at Yale offers such a broad and yet detailed intro to the world of finance. The course was designed well and covers the key concepts in every area from which you can build on further to understand more complex problems. A weakness for some might be that the pace at which the course is taught is quite fast, and it can be difficult to keep up especially towards the end when the material is more challenging. No other weaknesses as such.",
                "The lectures were really hard to stay engaged with",
                "Strengths: Covers all the main topics of finance in a well organized manner. There are a ton of practice problems to prep for the exams you should def do them.\r\nWeaknesses: There are only 7 psets, which cover very specific parts of the course, so you don't get a ton of practice on all course material through the psets. You get it by doing the practice problems.",
                "Strengths: engaging prof, interesting material, good psets. Weaknesses: lectures are sometimes hard to follow (but mostly great! prof just sometimes underestimates the difficulty of some of the material)",
                "final was way harder than I expected :(",
                "The course was well structured, had some very interesting topics and a lot of practice materials to solidify our understanding and prepare us for exams.",
                "Strenghts: Prof Davila is fantastic; I love his slides and teaching style, especially his breaks for reviewing the essentials of everything we just went through. The extra practice material with solutions is amazing; I wish more courses had something like it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: exams always felt more like a battle against time than the exam itself.",

                "Professor Davila is the true strength of this course. His teaching style enables him to cover many concepts in depth in just one semester. He is incredibly succinct and introduces new material in simple, manageable steps; his crystal-clear explanations enable him to move quickly and dive deeply into intricate, densely mathematical ideas. Another significant strength of the course is that the problem sets are similar to the material covered in class, and the exams reflect the material covered in class, problem sets, and practice material. At every step, Professor Davilas students practice concepts that will be useful, and this multiaxial reinforcement helped us solidify our understanding of the material every step of the way.",
                "Strengths - great professor, lots of practice material, and very well-planned\r\nWeaknesses - the cumulative final was a lot of material to cover in reading period. The course introduces a lot of unrelated topics and sometimes it can get a bit confusing.",
                "strengths: Prof Davila was amazing and really good at explaining tough concepts in class. Also, a large amount of practice materials were provided which made learning the concepts easier. \r\nweaknesses: Sometimes the teacher went fast in class, but normally important things were repeated several times",
                "good class",
                "A bit too niche\/intensive in the latter part of the course, take out some material and slow it down at the end",

                "The course was relatively slow paced, making things easy to understand but not very engaging.",
                "Strengths - Davila, the content, the clarity of lectures\r\nWeaknesses - went too fast at times, but very few",
                "The course gives you a very good overview of financial markets, like portfolio mix, market structures, interest rates, derivatives, bonds, bonds valuation, and other very applied topics. However, it is a huge amount of information in such a little time (also in the lectures) what can make the course a little difficult to be up to date with the lectures.",
                "Class went too fast.",
                "Problem sets could more accurately reflect the difficulty of the midterm and final. More examples in class would also be helpful.",
                "Strengths: The instructor is great, you can really see his passion towards his field demonstrated in class with regards to how in-depth he goes with concepts. The class keeps you up to date with any recent problems in the financial world, so you can definitely cut back on reading The Economist for some time.  It's designed to wake up your inner finance bro. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is too much to cover in too little time. At certain instances I felt the instructor was cramming together too many things which left me unclear with regards to grassroots level concepts. I also felt that the TA sections were a repetition of the class sides, and no new practice was being included. Lastly the exams were quite hard, and although adequate preparation material was required, questions with regards to the linear asset pricing model, and pricing of assets in different states were not discussed in class with the importance they held in exams.",
                "I think that it would be nice to have more review sessions before exams available to students, especially before final exams. I also wish that we had more graded worksheets\/homeworks rather than fewer psets. I would rather have the time pressure to do more problems than the expectation to do the numerical questions on my own, and having opportunities to go over more problems with TA's would have been helpful.",
                "Overall structure is good, however, unit on arbitrage felt a little bit rushed, so if possible in the future you could spend more time on it.",
                "As many of the other course reviews state, the problem sets were very brief and easy. The exams and midterm were just much harder than the problem sets. So, for the typical students (poor planning skills) this causes them to relatively coast through most weeks of the course and then just do tons of work and tons of practice problems for the week before the final and midterm. You can't argue that this is necessarily the professor's fault, though. Nonetheless, I think that making harder problem sets could have \"forced\" us to spread our studying out more.\r\n\r\nI will say that, I think there was a fantastic reservoir of practice exam\/midterm problems to study. By far the best and most extensive out of any course I have taken at Yale. If you do a couple hundred practice problems on your own I think you will do well on the assessments.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think there were some really nice supplementary textbook and notebook readings. Nobody is going to test you on how to construct an iron condor vs iron butterfly option strategy, but if you wanted to teach yourself about those topics, outside of class time, there were good resources for you to learn about those things if you're passionate about learning financial economics for its own sake.\r\n\r\nAs Professor Davila says, this is supposed to be a course that \"makes you think.\" Therefore, the class definitely focused on critical problem solving rather than rote memorization (really minimal \"plug and chug\" component to the course) which is probably one of the biggest aims to which professors aspire. So, good job!",
                "The material in the course was extremely well organized and went through at a good pace. A potential weakness is that grades were highly determined by one's performace on the midterm and final exam, though there is a lot of practice material provided to help do well.",
                "Great class!",
                "Prof moves a little fast in class and doesn't always explain things very clearly. However, the class covers a broad range of topics that you will learn if you attend section and devote time outside of lecture.",
                "In general, I do not like the teaching methodology of going from bullet point to bullet point from slide to slide. No narrative structure to demonstrate purpose of unit\/module within the overarching context of the class, which necessitates the requirement of TA sections to \"reinforce\" (reiterate word-for-word is more apt) what was discussed in lecture. Students just end up learning the entirety of the content themselves on their own time - faster to just read the slides then hear the slides from Prof\/TA.\r\n\r\nBut ultimately this flaw is not unique to specifically ECON 251, but rather a more structural problem within the Economics department. So, would still recommend taking the class. Good theoretical framework for any student interested in finance."

                "Yes! Especially if you're considering a career in finance",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if there are interested in developing a better understanding of common financial jargon and topics. There is a good amount of math involved in some concepts but professor davila does a good job explaining everything you need to know.",
                ".",
                "Yes, I would. It is a fantastic introduction to the world of finance and gives you the basic tools to make sense of the news and how to think critically about financial and investment opportunities. Needless to say, the class is essential for those looking to go into finance, buying would also recommend it to anyone remotely interested because of how broadly applicable this knowledge is in the future.",
                "Only if they are actually going into finance. I have an interest in it but since I'm not doing it as a career it was too niche",
                "Yes, super cool to learn about finance.",
                "Yes - it was a great class to learn about the building blocks of finance.",
                "Highly recommend! This course is great if you're interested in anything related to the financial world. You learn a lot of cool things about equities, fixed income, options, and more. There is a little bit of math involved but everything is explained well by the professor \/ teaching fellows.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone interested in finance.",
                "Yes - this content is great to learn whether or not you want to work in finance.",
                "Yes useful knowing in finance",
                "If you are interested in going into Finance - investment banking, hedge funds, and wealth management - then yes!",
                "Absolutely - I really enjoyed the material and learned a lot.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student pursuing a career in finance, as you learn a lot of applicable skills regarding stocks, bonds, and other securities.",
                "Yes. Would recommend.\r\n\r\nIf you're somebody with stronger quantitative skills, then you will also do well in this course. For example, the CAPM section covers lots of correlation\/covariance and if you took mathematical stats or linear algebra then you know that the covariance operator forms an inner product, so you can just solve those problems straight away. Yet if you don't know anything about linear algebra at all, then the problems are still just as solvable. Knowing a bunch of math will probably make this course easier for you. You could not say the same thing about the intro micro\/macro sequence for example. So, just be aware of that fact.\r\n\r\nNote also that there are many students in this course who are highly focused on investment banking or some sort of financial career, who will put lots of work into the course.",
                "Tough class with lots of smart people in it. Although Econ curve is generous. Definitely useful if interested in finance. Professor is very smart and good at explaining concepts, but he sometimes talks too fast to understand and goes into unnecessary detail (lecture slides are thorough but not efficient)",
                "Take this course if you want to learn the theory behind financial markets but note that some of these theories don't work in practice",
                "Yes for those interested in finance (genuine or not). Absolutely."
