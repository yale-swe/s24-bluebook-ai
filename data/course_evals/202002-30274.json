   "comments": [
    "Honestly, it is hard to put into words or quantify what this course teaches you. I would say that it taught me to be a better scientist and a better intellectual.",
    "I learned how to read and analyze scientific papers, write a research grant proposal, and how to present scientific research.",
    "I learned how to hone my public speaking skills, how to prepare effective presentations, and how to write a research proposal. I also learned about the various resources available to execute scientific writing.",
    "I learned how to develop my research paper, apply critical thinking skills when reading through complex papers, and also how to better communicate my research to others.",
    "How to efficiently execute an abstract, proposal, grant proposal, research strategy and presentation. What the best way to present research is. How to speak to an audience.",
    "I learned a plethora of valuable lessons and skills that enhanced my passion for research. This course taught me a variety of insights about scientific presentation and writing that will be very helpful for future tasks.",
    "This course is intense and really helps you improve your public speaking skills. Professor Moreno's criticisms can seem picky at times, but at the end of the course, you will be surprised by the public speaker you've grown into. This course is also a good introduction to scientific writing."

   "comments": [
    "This course's greatest stregnths was the fact that we learned a lot about how to present research effectively and efficiently. I only wish that we could have read more research papers as a class or maybe just in our TA groups. Although the course was online, it was overall still an amazing experience.",
    "Since this course online, I felt a lot of zoom fatigue because classes met M-F for 1-3 hrs. Maybe for the future if the class will be taught remotely, the meeting time can be shortened since class meets every day and students also have lab meetings and have to work on their project as well. However, the instructors made sure to check in on how we were doing and were understanding and accomodating of technical difficulties and everyone being in different circumstances during this pandemic. I did learn so much helpful information and skills regarding reading and writing scientific work as well as presenting research in the most effective ways. I will take these skills and knowledge I learned for future research experiences.",
    "Since the course was held online for the first time it's a bit difficult to judge but I felt that it was paced very well in terms of how we were able to develop our presentations. We also had a lot of opportunities to interact with the teaching staff and TAs outside our scheduled meeting time. One thing I could say is that there was definitely less of an emphasis on the journal club aspect as the course progressed but that was understandable considering how the course's main aspect was the final presentation which required a lot of work on its own.",
    "The strengths were the breakout rooms and involvement of the teaching staff in the improvement of the lessons regardless of the unorthodox virtual teaching methods. It could be improved by more in class participation.",
    "More variety of interactions. There was only lectures and TA groups so I only got to know a small group of students well. I wish there occasional TA group switches.",
    "This course was very successful.",
    "The strength of the course is the instructors' and the TAs' willingness to engage with students. The entire course is designed so that students have maximum interaction with their assigned TA and instructor, and feedback on public speaking are given directly. The weakness of this course is that lectures can get quite dry sometimes. Lectures are also unnecessarily long."

   "comments": [
    "If you have the opportunity to take this course through the STARS program, do it. There is nothing like it.",
    "I advise STARS summer students who will be taking this course to put the work in for it because while it can be a lot of work at times on top of your research and lab meetings, the payoff and skills I got from it were worthwhile.",
    "If you're someone who hasn't had much experience with research this is a great course to familiarize yourself with the structure of the writing that is done in that setting.",
    "Yes, it is useful for reading and writing research papers.",
    "Yes. The in-depth analysis of what makes a good research presentation and paper helped me in a way that I didn't know it could.  Most students don't know how to properly analyze and read a research paper, but it will help everyone.",
    "Yes, I will certainly recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would. I didn't think I could say I would recommend this course when I first took it, because the lectures are really long and sometimes a bore. I thought this class would drag on forever. But this class really grows on you. You end up forming a very close community with your fellow students, TAs, and even the instructors. The teaching staff are also very engaging and caring. I'm surprised by the public speaking and writing improvements I've made in this course."
