There is very little close reading in the class, as you might get in a course on political philosophy. Instead, it focuses principally on broader considerations about form, genre, and literary context."

                "Dr T is a gem - a well-rounded scholar with a knack for performance, he makes the course worth it",
                "The readings were well-selected and the instructor was charismatic and competent. The use of unstructured \"thought papers\" (reflections) rather than short papers to keep track of student engagement was well-suited to the format of the course. However, the course was decidedly lacking in structure. There were no student presentations or close-reading exercises in class. One brings whatever observations one has to the table, and then others will either bite or move on. There are also quite a lot of readings---the lack of close reading allows one to skim and pay more attention to formal aspects, but I thought that it did the foundational works quite a bit of injustice.",
                "I think a lot of the strength and weaknesses of the course were discussed fruitfully in class. In terms of weaknesses having a more extensive scaffolding of historical context for our readings would have been very helpful, not only for understanding each text independently, but also for helping to piece together a narrative about how \"advice literature\" transformed overtime and in different cultures. Lastly, the course does require a lot of reading, which was often difficult to complete in a singe-week timespan - I liked having all the readings assigned but I think that I could have benefited from smaller selections of a text, so that I could have more time to contemplate it. \r\n\r\nThere were other aspects of the organization of the course that were big strengths in my opinion - the weekly thought papers was a wonderful way to process the material, and I really enjoyed the mandatory outside lectures that we were required to go to. I also really appreciated our final project (a mirror) which helped me translate the kinds of learnings from our readings into real life. I cannot overstate how stimulating this exercise was!"

I would suggest a slight reorganisation of the course:\r\n\r\n- 3 broad \"traditions\" to compare: Arabic-Islamic, Latin/Christian, Chinese\r\n- these three traditions to be done one after the other (so students can understand cultural-specific aspects of literature in more detail)\r\n- texts presented chronologically within these 3 blocks\r\n- perhaps a summary session at the end",
                "Yes! if not for the readings, the superb final project - take it for professor toorawa!",
                "Absolutely! take it if you have any interest in either medieval literature or governance literature.",
                "I would recommend it for the upper-level student who has an interest in being exposed to a lot of medieval literature that they otherwise would not read on their own. Reading them all in succession over one semester is helpful for bringing out certain formal and thematic affinities. \r\n\r\nHowever, I would not recommend it for someone not well-versed in the historical context of the middle ages or someone who wants a course that emphasizes close-reading. For me, having taken many close-reading-based courses, it was a good supplement.",
