                "I learned a lot, actually, both about the specific literature\/aesthetic trends of 1980s Soviet Russia and China, and about how to analyze aesthetics more generally.",
                "How late socialism influenced society and how it was represented in a variety of Soviet\/Chinese literature and film",
                "I developed more insight into Soviet and Chinese reform policy during the 1980s as well as their similarities and differences. In comparing and contrasting differences in socialist reform, we learned more about the definition of socialism and the ideology behind its foundation."

                "I really enjoyed the chronological approach to the 80s. It was, at times, difficult to shift back and forth between Russia and China, and sometimes, it caused me to subconsciously make generalizations between the cultures\/societies versus giving them the nuance they deserve. A comparative approach and a nuanced approach is a difficult balance to find, but this class did a fantastic job taking on this challenge.",
                "Strengths: wide variety of literature and film, good thematic grouping of materials, manageable workload \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class discussions felt at times disorganized, and supplementary readings were rarely discussed. Perhaps a way to indicate which readings should be prioritized and\/or prompts for discussion board posts would be helpful. No feedback was given for discussion board posts, which were our only form of written work until the outline\/first draft of the final paper were submitted in the second half of the semester.",
                "I thought that the readings and movies for this course were particularly interesting. The seminar style of the class really allowed us to discuss the material freely and I think that added a lot of value to the course as well."

                "Yes, I think in the growingly bipolar world between the US and China, Yale students should be required to take a humanizing course on what is often framed to us as \"the other side.\" China and Russia are too often only taught in geopolitical and news conflict contexts.",
                "Yes. I really enjoyed the class and the way it was structured. Covering both written and visual material was really engaging. However, the workload for the class was intense. I would recommend taking this class Credit\/D\/Fail.",
                "I would. Be aware that its a lot of workabout 100 pages of readings most weeks plus 2 or 3 moviesbut its very rewarding and interesting.",
                "I definitely think it made me better at examining media through an ideological lens, but I can't say with total certainty if I would recommend it. I was really excited to join two areas of interest in one class (East Asian studies and Eastern European studies), but I think the course would benefit from more historical contextualizations to guide discussion (such as the presentation given in the first seminar session). The course material was really interesting, but the discussions were a bit lackluster.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The professor and TF were both very helpful throughout the course. If you have an interest in Soviet or Chinese history during the 1980s and the cultural and historical implications of socialism during that time, this is a great course for you.",
                "Yes! This was a great way to develop a better understanding of the 80s in China and Russia. Rather than reading about it through a textbook, watching films and reading literature that was created during those years provided a much more human and nuanced perspective."
