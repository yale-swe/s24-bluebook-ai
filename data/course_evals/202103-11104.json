            "comments": [
                "The main strength of the course is the final project - we had the freedom to create a cool interactive ML-based project of our choice, and we learned a lot and had fun in building it. The weaknesses of the course stem from the lack of instruction, both in lectures and on the homework. Half of each lecture was spent on paper presentations which hardly anybody paid attention to, and there was no accountability for anyone, including the instructor, to pay attention. The other half of each lecture was spent on interesting topics, but we hardly went into depth into any of them, and there was no accountability to pay attention, as the assignments were completely unrelated to the lectures, and there were no exams. This class could be improved by making the assignments directly related to the lectures rather than individual frustrating forays into ROS, and by holding people accountable to pay attention and learn something from the lectures and paper presentations.",
                "I thought that this course gave both a great dive into the theoretical and applied aspects of each new concept, that was a huge strength. I also thought that there could've been more TA assistance or guidance on some of the problem sets as they were a bit daunting.",
                "I thought the course did a good job covering relevant papers, though a lot of the papers were somewhat outdated and did not really show the full power of the techniques. In general, I thought the support provided for the course was quite good, and my questions were always answered very quickly. I loved that the class had a slack.\r\n\r\nI wish that the assignments hadn't been so much about how to use ROS. The class wasn't really a robotics class, and so it felt a bit out of place. On top of that, ROS required a lot of setting up the system. It felt like the problem sets should have been devoted more to learning concepts.",
                "Strengths: the course only had 12 students in the class and it had a professor and TA so there was a 6:1 student to teacher ratio. The problem sets and material was well-presented and very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no discussion section, as is the case with all CS courses at Yale.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting and exciting topics. Offers high levels of engagement between students of the class. Gives students an opportunity to work on something very cool for their project.\r\nWeaknesses: Workload is quite high especially during the middle of the semester where we have back to back homework assignments. It was quite challenging to do well in all these assignments with the limited time we had with them. However the workload became much more manageable after homework 3 or 4. Either some parts of the homework can be trimmed down a bit or more time could be given to do them (perhaps moving homework 1 earlier could help).",
                "The psets in this class are extremely well organized! They really enable you to spend time on conceptual understanding instead of getting bogged down in the nitty gritty of programming details \/ environment setup. Questions on the written portions are challenging in a good way. In general, much better and more in depth than the the AI (470) homeworks. Marynel is an awesome lecturer.\r\n\r\nThe final project was a fun and a productive application of things we learned in class. We were well supported through the proposal and checkpoint, and expectations were clear. Lots of deliverables but totally manageable."

            "comments": [
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they are willing to spend the individual time to learn ROS and the robotics machine learning concepts. Hardly any help was given by the professor or TF on the assignments, and it was only through talking with other students in the class that I began to understand the material. My main enjoyment in the class came from the final project, as we chose to develop an idea that was both cool to us and incorporated machine learning concepts we had learned in previous classes.",
                "Yes, this course is perfect if you want to learn more about developing sensors and intelligent machines involving state of the art techniques such as deep learning or reinforcement learning.",
                "This is a pretty good CS class if you want to get an overview of vision, filtering, and planning\/RL. I would recommend it to CS majors who want to learn these things. If you aren't a CS major, but want to learn only one or two of the things on the syllabus, I would recommend just learning that stuff on your own time. The class covers a bunch of somewhat unrelated topics, and if you don't need a CS credit, it probably isn't worth it to cover everything else.\r\n\r\nI felt that I didn't retain a lot of the information, because the psets didn't really build on class and felt a bit disconnected. Still, the psets, especially the later ones, were pretty interesting.\r\n\r\nI spent 84 hours on the class last semester, which is a pretty typical class for me. Breakdown:\r\n28 hours on psets\r\n27 hours on the final project\r\n25 hours in class\r\n1.5 hours on my presentation\r\n1.2 hours taking canvas quizzes",
                "Yes. You will gain a lot out of this course, especially in doing the final project which requires that you build a real interactive system. The good thing about this course is that there are problem sets that test your understanding of the material. If you are interested in robotics, machine learning, filtering, and computer vision, this is an excellent course to take.",
                "Yes, particularly if they are interested in robotics, AI, or machine learning. This course gives students a chance to dive deep into a project that they choose which makes for some really cool projects.",
                "Yep! This class is better than >90% of other CS electives IMO. Content seems intimidating at first glance, but the way the course is designed makes the material super approachable (esp. if you've taken 470), even if you don't have a lot of experience with ML. Lectures are interesting and homeworks are productive. Help is very accessible; grading is super fair; the final project was fun and relatively stress free. There are student paper presentations but they only take up a very small fraction of class time. I do feel like I could have gotten more out of the class if I had done some of the optional but recommended readings-- it's very much a \"you get what you put in\" kind of class.",
                "Yes! This class is difficult, but definitely worth it. You'll learn a lot of relevant information and get a lot of hands on practice. Even though there is a lot, the work does not feel like busy work."
