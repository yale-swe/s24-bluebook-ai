                "Strength: Professor Humphrey is an incredible and engaging professor. He explains things clearly and welcomes all discussion\/questions. He is approachable, enthusiastic, and flexible with students. The students have a lot of input in the course, and he welcomes feedback and suggestions. The content itself is also very interesting. It is one of the only classes where students get to discuss current and future treatments. The direct medical applications makes it much more relevant. The exams are fair and the homework assignments (short essays or math problems) are helpful for learning the material. Also, the guest speakers were very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course could use a bit more organization. We followed the syllabus, but it would have been helpful to have a review sheet with the information we were responsible for knowing. Also, the course is very backloaded. We had a 10 page paper + presentation + final exam at the very end of the semester. Together, those assignments made up 65% of our grade. It would have been nice to either reduce this workload or reduce the grade weight of these assignments.",
                "Was a really good class! Didn't have much bio background going in, but Professor Humphrey really explains",
                "Strengths: Prof. Humphrey does a great job presenting material in a clear, organized way and addressing people's questions; he also fostered a really supportive learning environment and did his best to make the class feel like a team despite the weirdness of virtual learning. I think the seminar format is great, especially since the vast majority of intro STEM courses are huge, impersonal lectures. Weaknesses: None to speak of.",
                "Great great course, could seem kind of random at times but then we pulled it all together at the end. Very flexible and good for learning! Fun environment, even virtually",
                "This course is very strong. The syllabus is great. The only weaknesses I felt this semester particularly pertain to the situation of the pandemic in that I think the course would have benefited from more of the usual hands on and in person elements but I think Professor Humphrey did an amazing job adapting where he could."

                "The professor used a running word document with notes from class (like a whiteboard). It was helpful to have those notes. He also always posted class notes on Canvas so students would be able to review the material. \r\n\r\nFor the final exam, we did the multiple choice section in the Zoom chat (private). This was unnecessarily stressful. It would have been better to do the multiple choice on Canvas quizzes so that we could distribute our limited time as we please. The written parts of the midterm and final were fair, and we had plenty of time to complete and upload our work.",
                "Posting the notes ahead of time (for the most part) was very helpful, as was Professor Humphrey's structuring of the class in a way that made it easy (and, in fact, necessary) to ask questions and engage with other students to complete assignments.",
                "I think that professor Humphrey did the absolute best given the circumstances. I do believe that the course could have benefited from the in person components however, this was not possible and I still feel i am taking away HUGE lessons and skills from the class."
