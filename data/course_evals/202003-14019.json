                "Strengths of this course include the fantastic teaching, the generally engaging readings, the extra resources\/podcasts, and the in class lectures. The only weaknesses would be the generally unhelpful breakout rooms and occasional irrelevant\/drab readings (very rare).",
                "Strengths: The professor had the right mix of presentation time and asking questions in my opinion. She often asked questions to the students while going through the presentation slides, but the questions were relatively easy to answer, so I never felt like I had constantly rack my brain in the class or that I was tiring myself out from thinking too much (which I often feel like I do in English classes, which are more discussion-intensive). The professor is very knowledgeable and often added a bit onto the students' responses too, so we learned a lot in class and my experience attending lectures is very positive. There also isn't that much work in the class and we had a tiny break in the middle of class to stretch our legs or go to the bathroom so that was nice too! Overall, the professor is very excited to teach the class, and I could feel that energy so that made my class experience very enjoyable :). This was my favorite class first semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we didn't have a lot of timed assessments, so when the final rolled around, I felt a bit unprepared for how an exam in this class would feel like. However, the professor provided us with a study guide and tips for how to study for the final, so everything went fine :).",
                "strengths: interesting material, engaging discussions\/lectures, instructor is very knowledgeable and accommodating to students' needs\r\nweaknesses: readings were sometimes hard to read and fully comprehend but gets better throughout the semester, review of material covered throughout the semester was limited\r\nimprovements: more opportunities (ungraded quizzes and refreshers during class) to review material covered throughout the semester would make studying for the final easier",
                "Strengths include Prof. Moeller's lectures and enthusiasm for the subject, and the subject content itself. If you are interested in ancient Egyptian history and\/or archeological investigations, this class will be super interesting! The online format was definitely a drawback for discussions, but overall these were also well facilitated and interesting. Course grading and assignment expectations were very clear throughout.",
                "Professor Moeller was lovely. She was always very accommodating and her lectures were engaging. I liked the discussions we had during class, especially when we were asked to look at things from the perspective of an archaeologist. The class was sometimes a little disorganized, as we were prone to get a little behind schedule in lectures.",
                "I really liked the break in class, it was nice to be able to stand up and stretch in the middle of class without seeming rude. It would've been nice to go to a museum in person, but that would be  unreasonable for this year."

                "I thought that the virtual seminar format worked surprisingly well. There were occasional technical issues, but there were only a few instances of people talking over others, which is something I was concerned about. Professor Moeller kept us engaged and interacting with a mix of breakout rooms, lectures, and general discussions. I appreciated this variety. She also provided all texts, which I found useful. We maybe could have employed a few more online resources (for instance we once did a mini quiz on Canvas, and I would have liked to have done another).",
                "I really liked the break in class, along with the dialog being apparent on canvas. I don't know if that was a feature you added or canvas did, but being able to quickly find a comment about something discussed in class was really nice."

                "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students. Professor Moeller is wonderful, and her teaching is second to none; she's quite literally the expert in the field, as she does research directly in Egypt! The class is engaging and perfect for anyone with interest in Ancient Egypt, and you don't have to be an expert or great writer to do well. If you want a first year seminar with great content, a great teacher, and a moderate workload, this class is for you.",
                "Yes! This is an amazing first-year seminar and the professor is very excited to teach the class and is super nice :). This was my favorite class my first semester at Yale because the lectures were engaging and the workload is fairly light; the professor 100% made an effort to include students in the discussion when talking about ancient Egypt.",

                "Yes. It's a very good first-year seminar, for students interested in ancient civilizations.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students; it was my favorite from the semester. The material is interesting and well organized so it's great for students who have little to no prior knowledge of ancient Egypt. The reading load was not overwhelming (30-40 pages a class) but was sometimes hard to get through because the material was unfamiliar (which gets better as the semester continues and you become more familiar with the course content). Plenty of time was given to complete the writing assignments. Small amounts of class time were dedicated to lectures, but the majority of class was spent discussing the main topic of the class (relevant primary texts and visual analysis of reliefs). Prof. Moeller is knowledgeable, engages with her students, and values student input during discussions and about the courses as a whole.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in ancient Egyptian history, archeology, or just want to learn something new. The readings are very interesting, and if you do them you will have no trouble participating. The assignments and grading are very fair, with lots of feedback and clear expectations.",
                "Yes! If this a topic you are interested in, I would definitely recommend it. I enjoyed the course a lot.",
                "This was a really fun class. The work load was light (several 2 page papers and a few projects, check the syllabus) and relevant. It would've been nice to have the class in person, but professor Moeller made the class work despite that."
