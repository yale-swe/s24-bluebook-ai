   "comments": [
    "I felt like the curriculum was a little outdated and could use a refresh. Sometimes the recordings didn't match the printed exercises in the course packet.",
    "Strengths: You cover a great amount of material and are exposed to a variety of french texts\/movies. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grammar felt very self-taught, the homework\/assignments were very unclear as well as the grading.",
    "The strengths are that this course was very difficult and thus allowed me to quickly learn what needed to be learnt.",
    "The course was okay in its style of teaching - I liked the media and literature that we engaged with, but the course packet work was boring and repetitious. Grammar was quite easy to pick up, and the stories were fun to understand and discuss. However, I thought the way that the vocabulary was presented and tested was ridiculous. Our prof did a good job of going over it with us and doing exercises, but asking someone to pull words out of their head to complete a sentence for any language is only a practice in memorizing the list of words. It's ridiculous and I would get 100% on every part of the test except for the vocabulary, no matter how much I studied. The course packet was never checked for credit, and the grammar was already tested in L2 so I don't feel like I learned much grammatically and did a lot of grunt work for no benefit. \r\nAdditionally, there were only around 4 students in the class taking it for a letter grade, which could either really help me or really harm me. I score better in my major-required classes but put the majority of my time into this class.\r\nOverall, it was nice to be in this class. I do wish that there were more projects or perhaps an oral presentation so that we could engage with other francophone regions rather than just France (reading about Algeria was quite interesting even though it seemed a little racist).",
    "I liked studying literature and films. So much homework and very strict grading with little feedback on how to improve.",
    "Lots of exposure but once you are behind it's very hard to get caught back up. Taught entirely in French so if you misunderstand an assignment or don't understand a discussion you are kind of on your own.",
    "I enjoyed the structure around the books and movies. I felt like expectations for smaller daily assignments could have been more clear."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in improving French grammar and expanding vocabulary. However, the class works takes a great deal of time and is largely self taught.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they are serious about taking french and want to continue with it beyond college, it is very challenging.",
    "If you're really committed to learning French, take this class, but don't take it as an easy language credit. There is so much work needed on a daily basis to even achieve a basic level of understanding, but if you have the time it will definitely be worth it. The literature and films are interesting, but you truly do have to put in the work to understand them; it forced me to read, though. Shop a few different sections before you pick one - the 9am was a little early for me!",
    "No it wasnt an enjoyable course.",
    "If you are good at learning languages and committed to french, yes. It's a lot if it isn't going to be your top priority",
    "As a masters student, it was difficult to manage the daily work. I would still recommend it but you probably won't get as much out of it as some of the undergrads who prioritize it more."
