If you qant to gain a solid footing on quantitative methods in biophysics and biochem, this course is not great for that, with the exception of Fourier transforms which was taught very well and had very good psets! If you sinply want to be exposed to different quantitative methods used in the field to be able to reference them and learn more about them later, this course may he helpful.",
