                "Lots of problem solving skills",
                "Broad overview of quantum computing: taking the existence and actual implementation of qubits for granted, we discuss how to work with qubits to solve various problems. The course covers the basics of quantum qubits, operations, algorithms, and error correction. It is very math-heavy, but elegant if you understand it.",
                "This class was very eye opening for me, I definitely gained new perspectives on computing as a whole and what is possible. It was very enlightening overall for me as I had been wanting to engage with this topic for a while and had never properly done it.",
                "We got a crash course in the relevant parts of quantum mechanics for quantum computing before diving into quantum gates, circuits, algorithms, and error correction.",
                "I learned very interesting topics on quantum information and gained significant experience with programming a quantum system in Python.\r\nThe PhD project was also very instructing as we had the opportunity to choose our own topic and approach."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Fairly mathematical and discusses from the ground up quantum computing through a computer science lens (no physics)\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures sometimes are quick and you may get lost if you try and fully understand the minutiae.",
                "Yongshan is fantastic and very organized. Questions on Ed are responded to promptly. The assignments are engaging and at the right level. Without a strong mathematical foundation this course might be a bit more challenging, but such is the nature of quantum computing.",
                "Strengths: I think professor Ding is a strong lecturer and does a great job explaining the concepts we learn in depth from a mathematical perspective. He also uses plenty of examples in class to provide intuition of complicated concepts. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: especially at the start of the class, it is difficult to take the existence of qubits for granted, and their properties. It would be helpful to have some more background about the physics to explain why we can model qubit as a vector of two complex numbers. Also, the Psets were a bit disorganized, as there was one question that even the TA could not explain (fully), and instructed us to solve a simplified version of the problem given. However, I then lost points for making a simplifying assumption. The programming portions of the assignments could also benefit from more documentation, and I feel like they could be expanded because many of them did not really add to the learning in the course.",
                "I found the first few homeworks a bit heavy on time, but the course overall was very well organized. Dr. Ding did an excellent job of keeping resources easy to find and updated which was very helpful",
                "The biggest strength of this course is that it is very well taught. Yongshan is a great professor! I highly recommend asking him questions about anything that comes to mind since he knows so much about the field! No weaknesses really come to mind",
                "Strengths: timely feedback on assignments, the professor is passionate about the subject and is willing to provide explanations\r\nWeaknesses: I think it would be good if we could do problems like those we see on our exams and homeworks in class. We often just did the underlying concepts and their proofs in class, which didn't translate well to the application-type problems on the different assessments. So I think doing more of those in class could help.",
                "The lectures were well structured and the professor did an excellent job transmitting all this information to us.\r\nThe course had quite a lot assignments, written and programming parts, midterm, finals and project, which could be overwhelming sometimes.\r\nHowever, the optional programming parts for graduate students was a really helpful measure."

It is very engaging if you are interested in understanding qubits, and for people who like applying mathematics to real-world problems, this course provides a perfect example of how to use math in such a way.",
                "If it fits with their interest, then absolutely. I think the insights I gained were valuable, the lectures were well done, and there is as much learning the be had as a student has bandwidth to engage with, which is generally a sign of a good class",
                "I would highly recommend this course! I think the content is fascinating and that the course is incredibly well taught! Be prepared for a challenge, however, as the subject matter is not easy.",
