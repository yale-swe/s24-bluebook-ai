                "This course was incredibly helpful for providing an introduction to a wide range of feminist philosophy topics. The course material covered a wide array of topics and time periods, making it extremely helpful for building baseline knowledge. I also feel that in reflecting on my experience in this course I have been able to learn so much about effective pedagogical choices. The structure of the course, the small groupings to discuss readings, the weekly letters, and the emphasis on embodiment throughout was all extremely helpful not only to my learning as a student but created a course environment that I hope to emulate as an instructor myself one day.",

                "Critical thinking and effective communication in abstract conversations.",
                "I learned about the history of feminist philosophy/queer theory, especially as it relates to gender roles, heterosexuality, sex and gender binary, power, and sex work. Most importantly, this course introduced different forms of knowledge production (e.g. art, body movement, consciousness-raising) that are critical to philosophy.",
                "I learned a lot about the development of specific feminist movements and the reasoning for their development. As someone who is used to a more \"brutal\" philosophy course, this one gave me other skills outside of those made popular by Western teachings within philosophy, such as close reading with a group of peers to better understand the text. A major insight from the course was a way to rethink pedagogy in a classroom. They don't always have to be in a seminar fashion and this course practiced that.",
                "so much about what gender is and what it does to us, as well as a lineage of how feminists have conceived of and fought against gender over time. this class will teach you a lot about the philosophy and history of feminism and transness and it will teach you a lot about yourself.",

                "This course is extremely well-facilitated and encourages creative engagement with the material. The small group structure allowed me to participate fully with the readings in an intimate environment, and Prof Dembroff always took time to go through the readings with us if we asked. Overall, I would say a strength of the course is that it allows the student to drive their own learning and take initiative to ask questions in the course, and if a student puts in the work, their experience in the course will be extremely rewarding.",
                "There are too many strengths of the course to name. I thoroughly enjoyed the focus on embodiment and bringing our full selves to class. The breath work was extremely effective as a grounding exercise to help me be present in the classroom. I really enjoyed sitting on the floor and getting rid of the overly structured classroom layout involving clunky and excessively orderly desks. Some of my classmates and I did express that, while sitting on the floor was helpful for creating a positive classroom learning environment, it could at times be uncomfortable. It would be beneficial if bean bags or some alternative floor seating could be provided. \r\n\r\nI also really enjoyed the small group structure of the course discussions. The bond formed in the small groups helped facilitate honest and open discussion of the course materials and their applicability to our experiences. \r\n\r\nI loved all of the activities that encouraged self-reflection. I always left class feeling that what I learned was extremely relevant to my life.",
                "Strength: Robin encouraged us to engage with material in an embodied, compassionate way, which was very unique for classes I've taken at Yale.\r\nWeakness: I found myself wishing we had actually read a larger selection of texts and/or had more of a \"lecture\" component. One of the reasons I took the class was because I wanted a comprehensive survey of feminist theory that has come from the discipline of philosophy. Particularly as an outsider to the discipline who was looking for a way to be conversant with philosophers this was important to me. Instead, we tackled a fairly eclectic selection of readings and were mostly left to our own devices to discuss.",
                "Strengths: very engaging and personable, felt like both my emotional and intellectual selves have grown. Felt that my personal feelings, thoughts and experiences are important in producing and understanding philosophical work, which is often neglected in most other philosophy classes\r\n\r\nWeakness: overall course trajectory not very clear, sometimes some modules are a little repetitive",
                "Prof. Dembroff's pedagogy should be promoted to more classrooms, to enhance collaborative learning and inclusive environment.",
                "It was great having a small group that stayed constant throughout the whole semester. This let me deepen my relationship with others in the class and created a comfortable learning environment. I also enjoyed the different forms of learning that this course encouraged. From our deep dives into texts to small art projects, this class employed multiple strategies to improve the learning experience. The only \"weakness\" is that there was sometimes not enough time to discuss the wonderful texts, but that is due to the time constraints of the course and not the course itself.",
                "Early in the semester when we started each class with breathwork, I found that really helpful. We stopped doing that after awhile, and there were a couple of classes when we sat on the floor with no movement breaks, which felt drastically different from the original stated intention of the class. \r\n\r\nI appreciated that the professor attempted to create a seminar style class with a larger group, but I didn't find that was always successful. Discussion felt limited in my small group with only the perspectives of myself and two others, but without the mediation or conversational guidance of a skilled facilitator. Other times when our small group joined other small groups for conversation, nobody seemed concerned with keeping the conversation on task, and so I didn't get a lot out of our discussions. With subject matter that can be very personal, it seemed like people found it difficult to strike a balance between sharing personal stories and being more objective. It becomes difficult to communicate about ideas when feelings are involved. Additionally, the class was composed of graduate and undergraduate students. Initially, as a grad student, I was excited to hear perspectives from the younger generation, but it became clear that the gap between us all was huge, and there was little common ground. It was alienating to be one of the older students. \r\n\r\nWhile it was stated that we should move through the course forming our own ideas, it seemed to be the expectation by the end of the semester that we would all agree/align with a similar narrative, based on how conversations were shaped. A couple of students seemed to know the professor quite well, and they were vocal in expressing this shared rhetoric. When I was working on my final project, I struggled to feel comfortable sharing anything that didn't fit into the favored rhetoric of the class (that gender is an oppressive social construct). My perspective is that this has more to do with current social polarization and individual personalities than it does with the professor and the course. \r\n\r\nThrough our weekly journals, we had to be accountable to each other by completing the assignments and showing up to class. This was great in theory, because instead of completing the weekly reading and journals because it was required, I found I was more so doing it to be accountable to my small group, and to show up with coherent thoughts. A drawback to this was that one of the members of my group missed a bunch of classes, so it was difficult to exchange our journals because we had to find additional times to meet up outside of class (beyond our monthly group gatherings).\r\n\r\nI recall that one of the earlier objectives Robin stated was to integrate all waves of feminist theory. I don't think we accomplished this goal.",
                "Really interesting texts / format. I really loved my group and expect to stay connected with them in the future. I do with there was slightly more emphasis on discussing the text in class, but I do think that there was a lot of value in the different approaches to learning in this course.",
                "Similarly to what I mentioned before, one of the major strengths of the course was the approach to pedagogy. The beginning of each class started with breathing exercises to get everyone on the same page. We all lay on the floor and breathed together in order to release any tension that we may have entered the classroom with. After breathing we broke off into smaller groups to discuss questions relating to the text and our personal lives and to also deep read the text. All of these approaches felt very different from any philosophy course I have ever taken. That was very powerful of this course, to attempt something so new with such a heavy and rich history as feminism. That being said, at times I felt like that very strength was sometimes its weakness. I mostly felt this because, even though we had good conversations in almost every class, I felt like we could have gone through the text more in-depth than we did. Oftentimes I felt that questions that students would bring up regarding specific passages in the text weren't clearly answered. Not to say that the main objective of a course is to fully understand a text, however, it felt like due to the nature of the course, attempting to understand the text fell by the wayside sometimes.",
                "strength: robin's teaching style! i have never felt more present for a class",
                "The professor was conscious of the class's position in the institutional setting and actively designed a unique learning environment that felt safe and accessible to all students. Conscious efforts were made to dismantle the typical power dynamics of the traditional classroom. As a neurodivergent student, I deeply appreciated the class's setup. Small group learning helped me feel comfortable speaking openly and honestly (and these conversations allowed me to engage with the material and my classmates more deeply), which is lost in typical seminar discussions. Letter writing assignments were effective for the same reasons. Meditation sessions every class were amazing and helped encourage mindful presence in the class (many professors tell you to be mindful/present without ever demonstrating how to do so). Weekly readings printed out were such a thoughtful gesture that also helped my engagement with the texts. This class was truly revolutionary in its approach to feminist philosophy, because we learned how to embody it in every single thing we did in class. \r\n\r\nThis is not a weakness of the class, but in my personal experience, I struggled a bit because I sometimes felt that my small group was not the best match for me. However, it was still a decent dynamic and I think most of us put our best efforts into engaging openly. I wonder if there is a way for the professor to improve the small group selection process.",
                "Overall absolutely incredible course, great content, great professor, great learning environment. The only con was the large class size as I think seminars are always nicer for this kind of subject, but I think that this way everyone who wanted to take the course was able to, and also Robin did a great job of making the best case scenario out of the class size (eg whole class time + small group time)",
                "Strengths: Actually practicing embodied feminist philosophy\r\nWeaknesses: Some chairs or things to support old backs might be useful :)"

                "Yes, highly recommend. The material is intellectually challenging, but Prof Dembroff will help ground the readings in real world circumstances so it is easier to digest. This is not like a typical seminar; you don't go around a table taking turns answering debate questions posed by the professor, but you are put into small groups and you discuss the readings that way. If you want more freedom to explore feminist philosophy without being told the \"correct\" ways to explore it, this would be the course for you.",
