                "Through this course, I greatly expanded my Chinese vocabulary, both in terms of writing and reading. Additionally, I was able to improve upon my Chinese writing skills and corrected some pronunciation mistakes.",
                "I learned pinyin and a lot of Chinese characters. My Chinese reading and writing has improved tremendously, and my speaking has improved lots as well. I learned many new phrases, both colloquial and formal, which I can incorporate in my speech and now writing.",
                "Chinese speaking",
                "I learned a substantial amount of new chinese characters, new grammar, and corrected bad tendencies I used to have in my speech. I also learned some cultural\/historical context for the language, which was useful as I hadnt learned it anywhere else.",
                "Chinese grammar, vocabulary, speaking, reading, and writing skills",
                "Learned intermediate Chinese grammar and vocabulary through relevance to modern topics.",
                "I improved my fluency\/vocabulary in Chinese and improved my reading ability.",
                "Through this class, the number of Chinese characters that I recognize greatly increased. I also am able to write many more characters than I was able to at the beginning of the course. I developed a better understanding of some aspects of Chinese culture."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course is the small class size and individualized attention to an extent, the focus on sentence structures and engaging applicable scenarios to the things we are learning. It is a very intense course with a lot of work, daily quizzes, essays every other week, and projects, but you also learn a lot.",
                "I think a strength of this class is in how it meets daily, since languages are much more effectively learned through repetition. I also liked how this course had more assessments, with tests every couple units and quizzes quite often, because it again reinforces repetition, and it also makes each assessment less stressful, since one bad performance does not so strongly impact my grade. I'm not sure what a weakness is.",
                "I think that the course was very good in what it is designed to do. I think that it's very engaging and forces you to spend time learning Chinese, so no improvement from my end. Maybe a couple of breaks here and there would be nice.",
                "I think a strength was the asynchronous day; it really helped by giving a break without sacrificing much learning. A weakness was definitely the amount of attendance required; it may dissude others from taking the course.",
                "amazing course. structure keeps students engaged and you see a huge improvement in Chinese in a short amount of time.",
                "Strengths: Slightly difficult but intensive and engaging course, emphasized encouraging us to improve oral proficiency through frequent class discussion.\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
                "I really liked how the course was structured and don't have much to say about weaknesses, except that I didn't always feel like I learned a lot from asynchronous Thursdays or the tutorials.",
                "Strengths: very interactive\/participation-based class, repetition to build knowledge, engaging\r\n\r\nWeakness: required a lot of effort to keep up"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, but you must be willing to put in the effort and work to succeed. It was about 2-3 hours or more of work for me a day which includes studying and reviewing.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. My instructor was always very kind and patient and warm which made going to class a joy, and though the homework was more than other classes due to the class meeting daily and being 1.5 credits, it was always straightforward and clear and actually helped me with the course content.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The reason for this is that although the class requires a lot of time and work, putting in the effort will allow a person to improve their Chinese by a great amount. This is particularly the case when it comes to recognizing Chinese characters.",
                "Yes, but only if they can speak Chinese well, and have a basic understanding of the language, otherwise it will be too difficult as it is very fast-paced.",
                "Yes; other students in the same situation as me who can speak and understand chinese but struggle to read and write would benefit greatly.",
                "yes, i would recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their Chinese speaking, writing, and reading abilities.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning Chinese at a very involved and in depth level. Although the workload was high, it never felt like busy work and the payoff is fantastic as I feel like I learned a lot this semester with Professor Liu.",
                "Yes - it is a very fun and engaging class, and a great way to improve your Chinese among peers with similar backgrounds to you.",
                "I would recommend this class as it is very fun and engaging but not challenging. Great course for those who are interested in expanding their basic Chinese knowledge."
