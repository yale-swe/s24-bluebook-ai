I improved noticeably at comprehending real-time speech, largely due simply to the demands of having to follow along with Zhan Laoshi speaking in the class. I also became more confident at speaking without lots of preparation in advance. This course introduced more specifics about the differences between formal\/written and spoken Chinese as well, which helped my essay writing."

                "great Chinese class but very tedious homework assignments. Felt like a lot of busy work.",
                "The course had very few weaknesses (Yale's Chinese department continues to live up to its reputation for excellence!). Strengths were Zhan Laoshi's upbeat, humorous, and interactive teaching, as well as her clear explanations of the minute differences between various words and usages. Every error a student made seemed to be yet another opportunity for explaining something to the class in more depth or introducing a new and better word. While I of course picked up a lot of new vocabulary and grammar over the semester, the speed of the class meant that I doubt I'll remember a good portion of it -- but that's not really a weakness in my book, because the speed\/density was what made the class so effective. The only other issue that I can think of is that the responsibilities for class time were not always consistent: some days, we had a full hour of group discussions that required plenty of speaking for all the students, but other days, when new material was being introduced, you could get by only speaking once during the entire class. I was always anxious about being able to speak well enough, so I never felt comfortable enough to disengage on those days, but I can imagine that some more confident\/advanced students might have that temptation."

And you'd be hard-pressed to find a more supportive and well-put-together language-learning environment anywhere else. You'll never feel lost."
