                "I wish the portfolio project was a little bit more explained in the beginning as that would help as we completed it.",
                "Strengths: lectures are engaging and problem sets are doable (often with TA assistance)\r\nWeaknesses: maybe make problem sets a little clearer in instructions? I feel like this was often why I went to office hours and it could've been avoided",
                "Strength: being able to apply what you learn that week to your own location every week in a PSET and then later compiling it together for a project. The lectures are also extremely fun and engaging, which I love.",
                "Strength - The assignments are self-explanatory and approachable. \r\nWeakness - None",
                "Professor Evans is a great lecturer and really interesting guy. He kept lectures lighthearted and sprinkled in a healthy amount of bad jokes and geologic rapping. The assignments were constant but short, so the final project (which built off the assignments) was a breeze. The class was relaxed and really well-organized.",
                "HOC Evans \"Majestic D\" is a gem. He is very excited about geology and the course make it so that we are interested in it, as it all leads to a final project regarding a chosen portfolio location, usually our hometown.",
                "Less busy work and more directed learning would be helpful. Thought it was organized well and the Professor is a great lecturer.",
                "I think in the past a weakness could be that the final project could be left to the last minute, however, this year Professor Evans responded to feedback and had students undergo research for their final project throughout the term, which is definitely very helpful for completing the final project at the end of the course\r\n\r\nThis course's strength definitely lied in its very educative manner, yet it never felt stressful, which in my opinion facilities learning all the more.",
                "Strengths: lectures are interesting\r\nWeaknesses: homeworks are at times unclear and as it gets more related to the particular portfolio location TFs aren't able to help as much",
                "This course is great. The content is interesting and the learning environment doesn't feel high stakes.",
                "No weaknesses!",
                "I absolutely loved this course! No weaknesses!",
                "PSETS were challenging and didn't feel like they connected to what we learned in lecture. Yes, it's gutty, but you will still need to devote several hours to the PSETs each week as they are not graded lightly. However, I do think I learned a lot through the work I did for the course.",
                "Strengths: very engaging lectures, very accessible for beginners unfamiliar with this topic\r\nWeaknesses: grading on homework inconsistent and nit-picky, often took away from understanding topic\/working on portfolio because of worries about harsh grading",
                "Good structured class. Can not think of any improvements.",
                "Some of the lectures were not very engaging, even though prof. Evans tried to engage even people who weren't interested in the topic",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, lots of support from TAs for problem sets, Prof. Evans is an amazing instructor; weaknesses: None",
                "Strengths: most of the psets are pretty straightforward (you can do them without going to lecture) and Prof. Evans is an entertaining lecturer. Weaknesses: two of the psets were really hard for no reason and the final project is worth so much of your gradeI would much rather have had multiple interim deadlines throughout the semester than have it all due at once.",
                "This is the perfect course for someone looking for a low-pressure introduction to geology. There were a couple homeworks (HW 9 especially) that could have been more straightforward, and perhaps multiple TAs could have been responsible for each homework in the weeks when many office hour slots were filled up. In addition, it seemed like one TA graded much more harshly than the rest, which was surprising but would not necessarily have been a problem if his expectations had been made clearer before the homework was graded. Overall, though, the combination of general lectures with specific weekly assignments culminating in a final project was great, because it enabled us to consistently and thoughtfully apply our general knowledge to a specific location that was meaningful to us, and then share that knowledge with the class and receive feedback through the video component of the final.",
                "The grading for home works was not always straightforward, and lecture recording quality could have been better. I know the low quality recording is meant to encourage people to come to class, but on days when I couldn't make it I had no motivation to try and learn the material after listening to what essentially sounded like whale songs for 55 minutes of my life.",
                "Strengths: Head Evans is a really engaging professor and the lectures were superb + very easy to follow along with. The material of the class was also very applicable to the real world. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it feels like the material from the lecture isnt directly applicable to the psets, which end up becoming an extremely detailed case study into a specific area of the world. Because of this I often zoned out in the lecture as there was a feeling you didnt really need to know the material",
                "The portfolio assignment is a really great way to connect all the concepts we learned at the end of the term, and gives students a clear reason why what they are learning is relevant\/relates to their life at all; the homework sets were a great mix of reviewing the content from class and then applying it to our locations; the class was structured so that even without tests I feel like I have long-term takeaways and learning that will stick with me",
                "The course was really great.  I liked the wide availability of office hours and the amount that the professor broke down the material to a level that was easy to understand.",
                "This course is very well-designed. I appreciated that all of the problem sets work towards piecing together the geologic profile of your portfolio final project. It was a great course for people with limited math\/science backgrounds looking for a broad, interesting science course.",
                "All strengths. This class reignited my interest in geology.",
                "The primary strength of this class is that Professor Evans clearly knows his audience. He adjusted the course material for non-STEM majors and created lectures that were accessible and interesting for everyone. The TAs were also hugely helpful and put aside so much time to answer questions about problem sets.\r\n\r\nThe primary weakness of the class is that the skills needed to tackle the problem sets were not always covered in class. In particular, Problem Set 9 felt like a very big ask given what we had covered in class, and I know that that homework assignment was very difficult for many students. We definitely learned the concepts in class, but the applications of those concepts was not always clear.\r\n\r\nI liked the portfolio project because it allowed us to feel personally invested in what we were doing in class, but it was hard to get specific feedback\/help from TAs because everyone was studying a different location. I sometimes felt like I was flying blind or in over my head because there wasn't anyone I could get location-specific feedback from.",
                "Strength: clear and organized information that is easy to understand; everything uploaded afterward, making it easy to reference when working on the homework; lots of office hours available each week to help with homework; introductory course that is easy for non-EPS majors to understand\r\nWeakness: N\/A",
                "The lectures are engaging and accessible to students without any prior knowledge about the topic. Lecture recordings were helpful to look back at and the final project was meaningful and enjoyable.",
                "Great lectures",
                "I thought the lectures were informative and the psets a good level of work.",
                "Weakness: class too large, office hours and TFs mostly inaccessible",
                "Strengths: engaging and relevant lectures, lots of guidance offered in the form of abundant office hours or consultations, bits of the final project are completed each week so it is not overwhelming at the end\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets didn't necessarily connect with information learned in class, some problem sets required outside research into your portfolio location and depending on what area you chose it could be really difficult to find information or the information was in a foreign language",
                "The course material was fascinating! I particularly enjoyed how each student had a portfolio location that they would study throughout the semester it was a great way to learn a little about the geological history of my hometown."

Also, although this is jokingly called \"Rocks for Jocks\", you won't be slacking off in this class and will still be learning tons. The homework sets ensure you're keeping up with the material and delving deep into your portfolio project.",
                "Yes I would if you need a science gut. My biggest piece of advice I wish someone had told me: GO TO OFFICE HOURS!! EVERY WEEK! Meet with the TF who is grading your assignment and ask them to look it over, that way you will automatically get As on all of the assignments. If not, you risk being docked on stupid points.",
                "Absolutely! Geology touches on so many aspects of life and it's important to understand it on a basic level.",

                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. If you have a heavy course load or need a science credit, this a great class to take. It is not necessarily a gut, but it is definitely a lighter load than most classes here.",
                "Yes!",
                "I am a geo major, but 99% of students take this as an \"easy\" or as I prefer to say accessible stem credit. I would recommend this class especially if you do not feel comfortable with math in your STEM credit.",

As a non-STEM person, who hasn't taken a math or science class in a couple years, this course made the concepts accessible and easy to understand. The p-sets were not too difficult, as long as you stayed up-to-date with lecture, and helped build up for your final project, which I greatly appreciated.",

                "Yes, if they are looking for an engaging science credit that doesn't take up too much time",

                "Yes! Best class I've taken.",
                "I would- it was a good science credit where you actually learned something, and the TFs were super helpful",
                "I would recommend this course if a student is genuinely interested in geology and is willing to engage. I found some topics less interesting than others and could tell when I had to force myself to remain focused compared to when a topic naturally captured my attention, so for students just looking for a science credit, I think this course could actually be really tedious despite the low workload if you're not interested in the material. However, for those who are passionate about the subject, Prof. Evans is a great instructor who is always willing to discuss questions or your project and can impart a lot of knowledge. Also, the work is very manageable overall.",
                "Yes! This is a great intro geology course."
