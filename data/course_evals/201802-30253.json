    "Very good fundamental background to Portuguese before the second part of the course in Brazil.",

    "I learned the basics of Portuguese verbs and vocabulary, as well as a deeper understanding of Brazilian culture.",
    "I learned so much in this course. I can now both write, read and speak Portuguese pretty fluently. I can have conversations in the language.",
    "I developed knowledge of basic Portuguese grammar and vocabulary.",
    "I learned some elementary level Portuguese effectively and was able to utilize it in conversation. Learning Portuguese was made easier by the fact that I was able to practice it every day.",
    "I developed the ability to speak, write, and understand Portuguese as well as a knowledge of cultural aspects of Brazil.",

   "comments": [
    "Perhaps some of the grammar structures could be presented in Portuguese first and then reviewed in English for clarity.",
    "Good variety of material presented (music, book, textbook, videos, etc.) which makes the class more interactive and interesting to follow.",
    "We were immersed in the culture and had to use Portuguese with our families so it was a way to learn it quickly. Prof Bete always made class engaging and exciting. While it is an eight week long program, there is a lot to learn in a short period.",
    "I think it was well organised and great.",
    "It is a very interactive and engaging course that utilized  different ways of getting us involved - audio recordings, movies, compositions, etc. The small class size is also helpful.",
    "I would say this course only has strengths. The language was practiced every day and there was never a dull moment in class where I would feel that I was not learning.",
    "The class is already strong and well taught as it is.",
    "The strength was how interactive it was. The weakness was how much was covered in such a short time."

    "Yes",
    "For sure! Nothing better than learning a new language in the country where it is spoken. Bete is an amazing teacher and you will actually be able to speak Portuguese by the end. I also believe taking language classes over the summer is a lot more enjoyable and easy to manage than during the school of the year.",
    "Yes! I had so much fun in Brazil and would do this program again! I hope to go back to Brazil soon!",
    "Yes. It was an amazing experience and I learned so much. Bete is amazing.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to begin to learn another language, definitely.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning a second romance language. The course is very intense but rewarding at the same time.",
    "Yes, I would. I think Portuguese is a very beautiful and interesting language to learn, and this course was a great way to learn with cultural aspects and activities sprinkled throughout.",
    "Yes I would, it was taught excellently by the professor and she was very good at having us practice it."
