                "Once you get to the workshop portion of the class it is SO FUN, but the first six weeks or so are a bit too lecture heavy in my opinion.",
                "Strengths: everything, the workshops were great, when Derek lectured it was great.\r\nWeaknesses: it was a bit hard to reach Derek at times for office hours.",
                "Strengths: Professor Greens experience constructing plots.\r\nWeaknesses: poor structure, lack of Professor availability, unchallenging assignments, no feedback.",
                "Strengths: There are so many. Derek Green is an awesome professor. He makes class fun always. He has such a great attitude. He has so many stories to share that are actually relevant and helpful. I think there's also a lot in place to support students throughout their writing process, especially with the workshop at the end! The feedback is AMAZING, from the students and Derek. I really felt like I improved because of it.\r\nWeakness: The readings are just kind of a lot, especially the feature film scripts, but I understand why they're helpful. The course is a little too power to the students for me in that there's a lot of onus on us to put the work in and get it done which, as someone who struggles to be a self-motivator, isn't my favorite way for a course to be structured, but also I know some people love the freedom and it's probably a little selfish of me to want handholding so I definitely wouldn't say this is a weakness for EVERYBODY.",
                "Strengths: workshop and reading classmates' work, Derek is a very smart writer and the way he talks about writing is SO helpful for improving your own work and he's super nice, chill, and funny (we were all laughing out loud several times every week), really cool and FUN course with awesome classroom vibes, having basically the whole semester to dedicate to one project\r\nWeaknesses: I wish each class had been a bit more structured and that we had received consistent feedback every week from Derek. I also wish it had been a bit easier to reach him over email and set up meetings to talk about our scripts",
                "I think this class was great! I most enjoyed the workshop phase of the class because it was really helpful to both give and receive notes. The one thing I would say is that we perhaps should have started workshopping sooner (not sure if that's even possible considering where everyone was in their scripts though)",
                "The workshopping towards the end of the course was a major strength. We got to read each other's work and give feedback in a mock writers room which was helpful for our own work and for meeting other writers to work with in the future. We helped each other work out problems and practiced giving feedback. Professor Green is great in helping us to each develop our own ideas and providing support through one on one meetings and assignments that work your way to the larger goal. It is a great feeling to leave the class with a completed draft of an original TV pilot."

                "Unfortunately, no. This course was disappointing. Professor Green is helpful one-on-one, but it was difficult to get him to make time to meet. Class was disorganized. Some take this just for the writing deadline, but just big one at the end of the semester with no feedback along the way. If youre motivated enough to go to Yale you could probably give yourself that deadline. Professor Green is lovely, but not engaged. Your time, energy, and curiosity might be more fruitfully directed elsewhere.",
                "Absolutely. Whether you want to be a TV writer or just enjoy watching TV, this class is just a fun different way to approach creative writing. The environment Derek curates in the class is not one I think should be passed up. Great time.",
                "Yes!! The course is a really cool, rare opportunity to spend an entire semester writing an original TV pilot. The workshop element of the course and reading other student work is also so much fun. Derek is a huge cheerleader of all his students, and his support and kindness is refreshing and makes it easy to take creative risks. He also sets up a super fun classroom vibe. I think the class would benefit from Derek being a bit more organized and structured. We didn't really receive written feedback from him throughout the semester, and he is not the best at responding to email. BUT once you get Derek in a one-on-one meeting, he is INCREDIBLY smart and helpful. (He has definitely transformed my writing for the better). A class worth taking and a professor worth having!",
                "Yes! If you want to have a first draft of a pilot script in just one semester, this would be the class for you! You will also be surrounded by incredibly strong creative writers and the environment was extremely pleasant and definitely facilitated the creative process.",
                "This class is fun and you leave with a tv pilot, which is great. Professor Green does a great job of not overloading you and allowing you to work your way up to the final piece. If you are at all interested in TV writing or want a great creative writing course, this is a great class. You do have to be committed to submitting work for workshop and put in a lot of effort because it is an advanced class, but if you are willing to do that you will love it."
