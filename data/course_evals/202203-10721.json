                "I enjoyed talking in section",
                "Strengths: Prof Jackson and TA were super kind and had very interesting interpretations of the texts",
                "So much could be improved when it comes to how this course was facilitated and professor's feedback but overall I am still happy I took it because I was introduced to this author's work that I otherwise wouldn't have been. Alsothis course is a seminar and so really shouldn't have a section. Though the was section was facilitated, was much more deeply enriching than any seminar class was.",
                "KDJ is an excellent professor with fantastic insights on these works. In order to spend more time on each story (we often rushed), it could be good to trim some of her stories from the syllabus, especially since it may free up more time for discussion, which was often extremely brief outside of section.",
                "Strengths- absolutely the material. Lispector is a wonderful writer with a lot of depth to her oeuvre, and it was very rewarding to explore all of that.\r\nWeaknesses- the seminar didn't feel like a seminar. The discussion section (which wasn't announced until after course registration had ended btw which I felt was unfair) did feel like we got to include our own thoughts (mostly thanks to Daniela, the TF who was wonderful). Professor Jackson tended to just monologue in class, rarely giving people the chance to organically share their thoughts. It also felt like at times he wasn't exactly listening to student responses, as he would often change the topic immediately after instead of continuing with the same thread. Also, we never received grades for any of our assignments -- just feedback, which was confusing in terms of understanding where we stood."

                "An unmissable chance to delve into the works of one of, if not the, greatest short story writers. Clarice's work, transformative and enlightening, begs to be read and dissected--do so in this course.",
                "Honestly, no. If you are motivated enough to read Lispector on your own, please do that because she is a wonderful writer, but it felt like I was wasting my time in the seminar meeting period because we weren't actually *discussing*. Professor Jackson's comments are often insightful, but sometimes bordered on problematic, and he wasn't very receptive to student commentary that disagrees with his. Some of the presentations done by students in class gave me way more insight into Lispector's writing style than Jackson's lecture did. I don't know, maybe someone would enjoy this class as a 5th credit if they're interested in taking it Credit/D, but I found myself getting increasingly annoyed with how Jackson would engage with his students throughout the semester."
