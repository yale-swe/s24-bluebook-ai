                "I gained, dare I say, an eye for beauty -- or at least an appreciation for artistry and beauty in the world that I've never fathomed before. We learn to pay particular attention to form in literature, which opens us up to depths of art rich in meaning.",
                "I honed my close-reading skills in assignments that ranged from philology to chapter analysis to a comparison paper, in which I compared an early American poet with a later American novelist. The class underscored themes of nature, race, gender, sexuality, religion, and more as they are woven through the American experience.",

Each section, the thoughts and critiques of my peers pushed me to deepen my understanding of the books that we were reading, introducing me to new analyses and perspectives with every text. Professor Peters also wrote detailed notes on each of our papers, giving me advice and challenges to address in my next piece of writing. Finally, this class gave me new insights into the American experience, expanding upon the pieces I encountered in high school to broaden and, often, directly confront the \"traditional\" voices that make up its narrative to question the United States' legacy of enslavement and discrimination and create a more inclusive literature."

                "The discussion were always pretty interesting and the class was overall very engaged. John Peters was always great at leading discussion and definitely was very passionate about the topic.",
                "Prof. Peters is excellent! The class discussions were so enriching -- it was a joy to go to class every time (even over Zoom)!",
                "Strength: seminar discussions were very helpful, class was very casual and open-minded, literature was classic\r\nWeaknesses: more poetry than I expected from the title of the course",
                "Discussions were always exciting and the topics covered were fascinating. The range of works we read was also great. Wouldnt change a thing, except maybe have it be in person.",
                "The real strength of this course are the people. Professor John Durham Peters is one of the smartest, most loving, and best professors I have ever had -- he is the real gem of this course. Don't take this course because you're into the books listed on the syllabus, take it to experience even a few tastes from the repository of his wisdom. The way he guides you into approaching literature is unmatched -- he will help you find artistry in even the most seemingly minor details of the work. He's also great with students -- he loves to help you with essays and is excellent in finding ways to escape writer's block. Another strength is the students -- because the course is a seminar, I learned so much from my fellow students. Each student brings a different perspective and strength in literature analysis, which creates a really rich learning environment. The books were great, but it doesn't really matter what the books are -- with this professor and with bright students, any book is worth reading.\r\n\r\nThe only qualm I had was, as a slow reader, I felt the reading was a little too rushed for me. I would prefer choosing fewer books and taking some more time on each work. Professor Peters had days exclusively on poetry between heavy books, which softened the blow a little.",
                "Regarding the reading list: through a mix of canonical works and newer additions, the course captured both texts consider foundational and those which represent the shift of American literature in recent years. However, the class did skip Toni Morrison (which was not a big deal as I really appreciated the texts we covered); but she is so central in American Literature and we only had one other black female author in Natasha Tretheway. \r\n\r\nStrengths: the readings were well-paced (Moby-Dick broken over three weeks), and various, striking a meaningful dialectic of prose and poetry; the assignments too were helpfully various, helping us hone our analytical writing skills in exciting ways that encouraged radical connections rather than subsume them in narrow prompts. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\/for future reference: as I lover of theatre, I hope American Literature can incorporate at least one play, be it by August Wilson, Sam Shepard, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, etc. or it could incorporate an author we covered Hughes, in his collaboration with Zora Neale Hurston, \"Mule Bone.\" Regardless of what is selected, I think the course would benefit from the third medium, to expose prospective English majors to the literary worlds and potential that plays open.",
                "I thought the course was a great time! Professor Peters did a great job of creating a fun and supportive class atmosphere, and I always looked forward to our discussions. I enjoyed some of our break-out room sessions, and would have appreciated more variations on the standard seminar-discussion from time to time.",
                "The strengths of this course were absolutely the people. Our seminars were undoubtedly the highlight of my week for the rich discussions that we had about complex material, as well as the bonds that we formed. Our class came to feel like a book club among friends, as we informed and critiqued each other's analyses and peer-edited each others' papers throughout the writing process. This course had no weaknesses--it was an absolute pleasure!"

Despite the physical distance between us, my seminar connected with one another over the course of the semester, even despite the pandemic. The seminar format perfectly transferred to the medium. It was only a shame that we couldn't meet in the same classroom together every week, so we lost some of the spontaneous conversations that come with in-person discussion. Nevertheless, Professor Peters tried to recreate some of those exchanges through office hours, keeping the class going a few extra minutes for those who could stay, and an end-of-the-year virtual class dinner."

It is particularly refreshing in time where identity proudly as American has become increasingly complicated by recent politics.",

While a foundational course geared toward the English major, this class features readings and discussions that are valuable for any student. The conversations we had in this course about complex subject material made me a better thinker, literary critic, and, however cheesy (yet true) it is to say, a better American citizen. The people I encountered through this course, from my seminar mates to Professor Peters, are among the most thoughtful and empathetic students I have encountered at Yale. This seminar became the highlight of my week during an incredibly difficult semester. In my opinion, it is a must-take here at Yale."
