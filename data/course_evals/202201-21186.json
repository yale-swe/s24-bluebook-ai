                "I gained a very basic understanding of how to make and edit video, and learned a lot about documentary theory and concepts. I think the course focused extremely heavily on exploring the ethics of documentary, with a lot of the readings focusing on what the proper way to tell a story is.",
                "Coming into FILM 162 I had no experience with professional film equipment, editing software, or what goes into producing documentaries. Walking away from this course I learned how to use a Black Magic cinema camera, learned how to tinker with audio equipment, edit on PremierePro and DaVinci, learned about the resources that Yale has to offer through CCAM and about how to tell compelling stories that bring change through documentary. These were skills that I learned both inside and outside of the classroom, as this course engaged my interest and learning all the time. Through our readings I learned about how to tell the right story and the right ways to tell it, I learned about the ethics that go into respecting one's subject matter and how to take responsibility behind the camera. Through viewing documentaries I learned about the modes of storytelling that I liked and disliked, and how documentary can take on many different forms. Lastly, through out projects I delved into my creativity and built up new artistic skills I hope to carry on into future projects.",
                "This course touches on all different sides of documentary making. It focuses on audio and visual techniques, and we watch a lot of documentaries along the way. Also, for the final project, we gained experience in production - how to you schedule and plan what you want to shoot, and then how to you adapt when things don't go as planned. The area which I grew the most in was developing the technical editing skills behind documentary (using Premiere Pro & Audition). This is a skill that can really only be developed by doing and troubleshooting, so the final project was a great place to learn this!",
                "How to use documentaries, things about the camera",
                "I learned a lot about how to think about documentaries. I also learned a lot about filmmaking.",
                "I improved my skills in film editing and filming documentary interviews.  A large portion of this class was devoted to breaking down the mystique of a camera as an objective manner of capturing a situation, at times almost seeming jaded.  It is important to understand that a camera represents one person's perspective of a situation, not the entirety, but that does not make that perspective irrelevant or necessarily manipulative.  Videos are arguments in the same way that essays are arguments.\r\n\r\nThe final project allowed me to do research into a topic of my choice. I became much more knowledgeable about child development and psychology.",
                "I learned a lot about documentary filmmaking. We watched other films as well as made our own films, so I learned about analysis as well as practice."

            "comments": [
                "I think the strengths are instilling the concepts of storytelling and documentary ethics. I think the weakness is that there was not enough focus on the video/filmmaking side. I think that more emphasis could be placed on how to shoot video, how to use Premiere, etc.",
                "The strengths of this course is that it truly teaches about you how to produce a documentary on every level. The course encourages you to learn outside of class, and build up a passion for film-making. In class we were given helpful feedback from the instructors and our peers that we could then use to improve our next project. The readings, QCQs, and films assigned also prompted us to think critically about what goes into making a documentary film both through what is captured on camera and what goes on behind the skills. It taught me to approach my art form with respect and purpose, and to consider the way my work is received on a wider scale. I think this course could be improved by teaching us more logistics on how to improve our skills and develop our own style of film. I think the course does a good job at giving you feedback and come to that on your own, but it would also be great to receive more guidance on that aesthetic front through more technical workshops of which we had one or two over the course of the semester.",
                "The strengths of this course was its structure, and the peers in the course. A huge area of learning was from seeing how your peers imagine and create their documentaries. Everyone's minds worked in very different ways and had different interests, so I feel like reviewing each other's material was a huge space of learning. I also felt that Steiner, and especially Emily, were a huge gift to the course. They, and the inherent structure of engaging with each other's material, created a class community where we could speak freely and use each other as sources while making our movies. I also think the class in itself is a gift -- it is not often at Yale that we get to engage in such a different way of thinking, or that we have the space to take on something like making a documentary. \r\n\r\nI would say the weakness of this course is that you don't engage with the homework viewing and reading material as much, so sometime the motivation do it was lessened. However, I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing -- I find it much more valuable to go through people's individual projects and talk through them, so that should remain the focus of the course. However, I wish perhaps less additional material was assigned, and we focused more on the projects.",
                "More interaction with how to use the camera and more technical aspects. As a person who had no experience with film, it would have been preferred with technical aspects would have been explained more in class rather than expected to learn it by yourself outside of class for the assignments",
                "The weekly assignments and final project were great. There wasnt always discussion about the readings we did.",
                "The assigned projects that allowed us to film, record sound, and edit were phenomenal because they encouraged contact with the medium.  However, the assigned writings were almost uniformly post-modern, deconstructionist manifestos.  They seem enamored by their own rebellious inclinations against social norms and valued pushing an agenda over any kind of objectivity.  I was not impressed and felt my time could have been much better spent on works written by influential documentarians.\r\n\r\nThe best part of the course was the freedom given to us on the final project to research a topic, conduct interviews, and produce a video.  This should be told to us in the first weeks so that we can begin drafting an idea early meaning we can spend more time in production and editing.",
                "I liked this course very much. The workshop-like environment is very nice, and the course materials are very interesting."

                "I would if making video/storytelling is interesting to you! It's a lot of work so it's kind of a big commitment.",
                "I think that this a great production class for anyone interested in learning about film. Documentary as a medium is useful for all fields of studies and learning the skills to edit, handle camera equipment, and build a compelling narrative are all skills that you will develop in this course that you can only add to future endeavors. This course was so much fun and helped me think both critically and creatively. It takes a good level of problem solving, time commitment, and craft. In the end, it ended up being one of the most rewarding things I've done as you really end up piecing together an entire documentary on your own. It make all the time and dedication absolutely worth it!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course to another student. While watching documentaries and then creating your own, you will realize how much editing is a deliberate process and you won't watch other films in the same way. I also feel like the class gave me a chance to explore an interest I'd always had, but had never given myself the time for. I ended up making a film about a group I am a part of at Yale (FOOT), and getting to dive into its history through archival footage and interviews gave me such a deeper appreciation of it. All this is to say, documentary is a medium through which we can learn about other things we love. It was an amazing class that I got so much out of!!\r\n\r\nHowever, the caveat is that it's a course you need to have the time for. Editing takes so long (and always longer than you think), so you have to have the space to allow for editing troubleshooting, experimentation, and failing. It's not a course where assignments can be rushed (also, \"rushed\" may mean you spent 3-4 hours on it, longer than most other course homework). Also, I feel like you get so much more out of it if you can immerse yourself in the work.",
                "Yes, it was very fun.",
                "Not really.  The group was kind and supportive, but the material of the class was disappointing.  Focusing on the counter-cultural applications of documentary takes away much of its wonder and beauty.",
                "Yes, I would. For anyone who is interested in exploring documentary film, this class is very interesting and would be a good place to start."
