One part that I disliked was that the student presentations were supposed to take 15 minutes but usually extended for most of the class, and I would have preferred to hear what the professor could tell us about the topic instead. I also would have liked more of a focus on the comic Dionysian.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the material is very entertaining and the professor is extremely knowledgeable about it. This course was very much how I imagined a small liberal arts seminar: creative, independent, and about a niche topic/works. In terms of improvement, some instructions when it came to assignments/assignment deadlines could have been clearer."

                "Definitely recommend the course everyone. Professor Symiris is one of the smartest and most inspiring professors I have met at Yale. It was refreshing to have a Mediterrenean professor that I felt close to my culture and to learn from. This course is a must on your way to become a truly well-rounded individual. Professor Symiris always facilitates amazing discussion."
