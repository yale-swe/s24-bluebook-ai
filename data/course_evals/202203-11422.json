I learned how to target specified locations of an image, create collages, merge images, and how to take a scene to the next level by searching for tension or mysterious forces at work. However, all of these capabilities came second to the times I shared with my teacher and classmates and the deep topics we unraveled together.",
                "Fine art photography. Photography techniques and art creation.",
                "So much! I learned how to work with a DSLR camera, take really good photos, how to edit & work with photoshop, camera raw, and print photos!",
                "Despite having had a history of taking digital photographs, Danna's class taught me so much more than I could've ever learned alone. We discussed the technical \"basics,\" such as light, composition, form, etc., however, we also discussed the more abstract components that are involved in photography, such as asking what \"questions\" the photo is asking, if it is \"successful\" for what it wants to accomplish. Generally, I feel like I gained a much largeryet in-depthsum of knowledge than I previously (and navely) thought possible: that is to say, I wasn't sure if I would feel as though the class was getting stagnant as the year went on. I can confidently say that I absolutely never felt that way in Danna's class.",
                "Most of all, I learned how to create better photos and how to think more thoughtfully about others photos. I also gained value insights about some issues in contemporary photography.",
                "In this course I learned how to use a digital camera, how to work with lighting and shadows, how to direct photographs, and how to edit and print pictures. Through the photography critiques, I also learned how to think critically about photographs and evaluate my own works and those of others.",
                "This course gives a comprehensive dive into the world of arts photography. There is some technical overview of cameras regarding aperture, shutter, etc, but that is not the focus of the course. We started with fundamental concepts like framing photos and using light and shadow, and it culminated in a final project completely of your own choosing. The class is incredibly flexible and you can always choose to carve out your own path and explore more deeply what you want to with the professor as a guiding hand.",
                "I learned to take photos with a digital camera. I also learned about different photographers and the what makes a good photo."

                "I do not think there were any weaknesses in this course. One of the things I enjoyed most was being able to venture outside of class and see others' work in MFA portfolios and museums. I think it would be really cool if the class could take a field trip in the future somewhere and take pictures together.",
                "No weakenesses. Was one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale.",
                "This course is absolutely amazing! I have no complaints - there are no weaknesses! I had almost no prior photography experience but I LOVED this course so so so much! DEFINITELY take it if you can!",
                "Strengths are the class size, approachability (i.e. any level of photographer is welcome and made to feel included), breadth of projects/lessons while also allowing for individual depth in topics that personally interest individual students, and just the generally neutral, yet inquisitive, way the course approaches digital photography...especially in our increasingly-advanced digital age where technically 'anyone' can be a photographer. Weaknesses were truly not to do as much with the class style and/or professor as it does a lack of funding for Yale's creative institutions, to be completely honest. CCAM and Bass Media are excellent resources for people in this class to utilize, however, the knowledge that they exist is often only shared by word of mouth...and even then both of those lending labs are underfunded. Again, this is entirely my opinion. However, it was a bummer to see my classmates be so excited about conducting a shoot in a certain way, only to find out that there weren't enough tripods, lights, specific lenses, etc. to be able to actually make it happen.",
                "The course was a little light on the technical side of photography. I wish there was some more guidance through learning how to edit.",
                "This course is a wonderful photography course - both for beginners and more experienced photographers. We are given enough direction to learn and enough freedom to be creative and enjoy the process of photography. Danna is a great teacher and a really good person.",
                "The course is a little unorganized feeling, but that isnt really a weakness because of the incredible flexibility that is also offered.",

                "YESSS!!! A thousand times! Definitely take this course if you get a chance! I LOVED it so so much! It is simply amazing!",
                "Absolutely. If the class remains a smaller size (i.e. 15-ish maximum) and the professor continues to provide a space for students of all levels to learn about the actual fundamentals about photo/digital photoas opposed to just being focused with the outcome of 'good' photoslike Danna did, this class is one that I believe anyone can, and should, take. It's not just focused on what it takes to make a picture; there is space for students to dive in to individual interests with anything photography-related or about specific photograph, such as the ethics of street photography, investigating color vs. b&w photographers, etc. I always felt engaged in this course and with the work, none of it ever felt like busy work.",
                "If you want to learn about the basics of photography or just have an opportunity to shoot and get feedback, take this course! It's awesome!",
                "I definitely recommend this to any student who is interested in photography. This class will make your semester brighter.",
                "I couldnt praise this course enough to do it justice. It is an excellent course that gets you away from typical p-set or essay work, but it is still an intellectual challenge and is incredibly rewarding. It almost feels like doing the work for this class is a break from the average work of other classes, but at the same time you spend just as much time, if not more, shooting, editing, or printing photos as you do on work from any other course."
