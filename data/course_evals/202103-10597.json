                "This course lived up to its name; the majority of the semester was spent on learning first through fourth species counterpoint in various voice combinations. I learned the rules of each species, the practicality of invertible counterpoint and compound melody, and how they might be used in a composition; as Dr. Harrison said many times this semester, \"counterpoint is indeed a compositional technique, unlike any forms of analysis.\" These forms of analysis were the focus of the second half of the semester, wherein we began with traditional classical phrase structures, which naturally branched out into simple harmonic analysis according to Dr. Harrison's familiar yet specific system. By the end of the course, we were analyzing more difficult Scarlatti Sonatas and Bach's Passacaglia in C Minor for contrapuntal, harmonic, and architectonic elements that we had studied throughout the semester.",

                "I learned a lot in this course! I was taught how to correctly compose the different species of tonal counterpoint, how to analyze the chordal structure of pieces and some of the compositional tactics used by composers, and how to identify larger structural forms in music."

                "Strengths: Amazing professor, interesting material taught in a thoughtful and planned manner.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Counterpoint assignments take time leave yourself an extra chunk in your schedule!",
                "The course covers a lot of ground in a short period of time. Still, a strong musical background is encouraged, as topics taught in intro theory classes (but more advanced than note reading) are expected, such as types of cadences and intervals.",
                "The course material is extremely interesting and lectures/discussion sections are always quite fun! I found myself feeling very accomplished whenever I did something right or a concert clicked in my head, its really fulfilling. The workload of this class is pretty high, however, and sometimes it can be overwhelming. Professor Harrison and the TF are extremely accommodating though, and if theres something youre confused about you can always ask them and they will explain it perfectly.",
                "This is a really thorough course, and I think it does a really good job of communicating the skills it aims to teach. I will say that it is a significant workload, and sometimes, it felt a little overwhelming-I sometimes felt that I spent a lot of time teaching myself material in order to complete assigned work. Otherwise, I thought this was a very strong course."

                "If youre genuinely interested in theory or are thinking about pursuing music seriously, then definitely! The material is very interesting and Professor Harrison is so passionate about what he does, its hard to not be intrigued. Plus, the class size was very small so I became really friendly with a lot of the other students! Working together as a group makes this course much more enjoyable. The workload can be overwhelming at times and sometimes the class moves a bit fast, but just talk to the professor or the TF if theres something you arent getting. They will explain everything super well and patiently, and they are more than willing to give you extra time on an assignment if necessary (there isnt a late penalty on work, theyre much more focused on you turning in your best possible work than you rushing to submit something)",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they were willing to put a significant amount of time into doing homework for it. I learned a lot, but I think I went into it thinking it would be a little bit less challenging than it ended up being."
