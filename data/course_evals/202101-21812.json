                "I learned about child development, developing curriculum for young children, and the role of the teacher in the classroom. The role of the teacher is much more complex and nuanced than I had originally thought, especially when it comes to encouraging the children to become inquisitive learners, instead of just drilling information into their minds. We learned a little about racism and talking to children about differences, which I found to be very illuminating. I learned about the role of blocks in the preschool, and how mathematics skills (sorting, classifying, ranking) can be taught in a fun manner. One of the biggest takeaways I got from this class is that early childhood educators are essential for creating young, inquisitive members of our society, and they should definitely be paid and valued by our community more!",
                "I learned SO much from this course. Not only do you get a glimpse into the history of education, you also learn to develop a really strong understanding of children, how they learn, and what is important for child development. I got to observe a child once a week which also helped me develop a relationship with him. Overall, I feel that I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge and insights from this course.",

                "Strengths: the weekly in-person observation of my child was so much fun and honestly the highlight of my week. I got to observe the development of my young child (she was 11 months when I first saw her, and is now about 15 months old!) which was pretty awesome. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not all of my peers were able to secure in-person shadowing opportunities, which was kinda disappointing. I hope next year the shadowing component can be in person for everyone!",
                "There were assigned readings each week which helped with comprehension. It was also largely discussion-based which was also great. Guest lectures, videos, and other materials were also used to supplement learning.",

                "This course is one of the most well taught at Yale. I have no suggestions for improvement.",
                "Very involved, firsthand experience with young children. Class discussions were great, though guest lectures were a bit too frequent.",
                "amazing to observe a child and all the lectures",
                "This course is wonderfully taught and relies on observations of children to supplement the material discussed in class. The only limitation to this year's class was the inability to observe children in a daycare setting at Calvin Hill, but this most likely (hopefully) will not apply to future semesters.",
                "it was nice to have so many speakers, but i would have liked to have a class hearing from Professor Horwitz about her experience and career (this was interspersed throughout the course, but it would have been nice to hear more!!)",
                "I like the structure of the journals. I think the materials exploration was a bit rushed in that we found out about it close to when it was due, but it ended up working out and I think the timeline will work out better next year after we were the guinea pig year.",

If you are at all interested, you should take it.",
