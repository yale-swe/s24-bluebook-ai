            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The lectures were well-organized logically. I liked the research proposal project. It was nice to have scoring guidelines as a reference when composing the proposal. Prof Hartman and teaching scholars were fast to reply to emails and Ed discussion questions. Weaknesses: There were way too many examples in lectures. Little context was given for very specific examples, which made the lectures hard to follow and obscured the important key concepts.",
                "Strengths: the content is interesting to me as someone interested in biology\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures are not very engaging and do not prepare students for the weekly quizzes. the weakly quizzes are very difficult andn not super useful. the homework assignment is not well supported nor relevant to course concepts",
                "Strengths: general understanding of  developmental processes, TAs are kind and helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Concepts are very disorganized. Feels like the course has been arranged in a way to make comprehension as difficult as possible, and we are quizzed on some arbitrary details in the lecture slides but not other concepts that were taught.",
                "The main weakness is the lecture. Sometimes it feels too slow, sometimes too fast. It usually ended past the end time, and hard concepts were rushed through while we would spend a lot of time on easier ones. I stopped going to the lecture in the second week because I got the content better going through the lectures on my own.",
                "This course provided an in-depth exploration of genetics and development. The content was interesting and engaging. \r\nI think the biggest area for improvement is providing students with more opportunities to strengthen their grasp of the course content. Since the quizzes in this class are very challenging (the content is completely fair, but students in class definitely struggle with them), it would be very helpful to give students problem sets (even if optional) for them to practice answering the style of questions that are on the quizzes. The problems sets could be in addition to the homework research proposal, similar to BIOL 101. Additionally, it might be helpful to set aside a little bit of time in Discussion Sections for students to ask questions about the content or for students to do some group practice questions. All this practice would be particularly useful because usually quiz grades are not released until after students have already taken the next one, so I think giving everyone consistent opportunities to be practice would be excellent. \r\nI really appreciated all the effort that the professors, teaching scholars, and peer tutors put into the class and the support they provided BIOL 103 students throughout the course.",
                "The course was very strong in that the discussion sections were very well-organized. I also found the organization of Ed Discussions to be particularly useful. The course could be improved through making the slides a little more readable.",
                "As usual, the biggest strength of this course was Professor Hartman: she is the sole reason I have been able to make it through the BIOL sequence so far along with BIOL 103. She is a very caring instructor and goes above and beyond for her students and wants to see us succeed. I did enjoy the lectures on an interest level, but they were a bit difficult to follow. I loved Professor Zhong's lecture style, but I wish his slides had a little bit more content on them (rather than just a photo or diagram). The lack of content on lecture slides made studying a bit difficult sometimes. Professor Hartman's lecture on stem cells was definitely a highlight of the course! We would love to see more lectures from Hartman in BIOL 103 and in the BIOL sequence in general. The quizzes were also unnecessarily stressful, and students would benefit from having even just 5 additional minutes to spend on quizzes.",
                "Strengths: sheer amount of support from instructors, organization of course material, enrichment, material itself. Quizzes were nice because one could focus on the overarching concepts of development (for the most part) instead of the nitty-gritty details of genes, proteins, and expression of traits. I think this course does a very good job of setting students up to be creative in sciences and how to develop a scientific way of thinking. I really enjoy thinking creatively in the biological sciences.\r\nWeaknesses: more straightforward lecture examples (sometimes concepts are not explained straightforwardly), more accessibility for students who may need extra flexibility. I wish I had an overarching understanding of development and the sequential  steps; I was only able to get them once I went to office hours (e.g. how to get from zygote to gastrulation to neural development to segmentation, etc.). Would appreciate more thought experiments and making students think on their toes about this material (either by asking questions during lecture or posting extra material to get students to think about the material creatively, and not in a way that is static)",
                "Strengths there are a lot of resources for support & reinforcement, Prof Hartman is incredibly available and willing to help walk you through things and so are the peer tutors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses while the lectures each had key concepts/learning goals to help guide concepts/provide focus, it was really difficult to organize material and know what details would be specific and understanding the concepts. It felt as we were jumping between aspects of development instead of learning it in a chronological matter which i think would have helped my understanding a lot more",
                "Strengths: the professors really engaged with the topic and were always interested in teaching us all they could about the material, and shared their passion with what they were teaching. I also really liked Enrichment, and how that made it so that the concepts explained in class were a bit easier to understand.  The topics in classes seemed to build upon one another, and it was something that I thought was wonderful in the way that it led to be understood. \r\nThere seems to be a bit of a disconnect between what is actually taught in the class and what is assigned as homework as well as there is on quizzes. The homework itself did not feel tailored to the course, and while we did research in the course, it did not seem necessary to do the research for homework; it felt like busy work more than anything that did not aid in my or others' understanding in the course itself. The quizzes, likewise, had a lot of questions that were very specific and discussed details that were not fully gone over or skipped over in class.",
                "Professor Zhong just simply give terrible lectures. They are hard to follow, understand, and you do not coming out retaining much of anything. I'm not sure how to improve this aspect other than finding another professor.",
                "I enjoyed section and the TAs were all extremely helpful. Lectures were insightful, but sometimes disorganized and relied too much on specific examples and not enough on over-arching principles. As I've found with most of the introductory sequence, the subject material is much higher level than expected, and often seems unapproachable. One strength is that they offer enrichment. The homework assignments, in my opinion, did not feel beneficial in helping understand the principles of genetics. They got me \"thinking like a scientist\" but I felt like I wasn't engaging with subject matter much.",
                "covers too much material, it's unclear what you're supposed to be learning",
                "I liked the course-long project (I felt like this helped me engage with the material) but I felt like the weekly quizzes were unnecessarily specific and challenging.",
                "I didn't like how the problem sets weren't really related to the class content. Like it was an important skill but it didn't help reinforce what we learned in lecture. A strength was the weekly quizzes forced you to study regularly.",
                "The course is terrible. As with 102, it seems way too difficult and specific to be a part of introductory biology. Because I have no background in biology, I struggled through the class and still learned almost nothing. The course could be improved if it was just taught by a better professor.",
                "The course was very good about going over the research project and I learned a lot about the scientific method. The lectures sometimes moved a bit fast and did not cover material to the depth needed for the quizzes. In addition, the quizzes required very specific knowledge about genes etc (matching letters to gene function) rather than focusing on conceptual questions.",
                "Strengths were that the content itself was very interesting and the research proposal writing process was very useful for those wanting to do research in the future. I think even though the quizzes themselves were often more specific than what the professor let on, some of the questions were useful in making you think about the content\r\n\r\nPrimary weakness was that the professor himself seemed very angry and specific when asking for student answers and input to questions during lecture. Further, there were many times in which there was an emphasis on learning the concepts and that what was being taught was for \"information only-- will not be tested on exams\" when in fact they were on assessments. In fact, we were told explicitly that the last lecture taught in this course would not show up on the final exam, and was told multiple times that only lectures 1-11 would be tested. However, the final exam did contain questions regarding the last lecture.",
                "Strengths: you have to spend a lot of time on this course, so you immerse yourself quite a bit in the subject matter and learn stuff I suppose.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were really tough to follow. Things were said but were not understood. Concepts were not well explained. Learning was not reinforced through psets, which was a strength of 102 that was not conserved in 103. The homework was not a great experience - it was kinda cool to learn about one specific thing, but having to make up a dubious research proposal with the little information we had was stress-inducing.",
                "Strengths to be honest is the rigor of the course. It actually made me learn something in the end because of the countless times I had to go over something in order to understand it. I felt that the HWs were tough because I waited until the night before to do them, but probably would have been more useful if I took time to really focus on them. Weakness of the class is probably the amount of work it takes to understand everything. Although the professor is sometimes hard to understand at first, I think he does a good job at leading you to the point he is trying to make and is very knowledgeable.",
                "The content was very interesting, and Professor Zhong lectures very well too. I really enjoyed being in lectures, and writing the grant proposal was a fun change from normal PSETs. The quizzes were quite difficult sometimes, but I still enjoyed the class overall even being someone who really dislikes learning about development.",
                "Lecture was not particularly engaging, and homework did not at all build on concepts from lecture. (Both homework assignments/Section discussions felt disjointed from lectured material.)\r\n\r\nAssessments were frequent and challenging but definitely solidified my understanding of the concepts. I might have preferred problem sets instead of research proposal to help nail down lectured concepts.\r\nLecture slides and Enrichment material was clear and well-organized.",
                "There are so many weaknesses that I'm sure the other reviews will cover. Short list: lecture, slides, quizzes, lack of psets, focus on random gene and transcription factor, discussion section seemed pointless. Professor Hartman holds enrichment once a week that you can attend to have someone actually teach the material, the only way to survive when Professor Zhong is the lecturer.",
                "strengths: you learn a lot\r\nweaknesses: taught in a very challenging way, heavy focus on experimental methods",
                "Because the research proposal was an entirely separate assignment, it took away from my learning of the lecture material, particularly since I had to focus on the homework every week. This made doing well on the timed quizzes difficult. However, enrichment was helpful: walking through the lecture content slowly, allowing for questions, and rephrasing the key concepts were all strengths. Reflecting back, I found that we covered a lot of experimental techniques in lectures that were useful when it came to coming up with the experimental aims and procedures, only I didn't know how to apply that knowledge then and relied largely on my own understanding of the research papers I came across. I think it would be really beneficial to have brief one-on-one mentor meetings while working on our research proposals to get regular feedback and guidance.",
                "Strengths: Professor Zhong and Professor Hartman were incredible. Prof. Zhong is a very very kind person and really takes the time to ensure that students understand the material, and his slides really reinforce the material. The quizzes, though difficult at first, were very helpful in studying for the final exam throughout the semester, rather than cramming at the end. Prof. Hartman was excellent as always (Go to enrichment!!). The Teaching Fellows are also incredible resources. The grant proposal provided me with really vital skills that I appreciated. Weaknesses: The discussion section papers, just felt like too much at times when I was doing so many different assignments each week for this class. The workload itself is a huge weakness, but it really builds your time-management skills.",
                "Strengths: if you try hard enough, you will get a good grade. TFs were great.\r\nWeaknesses: large lecture so it won't be very engaging. Also I didn't like how the professor would hold the recorded lectures from last year as leverage to get you to come to class. I feel like if it's very convenient for you to upload past recordings, you should do so.",
                "Strengths: Interesting and rewarding content, supportive professors and teaching team. Enrichment with Professor Hartman is a great resource to go over content again and really absorb material in a smaller setting, taught in a different way using collaborative and overview-based methods. Problem sets (which are research proposal assignments in 103) are less time-consuming and complex than in BIOL 102, while weekly quizzes are challenging but relate more closely to specific points from lectures than the BIOL 102 problem sets did. The workload was not quite as high as BIOL 102 but conceptual difficulty rose during timed quizzes and tests. Overall the content and engagement of this course outweighed most negatives.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures sometimes felt a bit unfocused, with several slides talking about the same process but not fully making this clear because there were small amounts of text on the slides or few immediately recognizable connections between the figures used. A greater use of bullet points across slides, with each slide having a clear title of specifically what it describes, might be a more effective method of organizing key events and concepts. Weekly quizzes and the final exam contained short answer questions which were sometimes unclear in terms of what they were actually looking for, which often made studying for these quizzes challenging. Section is also less helpful than in previous BIOL courses, as it is more focused on the specific topical conclusions of selected papers and less focused on understanding the key concepts underlying those conclusions.",
                "provide practice quiz questions",
                "- strength: excellent slides\r\n- strength: interesting content\r\n- strength: discussion sections complemented lecture fairly well\r\n- weakness: so-called \"enrichment\" content should just be made public to all students. i.e., slides + readings.",
                "The strengths were enrichment offered by Prof Hartman, I wouldn't be passing without her. She is incredible and her explanations were so clear. The project was nice because it was cumulative and we got feedback, so the class felt interactive. Weaknesses are Prof Zhong is hard to understand at times and tends to explain in complicated and long-winded ways, but ultimately I did learn the content. Another weakness is that we don't know much about biotechnology, but are expected to know it to answer quiz/final/project questions.",
                "The lecture content was not organized very well and the homework was not very helpful in strengthening the material for quizzes and exams. I enjoyed the discussion section readings and discussions in a smaller group setting.",
                "This is the worst class i've taken; lectures are incomprehensible. And discussion sections did nothing to reinforce/help understand course material.",
                "Strengths: You learn a lot by taking this course! A good amount of material is covered in depth and there is lots of support from the teaching team. Weaknesses: The final exam tested very small details that were not emphasized in lecture.",

                "Well taught",
                "The course covered a lot of useful material, but I felt like it was not engaging enough for students. For me, some of the information felt inaccessible and I did not care for it.",
                "A strength of this course is that Professor Zhong is very knowledgeable about the topic, and specifically focuses on neural development, which I am personally very interested in. A great weakness of the course is that the quizzes are much harder than expected, and no study resources are provided unless the student attends enrichment with Professor Hartman (which seems to provide a significant advantage). The quizzes have a short time limit, and the time allotted is not enough to truly demonstrate our understanding of the concepts. This is because the open ended application questions towards the end of the quiz are often very conceptually complex, and require a certain amount of time to think about how elements may interact. But due to the incredibly short time limit, I personally felt that I did not have enough time to clearly think through the problem.",
                "Just read the slides.",
                "Quizzes are very difficult \r\nHomework assignments were helpful",
                "Enrichment saved my life during this course. The lectures sometimes became abstract during class and having extra time outside of the lecture to discuss what wed learned really brought it down to earth. Professor Hartman is an amazing teacher.",
                "The strengths were the material and the discussion sections but the weaknesses were how the material was presented. It sometimes felt rushed or not thoroughly explained",
                "A strength is the ending slide for all the lectures. Having the key points available to me was really helpful in structuring my notes and understanding. A weakness of this course is the organization. I feel like a lot of the content having to do with early embryonic development could have been better understood if we followed the chronological pathway. I felt very confused as we jumped between the different stages.",
                "Strengths- passionate Professor, amazing and cutting edge knowledge",
                "I feel the resources are great and I enjoyed the research proposal. However, lectures were sometimes really long and quizzes challenging.",
                "The final project felt a bit pointless. In some ways it felt as if i was throwing data together that may not have matched in order to propose something that fit the criteria given that had not been done before.",
                "I love the peer tutors and enrichment sessions. There should be more class examples and activities during lecture.",
                "I struggled to recognize what information was truly important to takeaway from each lecture to understand what I needed to study. This made the weekly quizzes a steep learning curve to figure out how to understand how to study for them. It wasn't until the last 3 quizzes that I felt I knew how to study for them.",
                "Too much information on the slides.",
                "The weakness of this course is that there is too much material for us to comprehend in a short amount of time and so, often things are forgotten as we try to process everything",
                "More support and guidance on the project would be helpful, I felt unprepared to start the early stages.",
                "Material is very engaging but taught in a difficult way.",
                "Strengths:  covers good amount of material\r\nWeaknesses: Professor and slides presented the material in an unorganized fashion with too many specific examples.",
                "I respect Professor Zhong, and loved his enthusiasm about the course, but I don't think he was effective at explaining  material. I found his slides to be mostly disorganized, and his explanations of the slides to be not helpful during lecture. Any time I needed help with course material I went to friends or my TA, who I felt did a better job explaining it than he did. I think if I were to retake the course, I would have skipped most of the lectures to take notes on my own time, and used other sources to clarify any questions I had. \r\nAdditionally, I felt the homework in this course was extremely off topic from the material we were learning in class and actually made it harder to spend enough time understanding the material. The homework series helped me understand how to write a research proposal and gave me some knowledge on the disease I researched, but I have absolutely no desire to conduct research (and I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way) and the reason I'm taking this course is to get Pre-Med requirements out of the way. I suggest that the homework assignments be changed to reflect the content in lectures so that we can deepen our understanding on the content we get examined on.",
                "It was hard to understand Zhong's lecture sometimes on zoom and in person. Overall very passionate about what he teaches but sometimes lacks in depth detail.",
                "The cumulative course assignment (research proposal) was very well handled and engaging, I just wish the discussion section slides had been a little more coordinated or rehearsed with the TAs.",
                "Information overload. Would rather have the HWs focusing on course material like usual psets, and have the discussion sessions provide tutorials on writing research proposals.",
                "Add lecture recordings so that we can go back over the slides again with the professor connecting the dots to help clarify concepts.",
                "I think this course did a great job of including important and relevant material, however it could be improved by placing less emphasis on details of particular pathways or concepts and rather focus more on understanding bigger ideas.",
                "very interesting, too tricky test questions though, takes away from full understanding",
                "The lectures were not well organized and important information was often brushed past quickly during class. I dont know what I would have does without Professor Hartman teaching the whole class to us and making the information digestible. This is an intro course, so the professor should not expect the whole class to already be knowledgeable about certain topics.",
                "The lectures are done in the best way. Professor Zhong cares but is not the best person to teach and introductory biology course. The PSETS in the form of a proposal were annoying. I feel like PSETS reinforcing lecture material would be better. Also, the quizzes were very frantic.",
                "The psets could have better served the exams.",
                "I think the quizzes could sometimes be a bit not picky. I also think it would be helpful if we were given guiding questions for the papers before section so we could direct our reading.",
                "Too quick, needed more time in the semester for full understanding",
                "The topics covered were well-discussed, but quizzes could be stressful due to time pressure.",
                "The strength and weakness of this course was that the assessments were difficult which made you study more but it was for the better I guess?  The information was very very interesting regardless. Each topic is different from the last that if you didn't like the last topic there's still a possibility you like the others.",
                "One strength was that it covered a wide range of topic that gave a very good overview of developmental biology, and had sufficient detail to discuss the subtleties of development.\r\nOne weakness was that occasionally, the explanations were not as complete as one would like, leaving some students a bit confused as to how we reached a given step in the logic.",
                "This course and the rest of the bio sequence seems to go a bit too deep into the application of concepts without fully fleshing out the ideas needed to understand the course to its fullest. It is a very interesting course though!",
                "The course feels like a lot of unnecessary work. It felt like the grade was more based on following the course regulations rather than understanding of material",
                "Strengths: Amaleah Hartman! Prof. Hartman's Enrichment sections and office hours were enormously helpful in this course. She is endlessly patient and a gifted teacher.  Other strengths: the material of this course was so far the most interesting information presented of the intro bio sequence thus far. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture slides had too much information on them, were very dense. The homework research proposal felt like busy work much of the time.",
                "The class was really enjoyable and the lectures were very informative. Definitely felt like I learned a lot",
                "I couldnt understand the Professor and the sequence of what we learned was confusing",
                "The quizzes are really challenging but the professor explained all the concepts needed to understand whats going on.",
                "The quizzes were hard and I feel that there wasnt much time allotted for them.",
                "One thing that they could have improve on this course was to fix the timing a bit. The class ended at 12:55 and lots of people had classes on the other side of campus at 1 so people had to leave early and would miss the endings of the lectures.",
                "more practice questions to prepare for the quizzes and exam\r\ngreat influence on concepts instead of memorization",
                "Weaknesses: I think that this course was a little bit tough to ease into, mainly because a lot of terms were used without much explanation (similar to BIOL 102), but after a while, once you got the hang of it, it definitely improved. I also think the homework assignments, while interesting, weren't sufficient in improving our knowledge of the topics we were being tested on they seemed almost tangential. Finally, the quizzes are tough, but don't get discouraged by any of your grades on them!\r\nStrengths: I think Prof. Zhong is pretty funny and knowledgeable, and Prof. Hartman is simply the best. The lectures were always pretty engaging, and both profs did a great job of highlighting key ideas from each slide by noting them in boxes or in bold. I think enrichment is also a huge bonus to this course that many students should take advantage of!",

                "Of the four intro modules, 103 has been by far the worst in terms of both teaching quality and assessments. Although 102 was harder in terms of subject matter, it was far better taught/explained and thus more enjoyable. If you can at all avoid 103/place out of it, do so without hesitation. If not, good luck.",

Professor was impossible to follow and I had zero engagement with him. Professor Hartman is awesome and I highly recommend attending enrichment. Everything that I did learn in this course was because of her.",

The details of the lecture are so specific to particular ideas and you are expected to apply the unstated general concepts to other situations which makes the lectures and quizzes feel very disjointed.",

                "Now, I know the majority of you have to take this part of the biology sequence, and for that I am sorry. If you're just interested in bio and taking this for funsies, CHOOSE ANY OTHER BIO COURSE. Seriously, take actual biology courses (you only need to complete biol 101/102 for some of the MCDB biology courses) you want to instead of sitting through this. The professor is harder to follow than a dog in a field of squirrels. He doesn't follow a clear progression throughout the lecture, sometimes switching topics only to return to the original topic for the last 10 minutes of class. Professor Zhong claims to put \"important stuff\" in the red boxes on his slides. Well, no, he doesn't. He once put a citation in a red box, ignoring the term defined on the slide. This is a normal occurrence. Then, suddenly there were pink boxes. What are the pink boxes for? No idea, even after taking the final. You might learn a little from looking at the slides but the lecture is awful, honestly my worst at Yale. He will introduce a topic that is a very in-depth example of the material we're supposed to learn and yet won't go over the terms he's using or explain how they really apply to the example. Professor Zhong also frequently will ask questions to the 100 person lecture and when one poor brave soul begins to answer, he listens to the first 3 words out of their mouth and then starts talking over them. I never did figure out if any of my peers knew the answers to the questions. \r\nThere are no PSETs on the material. You work on a project over a gene and transcription factor, a topic that relates to 1/2 of a single lecture in this class. Therefore, there is no working on your understanding or getting feedback from homework. The homework is irrelevant to the material, meaning only through poor grades on quizzes do you learn, 2 weeks after the material was \"taught\" that you don't understand it. The quizzes are terrible. Never have I studied for a course and still managed to feel so unprepared for the quizzes in this class. True/false questions followed by a sentence explanation, usually as nitpicky as to have one word wrong causing students to sit in despair as they don't know the word-for-word definition of one of the terms Zhong never mentioned. The matching section of the final used a term I'm 85% sure never appeared on the slides, and if it did, it wasn't in a red OR pink box, and wasn't explained. All this to say that on top of a poor lecture, the quizzes are difficult and most people looked like they wanted to cry after the final. Poorly taught, a course of confusion, avoid at all costs.",
                "not if you don't have to take it, not very fun or engaging",
                "Yes - you likely need to take this for a major requirement. 102 was honestly very difficult for me, but know that it gets better! 103 is still definitely hard, but it is manageable and the material is actually accessible so if you put the effort in, you are much more likely to see results and learn the material (unlike 102, which could be hit-or-miss in that regard, though still interesting). The point is, if you're struggling in 102 and considering quitting STEM because of the sequence, don't. It gets better.",

You learn a broad range of themes in development through the lens of genetic and cellular biology, and it is satisfying to be able to read complex research focusing on these themes after taking the course. The research proposal assignments (which act as problem sets) require less heavy lifting than BIOL 102, but in-class quizzes are generally challenging and can be tricky to study for. Sometimes lectures could be hard to follow, with some important details being hard to identify, but I feel like I learned valuable information and thought this class was pretty rewarding.",

Everyone takes it because it's required or to fufill a distributional requirement, but to fill your science requirements there's a ton of more interesting classes that consume less of your time and energy. For the entire bio sequence, 103 included, it's frustrating that you can only do well if you take enrichment, which is an extra 75 minutes a week, because the professors are notoriously bad at explaining.",

It's super informative genetics-wise, and the information is interesting as well. I think Prof. Zhong can be a little fast and slow at the same time, but you get the hang of it pretty quickly. Please do yourself a favor and go to enrichment  you will regret not signing up for it.",
