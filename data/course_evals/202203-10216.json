Through this course, I've learned about what kinds of shows and writing I really enjoy and can see myself doing.  An important skill I have also gained that can be applied to any form of writing, not just for TV, is a way to break down a project and build it up from the broad and vague to a more specific and detailed final assignment.",

Its a very low workload, and the entire semesters feedback from the professor could probably fit on an 6x4 index card. \r\n\r\nProfessor Tracy does explain facets of the industry that may be informative if you dont know much about the TV landscape. Yet, his demeanor is typically icy and reserved, so as far as a creative writing class goes I dont feel he pushed us to find our voices. And I also dont feel like I came away with the ability to structure a pilot.",

                "Super knowledgeable professor with great insights on how to write well. Reading different pilots was very helpful, and we had a wide range of fun / engaging activities throughout the semester",
                "A big strength of this course was how the final project was built up over time. It never felt too stressful or overwhelming because we took the process slow and had time to sit with our ideas and flesh them out. I also feel like there was so much room to bring one's own voice and personal creative style to the assignments, which is always a great thing. The feedback I got was also amazing and it was very clear how to implement it to make my piece better and why that was. The only weakness I can point out is that when the assignments were due was a little unclear, especially because we ended up straying from the syllabus quite a bit. I would have loved if there were a more central place that we could view the assignments and readings for the semester that was actively updated to reflect changes to what we had to read and write.",
                "I really enjoyed building every class around a different TV pilot. There was a really good range fo styles and voices represented in the scripts we read for class. I do wish that we had focused on each element of tv writing  character development, scene writing, dialogue, etc.  in a little more detail."

As someone who would love to pursue TV writing in the future, this course made me feel so much more in tune with what's happening in the professional world. It is also really rewarding to leave the class with the beginning and framework of a big creative project already completed.",
                "It is probably worth taking if youre interested in television writing and have room in your schedule, but all together it feels like a pretty low-effort class, on both the professor and student side...",

                "Absolutely! This is an incredibly fun and engaging class that will make you a much better TV writer!",
