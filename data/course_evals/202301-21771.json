                "As a recently declared English major, I was honestly surprised by how much I truly enjoyed ENGL 126 -- as a foundational course, I thought it was a perfect balance of and introduction to close reading and rich class discussion. I think I became a better writer as my analysis improved throughout the semester due to Professor North's insightful feedback, and writing essays became easier and more enjoyable as time went on. I also think my skills as a reader improved, as my classmates and instructor were both great in this regard and always had such precise and interesting things to say about the poems we were reading. I really learned the importance of pointing out formal qualities and how to nod to specific words or features in the text to support my interpretations.",
                "You'll learn how to read poetry rigorously for content and style and discover hidden treasures in the language of each poet. You'll feel confident deciphering nuanced language, deriving meaning from it, and relating it to other poems or concepts from the course. In your essays, you'll take a deep dive into specific poems by sitting with them for a while to see what stands out then what you can uncover through rich analysis. This course is a wonderful exploration of poems, their creators, and their fascinating contexts.",
                "Close reading of poetry\/analysis skills, a greater knowledge of poets from 1800 onward (main ones we touched on were Wordsworth, Dylan Thomas, Dickinson, Audre Lorde, and Tracy K Smith), and greatly improved writing.",
                "Learned so much about proper close reading and even just appreciating a text more. I think I saw a lot of improvement in my writing, but also saw more clearly the places I can improve because Professor North offers us such detailed feedback.",
                "I learned in-depth poetic analysis skills that helped me enjoy the poetry we read while challenging myself with its technique.",
                "I learned how to approach the analysis of poetry and developed skills to write about poetry. Having very little previous experience studying poetry, I gained a lot of appreciation for the genre and even got to experiment with writing my own poem.",
                "I learned how to read and analyze poetry. I also learned how to articulate my thoughts in a round-table discussion and through writing.",
                "I was able to close read poetry much better after this course and really analyze specific formal features of poets and their works. I believe this seminar also made me a better writer.",
                "Close-reading poetry, deep analysis and comparison of different poetry time periods, and an overview of poets (mainly Wordsworth, Dickinson, Thomas, and Lorde).",
                "I learned how to analyze poetry very well and eloquently; essay writing skills improved.",
                "I learned how to do a deep analysis and close reading of poetry and articulate my thoughts through critical writing. I really enjoyed learning about the historical background to provide context for the poets and their work. I especially enjoyed the units on Emily Dickinson and Audre Lorde. I feel my writing improved in this course, specifically in how detailed and specific I am now able to make my theses."

            "comments": [
                "I really enjoyed this course! One thing I greatly appreciated was Professor North's no-technology policy -- especially in an English seminar, it's so great to be able to interact with the text in an authentic print form without people getting sucked into their laptops. I think this was a huge factor in how much I was able to put in and therefore get out of the course. Another strength was the discussion-based format of the class. I think this is one of the more effective seminars I've been in, as we were guided sufficiently by the instructor but also allowed to reach our own conclusions and come to them organically.",
                "Strengths: During each class meeting, we deeply explore a few poems from the previous night's homework for content and style. The poems themselves are curated based on writer and theme, and these intense explorations of topics and poets builds a fascination for the course. And Professor North creates a class community that is so tight-knit. At the beginning of each class, we share names and \"threshold thoughts\" so that we build friendships with our classmates so that we are more comfortable rigorously analyzing wonderful poems together. The essays facilitate student discovery through the encouragement to tour poetry for its rich meanings. Professor North also makes himself available for insightful office hours conversations to brainstorm and review essays and explore the course content more deeply. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The turnaround on essay feedback can be slow at times, but only because Professor North provides such articulate and thoughtful feedback that this, of course, takes time.",
                "strengths- I could go on and on. Really helpful and in depth feedback. Prof North is so engaging and the class discussions were humorous and insightful (and he has such a beautifully deep voice when reading the poetry aloud). He starts every class going around asking whats on everyones mind which brought us closer together as a class and focused everyone for the rest of class. I learned a lot and especially as a non-English major this course really made me love reading and writing about poetry. The only weakness is that the papers started so late since they were delayed so there was almost no work at the beginning of the semester but more toward the end. But I think overall it didnt interfere with my enjoyment of the course at all. I really liked that he gave us the option for the final paper to write and analyze our own poem based on the formal features of one of the poets we read in class.",
                "No weaknesses. This course was fantastic. Its incredibly engaging, the poems are great, Professor north is great, the environment of the classroom was greatI LOVED this class.",
                "I loved the way Professor North prioritized any and all thoughts about our poetry, as well as challenging us to go deeper and be specific about the observations we made. I felt that I could simultaneously learn from poetry and feel pushed by it while still immensely enjoying the work.",
                "strengths: the majority of the content we read really inspired us to think critically about issues relevant to our life; the method we used to study poetry was conducive to close reading across genres of writing; the class was entirely discussion based; we were encouraged to try to find answers within poetry but not shamed for having the wrong answer\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the first unit of rhyming couplets, while historically significant, felt a little superficial",
                "Strengths: Poetry was really high quality and diverse. Prof. North was fantastic at walking us through it and making us feel like we were smart enough to understand it if we thought hard enough. The course is really well-organized as well as understanding of everyones different skill sets. Honestly I dont think there were any weaknesses; this was an exemplary class.",
                "I dont believe there were many weaknesses. Maybe I wouldve liked to read more works, but I understand that that means we wouldnt be able to close read them as deeply, and Id rather do that.",
                "Strengths: amazing course, super interesting poets and poems, amazingly taught, extremely engaging, intellectually stimulating with a really manageable workload, tons of clear and specific feedback, great crash course on how to close-read and analyze poems in a deeper way than I ever had before, and a load of fun\r\nWeaknesses: I genuinely cannot think of any- there were poems and poets I liked less than others, but that's just personal preference.",
                "Strengths: interesting variety of poems, talking about our interpretations and analyses of the poetry in class was super engaging and interesting.",
                "Fantastic class atmosphere! Great icebreaker at the start of class and we all knew each other's names and felt comfortable sharing our opinions in class. This lead to great, detailed discussions and we all engaged with the material at a high level! Professor North's enthusiasm is contagious."

                "Yes! I loved the poetry we read, and even when I didn't love it, I had classmates who did (and Professor North's enthusiasm about certain poems was often infectious). I really learned to appreciate poetry across a variety of eras, and it was so wonderful to see how their themes and connections all intersected, even in such different time periods and from such different people. I also learned so many technical skills and gained a much greater formal understanding of poetry and how it works.",
                "YES! Professor North is one of Yale's best professors. He is so knowledgeable about poetry and creates a fun, engaging classroom environment. It's a joy to learn from him and he challenges each student to become more articulate and rigorous in their poetic thinking.",
                "Yes. Hands down. Take this course with Joe North, hes an amazing professor and the course is truly a joy. Even (especially) if youre not an English major, this course is a great way to get a writing credit and a wonderful experience.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Take this course with Professor North if you have the opportunity. He is such an amazing prof, and the way he facilitates the class is so rewarding and engaging for us. Best class Ive taken at Yale so far.",
                "Absolutely. It proved essential to improving my close reading skills, something I was unaware needed improvement until I took a course with Prof. North.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor North is amazing and I really think it provides a great understanding of a variety of poets and works for people with varying interests.",
                "I would recommend it, especially with Professor North. It was the perfect way to get introduced to poetry but I think would also be really fulfilling for students who have experience with poetry as well.",
                "Absolutely. This is perfect for both English majors and non-English majors. It is great for a writing credit if you want to learn literary criticism skills rather than creative writing skills, and Prof. North was very understanding of peoples different skill levels. For English majors, you will see a huge leap forward in your analytical skills. I was a much better essayist by the end of the course.",
                "Absolutely! It was extremely enjoyable and I loved the Professor.",
                "Absolutely, without a doubt. Super interesting course and not a ton of work, great for people who love poetry but also people who've never been into that. Really fun time overall.",
                "Absolutely! Its a super interesting and engaging way to learn about poetry and how to analyze and understand it. I highly recommend taking the class with Professor North  he was an amazing professor and his poetry selections were wonderful!",
                "Yes! 100% recommend. This course really makes you appreciate poetry at an even deeper level. Note that this course is analyzing poetry  not writing your own. Fantastic professor and you will get close with your classmates! Loved it so much."
