    "I learned how to reveal a conflict while still being kind, how to interview a subject expansively. I also learned technical nuances pertaining to audio and video quality which were quite helpful in post-production.",
    "I learned about all the different elements it takes to make a documentary. I also learned how much filmmakers can manipulate an audience",
    "The clsss gives you the opportunity to grow by making - the only real way to learn in film.",
    "I got more acquainted with working with Adobe Premiere and Final Cut. I also got good feedback on interviews and cuts of b-roll footage that helped me think about how I edit in the future.",
    "I developed my skills in filming techniques, documentary-style interviewing, lighting, film and sound editing, and analytical film critique."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths are in watching and discussing some great documentaries and getting to creat your own film. There isnt a lot of instruction on the technical side so it can be time consuming and difficult to make the films.",
    "Working on a single topic all semester is great, and allows for great depth of engagement. Really enjoyed the bank robbery editing assignment, to see how many different approaches there are to the same footage. Assignments came quickly enough that we were always working towards our final project, but with enough time to critique and improve and change direction if necessary.",
    "I really like having group discussions and critiques of each others work. I wish we had that more. I also wish the class had more hands on lab practice in class. I think screenings are super helpful and so are writing responses about then. I also think the book is helpful , but I dont think reading responses are because its not the type of material that reflection helps with. \r\n\r\nI like the focus on making! This is one of the few yale film classes whose emphasis is that. They should learn from this class to have more hands on learning classes",
    "I believe this course could be improved if a) we were required to select our topic earlier and b) if we could create a film with other classmates. I thought that simply creating a film by ourselves in the given timespan was unrealistic, and I think we all could have benefited from more required collaboration. Also, there should be a reserve of cameras available specifically for this class. It was incredibly difficult dealing with CCAM and Bass for equipment reservations, which felt like a somewhat unnecessary burden."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you want to learn how to follow through on a story from idea to final project, and you want to hold yourself to a high standard, then this class will teach you everything you need to know.",
    "Yes. It's wonderful to have the time and the support for making a project like this built into your schedule, and you can be assured that your work will be all the better for the instruction provided. If you want to make the most out of this course, you'll need to be proactive in finding your subject(s)\/times to meet\/location permissions. You'll also want to have a distinct idea of where you think the story is while being open to your idea changing over time. If you do these things, the rewards are immense.",
    "Yes, its an incredibly rewarding class if you put the time and effort in.",
    "Yes if you want to learn a lot about documentary filmmaking. Again I wish the class time itself was spent more on critiquing each others work and doing hands on workshops, but its a great space t really immerse yourself in filmmaking.",
    "I would recommend the class if you like recording and editing videos or want to get better at it.",
    "Yes, but with the fair warning that it is a lot of work."
