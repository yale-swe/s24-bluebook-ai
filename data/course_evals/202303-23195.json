                "For strengths, I enjoyed being challenged by the course content as this was a field that I was previously unfamiliar with. I genuinely enjoyed all the learning I did and think it will have useful applications in basically any STEM subject I delve in later on. For weaknesses, the course being labelled as an intro was misleading as majority of people had previous calculus knowledge which inflated the curves. The workload was so much that the subject became parasitizing. The problem sets were impossibly hard compared to what we were taught in class and basically impossible to complete without going to either office hours or tutor hours.",
                "I loved the ximeras as they are a brilliant way to supplement and re-enforce topics learnt in class especially when you dont understand them initially. I think the p-sets do get repetitive and can be draining sometimes",
                "The strengths of the course was the Ximera, which presented lecture material in a digestible way. The weakness of the course was the difficulty of exams and problem sets, which oftentimes did not reflect course material adequately."

                "I believe if you wanna go further in math or you have to take a QR its definitely a neccessity.",
