                "Strengths: Very interesting texts, from literal texts to videos and movies. Also, really good at getting you to a conversational/understanding level of Portuguese and keeping the class engaging. Also, very chill meaning that the class is not a source of stress or likely to cause you major problems as you take it. Weaknesses: At times very unstructured and hard to take seriously. Also, very little feedback and general guidance throughout. We really didn't have any tests or prompt feedback to see how good our writing was, and while that was often relieving it also made it hard to learn. Finally, at this time the class was really small and that made it very hard to learn. We had a limited number of conversation partners, and as the semester wore on less people came to class and it was even harder to enjoy class.",

                "It depends. You are probably looking at this course as your last required language class, in which case it is a great one to take and get it out of the way. If you placed into L3 or are looking at Portuguese ratings, I would think if there is another language you would be interested in, and how much you want to learn a language. There are few languages as enjoyable at Yale, but there are definitely languages where you learn more and become more confident in the language quicker. Especially if you enjoy/prefer the repetition-based side of learning a language, with flashcards and worksheets, Portuguese is not for you. If you do take 130, I would also definitely recommend the 10:30 or 11:15 section, 9:25 is brutal!",
                "Yes I would! Learning Portuguese, especially with Giseli, is a very fun experience."
