    "Exactly what the course title says. Math 110 is the bridge between high school and college level mathematics. A solid way to review functions while being effectively introduced to concepts of calculus at the same time.",
    "This course taught me a lot about derivatives and functions and how to apply that information.",

   "comments": [
    "Good practice problems and general notes in the textbook. Class notes could have been better rather than just random examples at times.",
    "I felt that it was difficult to understanding things in class the way the professor explained it. I also felt like we didnt review specific material that we would be doing as much either.",
    "Strengths: Course provided students with the tools and resources to fully understand the material, (textbook, ULA office hours, workshops)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of clarity on how to answer test questions. Answers seemed to be very specific in wording and this skill was rarely taught for questions.",
    "I had a lot of strengths in the course however my top weakness was definitely the optimization word problems",
    "Strength: Great teachers and awesome ULAs, office hours, ULA hours\r\nWeaknesses: Some discrepancy between sections",
    "This is a tough course for a first year student and I believe that nati wasnt able to educate us the information in a great way.",
    "I think the strength was definitely in the resources provided. I attended office hours every week and they helped me greatly. The weakness was in the teaching. I felt as though the professors and their teaching was very confusing.",
    "I would like to be able to work on the problems in the book in order to prepare for the tests, i.e., for example, get an answer sheet for all even numbers of problems in the book and then have the problem sets on all the odd numbers or vice versa."

   "comments": [
    "yes if you need review on calc and pre-calc or if your calculus skills are not great.",
    "I would only recommend it if you need the class for a major. Not fun at all and instructors are less than adequate if you don't get John Hall",
    "Yes I would because I feel like it challenges you to think in different ways and will be very useful in the future.",
    "It's more of a prerequisite type of course.",
    "yes, it is a good course to take to learn calculus at a slower pace",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this course to other students who want to learn calculus, and those who feel like they need a more indepth introduction to these concepts.",
    "Yes I would reccomend the course to another student because I liked taking it and I also thought that the resources are very helpful.",
    "yes, if you are interested in math and need to update your math skills this course is a great starting point."
