Learning how to talk about these things in Chinese was very useful and helped me begin to learn how to speak precisely in another language, which is necessary when talking about controversial issues that some people might be offended by.",

They weren't necessarily excessively difficult, but it felt like we weren't really prepared in class for the jump in difficulty.",

If it is not very important to you/your major, then it may be difficult to stay motivated with the almost nightly workload and constant intellectual challenge. It is definitely not a light fifth class even though it is no longer 1.5 credits/everyday like L3-4. However, the professors are very knowledgeable and care about their student's success. It is one of the best and most organized language departments at Yale.",
