    "1.  strong focus on typography. \r\n2. fundamental design thinking approach. \r\n3. Ability to use limited tools to create a design in various mediums.",
    "From the course I picked up some skills on graphic design including animations and timeline creation.",
    "I learned about the fundamentals of graphic design, and a deep evaluation into typographic methods and how to utilize them.",
    "I developed a reasonably good sense of the basics of graphic design and typesetting.  It focused much more on abstracts involving design rather than specific techniques.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of design and what, historically, makes a design functional.",
    "You will gain not only an understanding of basic design principles and concepts, but you will also gain experience working in the Adobe Creative Cloud. The course provided some tutorials for Photoshop, Illustrator, and inDesign."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\nI enjoyed the arrangement of the assignment, but I wished more technical details can be introduced with book design. \r\nThe typography aspect of this course is strong, and is accessible to anyone from any background. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI wish the course could be more balanced with fewer word exercises but emphasizes the production of final projects, I also hope there could be more aspects of writing designer statements rather than writing reading responses. \r\nWeekly critique can be more compacted. \r\nI wish we can recieve  writing response comments for our individual writing assigment.",
    "The strengths are the engagement with students and critiques that really improve progression in the class. A weakness was that it was much more engaging in the latter half that the first.",
    "I wish this course spent more time learning about the illustration aspects of graphic design (building interesting and engaging visuals).  While I enjoyed the animation portion of the course, I felt it didnt mesh well with the rest, and we would have been better off focusing our efforts on a different static project.",
    "I believe the number of assignments for this course was just right, any more and the workload would have been unmanagable. I also believe more time could have been spent on design techniques that were different from the standard typesetting (but I know that typesetting was the focus of this class).",
    "The class should be call Intro to Typography because it was very typography based and didn't align with the expectations established by the syllabus posted on Summer Session.",
    "The largest strength was that the course was fairly independent. You were free to experiment and explore on your own while also receiving constructive feedback during critiques. This layout offers a lot of freedom to express your individuality in your designs while also learning about the principles. The only weakness was that the zoom meetings felt a little disorganized (but I feel like this is to be expected for an online class during this time)."

   "comments": [
    "Yes if the student is interest in graphic design and would like to improve their skills then this class is a must. It can be a bit boring at times if you are not one interested in typography, but you take away a lot from the class that will help with any form of graphic design.",
    "Yes! Jessica was a great and well informed teacher who helped myself and other students navigate the complex world of design for the first time.",
    "No, not unless they are very interested in typogrpahy. Definitely not if they have a broad interest in graphic design.",
    "Yes! Graphic Design during the academic year is really difficult to get into nowadays, so I think taking this course during the summer is a really good way to enter the sequence. Even if you do not pursue the sequence, I have already applied the skills I learned to my summer internship."
