The variety of grammatical structures we have learned up until now has been the most rewarding aspect because I feel that it allows me to develop more fluency with sentences that portray complex ideas."

                "Strengths: I definitely learned the material well, and I enjoyed going to class because I knew it would be worthwhile. Chan laoshi definitely cares about teaching Chinese and it makes me more encouraged and enthusiastic to do well. Weaknesses: it was hard to practice speaking since most of the class is just listening to instruction and grammar points, so i wish there was more interaction",
                "There are not any weaknesses in this classes. The professor is very caring about her students and their engagement and learning in the class.",
                "The biggest strength was absolutely the instructor. Prof Chan managed to keep me engaged for every class, despite doing 4 classes a week remotely with very little motivation for other classes. She was very caring and was understanding when students needed extensions. The lectures were always interactive and gave us many opportunities to engage with classmates in order to practice more natural conversations. The variety of projects throughout the semester (pair dialogue, PSA, ...) also gave many opportunities to thoughtfully integrate all the new things I learned. A weakness would be the courseload, or lackthereof. We always had assignments due, but the quantity of assignments due throughout the week was much lower than chns 112, leading me to practice writing hanzi less. Overall it was more difficult to keep up with learning characters because my self-discipline was a bit lacking this semester. Your mileage may vary!"
