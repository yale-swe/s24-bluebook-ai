                "I have learned Gandhi and his endeavors in depth as well as how he has impacted other movements. I think one of the biggest take aways from this class was how we have questioned the things we take as given when thinking of social change.",
                "This course made me question my pre-existing beliefs and biases by making room for critical thought and balanced arguments.",
                "The Global Gandhi seminar is discussion intensive and posters at the theme of whether or not non-violent resistance is an effective means for change, the leaders that have influenced it, and how contemporary movements adopt aspects of it to advocate for their cause. The beginning of the course introduced Gandhi, his upbringing, and his work in India. We then learned about other decolonization movements and watched the film, The Battle of Algiers. We then connected this to the environmental movement, civil rights, and a contemporary movement of our choice. I learned a lot from Professor Amrith's immense knowledge. His presence in our discussions made an immense difference in terms of historical context but also in getting us to ask the right questions. Amrith never told us what to think, but helped us figure out how we should be thinking. At the end of the course, we share our takeaways and many of us are inspired through a multitude of directions.",
                "I learnt to contextualise the nuances behind violent resistance and its place in the decolonization context.",
                "Excellent course where I learned more about nonviolence revolutions and Gandhi.",
                "I developed critical skills in historical interpretation and philosophical modes of thought. Through this course, Professor Amrith guided me in becoming a better historian and made me more in touch with historical and current events around the world. I particularly found our discussions of movements and their ethicalities to be philosophically engaging and our discussions of modes of historical documentation and interpretation to be fruitful for me as a learner.",
                "I developed a much stronger sense for the often contradictory nature of history and was exposed to many strategies of historical inquiry and criticism. With regard to specific content, I greatly expanded my view of Gandhi as a person and of many resistance movements around the world that were connected to his legacy, as well as many connections between those times and social justice movements of the modern day, where I think the course's insights were some of the most valuable and applicable to how we move through the world today.",
                "Analyzing readings and generating my own ideas based on information I've read.",
                "I learned more about Gandhi's life, ideology, and the ways he impacted later movements. Additionally I learned the importance of critically engaging with historical texts and narratives.",
                "Principally, I gained better appreciations of how different types of oppression modify the resistance to it, different idealogical views on what non-violent resistance means, how circumstances affect the ways nations respond to resistance, how movements may react to success or failure in their resistance, and what analogies to non-violence exist on the international stage.  We covered all this through a balanced set of explorations of historical movements and more philosophical discussions.",
                "I learned a lot about Gandhi and other leaders of social movements, the morality behind nonviolence and violence, and a significant amount of postcolonial history (India, South Africa, and Algeria)."

                "Strengths: professor eager to hear students views; wide range of texts; interesting philosophical question about the merits of violent resistance; light reading and workload\r\nWeaknesses: felt like it dragged on at times; wished we could move faster",
                "The seminar format is a strength, as the class is heavily discussion-oriented, which makes the class far more fruitful as a variety of perspectives are discussed. The class also extrapolates historical learnings to contemporary issues, which made the course material easier to engage with. Something that could be improved is the balance between learning and discussion - I would have liked to have more knowledge before delving into discussion.",
                "The course was taught very well as a first-year seminar, especially as one who knew little specifics about Gandhi prior to the course. It was intensely discussion driven in the form of a whole group discussion and involved discussing large concepts such as change and how it plays into our own lives, along with the readings that we do in class to prepare. The course integrated film and media into the classes very well. I think using small group discussion more would also be an effective way to promote thinking. Overall, I really enjoyed the course and the diversity present among the students to bring unique perspectives to each discussion.",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor who taught the material in an engaging way. No real weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: built historical perspective and interpretation skills, engaged moral philosophical thinking, discussions were interesting and had important substance\r\nWeaknesses: at times, it felt that some of my classmates were disengaged",
                "Overall this was a great course, with fairly short but topical readings and interesting class discussions; but I feel like at times we had a bit too little to discuss in class and maybe could have done with a bit more material (either on reading or as primary source material in class).",
                "Really insightful class discussions, assignments helped me extend what I learned in class and feedback was helpful. No significant weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Professor Amrith is amazing at leading seminar discussions and is passionate about the topic at hand. Very kind and thoughtful individual.Everything covered in class was extremely interesting and never felt irrelevant. Assignments were not to difficult and we were given flexibility on what we wanted to to write about. Weaknesses: none.",
                "Strengths: Professor Amrith is super supportive and has an obvious passion for history. He was really good at guiding our class conversations and introducing us to new ideas. He also valued students' ideas and perspectives. The readings were fascinating and ranged from analysis of social movements to political philosophy. The discussions were always lively and inclusive and introduced a range of different viewpoints. Weaknesses: None"

                "Yes! I loved this course and had a great time in the discussions. The professor is amazing and the assignments and readings were completely manageable. I think it is a great way to start your way in the humanities.",
                "Yes, I definitely would! It ventures into important ethical dilemmas that can be applied to other classes as well. The assignments are also really fun.",
                "The Global Gandhi seminar is highly recommended to first-years as a survey of nonviolent resistance and the humanities at Yale. The class teaches you to become better at thinking about concepts from a historical and contemporary context, often bridging it with your own lived experiences. The writing in the class is not intensive and the reading is light. Professor Amrith is an amazing historian and knowledgable instructor who promotes discussion, asking questions, and encourages students to draw creative conclusions. Feedback is given regularly on written assignments and verbal feedback is given through class discussion; as far as assessment and grading, no formal grades are given on works submitted, ultimately, the grade received at the end of the term is the instructor's holistic evaluation of progress which should not be of concern to most students who make an honest and diligent effort to participate.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, definately.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great course for introduction to the histories and implications of nonviolent and violent movements around the world, and discussing their ethicalities accordingly.",
                "Definitely  it's not too heavy on the reading while still allowing you to get a fairly deep exposure to the subject and its connections across geographical and temporal boundaries. That being said, it does lean towards being a philosophy course over a history course at times as it delves into somewhat abstract discussions on violence and nonviolence, so keep this in mind (though for me this was very much a positive).",
                "Yes, the workload for this course seems to be lower than other courses which served as a nice introduction to the humanities/history. Excellent instructor.",
                "Yes most definitely. The professor, topic, and workload make this course an excellent introduction to the history department at Yale while also being able to engage with other first years on such a pertinent topic in the 21st Century.",
                "Absolutely! I really struggle to imagine a question more pertinent to the modern day than how to effect change through resistance, and I really cannot imagine a better course to examine that question.",
                "Absolutely. I looked forward to every class. The material was really interesting and Professor Amrith is amazing. This course completely shifted how I see social movements and leaders fighting for social change. It's a good introduction to the history of nonviolent resistance and the moral arguments behind it. The content is pretty wide-ranging and Professor Amrith gives a lot of flexibility in what you can write about in your assignments, allowing you to explore whatever areas interest you. The class is very engaging and the discussions were good at challenging your thinking.",
