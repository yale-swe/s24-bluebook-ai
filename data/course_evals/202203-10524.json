We learned how to identify and name the chords within the context of a chord progression in a song, and in particular when these chords were the standard triads in a major or minor scale. We practiced the movable-do solfege system and the ability to translate to and from this system quickly.",

The chordal progressions and basic structures of melodies such as the 1-1-2 figures were really integrated into my mind and my approach to both music outside of this class and music that the class analyzes has improved and deepened. I think my singing skills and harmonization has also improved."

                "Overall, this course was excellent. The main difficulty for me was the two-part rhythm sight-reading that we often did during classes. I felt as though there was a significant jump in difficulty from the (relatively easy) single-part rhythms we covered earlier, to the two-part rhythms. However, this could also be a reflection of my need to go home and practice more of these rhythms, so it's perhaps not an issue with the course.",
                "The course covers a lot of material and the material can be quite difficult, depending on your musical background. It might be a good idea to offer an intermediary course that covers the content a bit slower for less advanced musicians.",
                "Very chill. Not sure how much I learned apart from the knowledge I came in with though. This is a class half filled with YSO and Yale Glee Club people (aka half the class have perfect pitch). But the instructor understands that everyone come in with different musical backgrounds.",
                "It's hard to know how well one is doing in the course because of lack of feedback. Also, because my brain never truly adjusted from scale degrees to solfege I don't feel like my sight reading improved much.",
                "More office hours would be helpful",
                "Strengths were how the course was structured, including both its flexibility and repetition when it comes to difficult practice listening sets.",
                "I enjoyed the laid-back structure of this course because it allowed me to learn at my own pace.",
                "In the beginning of the course this course felt fitting for someone with rudimentary skills in music as the concepts were explained thoroughly but as the semester progressed I felt that",
                "The lecture style and intimate setting made this course a lot of fun to look forward to, and the discussion sections integrated the material learned in my head much better. I think that really writing down our dictations were a major plus, but I think that the course could enforce the solfegge syllables much more as I was looking forward to getting my solfegge up to a high point."

It is definitely a little challenging, but doesnt feel completely over your head. I came out of this course a much better musician and improved music listener.",
                "Yes, it teaches important skills for instrumental and all other types of music.",
                "It depends, there is way more music theory knowledge needed to do well in the class than the prereqs/syllabus suggest. Also, there wasn't much exploration into the \"vocal improvisation\" aspect of the course, which was surprising as I thought that was one of the main points in the class; it was mostly just an advanced ear training, sight-reading, and music theory class.",
                "Yes, but make sure that you meet the prerequisites and some or you may find yourself having a higher workload than expected. The professor and teaching assistant are able to help with clarifying difficult concepts or how to practice them.",
