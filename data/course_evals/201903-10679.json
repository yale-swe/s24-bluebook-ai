    "This course may help you become a more concise writer if you have very little writing background. If you have a strong writing background, you will learn nothing new here. The topics discussed are interested been seem dragged out. Independent reading on these topics could be just as interesting.",
    "I greatly improved my writing skills",
    "I learned to analyze philosophical and scientific readings. I also learned to write short responses full of content.",
    "We discussed some interesting topics throughout the semester including but not limited to the definition of consciousness, whether machines are capable of thinking and feeling, the Turing test, whether physical reality or consciousness is more fundamental, etc. We also gained experience with writing short passages and picking the most appropriate words to answer writing prompts.",
    "This course is structured like a seminar to facilitate discussion about the central topic: \" can a computer be conscious \"\r\nwould recommend to someone who is looking to knock writing requirement out of the way ( this class is no work ) and is fine with a grade that is randomly determined.",
    "Writing concisely",
    "This class has drastically improved my writing ability, especially when it comes to cutting down unnecessary words and making my arguments clear and to the point",
    "I developed the ability to think about controversial topics in a manner based on my own deductions instead of what I hear from others."

   "comments": [
    "Grading seemed random. The professor has a very specific style that was not be entirely clear until the third paper. If your writing does not match his style, you will not get a good grade. When the writing does match his style, the grades still seem random.",
    "Strengths: deep discussion of the readings.",
    "I think this course gives students the opportunity to be highly involved in class discussions if they choose to and to share their opinions throughout their writing assignments. This course is weak in that students are not challenged to think about class topics until it is time to write their writing assignments. Also some lectures felt off topic from the main points of the course and unrelated to some of our reading assignments. It made it difficult to be involved in the class for those days. It was also unclear how grades would be distributed in this class other than mentioning that improvement would be observed throughout the semester. It made it difficult to approximate how well one was doing in the course.",
    "Strengths -- interesting material, good readings, loved prof\r\nweaknesses -- no syllabus, unclear grading",
    "Its a great class. Maybe more class participation",
    "It could have been scheduled better so we could complete the full class on time",
    "It could be improved is there was a set guideline for how to write papers."

    "Only take this class if you are looking for a writing credit with very little work and are willing to get a bad grade.",
    "Yes, it is a good writing requirement for STEM students and you learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is mildly interested in the topics of consciousness and whether this quality can be created within a machine as well. Also for a student who is looking for a writing credit with a very light writing load. There's about only 3 or 4 reading assignments throughout the semester which help one follow along in class discussions. The writing assignments are very short, only extending about a paragraph or two, except for the thousand-word final paper. This course can be more engaging with however much effort you put into it. Otherwise the course can be a simple way for non-writing majors\/CS majors to get a writing credit.",
    "would recommend to someone who is looking to knock writing requirement out of the way ( this class is no work ) and is fine with a grade that is randomly determined.",
    "Yes, because it teaches you to write concisely",
    "Yes! Great Professor that cares a lot. Interesting material",
    "Sure",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student since it felt like the feedback that I got on my papers did not help with future papers.",
    "No do not take this class if you care about your grades. The grading is so arbitrary he makes corrections on his own corrections and the class is so stressful. The most stressful 200 word assignment that I have ever written."
