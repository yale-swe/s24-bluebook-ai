I learned a lot more about the social history of the Civil War. Like we all know the basics of the Civil War, but this class was super interesting because of Blight's extensive knowledge of stories from individual soldiers, citizens, and leaders from the time period. I initially found his willingness to go on tangents frustrating, but I came to realize that that was, in fact, what the class was all about.",

                "I learned not only about the Civil War and Reconstruction Era, but also how to critically think about history and how it is presented to us. Blight did an amazing job about making sure that the students were able to comprehend the material and also to make sure that we could interpret it.",

I learned a comprehensive history of the conflicts that led up to the Civil War, the war itself, and the Reconstruction period that followed. Normally, history is just a ton of stuff to memorize, but I feel like this class was so much than that.",

                "This course granted me really valuable knowledge of American history and politics during the Civil War era, and also insight into how this period has been viewed and understood in the memory of the nation throughout history. I especially appreciated what I learned about military history, which is something I really would not have expected to be interested in but found really valuable to learn about and super engaging. I got a great sense of how to read primary sources from this class as well, since it relies heavily on those. I learned a lot about understandings of race and why white supremacy was so powerful in the South in this era; I think the most interesting thing I learned about were the two ideologies that shaped both the North and the South and informed each region's embrace or rejection of slavery.",
                "Throughout this course I learned about the causes and course of the Civil War, as well as the rise and fall of southern Reconstruction.

                "While I have studied the Civil War before, this course was much more in depth. It felt like what I always imagined a \"classic Yale history course\" to be. I learned how to dive deeply into a topic and also approach history from lots of different angles and source types. We worked extensively with interesting primary sources as well. This was my favorite course I took this semester!",

                "I learned a lot about the social, political and military history of the Civil War and Reconstruction. We also discussed how memory and causation affect our understandings of history, which was really interesting and helped strengthen my ability to think critically about history.",
                "I learned all about the civil war, in addition to the years leading to it and the years directly following. Lots of interesting frameworks for how to think about the war from a historiographic perspective, and how it relates to the modern day.",
                "Ability to think critically about our current social/political/economic/legal climate and find a thread between now and the Civil War; to understand events like the Civil War and its reconstruction period as so much more than just a military battle but a social/political/economic revolution",
                "I learned a lot about the fundamental differences between the North and the South in the Antebellum Era and how those problems (and other factors) eventually led to the Civil War. Further, I learned about key battles, strategies, and people during the Civil War and how it became the war that freed the slaves. I also learned about Reconstruction in a new, thorough way. My TF also gave wonderful feedback on essays, so I feel like my historical writing has improved!",

                "I came into this course already having a solid overview of this time period, but I learned many things beyond the basic sequence of events. I gained a deeper insight into the political motivations and forces at play in the lead-up to the war, the process of emancipation during the war itself, and how Reconstruction attempted to define the meaning of the war by giving equal rights to Black Americans but was ultimately largely unsuccessful. I also found Professor Blight's forays into historiography and how it relates to the Civil War in American memory fascinating: the Lost Cause movement, the Beardian school, etc.",

                "Strengths: super interesting lectures. super interesting readings. well-run discussion sections. fair writing prompts and grading.\r\nWeaknesses: 500+ pages of reading/week is absurd, so you can't do it all. lecture ran minimum 5 minutes long, usually closer to 10.",
                "blight is a gem of yale, would take anything with him. thought essay qs too broad.",
                "This course is never boring and extremely engaging. I looked forward to going to lecture.",
                "Loved! Professor Blight is amazing and my TA was great.",
                "Professor Blight is exceptional and you leave the course wishing you could have had another semester to explore the war more in-depth. If anything the lack of time is the greatest weakness.",
                "I wish Professor Blights lectures better corresponded to our readers. While he is a phenomenal and charismatic lecturer, I found his lectures disorganized. The strengths relate to the readings and level of expertise in the teaching staff.",
                "I honestly really like the way this class was formatted. I think the two essays throughout the semester were really interesting prompts. I do think the final was a bit excessive - it was way too long and too much to write. In another world, I would have rather had a shorter final and added a third essay to do at home. The strength of the course is definitely David Blight. He is obviously super passionate about what he teaches and it shows.",
                "I think Professor Blight is an amazing lecturer and I loved hearing him speak. I don't think anyone would be opposed to a longer course time, which is definitely what this course needs. It consistently ran over time and felt rushed and stressful.",
                "The lecturer went over the time limit every day, which wasn't great for those of us who had class right after and did not want to be disrespectful and leave while he was still talking. The discussion sections were a really helpful part of the experience.",
                "Strengths: excellent lectures, great TFs, interesting essay prompts\r\nWeaknesses: occasionally a bit stressful how much weight each assignment held (exam was worth 40% of grade, 2 papers at 25% each, and 10% for teaching). That said, I felt that grading and assessment was fair and the feedback I received was clear.",
                "Great organization and communication",
                "Course was well organized, lots of interesting information that is presented in amazing lectures from Prof. Blight. Sometimes I wish there was maybe a little bit more structure to the lectures so that we stay on track and end lectures on time, covering at least most of what the syllabus mentions for that course.",
                "Prof Blight is an amazing lecturer!",
                "Strengths - so interesting, readings really good, lectures amazing. \r\nWeaknesses - I wish the reading could have been assigned in a more reasonable manner (I obviously cannot read 1.5 books in 2 days). I wish there could have been more clear connection and correlation between the reading and the lecture. \r\nBut seriously, this is just nitpicking, this course is PHENOMENAL.",
                "This course is well beyond a basic survey of the Civil War. I would argue that it is essential for anyone studying a topic related to the United States. The lectures were captivating, the assignments useful, and the structure well laid out to provide as much information as possible without overpowering key trends. I have no suggestions.",
                "Strengths: amazing instructor in Professor Blight-- knows so much about the topic, and you are so lucky to be able to learn from him. The lectures are fascinating, with anecdotes/stories weaved in throughout to keep them entertaining. The questions he probes at are really rewarding and challenging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could use a bit more structure to ensure getting to all the material, and I honestly think there is too much reading-- you rarely get to discuss all of it in section so I think cutting it down to let students prioritize the reading that we will ultimately discuss the most.",
                "One of the strengths of this course was Blight's engaging lectures. He was very helpful and I gained a lot of insight from him. Yet he always ran overtime and never finished his lecture outlines, so the class may be improved by being structured in a two 75 minute lecture format instead of 50 minutes. This would help him finish the lecture notes and not go overtime as much.",
                "prof blight is great! good content. weakness is its a bit disorganzied",

                "Best course Ive ever taken",
                "Professor Blight was definitely a strength of the course - a great lecturer who kept his students engaged through thrilling stories and personal anecdotes. I also loved his outlines for notes, it really kept us focused on the end goal. One weakness is that sometimes the reading piled up on certain weeks, so I had to pick and choose what to read, although it all seemed very fascinating.",
                "Great depth into the subject matter- excellent course no complaints.",
                "Strengths: Pre-Civil War and Reconstruction. Weakness: the war itself. I'm not really interested by the battles, but some of the lectures (Civil War in an international context and the meaning of emancipation) were still very engaging. Blight is great.",
                "The course topic is fascinating, and the documents naturally led themselves to great discussions. In the future, the Canvas page could be better organized, and lecture outlines could include more specific details. However, all lectured materials seem easy to understand.",
                "The biggest strength is that the lectures in this course are incredible. Professor Blight is very skilled/an expert in the subject and the assigned material is fantastic. Sections were also highly engaging (my TA was great). This was a nuanced and thoughtful approach to the Civil War/Reconstruction that has reshaped and deepened my understanding of American history. The biggest weakness was that there was so much reading, it was very difficult to complete it all each week. I wish I had been able to get through all the reading because it was so interesting but since it was easy to float through the course without completing it/there was so much I was unable to do so. I would also note the course consistently ran 10 minutes late - which is important to keep in mind if you have class directly afterwards.",
                "strengths: good lectures\r\n\r\nweaknesses: a lot of reading",
                "This course is incredible!!! I looked forward to every single lecture and have never been so genuinely interested in a course before",
                "The only weakness is that 500 pages of reading a week is never ever going to happen. Maybe 150 but not any more than thay",
                "Strengths: Professor Blight is amazing, he makes the class so engaging and makes me look forward to class every week. Also my TA and section for this class was more interesting and inclusive than most other history sections I have had.",
                "The lectures were all over the place sometimes. Staying on topic could be helpful. A strength of this course was how excited and passionate Professor Blight is about the subjects, it helps the history come alive",
                "The course is a really nice survey of the civil war era. I think it could be improved if it allowed us to think about comparisons between the war era and today more specifically",
                "Strengths: BLIGHT! TAs! Assigned Readings!",
                "Strength: PROFESSOR BLIGHT. He is an amazing lecturer and so passionate about this era and the people within it, which is so important! The assignments were also really good because you had to think broadly but also deeply. The readings were also really enjoyable, although they could be tough to read at times because of racism and racial and sexual violence, but you cannot study this period without being exposed to that. \r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "The lectures were excellent but sometimes they seemed to lack some structuresthe professor didn't always seem to have time to follow through completely with the intended outline.",
                "Strengths - Professor Blight is a subject matter expert and very passionate about what he does, the Civil War is a very interesting topic that everyone should understand, an easy history class for those looking for a gut\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - very poorly organized structure wise and lecture wise (he goes over by five minutes, minimum). For lecture, it sometimes feels like it is going off topic or he is rambling about something that's not very relevant (you don't need to quote Whitman every class to prove how terrible war is), readings are not always clear since it's not always page numbers it's usually \"start reading xxxx book\" or \"finish reading xxxx book\" \r\n\r\nImprovements - more focused and organized lectures, more specific readings",
                "Professor Blight is definitely a strength of the class as he knows so much about the subject that he sometimes gets distracted by all the intricacies. Some of the readings are really long and don't exactly add much to the lectures.",
                "Excellent class with spectacular lectures and interesting readings. The assigned reading load should be reduced in paper weeks. Lecture tangents on contemporary politics often caused the class to finish late.",
                "A little bit more organization during the lectures",
                "Strengths:professor Blight is the man! Lectures were the most engaging and interesting ones Ive heard at Yale.",
                "There's a lot of reading... very hard to finish it in the time assigned (often a book and other readings per week). However, it's all very interesting and useful information, I learned a lot!",
                "Lectures are incredible. Sections worked well.",
                "Strengths are the story based style that Professor Blight presents each topic with. The events that we reviewed in class fluidly transitioned between one another in order.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are that other than the readings and in discussion section I think I may have wanted more practice in the writing assignments or more writings in general.",
                "Lectures are entertaining but often stray from their stated structure substantially.",
                "There are no weaknesses; lecture was well organized and section was well structured to go over course material.",
                "This is a great course, but there are a couple of things I would change. One, Professor Blights assigns too much reading some weeks. Even as a student who took DS and is willing to read up to several hundred pages a week, there were times when I literally didn't have the time to complete all of the reading. The quality of section discussions also decreases when not everyone has done the reading. Two, I think this course gives Reconstruction a little bit of short shrift. Three weeks simply isn't enough time to cover everything in sufficient detail, and I think leaving important material for reading week (and the day after Spring Fling at that) is unfair to students. I would have liked to see less time given to the War (even though I adore military history) and more given to Reconstruction given that it's more directly relevant to today's politics.",
                "The classes could have been recorded to allow more flexibility for students with time constraints.",
                "The readings are absurdly long that students could not finish them. Adjusting the readings so that students can reasonably finish them would be a great improvement.",
                "Professor Blight is an INCREDIBLE lecturer -- more like an orator honestly. So engaging and full of stories from his decades of research. Also really great in office hours! Lot of reading, but super interesting and a variety of types of sources so there's something for everyone. Be sure to factor into your schedule that the class WILL run 10 minutes late pretty much every day.",
                "provide engaging stories and historical accounts of the civil war from primary sources.\r\n\r\nthe majority of people take this course as a gut, ie: an easy class to fulfill academic requirements etc. as a result, the majority of students do not buy the texts or read them. thus, rather than centering class discussion around long books that students will not read, i would highly recommend requiring only a couple texts (for this class I would recommend making the Gineapp and the Lincoln documents book required) and then uploading PDFs of relevant chapters from other texts onto the Canvas site. this would make the material more accessible and thus class discussions would be more lively. digitally uploading chapter would also relieve the large financial burden placed on students."

                "Couldn't recommend highly enough. One of my favorite classes at Yale. Blight is an amazing lecturer, obviously knows his stuff, and has a well-prepared class. Loved it. Super interesting content presented in an engaging way.",
                "yes, classic, great history lecture",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. This course provides very engaging insights into the Civil War and Reconstruction era.",
                "Yes! I think that this course is amazing and very engaging. I am not a history major, but yet I still took this class and enjoyed it thoroughly.",
                "YES! One of the best history classes I have taken here. Wonderful.",
                "100%. Every student, regardless of major, should take a history class with Professor Blight. This class is taught in a super accessible manner as well.",
                "I wouldnt recommend this course to another student. It was boring and not well organized. I dont feel like I actually learned anything; it was more of a fun story hour with David Blight. That being said, hes a great lecturer but the course was poorly facilitated.",
                "Definitely! Even for someone like me who is a STEM major and is out of touch with history classes, this was super interesting and engaging. The workload is also very manageable.",
                "I would! Professor Blight is a great professor.",
                "Yes, Prof Blight is amazing and the readings are all very insightful.",
                "Yes, but I would let them know that the reading load is substantial.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I decided to take this course just for fun and am so so glad I ended up enrolling in this one. I really enjoyed the lectures, had a great TF, learned a lot about the field of history, and developed a much more nuanced understanding of the American Civil War.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, definitely. Highly recommend that everyone take this course, especially those interested in American history.",
                "Yes for anyone interested in the topic",
                "Absolutely. Blight is incredible and if you take the essays seriously, you will learn how to construct a strong historical argument. Studying for the exam was one of the hardest things Ive done in college, but I am so glad I did it and took it seriously because I am better thinker for it.",
                "Absolutely. Prof. Blight is a phenomenal lecturer with vast knowledge of every aspect of the Civil War. The essays are challenging but provide enough freedom to keep students passionate.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student; I think it was a really interesting and rewarding one to take. Even if you're not particularly interested in the Civil War, you'll get to hear such cool stories and do awesome readings that make it worthwhile.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot, and the lectures and readings were very interesting.",
                "yes, good US history deep dive",
                "Yes its a great intro history class.",
                "In a heartbeat, yes, definitely",
                "Yes! It is a great history course, and any time you have the chance to take a class with Prof. Blight  do it!",
                "I recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject matter and willing to put time into doing the readings---this is crucial to staying involved with the class and discussion section.",
                "Yes! I knew a lot of the info already from highschool but Blight is the expert and he adds interesting insights and this is a nice lecture course to have in your schedule.",
                "100%. Everyone should take this class. This class not only teaches you about the Civil War and Reconstruction, but also provides insights into American society today.",
                "Take this course if you're genuinely interested in the American Civil War, because the readings goes in-depth and would require interest to follow through during busier parts of the semester.",
                "Yes! Absolutely. If you have any interest in history take it - Professor Blight is AMAZING and this is such a class Yale course. It is very approachable no matter your background/in you are a history major or not. This was my favorite class of the semester and I am so happy that I took it.",
                "Yes. This is one of the best classes Ive ever taken at Yale. Dont miss your chance to take a class with Prof. Blight.",
                "Yes, if you like history and can manage the readings",
                "YOU MUST take this course!!! As a history major or non-history major, you will learn so much and have so much fun!!! The subject matter is so interesting and Dr Blight is the best professor Ive had at Yale so far",
                "Yes, DBlight is a freakin beast and I also had a great TA. DBlight is just a story teller and its so amazing to watch",
                "YES! If you are going to take one history class at Yale this is the one. One should jump at any opportunity to learn from Professor Blight.",
                "Yes! It is a great survey course to learn about this time period and the work load isn't too bad.",
                "Yes! This is a great course if youre looking for a pretty easy but interesting history course. Prof. blight goes on tangents a lot in class, which keeps the course really engaging (even if it can be a little distracting at times!). The essays are straightforward, and the exam is very fair. Would recommend!",
                "YES! I looked forward to each lecture for Blight's teaching style, knowledge, and story telling prowess.",
                "YES!! Take this course! You do not want to miss out on a chance to learn from Professor Blight!!!! Also, the way he teaches about the Antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction Eras takes into account multiple POV of the era, which is important when you teach (and learn) history since they all interact and have cause and effect!",
                "Yes! The professor is excellent.",
                "Yes - to any student of American history.",
                "Maybe. If you need an easy history credit or a humanities credit, are interested in the civil war, then by all means go for it. Just keep in mind that if you took something like AP US History, you probably won't learn anything new in this class. If you actually want to learn something new about the civil war or discuss the more intricate parts of it, then I would definitely skip the lecture course and take Professor Blight's seminar where it goes more in depth about historical memory of the civil war.",
                "Absolutely. The level of detail on the Civil War is deeply fascinating and Professor Blight's lectures are magical.",
                "Certainly",
                "Absolutely. This is a must-take course at Yale. Do not graduate without having taken it.",
                "Absolutely. Blight is amazing this is a must take course for students.",
                "Absolutely, 1000 percent",
                "Absolutely. Professor Blight is an excellent lecturer, I really enjoyed attending his class. He's a wonderful orator and really emerges you into the material.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other history majors.",
                "I would recommend it as the Civil War is arguably the most important period in American history, and it is critical to understand it.",
                "Yes because David Blight is incredible and every American should know about the Civil War.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who hopes to increase their understanding of the importance of the civil war and reconstruction era.",
                "yes, David Blight is an iconic lecturer that i feel lucky to have been taught by. and as an american, i felt that it was imperative for me to better understand the civil war. this course counters some of the patriotic propaganda i was taught in middle/high school by providing nuanced accounts of the confederacy and union."
