                "Strengths: Brad's open to talking about anything, cupcakes, TF's give clear feedback (although I wish it was more extensive/helped actually better my writing), topics are all over the place and very interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: ?? Maybe the midterm. It's not really a weakness though, it's just hard.",
                "Strengths: Brad has super interesting things to say about the topics we cover. Readings are overall very interesting. Very relevant class for our generation.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings feels very disconnected from the course at times. I did all the readings and wanted a bit more synthesis in class. Leminar format was...not my favorite but was fine. TA feedback was a bit ambiguous at times.",
                "This course is VERY VERY WEIRD and not at all for everyone. Brad is, frankly, an ass, and not always in a helpful, educative, or constructive way. However, most of the time, he does succeed on those marks, and I personally liked having a teacher that gave it to you like he really thought. Brad is clearly incredibly intelligent and thoughtful about his subject. Personally his aggressive and honest teaching style worked well for me. However, I do think he gives himself more credit for listening to competing viewpoints than he actually takes, which can be frustrating. Of course there are times when he's trying to make a point, but sometimes it seems obstinate. I personally loved the content and was engaged, but again not for everyone. A lot of my friends didn't give a crap about the privacy and property rights aspect which is what I liked, and I didn't really care for all the computer stuff. I would say the hardest part about this class is that it is just WAY TOO BIG! totally impossible to debate Brad or touch on points more thoroughly when there are 200 people in the room. I think if you go to dinner with Brad and have some one on ones, you will appreciate his style much more and what he is trying to get us to understand in the course. If you're not going to try, you'll just think he's an ass. And maybe he is--but I love him for it. Midterm was fine, readings are interesting, reading responses are stupid, and the final project is whatever.",
                "It was really really engaging but very unstructured. I wish we could have had some sort of structure for the reading responses. It was hard to be self paced. There also wasn't super clear information about the quantity of reading responses we were supposed to do, since there were some that got dropped and some that didn't it just because really confusing.",
                "strengths: you don't need to take any notes. claire's cupcakes for participation in class!! you watch a lot of fun videos that trick you into learning. the ability to grade appeal at the end of the semester. \r\nweaknesses: grading is incredibly vague and you don't know your grade at all throughout the semester. brad says this is by design but a lot of my peers and I thought it created more stress and uncertainty. sometimes brad got weirdly sensitive (?) or maybe defensive (?) about us asking him questions, too, which sometimes made him unapproachable (even over email)",
                "Brad is the draw, he makes the class. Gotta take it with him and just enjoy the journey. Genuinely enjoyable assignments and lectures. Plus dinner with Prof which is unique and made the class even better",
                "This course has no weaknesses. Zero. So I'll skip to the strengths. \r\n\r\nThe number one strength is Professor R-. No, don't you dare call him Professor Rosen. His name is Brad. You call him Brad. Anyways, the number one strength is Brad. He is an incredible educator, who tricks students into learning through his eccentric and unique teaching style. It is an absolute joy to take a class with Brad, I would highly recommend. \r\n\r\nSecond, is the content. There are no other courses offered at Yale College that cover law and technology like this one does. If you are at all interested in issues of copyright, intellectual property, privacy, digital rights, I can't recommend this course enough.",
                "I particularly like the structure of the course, with the reading responses, midterm exam, and final project. The readings sometimes felt like a bit much, especially in the weeks with a number of court cases and the readings assigned over breaks, but I don't think they ever strayed into the realm of completely unreasonable.",
                "readings were cool but i just felt no incentive to do them all",
                "Strengths: The content is super interesting, you learn a lot, the professor is very engaged. The assignments are structured so students can write on their own schedule and about the topics they find most interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is very unstructured, there is no powerpoint. The Professor often asks students to remind him to mention certain things if he forgets, this could be improved be him just having a notes. Additionally, he allows himself to be distracted by students who want to have long-winded conversations -- class can be derailed by a single student. This can be improved by him just offering to continue conversations after class if they are not beneficial for everyone to hear.",
                "strengths: BRAD IS THE MOST AMAZING AND ENGAGING PROFESSOR AT YALE. Free cupcakes. Extremely entertaining but in a way that you leave the course feeling like you learned SO MUCH about the law. Brad is a reasonable human being. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: not really any. hard to tell how you're doing in the class (final grade-wise) but if any course teaches you that grades don't matter, it's Brad's.",
                "This is the only course Ive ever had where I looked forward to attending every single lecture. This class is great. Workload is pretty low except for the midterm, content is incredibly interesting.",
                "The class was incredibly engaging and fascinating. The midterm and final project were a fun way to demonstrate what we had learned. I do wish we had more time to complete the reading responses, so making readings available a week or two in advance would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: BRAD! He is such a fantastic orator and teacher. He makes class super engaging, and 'tricks' you into learning while you think you are just having fun. Bonus points for the cupcakes ;)",
                "What you gain from the course reflects the amount of work you invest into the material. There was no intense pressure to keep up with readings, but if you chose not to, you would lose out on many of the topics covered in class. That system encouraged me to learn and interact with the material for the sake of learning. That could also be seen as a weakness because there was material that I did not read and missed out on. Overall, I appreciated the focus on learning instead of a focus on doing things for grades.",
                "No notes! Great class.",
                "Every lecture was clear, thorough, and completely engaging. The material was as well and every class was a blast to go to.",
                "Strengths: Brad. I also appreciate the creative liberty that can be taken with the reading responses and final project, and I appreciate the creativity Brad put into the midterm. The course provides a range of readings and content (court readings, blogs, YouTube videos) which makes it easily accessible to all types of students. \r\nWeakness: It was sometimes difficult to turn in reading responses on time if you wanted to turn one in by Wednesday due to the fact that the readings usually wouldn't be posted until after Monday's lecture.",
                "Brad is a phenomenal instructor who makes the lectures very fun and engaging. He also invites the whole class to sushi after class which is a really fun and interesting way to keep engaging with the material. You do a lot of things in class that don't seem like learning at the time, but you realize later on that you were learning without realizing it. The readings are interesting but there are too many of them and it can be hard to keep up with everything.",
                "Brad's teaching style is very divisive but extremely engaging, and I wouldn't trade it for anything else. The best way to describe it is full of pure raw emotion and enthusiasm that makes the long lecture never boring. Brad is very knowledgeable about all of the topics in the class and gives a very unique perspective as a lawyer that has had a computer science background. The workload is as much as you want to put into it, and you get back what you put in; and the workload isn't too bad even for an A. He makes effort to appeal to both computer science majors and non-computer science majors.  The \"leminar\" style where sitting in the front allows you to be more engaged is amazing as it's rare to be able to engage and voice yourself in a lecture of this size. An improvement I would say is more clearly outlining reading responses, the midterm, and the final in a formal document instead of having to hear bits and pieces of it over lectures and getting a summary email once in a while. There is also a bit of inconsistency in grading between the different graders of the reading responses, which are the only assignments outside of the midterm and the final.",
                "The course is very engaging and, as Brad told us on the first day, you will be tricked into learning serious legal concepts without even realizing! Looking back on the course, it is clear what the arc was intended to be. However, I think that course could definitely be improved by a quick explanation on the first day of what the course is actually about and what will be discussed. Even after the first few classes I was a bit confused about what the course was about, but it started to make more sense after this window.",
                "the strength is brad and his amazing humor and heart - this class (and the cupcake after) was genuinely one of the best parts of my week. brad acts tough and mean the first few classes but is actually really really kind and a softie. deadlines don't really exist, but you do have to try because TF grading is kind of strict sometimes. make sure to cite to lots of things in the reading responses. \r\nweaknesses - most of the hardcore learning is in the readings which are long and mostly legal/academic. also, i know this seems contradictory to the above, but he sometimes asks for comments and then (kind of brutally) shoots down/interrupts the students he disagrees with or that are incorrect. i wish he would correct students more gently"

I had absolutely no interest in the law prior to this course and it's piqued my interest. The course isn't entirely law related though, you do get into other topics as well, but overall recommend if you're looking for a course concerning the emergence of new tech and how it will affect our future.",
                "Potentially - probably a great class to take as a sophomore. If you're interested in law and tech, you will get a lot out of it. The class format isn't great for leaving the class with a clear understanding of all the material, but good for critical thinking in this area.",
                "Yes. Brad does his job and he does it well. Go for it. Unless you're not gonna listen or you don't wanna get to know him better like at dinner. then you won't like it at all.",

Do not take it as a first-year, or you won't appreciate it as deeply as if you take it when you've already gone through a few Yale lectures. \r\n\r\nAnyway onto the class: Take notes on the readings, they'll be invaluable for the very longggg midterm (which manages to cover everything in the class and is actually rlly fun to complete -- in retrospect only haha). Schedule your reading responses and stick to the schedule (altho, he's chill with providing 'amnesty' reading responses for when you realize it's impossible to write 5 reading responses for 2 remaining lectures). Do the readings, sit in the front, and participate (otherwise, why waste your time). Attend at least one of the post-lecture dinners. Brad is an amazing professor and an even more amazing human! The content itself was extremely interesting, as a pre-law student interested in CS/the digital world.",

                "Yes, absolutely. If you are interested in the legality of online conduct or the ways that the Internet has shaped society, this class is excellent. It feels very modern and often incorporates current events.",
                "YES! ABSOLUTELY!! Brad is an amazing professor and human being. This is definitely one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale! This course is perfect for anyone and everyone, and I think the material is important for anyone to develop a healthy level of criticism for the current state of our society (thus encouraging thought about how to fix what is not working). Each class was a blast, and the cupcakes were delicious! This was one class I genuinely looked forward to each week. Please, please, please try to take this class before you graduate!!!",
                "I think that this is a class you need to take some time during your time at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. I thought that the professor had a very honest approach to his class. He would offer us the readings and talk in class, while we were expected to think about that material. He trusted us enough to allow us to learn. The class itself is also very fun. Aside from the professor being funny, he knows what he's talking about. He mentioned many times that this is not a throwaway class. The work/ fun balance in class makes the course very easy to recommend.",
                "Yes! You will learn a lot about the social context of your work if you're coming from a technical background, or gain a new understanding of the implications of tech if not.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course. It was something completely out of my major and sphere of knowledge and I am glad it took it. This is the type of class you look forward to attending at Yale. It broadens your horizons. Its a must-take!",
                "I know that we were supposed to be \"tricked into learning\" without feeling like we were learning, but I think you could learn a lot more in a different class. That being said all of the content was very fun and interesting.",
                "Besides the more obvious reason being the character that is Brad, I would highly recommend this course to anyone who uses the internet and is remotely interested in being a better/more mindful user. The course really exposes you to relevant cases and issues which, having grown up with the internet, I find is important for all of Gen Z (and future generations) to know about.",
                "Absolutely, really fun class where you still learn a lot. Brad is super dedicated to making this class great. As he will warn you at the start of the class, his style is polarizing, so it makes sense to have a backup plan in case you decide it isn't for you though during shopping period.",
                "If you need a gut/chill class for extra credit, then take it.  I was able to get by in the class by just attending lectures and only doing the readings for the times I did a reading response.  It was very manageable when taking 4 other classes.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student who would enjoy learning about modern issues in society related to technology and taking a very deep dive through engaging lectures that are highly open to student participation. Additionally, the relatively low workload of this course compared to how much you can get out of it makes it a very worthwhile course.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is by far the most engaging course that you will ever take at Yale, and Brad's teaching style is something that you will find no where else on this campus. Brad's style of teaching is...unique (you'll know what this means if you attend the first class). Brad really tricks you into learning legitimate copyright law and other legal concepts through memes, viral videos, and other formats. Definitely a course to take before you graduate Yale!",
                "this class is such a wild ride but so much fun, i kind of miss it a little"
