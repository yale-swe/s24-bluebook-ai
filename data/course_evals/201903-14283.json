   "comments": [
    "My skills in literature, writing and college-level humanities improved drastically over the course of the semester.",
    "I learned how to actively read a book without looking for vague things like character development.",
    "I learned how to engage in constructive conversations about literature, without it just devolving into people giving long monologues about their thoughts. I also learned how to pay really close attention to word choice and brevity while writing",
    "The course taught me how to look at the humanities in a more holistic way than just what was on the page. While it took a while, it definitely taught me how to become a better reader and how to analyze writing in many ways different than how I did before.",
    "I have become far more skilled at close reading of texts. It taught me how to read looking for the small but telling details in a text that I had never looked for before. I also learned how to become a more concise writer. I also learned to not look for details in a text to support my preconceived notions of a text but to let the details shape my interpretation of the text.",
    "I became a much stronger reader",
    "This course helped to understand that different texts demand different kinds of reading. In other words, one does not read poetry from ancient China in the same way that they might read Shakespeare. With this in mind, I believe that I actually became a better reader throughout this course, because Dr. T and Prof T emphasized the importance of staying true to the text. We did not read a book and look for overarching themes, but read a book looking at the way the words were crafted.",
    "Definitely learned to think about the craft of writing more. I think I became a much closer reader; learned to pay attention to the author's small choices to guide my interpretation of a book rather than big-picture themes from general vibes. I also became much more intent about my choices as a writer (does that word really mean what you think it means, etc).",
    "I learned about humanistic inquiry and how one should approach a text. I learned more than I thought possible about responsible reading as well as a bit about eastern cultures and traditions.",
    "I learned how to write concisely and conduct close readings of text.",
    "Learned how to analyze texts in an entirely new way.",
    "I think I became more adept at reading texts. Even though I could read texts and write papers before, I feel like I can now analyze them thoroughly and approach them more holistically.",
    "This course provides insight on what a professional career in the humanities looks like. It helped my ability to edit writing as well as write with concision. The course taught me how to read closely and gather evidence strictly from the text.",
    "I learned how to write sentences with extreme precision and in doing so sharpen my thinking. I learned the different between \"reading into\" a text and \"reading the text.\" In short, it washed some of the lazy habits of thinking and writing that high school had left me with.",
    "As was the intention of the professors, I gained more knowledge about different canons besides the traditional Western one. Specifically, we read books from East Asia (China, to be exact, though the Chinese culture of the time periods of the works we read was not the same as it is today) and Persia\/Iran, along with The Tempest and Frankenstein. For me, I think the biggest thing I learned -- and I know this seems obvious, but I didn't realize how difficult this was going to be -- was that works from different canons are very different stylistically, and that accessing them in meaningful ways is hard when one doesn't understand certain important aspects of the culture the work is from. For example, in one of the works, \"Story of the Stone,\" an assignment was to look for things that seemed surprising -- but some of the things I found were just normal in China at the time. It was hard for me to differentiate without help. This was true for other works too; I just didn't understand what I was supposed to look for. I think confusion is an interesting part of the project of \"Six Pretty Good Books,\" because it really makes you question your assumptions about what a work in the canon really is.",
    "I developed my writing skills and my ability to analyze texts. Specifically I learned how to actively engage with texts not just passively read them.",
    "I learned about the academic world and existing in it. But ultimately, Six Pretty Good Books makes me feel cheated, even though it included an almost-free trip to New York and D.C. \r\nI never could have gone on those trips without this opportunity. I never would have learned as much about the way college and professors work without this class. Im thankful that I was welcomed into the homes of a college professor as well as a museum curator-- I want to go into academia, but thats a world Ive never been part of. Being able to just sit on the carpet of an intelligent persons house and listen to academic banter showed me a life I hope is someday mine. Shawkats discussion on translations and editing and the innerworkings of the academic world excited me and showed me futures I could imagine for myself. \r\nI didnt really learn much about reading or writing, which disappointed me. I really thought this class would be about discussing books and language and coming to a deeper understanding of the human experience across time and space. I thought we would look at a work deeply enough to learn something. Im disappointed that this class never deeply looked at something, that we, as a class, never refined ideas until the point of a breakthrough and understanding what something meant. I suppose that wasnt the intention-- we only ever looked at paragraphs or pages or fragments of a work. Its too much to expect analysis and deeper themes.  \r\nBut it feels incredibly unrewarding to look at fragments rather than a whole-- which maybe is why cannons exist. Theyre all units within one greater body sharing tropes and themes and characters, they cross reference each other and build meaning. Without this context they become weaker, less meaningful, less significant."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was an extremely engaging class, with field trips and spirited class discussions. However, it was extremely unorganized. Most of the time, I had no idea what was going on or what the expectations were of me. I learned to deal with this though for the sake of the benefits of the class.",
    "confusion in assignment requirements, standards and due dates.\r\nexpectations were ambiguous and no one was sure of anything",
    "Strengths - great community building, professors cared a lot about the students\r\nWeaknesses - the course \/ syllabus is clearly still in the works, as this was the first time the course was offered. That meant that assignments were often changed on the fly, and the whole thing felt a bit disorganized. With that being said, I think that after this trial run, the course will begin to improve.",
    "We were not given the expertise to live up to the expectations of the course until much later on in the semester and the course deviated from the syllabus a lot (in good and bad ways). However, it's a great class to learn more about the humanities and humanistic study.",
    "Prof T and Dr T are so much fun to be around. You really feel like you join a community in the class, and I was happy to go to class every day. \r\n\r\nThe field trips to NYC and Washington D.C. were outstanding. We got to engage with so many interesting people at the Met and Freer-Sackler, and we got to see how the texts we read had \"afterlives,\" particularly with the Shahnameh and Persian book art. \r\n\r\nI think that, while the writing assignments were helpful, we would benefit from more of them. I felt more comfortable with what sort of work we were supposed to be producing toward the end of course, but at times it still felt a bit unclear. I think an easy remedy to this would be to provide sample writing assignments and to increase the number of writing assignments so that students can have more time to grow. \r\n\r\nI also felt like expectations were not clearly communicated at times. We departed completely from the syllabus, which I found a bit stressful. And, grading expectations were not clear. The focus should definitely be on learning and not the grade, but it is still something that students (first-years especially) worry about. I think communicating expectations\/standards for quality work in the class would fix this easily. \r\n\r\nAlso, sometimes feedback on assignments from Dr. T and Prof T were very different. While Prof T would like something, Dr. T wouldn't, which was sometimes a bit confusing. I think if they communicated with each other and ensured that they were giving similar feedback this would also be an easy fix.",
    "Wonderful teachers",
    "The strengths of this course were its sense of community, the field trips we went on, the guest speakers, the level of engagement, and the way in which I find myself to have become both a better reader and writer. The professors, Dr. T and Prof T, are both intelligent beyond belief and made the course all that it was. That being said, since it was the first year it ran, there are certain kinks that need to be worked out in the future. For example, at times the expectations were unclear.",
    "Strengths: the profs are fun to be around and want to help you out, the books are enjoyable to read, most of the time it's not too stressful. Trips and food are lots of fun. Guest lecturers are nice. Towards the end I also appreciated the work we did on how to read and write. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: expectations are often unclear, which can create stress (profs are generally hesitant to give examples of what they want bc they don't want us to close off \/ only cater to them, but then we become confused). In the first half of the course I felt like I wasn't learning much but that improved. Occasionally boring but I expect other seminars are more so.",
    "The strengths are its small size and the knowledge of its professors. I also really enjoyed taking trips and the professors engagement outside of the classroom. This course could be improved if the syllabus was more definite and if students were given more indication as to when their readings were considered \"good\".",
    "I loved the community atmosphere Prof T and Dr. T promoted in the class. The class trips were engaging and fun, and the range of texts exposed me to new fields. I wish we started writing earlier though, so we had a stronger foundation for the essays we wrote later in the year.",
    "A bit chaotic but could be a good thing if you don't really like structure.",
    "I dont think this course had very clear instruction, nor did it have enough writing assignments. However, it cultivated a strong community and the dynamic between student and instructor was very good.",
    "The organization of the course seemed a bit lacking. Students had few opportunities to write and receive feedback on their writing. Students also felt lost the majority of the time on the expectations on what the writing assignments should look like as models were not provided. The course could be greatly improved with more writing assignments without necessarily the pressure of being evaluated on them as a grade.",
    "Strengths - field trips were super fun, visiting professors engaging (& good at introducing to a large variety of subjects), introduces you to college level thinking without a ton of work.\r\nWeakness - teaching methods did not help me enjoy the books (although overall they were pretty good), professors were unclear about expectations & \\ struggled to provide clear feedback. The class discussions and writings left us feeling very frustrated most times.",
    "I think a strength of this class is its mission, to broaden the canon that we, students at a very Western university, experience. Even though I think the confusion that comes along with delving into new\/different cultures is an important aspect of experiencing them, I felt like there was too much confusion in this class. Part of reason I had trouble understanding new pieces was that they were written under different cultural assumptions, but part of it was that the professors understood exactly what those assumptions were and therefore didn't find them confusing -- which would be fine, but it seemed like they also didn't understand why we did find them confusing. Instead of explaining what to look for, and what was normal, they asked us to look for specific things and then told us when we were wrong (which was most of the time). So it felt like instead of teaching us how to read texts from different canons, they were giving us texts from different canons and then telling us how we did it wrong. I think one way this could be improved would be if the professors could be very clear from the outset of each unit about what to look for and how to discuss it, with specific examples of the \"right\" way of doing these things, instead of criticizing us when we did it incorrectly.",
    "This course had a strong concept but was very disorganized in execution.",
    "The seminar format really helped the class because it was easier to discuss the texts we were reading. There were also opportunities for small group projects for us to develop and challenge each other's ideas. One weakness in the course is that I think there actually could have been more writing assignments to help me develop my analysis skills. This being an experimental class it took about half a semester to determine what did and didn't work, but the analysis assignments we ended up doing strengthened the class as a whole.",
    "The book selection wasn't great. I think Du Fu is universally regarded as a mistake so I won't spend too long talking about that, but randomly picking works from various countries felt like it contributed to the meaninglessness of this course. I think it would be more insightful if the works were chosen by adherence to a common theme and that common theme was explored across traditions. Spending more time with the experts would also be good-- my imagined reworking of Six Pretty Good Books involves six professors who each teach a week or two's worth of material, with multiple rotating sections of students who study the works in a different order. For example, Professor A is an expert on book A and Professor B is an expert on book B and so on-- and the six sections each have the same professor and same work but in a different order, so they're all reading these books with experts."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, it was such a unique course. You're not going to have opportunities to take classes like this with professors like these often.",
    "Yes - the community I found here was really great, and it's relatively low pressure and very low workload",
    "Yes. While it was rough in the beginning, the professors did a great job helping us build a cohort and learn how to read books and analyze writing in a much different way. The workload fluctuates in the class, but there is a good support system built up within the students and between the students and professors.",
    "Yes. Ultimately, I think I got a ton out of the class in terms of improving my reading of texts. But, I would make it clear to them that they will not be in their comfort zone in the class. It pushes you to read and write in ways that are not necessarily comfortable, so I would warn them about that.",
    "YES!!! Amazing opportunity to be in close contact with two highly-accomplished and engaging faculty members",
    "Yes definitely. There were flaws with the course but it's obvious that the profs are trying to improve it based on our feedback. The class trips are a great opportunity (the food... very good). True to the ads the books are pretty good, and we don't fully read the long ones, so the workload is super manageable. \r\n\r\nimo the essays require a lot of deep thought (\/ sometimes you have to deal with confusing expectations), so at times it's difficult, but it's a worthwhile tradeoff when you only have to write three papers and the longest is 2 pages. It's more about the quality of your thinking than the quantity of your writing.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, especially someone that has an interest outside of the humanities. This course was a great comprehensive introduction to the way humanists approach a text.",
    "Yes, It was very engaging and I have gained skills that I will carry on with me throughout my career.",
    "Yes, the people in the class were a great little community. The trips were very fun.",
    "I would recommend it to another student to gain a new perspective on how to read and approach texts, but not to get writing experience. I feel much more adept at understanding texts, but still have trouble figuring out how to write about them correctly.",
    "They are clearly still working out the issues, but I think the class got progressively better so I'd imagine the next complete iteration would be pretty good. Only take if you're tough & open enough to have your ways of thinking destroyed and built from the ground up.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend this course to another student. I definitely think the project of the class -- to broaden the canon -- is a good one, and since this was only the first semester Six Pretty Good Books was offered, I'm sure the professors will be able to mitigate some of the issues and sources of confusion. This course also has some amazing field trips, to DC and New York. Some of the guest professors were amazing, and we also didn't have a ton of writing, considering it's a writing credit. However, at the same time, the harshness of the professors (which they termed \"pushing back,\" a concept that is totally fine by me as long as I can respond in defense of myself, which I never felt able to do) and their lack of clarity about what they wanted definitely frustrated me and put me off. I also felt like some of the choices of texts were somewhat strange. In some cases I just personally disagreed with the \"greatness\" of the work (like \"Frankenstein,\" for example), and others just seemed not very, well, canonical (like \"The Consorts of the Caliphs\") -- as in, they didn't seem to have extensive influence on the culture from which they came. I'm not sure if the syllabus will stay the same in future iterations of this course, however. I personally would have loved to read more from different geographic areas (like anywhere in South America, or Africa, or Australia), as we focused on very specific regions (China, Iran, and England) for a course intended to culturally broaden the canon.",
    "I know this course is planned to be revised, and if so, I would recommend it. I probably would not recommend the course as I took it.",
    "I would recommended this course to a student who wants to practice analyzing texts from outside the traditional western cannon.",
    "No. I think some people really liked certain aspects of this course, so there certainly are some students who would enjoy it. But personally I felt like it was frustrating and a waste of time. I didnt struggle with ideas or feel like I really learned how to read or write. \r\nGoing to DC was fun, but doesnt make up for how little I got out of this.\r\n I feel really bad that all I can say is negative and want Dr. T and Prof. T to know not to take this personally (just like we shouldnt take writing feedback personally!), theyre both really kind and interesting people and the idea behind this course was interesting-- but pretty much everything about this class makes me disappointed. I dont think we ever came to a point of fully understanding an idea and I never felt that fulfillment of finding meaning in anything associated with this class. \r\nI thought I wanted to study literature and the humanities and deeply loved analysis. I thought I wanted to be a translator or an editor, I thought I wanted to study words and meaning and this class made me feel that not only am I entirely incompetent at any of that, these fields are so bogus and myopic I dont want to be part of them anyway."
