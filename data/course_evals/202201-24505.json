The guiding principle of the course is the relationship between the immediate and the mediate. Specifically, the relationships between meaning and information, between interpretation and computation, and between interaction and infrastructure.",
                "This course was excellend. I have studied semiotics with other professors at Yale and Prof. Kockelman elucidated concepts in ways other professors simply could not. The course expanded my knowledge with respect to information systems. The texts selected by the professor were among the most interesting I have ever read. Prof. Kockelman's subsequent explanations of these texts were just as insightful. I am really grateful to have been in this course.",

The lectures are extremely engaging and often left me pondering the material throughout the week and making connections to other courses. At times the material can feel esoteric, but professor Kockelman makes the nature of the material clear from the beginning. Another weakness of the course is that it is effectively a lecture, so just set your expectations.",

The course material is so broad that anyone will get something out of it and have ideas to contribute. The course will also have you thinking about the material outside the class. The term paper is very open ended and you can write about something you're really interested in.",
