    "This course will give you a fundamental understanding of basic biochemistry and cell biology as well as a foundation for how to think scientifically.",
    "Principles of biochem\/biophysics (noncovalent interactions and protein folding, macromolecules and their functions, processes like ATP production, DNA replication, transcription, and translation, biotechnology methods); Cell biology (characteristics of the plasma membrane, transport across membranes, synthesis and targeting of membrane\/secretory proteins, endocytosis, the cytoskeleton, actin and microtubule assembly, experimental methods with emphasis on microscopy, immunofluorescence, and biochemical methods like electrophoresis, sedimentation, etc. We also discussed 5 landmark papers in cell bio)."

   "comments": [
    "Two halves of the course in the summer work well together. The second half is little faster and little tough to keep up with if you don't stay engaged throughout the course.",
    "Strengths: Great depth, Great Professors. Professor Collins was one of the best professors I have had at Yale. Professor Mooseker was one of the most knowledgeable and thoughtful with really interesting problem sets. Both had a great focus on a priori teaching. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think Professor Mooseker would do better offering quizzes like Professor Collins did that covered basic facts to make sure students have the foundational knowledge to attack the problems we are given.",
    "- The primary strength for this course was the teachers, as both had a clear dominion over the topic and could clearly explain the key concepts of the different topics seen during these 5 weeks. \r\n\r\n- One weakness was that the course sometimes felt too fast-paced, and we had to learn a wide variety of subjects in a somewhat short span of time.",
    "Compared to the lecture version offered during the year, we only had 12 people, so we could easily ask questions and have small group discussions. The strength of both halves of the course was that there were study guides for each unit, so even if we went through the material quickly, we could go back and make sure we learned the important things. One weakness is that the second half of the course covered significantly more content than the first half, but both halves had equal time assigned to them. The workload for the second half of the course was much higher as a result."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely will. It's such an useful course and it's interesting as well. But remember to come to the course prepared.",
    "If you need to take it, but it's better in the summer. It's more manageable when you have more time to focus on it.",
    "Absolutely take this class. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yeah its a great class. Itll start off nice and easy in the first half. Youll really be tested on things like vocab and understanding experiments that were shown in class. The second half becomes more challenging, you now start to take principles from the experiments you discuss and apply them to novel biological situations. Professor Collins and Professor Mooseker are both amazing people, and it is very obvious that they really do care about both the material and their students. They are two of the best lecturers Ive had at Yale. Moosekers lectures can get dense with information, but he is more than willing to stop and go over topics 2 or 3 times if need be.",
    "Even if you do not need this course for your major, I still think it gives a good overview of the important topics of biology. This course is more focused on analysis and critical thinking over memorization, which I enjoyed."
