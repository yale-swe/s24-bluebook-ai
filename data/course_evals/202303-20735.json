                "I learned how to write a research paper that focused on comparing literature. A very helpful skill learned was also the ability to dissect, interpret, and academically compare texts, even more specifically ancient ones. I also learned about myself and my writing style. Given that it is an Egyptology course, I learned a lot about the inner workings of Ancient Egyptian religion and culture.",
                "Before this course, I had no prior exposure to writing research papers. I did not know what an abstract or annotated bibliography was. I am pleased to take away the skills of being more comfortable with research, being capable of writing an abstract for a paper and being able to write an annotated bibliography. Familiarity with the format of academic papers, such as research, is extremely beneficial to building my comfort with different types of writing. Initially, I was more familiar with creative writing, but now I feel that I have the skills to understand how to approach more formal writing structures. I believe that these skills will serve as a great foundation for academic writing during my time in college and beyond."

                "Great writing course where you will learn/refresh the basics and get insightful feedback. It is very obvious that the professor cares about your progress and growth and it will show in your writing. Only \"weakness\" is that the last readings that were from outside Egyptian culture felt a bit rushed considering they were options for comparison in our papers.",
                "The structure of the course is a strength. For example, at the beginning of the course, we spent time on the historical background of the Egyptian literature that we discussed in class. The ability to receive feedback on papers and revise was also a strength because it helped me develop editing capabilities. I also appreciated how the papers and projects built upon one another in difficulty as we gained more exposure to the material and writing methodologies."

Would recommend it even more when taught by Professor Tritsch, he's amazing! He genuinely knows what he's talking about and his passion for the topic makes it easy to focus and genuinely enjoy learning the information.",
