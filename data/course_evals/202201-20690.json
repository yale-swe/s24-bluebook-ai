                "I developed proficiency in solidworks.",
                "This course allowed me to learn new skills in CAD software having had very little experience prior. I was also able to develop and foster these skills while also filling my portfolio with demonstrative creations. I learned about various basic machines commonly used in the mechanical engineering world.",
                "I learned best engineering practices for SolidWorks and CAD design, simulation analysis of physical mechanisms, and the theory behind how computer modeling works using linear algebra and MATLAB.",
                "I greatly improved my knowledge in SolidWorks.",
                "A good introduction into CAD, especially having had little-to-no experience whatsoever coming into the class. The concepts are introduced pretty gradually gradually at a nice pace. We learned modelling, motion analysis, a bit of MATLAB, and some FEA analysis.",
                "CAD",
                "I learned how to use Solidworks and Matlab. I also learned how this software is used in real engineering applications.",
                "Dr A is super helpful with teaching the fundamentals of CAD, even for someone with no previous knowledge. We learned various functions such as CAD modeling, Finite Element Analysis, Flow Simulations, Animation and Motion Analysis. We got to build some really cool CAD models and everything is at your own pace.",

                "Learned how to cad",

                "SolidWorks\/ CAD skills",

                "Very fun and engaging, get to work on projects with new pairs for most of the projects. Easy to follow instructions, and great resources available.",
                "The professor is very kind and always willing to help you figure things out. The class is very structured around helping you learn as opposed to assigning you a grade, which makes things much more positive to experience.",
                "The course was very well taught and meant to facilitate student learning!",
                "The strength of this course was Doc A. He is definitely one of the best professors at Yale and genuinely cares about his students! He is incredibly friendly and engaging. The course was structured well. I loved the topics we covered. I appreciated that he used mastery based learning where we could resubmit until having mastered the material. This reduced the stress of assignments and allowed us to genuinely learn the material without too much pressure.",
                "Strengths: very casual class, the professor is nice and humorous, very understanding as well, overall a low-stress way to get an introduction into CAD. \r\nWeaknesses: solidworks is a windows-only software so if you have a Mac, you'll have to find a way to get windows to run. Other than that, as long as you understand the CAD concepts which are not too bad at all, you'll be fine",
                "It was awesome",
                "The course was excellent. The assignments all seemed to further teach you how to use the programs. I felt like the insight I gained into Solidworks was rather unique for a course and super valuable. Doctor Adrezin is also a great professor and makes the class super accessible to people of all backgrounds. You very much get out what you put into the course, so it offers much opportunity for growth.",
                "Strengths: Great professor who is really great at explaining step by step the ways to build everything in Solidworks. The difficulty of assignments increases over time but there is plenty of time to work on them in class and ask questions. Great peer tutors who were always ready to help if you had any questions on any assignments. Weakness: Not much MatLab is used in the class except for the project but it's relatively simple.",
                "Great class, supportive environment, learned a useful skill",

                "Yes, great course to learn SolidWorks and create interesting CAD models. I also got to meet new friends while working on projects together.",

                "Absolutely! This class is a great introduction to SOLIDWORKS programming while also teaching you how to use these skills more professionally. I recommend it to any student, not just engineers!",
                "Yes!! I learned so much, and it was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale that perfectly combined theory and practice.",
                "I would recommend this course to any mechE major. This course is extremely practical!",
                "Yes! If you already have CAD experience and want a more challenging or deeper level class, this class might not be right for you since you build from the ground up, but if you want a solid introduction into CAD and using solidworks, this class gets that job done well.",
                "Yes, it was good.",
                "Yes, I would. This course is a great introduction into Solidworks and Matlab. Literally every assignment is valuable, and the final project is a great opportunity to showcase all that you learned in a fun way. I really loved the course. Doctor Adrezin is also amazing. He is super helpful and makes the class fun. I was weary of taking a class late at night, but it was definitely beyond worthwhile for me.",
                "Yes, take this for sure, even if you are not a MechE major (take it for an engineering elective). Doc A is available an hour before every class session and very accessible (feel free to interrupt him and ask any questions you may have). Other than that, he structures assignments so they are relatively easy at first, to help you ease in and begin modeling in CAD. Enjoy the class and by the end, you will be amazed by how much you can do in CAD.",
                "Yes! Learned a good skill in a low-stress environment",
                "I would highly recommend this course to other Mechanical Engineering students and general makers--this is a more chill opportunity to learn something useful.",
                "Absolutely, it is an awesome course that gives you real skills",
                "Yes, this is a fun class that helps you to develop CAD modeling skills. If you are already proficient in SolidWorks the beginning of the course may be a bit repetitive but there are still useful tips and skills throughout the course particularly for modeling in a workplace environment."
