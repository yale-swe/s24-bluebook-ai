You will be reading a book, reading a script, watching a movie, and submitting a beat sheet on the movie every week which feels excessive and often feels redundant. It will expose you to a lot of media you probably will not have seen before which is great, but the writing process of the screenplay itself is not especially scaffolded by the course. It's a good class to take if you need the deadlines and structure of a class to write a screenplay, but this isn't a course that I would take as a fifth or 'for fun' class if you're doing it for a grade."
