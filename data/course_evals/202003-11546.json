                "High expectations, but this is probably related to the changes due to the pandemic. Being understanding and flexible was great, but it would be even greater if the standards were realistic from the start.",
                "Weaknesses: it was a lot of work. feedback on expectations could be given more promptly\r\nstrengths: the groups were put together in a thoughtful way, advising was available whenever we needed and more, accommodations were made to ensure that we could work on our projects in real life",
                "Lectures are not super helpful, especially if you've taken other engineering design classes. I was very excited for this class, but the reported expectations were apparently not always the teaching staff's actual expectations, and the work was easily twice that of a regular class if not more. Clear, reasonable expectations and a way to more evenly divide work between team members would help. We are all already overworked and sleep deprived, and honestly I've lost all faith in teamwork. From what I found talking with other teams, every group had team dynamic and work distribution problems, some more than others, and the only way I can think to change this is to make individual's grades more reflective of their own personal effort. Teamwork could be a huge strength for this class, but some structural issues need to be improved so people prioritize and are excited about the projects as a group.",
                "I loved being able to pick our projects this year!!! But I felt the selection of groups could have been done more in line with people with similar interests over just who Prof Booth thought should be in a group together. I liked the virtual lectures, and thought the balance between those and group work time was well done.",
                "A strength of the course is that it gives us a lot of trust and freedom to choose our topic and guide our design process how we see is best for our project, with guidance from the teaching staff, who is very available for conversations and questions throughout the course. A weakness is a lack of direction and actionable feedback. Particularly with the last design review, we did not have much time for questions or comments, and we were unable to get much meaningful feedback from fellow students or teaching staff from the presentation.",
                "Strengths: students are able to and given the resources to pick and develop the project of their choosing. The instructors are very available for help and feedback\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures feel as if they are just there to pass a requirement rather than as a learning experience. The assignment requirements are confusedly written and require constant questions to the instructors",
                "Overall I think the class is structured well given the circumstances.  I think the challenge of the disconnect between lecture material and group work was exacerbated by the virtual format."

                "The instructors did quite a good job of distributing materials and opening lab space whenever possible.  The limitations were handled well.  Virtual lectures are challenging, as they are for all courses, but are perhaps made worse by the feeling that time for the class should be spent on project work, making lectures feel disconnected."
