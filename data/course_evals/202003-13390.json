                "Lectures were very bland and not conducive to creating an environment for engaged students. I think this was likely exacerbated by the virtual setting.",
                "I enjoyed the material, but the lectures online sometimes made me feel isolated from the other students. My section was also really small, so discussion was difficult to have. I did enjoy the professor's lectures and his attitude about the class.",
                "Strengths - interesting content, but section was where I really felt like I engaged with the content. Also, I took this class during the 2020 election which was really interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - some of the readings seemed kinda redundant\/useless - I felt that reading the selections that were discussed in section was important, but not the entire set of readings.",
                "Strengths of the course was the purpose fo the course. I think it is very important that people understand the role of parties.\r\n\r\nWeakness of the course was the emphasis on readings. We spent a lot of time in section and exams looking at very dense long readings. I found myself getting more confused by the authors and losing track of the concept we were actually talking about. Also we are expected to complete 6-9 of these dense readings a week and be able to compare them to each other. I thought this was far too many to keep straight in my head .",
                "Strengths: the clear instructions throughout the course and the professors willingness to answer questions and ensure that students truly understood the concepts. Additionally, it was helpful that the professor provided all the powerpoint presentations and readings directly on Canvas. Weaknesses: due to the online lecture format, the class engagement during lecture was sometimes low.",
                "Strengths: Great discussion sections, manageable reading load, lectures were engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Exam formatting",
                "A strength was the level of interaction between the professor and students during lecture. I also appreciated how the professor answered questions after the lecture.",
