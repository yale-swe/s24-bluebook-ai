                "Strengths: interesting and useful material, lectures easy to follow ======== Weaknesses: some homework problems involved a lot of semi-obscure linear algebra",
                "I think the course is very well-organized, accessible, and enjoyable to attend. The workload was a bit high, but I believe assignments are necessary to learn the material for the course. One suggestion is to possibly have longer, bi-weekly problems sets rather than weekly to be more flexible for students to plan around.",
                "Strengths: The material was incredibly interesting and I often left lectures completely mind blown about what I had just learned (yes, the material is really that cool). Sekhar is also the best professor to be teaching the course. He simply knows so much about the field of optimization and also cares so much about the success of his students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only improvement I could think of is with regard to the homework assignments. Sometimes I felt that the problems were meaningless for my understanding of the course material. I do think, though, that this is because the course was being taught for the first time this semester.",
                "Gives a great survey for different optimization methods and the mathematical principles behind them. However, for someone with limited exposure to this field, the content is very heavy and intense, and it is easy to leave a class without an in-depth understanding of the topics. \r\n\r\nInstead of giving weekly problem sets which only includes mathematical derivation, maybe give bi-weekly problem sets which are longer but include both derivation and implementation of the algorithms to facilitate better understanding of the topics covered.",
                "The main strength of this course is that it covers a lot of fundamental topics in convex optimization with mathematical rigor. Moreover, Sekhar is a great teacher and he is always available for clarifications. The problem sets are also often related to the content of the lectures, and I found most of them useful.",
                "The course gives intuition about many complicated optimization algorithms.",
                "I really enjoyed this class. Sekhar is an amazing professor and his lectures are the highlight of the course. We cover highly technical problems but he makes sure to motivate each concept and also harkens back to big picture\/high level overviews of the class so that we dont get lost in the technicality of the proofs. One thing I would say is that perhaps the workload for psets in the latter half of the semester could be a little less so that we have more time to focus on the final project.",

                "The course is extremely good as it is.",
                "No weakness",
                "Strengths: Sekhar is very organized, kind, and approachable as a professor. He seems passionate about the subject and find the most optimal ways to transmit the information to us. There isn't stress of midterms of finals, which is nice given how technical some of the subject matter can be - it gives you more time to explore and work through the material at your own pace.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While Sekhar seemed very well prepared for the lectures and there was space for students to ask questions, a lot of the content felt impermeable in lectures. Since we often delved straight into technical concepts \/ long proofs, it felt easy to lose track of what we were doing and the goal for the proofs. Maybe this is the nature of the subject or my own personal block about the material, and it is hard to think of something that Sekhar could do differently to make it more accessible because it seems clear that he is already trying. Maybe more time could be spent on starting with motivating problems with relatable examples? Sekhar already tries to make things more interactive by asking the class some questions but gets little response, but maybe he could try some more direct in-class activities where we have to discuss something amongst ourselves in small groups at the start of class to get some intuition for examples?"

                "Sekhar does not shy away from going in-depth over each topic covered in the course. Those who have taken an optimization course but want to develop a level of understanding that allows one to do excellent research in the said field should take this course."
