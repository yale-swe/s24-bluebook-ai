I also learned how to read and speak in Hindi and those skills greatly improved over the course of the semester. I could observe a noticeable difference in my reading and speaking skills, although it was harder to gauge my writing skills due to the nature of it being over Zoom.",

I learned how to introduce myself, to respond to various commands, and to communicate basic needs. This course introduced me to aspects of Indian cultures and fomented my love of the Hindi language."

                "A strength of the course is that it provides a low-stress environment for those that are completely new to the language to feel comfortable and develop their skills. The instructors are also very nice and encouraging. A weakness of the course is sometimes I was not really sure how assignments were being graded.",
                "This course has many strengths, chief among which is the engagement of the professors with the students. Beginning to try to express myself in a different language and in an unfamiliar context was anxiety-inducing, but my close relationship with Seema Ji and Swapna Ji quickly helped to alleviate my fears. I Would only make one suggestion for altering the course: I think it would be beneficial if students had the opportunity to speak in Hindi more in smaller settings, perhaps structured time to engage with conversation partners or a TA.",
                "Strengths: Warmth and personability of Swapna ji, Seema ji, and Chitra, incredibly inclusive\/welcoming learning environment, songs to keep us engaged, unique\/challenging midterm and final projects, journal entry exercises.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times seemed a bit disorganized and was sometimes difficult to find things on Canvas. Writing out a weekly learning portfolios didn't seem very useful on my end."

                "In my opinion, the class was taught as well as possible given the online format! The professors did a great job adapting to the virtual space. Question and answer during live sessions were incredibly useful in enhancing student knowledge on the subjects. I think the whiteboards are great to use, and perhaps could have been used more while learning the Devanagri script (there is an annotate feature which allows students in the class to also write on the professors whiteboard simultaneously  -- it might be good to help new students write the script in class to simulate using the chalkboards in person! )",

The instructors successfully represented both a strong linguistic treatment of the language as well as the experience that linguistic rules are insufficient to convey. The courseload was regular but low, and the word was easily manageable but stayed engaging throughout the semester.",
