Coming in knowing nothing, the class is fast-paced but very engaging and facilitates learning German vocabulary and grammar structure very well. My conversational German grew a lot, but I think the class definitely helped me in my reading and writing of German. Having a native speaker, it was also interesting to talk a bit about culture.",

                "This class was great in facilitating fast learning. With the class being conducted in German, it was sometimes a bit daunting, but it was very helpful in the overall learning process. The class breaks students out of their comfort zone with regards to speaking, allowing them to really challenge themselves and in the long run learn a lot. The asynchronous assignments were not as engaging, but they definitely were helpful in getting a full German education in speaking, reading, writing, and listening. Sometimes, the organization of the class and the class Canvas page made it a little bit challenging to understand assignments and tasks.",

                "I found the model of the course extremely successful. The wide range of assignment formats (video submissions, worksheets, Canvas quizzes, online homework assignments) provided variety and allowed me to learn in a lot of different ways. I found the balance of synchronous and asynchronous learning to be helpful, too, although I would prefer a return to a full week of synchronous classes once in-person classes are possible again.",

                "Yes! I learned more in this semester of German than in years of language courses in high school. It was super engaging, and it's a fun language!",
                "Definitely! I did not know any German coming into 110, which was scary but has made the class super rewarding! The first week was a little intense, but overall the class is paced really well for new German students (not so slow that its boring but not so fast that you miss entire concepts and feel that you have to spend the whole time catching up). If you are undecided about how to get your foreign language requirement done, take German!",
