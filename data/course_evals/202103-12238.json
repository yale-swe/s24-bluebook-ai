As a result, only a couple people (in a section of 20+ students) would actually participate in section, and it just felt a little awkward. It seemed like most people didn't do the reading, but that prevented us from having engaging conversations during section.",
                "Very dense information during lectures at times and I wish the material was taught in a more organized way to depict a timeline. The first half of the class lectures felt disorganized and were oftentimes confusing in regards to time periods.",

                "I thought the incorporation of ancient Egyptian literature into the course was fascinating. Professors Moeller and Manning infused the course with a lot of passion for ancient Egyptian history, which was enjoyable to be a part of. I did have difficulty with the organization of the course. I wish lectures focused more on teaching the narrative of lecture topics and instead focused very heavily on archaeological remains. I often found that I left lecture not knowing very much about the time periods the lectures were meant to cover since we talked more about interpreting remains versus tracking the continuities, changes, and events of the history. The main readings also focused very heavily on the archaeology of ancient Egypt although each chapter began with helpful sections detailing the historical narrative, which was helpful. I typically like to cover the bulk of the content in lecture, using readings and section to supplement the lecture, but in the course (largely in an effort to punish the students who did not attend lecture), the bulk of the content came from the readings with lecture and seminar feeling slightly scrambled with supplementary analysis. I'm very grateful for the robust study guide provided for the final exam because otherwise I would not have known what information to focus on.",

The material itself is fantastic. Anyone who cares about human life and civilization should study Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe main issue with the course is the simple reality that most of the students in the lecture hall don't seem to care about Egypt; why they are in the course, I don't understand. Because the professor were clearly disappointed in the lack of participation, they often asked for volunteers from the classroom to answer questions during lecture. Unfortunately, clearly only a handful of students ever did the reading, so basically only three students ever spoke. \r\n\r\nOne specific note is that the lectures sometimes became so full of archeological specifics that they lost sight of what we are trying to cover during the class.",
                "Strengths are that the material was interesting and engaging. The content was easy to take notes on and easy to understand if you went to class and listened. The Instructors were phenomenal and very understanding and just wanted us to share love and learn. Weaknesses were maybe that it wasn't recorded so if you were sick, you missed out on a lot.",

They tried to make it more discussion style but very little information got taught during those and we have separate discussion sections so there was no need for that.",

Professors Moeller and Manning are fantastic and very passionate about the course content. The content itself is rich and fascinating. However, I thought the structure of the course made it difficult reach the fascinating content. I would want lectures to focus more on the changes, continuities, and events of ancient Egyptian history with archaeological remains used as supplementary content (instead lectures focused primarily on the remains, making it harder to piece together the narrative).",

Sadly, most of the students who take this class are athletes who are just taking this as a gut credit. \r\n\r\nI know it sounds dramatic, but this course truly made me question what Yale stands for as an institution. Why does Yale admit so many students who genuinely seem uninterested in learning? Or are made so busy through sports that they can not make time to learn? Alas. Mostly, I feel sorry for the two professors who are both brilliant people and good teachers.",
