                "I learned to appreciate how much work and time a painting requires.",
                "It gave me a really good foundation to grow from as a painter. Honestly great class, very few complaints.",
                "I was able to learn more about color in this course. I love how we were only given a select color palette to work with, so mixing and thinking through different color relationships was very fun. I also love the different ways we approached painting with a trip to the Peabody, painting from collaged work, a still life, and then having the final project to have more freedom.",
                "I learned, as you might guess, the basics of painting! I learned about the use of different mediums like oil, acrylic, gauche, and why one might choose one over the other. I learned the differences between brush sizes and shapes, and I learned how to use additives to your base paint to achieve different effects. I also learned my own painting style and how to paint faster as the semester went on.",
                "I thought this course was a great way to learn the basics of oil painting. We learned fundamental techniques, and each painting assignment we had built upon our previous assignments and our previous skills. Through the instructor, the environment and critiques this class provides, and the self-learning that naturally happens as you dedicate time to paint, I feel that I have become a more confident painter. The class helped hone my basic art fundamentals, like color mixing, composition, value, mark making, etc. I have also gained basic technical skills regarding oil painting, like how to use solvents and mediums, preparing a surface, glazing, clean up, safety, etc. I think the more I've learned about oil painting, the more I'm realizing how complicated and technical oil painting can get, and I do think the class could go more in depth with some of these things, but I think even as is, it is a really really good introduction into painting, it gets you ready to start painting immediately, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in painting. I feel that I have come out of it with sharper decision making skills when it comes to making a painting. The art critiques that happen in this class were also a great way to learn about how to talk about art, critique art and get inspiration from the work your peers are doing."

                "Strength: I got a lot of personal feedback about my art and what I can do to improve! I also got a lot of guidance about what parts of my paintings worked well which helped me solidify a style.\r\nWeakness: Visiting the YUAG at the beginning/middle of the semester rather than at the end may have been nice.",
                "I loved this class, it was so much fun and I liked how open-ended the assignments were! I think the bird painting assignment was a bit weird though, having stuffed animals staring at us... Also I'd appreciate having more in-class time to work on the assignments",
                "This is a not a \"learn to paint\" or \"teach\" painting. Yes, it is beginner friendly but there's very little \"teaching.\" Or rather the method of teaching is through self-practice more so than step-by-step instruction. This is a strength, but could also be a weakness if you are joining this class to learn how to create compositions, mix colors etc...",
                "It gives a great foundation and is a pleasure to be in. The introductory exercises have a clear purpose, and everyone can benefit from them. By the end of the course, students are well prepared to embark on more individualized projects, although there is plenty of room for individual flexibility through the course. I would say that the class could be improved by having more exercises, like figure drawing, etc, but honestly nothing is stopping students from doing stuff like this if they want to improve lol. A few people actually turned in multiple paintings and individually did things to challenge themselves. I think some more critical feedback could be good, but it's usually available to students who ask for it.",
                "I loved the time dedicated to critiques, I just wish we were encouraged to give more constructive feedback. I think a lot of those seriously interested in art want to learn and are more open to harsher critiques but for the sake of the students not as interested, the critiques were more relaxed and mild which I feel takes away from the learning. I would also like to see more demonstrations and the applications of paint, and even more information on what our materials like canvas boards versus stretched and gessoed canvas provide for our work.",
                "I think a strength AND weakness of this course is  the amount of time spent on each painting. Over the semester, we painted four works, which I feel I was able to contribute enough time to (I would have liked even more time on a couple). Yet, I also would not have minded a few smaller projects as well to exercise skills a little more technically on a smaller scale in between bigger projects. Another strength is the amount of time spent actually painting: most of class time is spent on painting which serves as a nice time where you know you can make progress on course work. The crits also serve as a great, friendly way to get feedback on paintings.",
                "Strengths: beginner friendly, non intimidating environment, friendly environment for people coming from all types of backgrounds. Matt and our TF Haleigh are very knowledgeable about painting and very willing to give feedback, inspiration and artists to look into, direction to go in, etc. They give excellent feedback and give good pointers. I found critique to be approachable, respectful, and very helpful. I thought assignments made sense and built upon each other. I appreciated the open endedness of the final painting assignment, the previous assignments built a strong foundation, and with this final assignment we had a lot of freedom to explore whatever we were interested in and I really liked seeing people's work in the end. In our class, we split critique into two days, and I thought this was a good decision and it gave adequate time for each person's critique and Matt and Haleigh were also very generous if you needed some extra time and wanted to go on the second day for critique. Neutral: We essentially have four main painting assignments that we work on and around 2 to maybe 3 weeks for each painting. I do think this is a reasonable and sensible amount of time, and we got plenty of time to work in class, but if you are a slower painter you just need to plan ahead and manage your time well. There are no major weaknesses that stand out to me, though I think we could have gotten even more technical with some of the painting process even if it's just in passing. For example, I would've liked even more information regarding different surfaces and surface preparation, more info about mediums and solvents, varnishing, etc. But I also know that those stuff can be a bit more advanced and are likely outside of the scope of this class. I think as is, it is still a strong intro painting class."

                "Absolutely! By far the most informative art class I've ever taken. Whether you're just starting out with art or you have a lot of experience, I would definitely recommend this course!",

                "Yes, great elective. But be prepared to learn through doing.",
                "Yes, and you'll get as much out of the class as you put into it.",
                "Yes. Matt is an excellent instructor and the variety of work completed throughout the semester provides a great introduction to painting. However, it's important to note that a lot of the learning happens on your own. The instructors are around during class time, but feedback usually remains pretty general rather than teaching you specific painting techniques. I wouldn't say this is necessarily a weakness, but it does make it important for students to go into the class motivated to explore and experiment.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is mostly studio time which really allows one interested in art to problem solve and experiment with the different assignments we were given.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to another student. I took this course as a STEM major, and I feel like I gained a lot from it. It served as a nice change of pace from pset, exam-based courses. I also believe it was interesting to look at how courses such as this and STEM ones could interact with one another. Before this I had never painted before, and now I find it to be an activity I really enjoy and want to continue practicing.",
                "Yes, would highly recommend regardless if you are an art major, and definitely recommend if you are an art major. Great class to build foundations in painting."
