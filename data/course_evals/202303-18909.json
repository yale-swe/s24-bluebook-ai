In particular this class tended to focus on symbolic solutions to problems in which real-world numbers were never plugged into the equations. This type of symbolic answering taught me to attempt to make sense of my answers such as if the units work out appropriately or the limiting cases. These tools seem very useful for the rest of my study of physics as well as my studies in other analytical courses.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Great professor, interesting problems, good pace, nice focus on problem solving, interesting topics, overall very good course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course definitely requires teaching yourself some physics, which I enjoyed because it meant lectures were more focused on problem-solving and techniques then going through standard physics material.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- TA team was very strong, especially Rose, Sanjana, Nick, and Nikita.  There were a lot of office hours to go to to get help on the psets\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Notes/ lectures were pretty confusing and didn't emphasize the important content enough.  They would work through a bunch of math to get to an equation, but then the equation that we needed to know wasn't super emphasized/ well-explained\r\n- Time-managment of course was rough- we moved very slowly in the beginning, but the course ran too quickly at the end and got to the point that it was nearly incomprehensible\r\n- Notes/ lectures would've benefitted from more examples. Instead of the 1-2 fleeting, sometimes complicated examples for most lectures, it would've been more helpful to see multiple easier, well-worked through examples that actually clarified the content. Also, often on examples, we didn't necessarily cover the answer, which makes the example nearly pointless.  Showing AND explaining examples would've been more helpful",
                "Very informative, albeit slightly redundant",
                "Lectures were very engaging, plenty of office hours which were very helpful",
                "Teaching could be better. TAs are good.",
                "The course covered many topics in a short period of time, which I found to be a great strength. The material was new and refreshing each week, and we spent enough time on each topic so that I had a basic understanding of each. The depth of coverage for each topic varied, since the course assumes prior experience in classical mechanics we spent only a week or two before moving on. I enjoyed the opportunity to be introduced to more advanced topics.\r\n\r\nOffice hours were also an excellent resource. There were plenty of peer tutors at all hours of day, which was extremely helpful for completing problem sets.",
                "The professor evidently spends much time preparing his lectures and although there is preparation well in advance, he still takes the time to update his notes depending on what the class's needs are coming into each lecture.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lectures, some cool demonstrations, you can tell the professor really does care about student understanding.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a LOT of content covered in this class, and it is very, very easy to feel behind, even after missing just one lecture. I don't exactly know how this could be fixed, but it does feel intimidating to figure out how to ask for help and catch up, when you did not catch or understand part of the unit.",
                "Strengths: very interesting content, a cool professor, MANY opportunities to get help at office hours/study halls.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not like that class was taught from slides, because I think for a lot of physics derivations it is hard to follow the flow this way. However, I understand that the amount of content to cover made teaching from the board difficult.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-The lectures by Tipton are very well done; very engaging, and informative. Crucial for a true understanding of the homework and material.\r\n-TA/Office Hours - There are so many peer tutors and office hour times, it is incredible. This was a god-send, and my understanding of the material benefited so much from these opportunities. If you take this class, use the peer tutor and TA office hours, they are great!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Tipton was sometimes a lecture or a half a lecture behind, so it can be jarring to switch from one piece of material to another halfway through class, instead of staying on topic for the whole duration.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, great professor.\r\nWeaknesses: pace was a little fast, and so the topics were not explored in much depth.",
                "The weekly problem sets are a strength of the course.",
                "The course is very well taught. Professor Tiptons slides are very well made and the problem sets complement them well. Professor Tipton is also very understanding about his students and wants them to succeed. The only weakness of the course is that the lectures sometimes gloss over derivations to arrive at the main result, and it is not always clear how much of the information is important since we go through it so fast. Still, the problem sets help with this.",
                "The ULA sessions are extremely useful, and a great opportunity to check your understanding. I found the lectures to be not very clear, with too much focus on the nitty-gritty math and too little on understanding the concepts. It was usually only after reading the textbook that I actually understood what was going on in the lectures.",
                "Well taught with amazing TAs. No major weaknesses.",
                "The course is well taught but sometimes course information is vague and not readily accessible.",
                "The lectures were interesting and the TA instruction was helpful, however it may be useful to make the lecture slides more concise, or to separate derivations from applications, so the information is clearer and easier to absorb.",
                "I think that too much material was covered in too short of a time, without time to properly understand some subjects. The format of the lectures were slides, which were helpful, but I find writing in the board more helpful.",
                "Prof. Tipton is a very engaging lecturer. He is detailed, constantly doing practice problems, constantly checking our understandings, and is very humorous. His grading is always fair, and will adjust for ambiguities or errors in problem sets and exams if need be. We covered a lot of content but it for the most part did not feel rushed. Any extra mathematical background needed was taught very well. The office hours  for this course were the best organized out of all my courses. The times and locations were easily found on the canvas calendar, the location/time changes were swift and always announced, and all the TAs clearly knew the material and helped us extensively. The problem sets were the right length and suitable difficult.\r\n\r\nA few topics were rushed--especially entropy and heat.",
                "Strengths include an elaborate professor, strong supporting network of teaching fellows, and clear directions on homework assignments. Weaknesses could be lectures at a fast pace.",
                "Strengths  many, many resources (teaching assistants, office hours, textbooks and an online lecture series by this course's past instructor). Professor Tipton always seems to be looking out for his students, and you feel supported throughout the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses my situation might be unusual, since my physics background going into this class was weaker than suggested, but the class goes fast and I was often left confused in lecture. This was always remedied by going to office hours or reading on my own, but I would have preferred to have had a more solid understanding in class.",
                "Problem sets are well designed to help you learn, lectures are interesting and material, especially at the end of the semester, is generally engaging. A deeper/clearer explanation of various mathematical derivations for some of the principles would be appreciated.",
                "Overall very good course. Lectures were well-designed, lots of office hours and opportunities to help, fair exams. PSETs were helpful in applying the material but not intended to take days of your life or to leave you doing a ton of algebra, which I thought was perfect.",
                "The lecture style wasn't the most conducive to rapid and complete learning. I think an emphasis on group work with immediately accessible instruction and help could be a better way to teach the material.",
                "strengths: psets were very helpful and similar to test questions, lectures were engaging and integrated practice problems well\r\nweaknesses: a few topics (particularly thermo) were a bit rushed and there wasn't a great focus on the most important concepts; I felt as though I understood it better from what I had learned in AP Physics 2 and if anything was more confused after covering it in class (I ended up falling back on my AP Physics 2 notes and understood everything significantly better by relying on that and ignoring that portion of the lecture)",
                "The latter half of the course felt rushed. Especially since those were the harder topics of the semester, the class was tough for that last month. As for the strengths, this course comes with a lot of support and resources. There are office hours almost every day and the TAs and ULAs are very helpful.",
                "The flow of material is not very logical, and sometimes it is difficult to follow the slides and make connections between different topics. There was always too much text on the slides to read in class, but this was beneficial when I was reviewing the slides on my own after the lecture. The biggest weakness, I would say, is that there was no proper review session before the midterm, where the professor or TFs go through the material. I wish there was a systematised document, like a handout, with all the information summarised before an exam, which the students can fill out in their preparation, for example during the review session. Overall, the course has more strengths than weakness: the peer tutors/TAs are incredible and helped me so much each week, the exams were interesting and truly tested my knowledge of the material and critical thinking, and finally the professor cared about each student so much. Huge thing that helped me learn - the professor had demonstrations of physical phenomena almost every class. All of this made the class really enjoyable. The feedback I received really helped my learning.",
                "Well organized but lectures are sometimes a bit rushed.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tipton is really nice and genuinely cares for his students. While he is not the best lecturer in the world, he makes up for it by making class entertaining and doing his best to engage students. Exams are straightforward, if not a little too easy compared to the PSETs. \r\nWeaknesses: You might sometimes feel like you and the rest of the class have zero clue what is on the lecture slides in front of you. Youll understand eventually, but it is quite painful while it lasts."

                "Yes, but you have to fully commit yourself to this course, especially if you don't have extensive physics background or are not naturally fluent in mathematics. It is challenging, but worth it!",
                "Yes, I think this was a very solid introductory physics class. I would recommend it to anyone interested in physics, and I think it is a good balance: more intellectually challenging than PHYS 170 or 180 (while also having less time-consuming PSets) but not as difficult as PHYS 260.",

It is helpful to have taken a physics class in high school; most students in the class have. The exams are very fair and students generally do well on them. The workload is very reasonable too.",
                "I would recommend this course to students willing to do some work on their own to really understand the material.",
                "Yes! I think this course is the ideal course for someone who enjoyed physics in high school. The course is fast paced with new material that I had not seen in high school. At the same time, it helped me gain a deeper understanding of concepts I was already familiar with.",
                "Yes, I think the material is pretty interesting and applicable as it is physics.",
                "I would recommend this course, as it provides a good overview of introductory physics. However, if the student did not have excellent high school preparation, I would encourage them to take full advantage of course TAs and TFs, as the lectures themselves do not provide complete guidance on every topic.",

                "Yes, it is a very rewarding course.",

                "I would be hesitant to recommend it to another student. Only if it was required for their goals would I encourage them to take it.",
                "yes, really great introduction to college-level physics that built well off of what I learned in AP Physics 1 & 2 (there would probably be less new material if you'd already taken calculus-based physics, but I had not so this course was great for me) that was more interesting that a typical intro-physics course because of the inclusion of special and general relativity",
                "Yes! If you've taken any sort of AP Physics in high school, I would 100% recommend PHYS 200. The topics in this class that go beyond the AP curriculum are quite interesting and fun to learn about.",
