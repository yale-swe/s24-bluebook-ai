                "Strengths: This course is very good at breaking down the research process week by week, and students get regular practice summarizing their topic, writing abstracts, and presenting proposals to outside faculty. Prof. Caldeira and the TAs are all very supportive and willing to help you think through any challenges as they arise throughout the research process! Weaknesses: Sometimes, the weekly workload can feel high; it can be tricky to find a balance between your own research and the required readings for class. Weekly reading responses try to bring them together, but sometimes these two components of the class - core reading and personal research - felt disjointed.",

The course is super helpful breaking down the research process and creating weekly assignments to work towards an abstract, project proposal, and presentation slide deck. The individual time and support you get with Prof. Caldeira and the TAs is also amazing - they are all invaluable resources to help you develop your project.",
