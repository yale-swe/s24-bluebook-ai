   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of the history of the West, (a lot of what is now the US, mostly east of the Mississippi). The course is great at developing overarching themes and presenting history as more than a far past. It connects many ideas to the present day and how we still view the West and different aspects of it.",
    "I learned about Western history from approximately the beginning of European colonization to the present day, but the course doesnt cover every bit of that time frame  we focused on themes and stories in general. Although Ive taken American history classes before, this didnt feel redundant -- theres a heavy emphasis on Indigenous history in particular.",
    "This course teaches you not only about the history of \"The West,\" but also how to question what \"history\" and \"The West,\" as concepts and courses of study, even mean. There was an obvious emphasis on critical thinking and recognition of cultural-biases, and it was absolutely fascinating to examine what the American West as a concept means to me (from a stereotyped, Clint-Eastwood-influenced point of view) in relation to what it might have actually been like.",
    "During the course, I learned of a new way to look at the American West that we know today and redefined what is the American West. The course gave us new insight into the ways we look at the West and the stories we read about the West to better know the characters involved. It will help me better look at the US today and understand the issues that have been prevalent over the past few centuries and remain today.",
    "I learned how to rethink history through the lens of what is said and unsaid in the written history of the American West."

   "comments": [
    "I loved the small class size and the way it felt like such an intimate class, even though we were technically in a lecture. The professor was amazing and always made all of us understand the weight of the material while still teaching it in an engaging fashion.",
    "The course was so fascinating, and I loved how each lecture felt more like a story about different groups or individuals than a dry representation of historical facts. It was somewhat difficult to tell what was expected of me on the midterm, but I felt incredibly prepared for the final!",
    "Professor Ross was a very engaging lecturer. The class size was small so we were able to better engage with him and the material. The stories which he told were interesting. \r\n \r\nIt could be improved if sometimes the lectures were better tied together.",
    "Fantastic lecturer and interesting material. No weaknesses."

    "Definitely! I absolutely loved this course. One of my favorite at Yale!",
    "Yes, take this class!! Prof. Ross is a really excellent & engaging lecturer. The course assignments are fun & the grading is fair.",
    "Yes! I think this course does an excellent job at reevaluating how we understand and tell western history. I think this course, with its re-examining of stories and tropes used in telling Western US history, should be a must for American Studies students, since these stereotypes underlie most of US history. Professor Ross also does an excellent job at bringing in parts of Western history students may not know much about or the points of view students may not know.",
    "Absolutely! This course is fun and really important, especially if you've spent most of Yale so far avoiding classes on critical-thinking. The workload isn't insane, and professor Ross is very engaging.",
    "Yes",
    "Most definitely. If you are at all interested in the history of the American West or just American history itself, take this course. It's amazing how much the West has influenced the rest of the US\/greater North America as a whole.",
    "Absolutely. Fantastic and well taught course in a subject matter we think we know but often do not.",
    "Professor Ross always makes the content interesting and engaging!"
