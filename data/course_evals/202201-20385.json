                "Unfortunately, I had a lot of issues with this course. I felt as though I was not provided proper guidance. I was not well aided when it came to narrowing down my research scope, finding and analyzing primary sources, and structuring my paper. I often felt that I was going at this alone and would have preferred more rigorous guidance and instruction. \r\n\r\nI think there should be a mandatory pass/fail course for junior history majors called \"Methods in Historical Research,\" where we learn about how to access and analyze archival sources, how to gather the right secondary sources, and how to structure and execute the senior essay (with reference to past successful and less successful examples). I felt incredibly unprepared for this project and feel like such a course would have greatly prepared me.",
                "the strength is gitlin and his weakness is ...... impossible to find",
                "The senior essay helped me to learn how to independently work on a long-term project and engage in archival research. As someone who was visiting physical archives in another state, at times some of the internal deadlines felt arbitrary, as I was asked to turn in drafts based on documents I hadn't yet read, or turn in work that I had to go out of my way to complete.",
                "Strengths: Because of the intensive research you do and the time you spend on your material, you end with a deep understanding of your topic. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We had five week between the draft and the submission, and I believe that a deadline should have been imposed on the advisors too. If the draft is submitted on time, then the advisor should be required to send comments in 2 weeks so that students can then have time for another round of edits/discussion with their advisor. Because there is no clarity on what the expectations from professors is, they can give feedback whenever which left me with very little time to edit.",
                "The hardest part of writing the senior thesis was how little the History major prepared me to do so. I have loved my time in the History major at Yale, but the many History junior seminars I took (four, and I got As in all of them) absolutely did not prepare me for the kind of original research and writing I needed to conduct to write a successful senior essay. It was thus incredibly stressfully to produce primary-source-based work of a caliber and length never required of me until the moment it mattered the most.",
                "Strengths: finishing a draft early and finishing the entire thesis early\r\nWeakness: very little guidance, very rushed writing process, very poorly advised",
                "The milestone assignments did not feel very helpful or realistic. There should be more of an emphasis on creating an individualized accountability system between each professor and their advisee rather than that which is imposed by these assignments.",
                "Fulfilling experience.",
                "The Senior Essay is the perfect opportunity to learn the hard skills of historical research and writing before graduating. It was an essential part of my college learning process, and I am deeply grateful to have had the chance to work on a single passion project for an entire year.",
                "In general, the senior essay is what you make of it. The only weaknesses were the milestone assignments, particularly in the first semester, that I thought distracted more than they contributed to my research.",
                "This was a phenomenal opportunity and I have no suggestions.",
                "Disconnect between advisor and reader -- would be nice if they graded together. None of the issues pointed out by my reader were anything brought up by my advisor and based on the comments it appeared that my reader did not read all sections of the essay super closely"

If you do not like extensive independent reading and writing you should choose another major such as political science with a much lighter thesis requirement. If you do like to read, write, and work independently, then this course can be a very rewarding - but highly stressful - experience. I highly suggest taking advantage of funding to travel to an archive for research.",

Having the time to really think out my topic and do lots of research was great.  It is the biggest academic endeavor I have ever undertaken and I am so happy I did it.  Plus, the two semester senior essay allows you to receive distinction in the major."
