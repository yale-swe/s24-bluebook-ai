                "In-depth knowledge of nucleic acid biochemistry & prokaryotic/eukaryotic genetics",
                "This class was really beneficial for developing my critical thinking skills about work in scientific research. This class had a strong emphasis not on just the scientific facts, but understanding the research that worked in discovering these facts. We worked a lot in breaking down research figures to come to these conclusions on our own, which was something I had not worked on extensively before. It was good to take our scientific fact to apply in a conceptual manner in understanding how to conduct research.",

                "Insight into the details of how different processes work at a molecular level",
                "This course is a good, relatively in-depth introduction to nucleic acid biochemistry.  The course is pretty well organized (first section focuses on prokaryotes, second on eukaryotes, with a variety of other topics sprinkled in). The density of information and application/experiment-based exams helped me improve my study techniques since there was too much information to just memorize without a deeper understanding of it. Even spending the whole semester on nucleic acids, it was clear there was a lot of complexity we didn't have time to get to, so this course piqued my interest in upper-level biology electives that will take a closer look at some of the topics introduced in 301.",
                "Learned a lot about bacteria, genetics, phages, DNA/RNA, transcription and translation in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. There is always history about the experimental techniques used to discover these processes and there was definitely a lot of data interpretation and analysis. This course taught me to think critically about the information and data presented and how they support or contradict ideas. This course was overall a great way to end the biochem sequence since it brought together many ideas presented in previous bio, chem, and mbb300.",
                "I learned in-depth about prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular processes (with a focus on the central dogma) and perhaps more importantly, how to critically analyze key experiments involving the discovery of these processes.",
                "Good understanding of genomic and cellular processes",
                "I learned to think critically about experiments and mechanisms in genetics and molecular biology. During the course, we studied numerous famous experiments and setups that elucidated valuable findings in biochemistry, going beyond the principles established from the experiments and studying the historical context (what people knew or thought), the goals and initial hypotheses, and evidence that changed our understanding of the topics.",

                "Strengths: Really interesting and useful content, well organized, professors were all great.\r\nWeaknesses: Switched from quizzes being online and due the day after lecture to being due at the end of class.",
                "I found the information given in an odd order. There were many topics that were taught at the beginning but at a surface level, then further detail was given later in the semester. It was hard to follow which topics related to which. I think it is easier to learn when we are told what the goal of learning is and then go from specifics to broader sections to tie everything together.",
                "strength: layout of lectures is really well done\r\nweakness: it is a memorization course",
                "The big weakness of the class was in the PSETS, in which I felt we had little direction in doing them, and were told somewhat vague statements about what was deemed correct, but the PSET grading did not reflect those statements. So sometimes, I felt like I did not really understand what the PSETS were trying to get at in terms of the content of the class.",
                "Organized lectures and knowledgeable teaching staff\r\nIt could be improved by recording lectures and releasing them at the end of the semester-- the lack of leniency on this specific policy really bothered me, I would understand why instructors are not inclined to release lectures on a weekly basis to maintain attendance. Still, it would have been loads helpful if they were even recorded at all and released at the beginning of the reading period",
                "Style of teaching of each of the instructors was very different so it felt like student learning and engagement fluctuated with each instructor. But overall the content was very interesting and you gain a deep knowledge and appreciation of biochemistry!",
                "One of the weaknesses was that it wasn't recorded, which made reviewing hard especially because lectures went fast and it was easy to miss something the instructors said",
                "The problem sets were not reflective of the depth that the exams required and the review sessions could have used some more structure. \r\n\r\nThe principles of the course were very good and I feel that I learned a lot and became a better scientist.",
                "Strengths: Course material lectures were well explained and tests were fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it was unclear when we were expected to memorize information vs. understand a topic conceptually. Given the sheet amount of content, this added stress at times to memorize terms that later proved useless.",
                "A strength was that was pretty well organized. A weakness was that they wouldn't release answer keys on homework assignments or quizzes so it was more difficult to get feedback sometimes.",
                "Strengths: very in depth course material, all the topics meshed very well together, and by the end of the course I had a very good understanding of the central dogma of molecular biology. The professors also taught really well and did a great job breaking down many of the topics.\r\nWeaknesses: I think that having more review materials would be nice, going into the final was hard because of it. It was hard to prepare for exams because there were so few example problems.",
                "Especially in the beginning of the course, we learned a lot not just about what has been discovered about DNA/RNA/transcription/translation/etc., but also got to discuss experimental techniques that generated the knowledge we have today, which I think is useful for research, which a lot of students in the class are interested in. There was so much detail in some of the lectures that when it got to the final, it was difficult to know exactly how much detail we needed memorized, but the term sheets were helpful and I think all of the exams were fair. There are a lot of application questions and questions that ask you to interpret experimental data, but you still need to have a good handle on details from lecture to make these applications.",
                "I sometimes had a hard time understanding what instructors were saying in class and they move at a very fast pace, so if you get lost or distracted, it is game over for that lecture. TAs were not quite as helpful as the ones in mbb300, but they do try and help you but it's usually pretty limited help. I highly recommend going to the peer tutors for help on anything! They were amazing and explained things in a simple and understandable manner and were always so eager to help us out. I believe having more structured TA review sessions would benefit the course a lot. I attended the first few TA sessions but found them to be not super useful or structured so I ended up not attending them.",
                "Strengths are the great teaching/lectures (using creative visual aids and available office hours). Weaknesses were the TF review sessions (which solely involved reading from the slides), lack of monitoring/use of Ed, and very particular exam questions that sometimes seemed to test memorization rather than mastery of the lecture key concepts.",
                "Strengths: Christian is a cool professor, when experiments are explained well, lectures are interesting\r\nWeaknesses: hard to differentiate what facts important to know vs what concepts, tests overemphasize facts over concepts, never quite sure what to study, overly stressful",
                "The course is content-heavy but also well-taught and fairly graded. There is a heavy emphasis on interpreting biological data and developing conclusions from this data, which I believe is the proper standard in biochemistry instruction. However, I disagree with the instructors' decision to stop recording lectures, a practice they had ever since the pandemic, as I think this only hinders learning. I also disagree with the instructors' decision to not upload correct quiz answers in order to foster attendance. Sometimes, people have to miss class for a reason (like sickness), and having the quiz answers after would help them catch up with missed content.",
                "Strength: generally very interesting material in lectures\r\nWeaknesses: too much info, could feel overwhelming for exams. Part of that was that the p-sets were a bit short -- not comprehensive enough to give you working knowledge of that week's material",
                "Strength - SO much!! I loved this class, particularly for developing the critical thinking skills relating to experiments / research.",
                "Strengths: MB&B 301 teaches you a lot of biochemsitry for sure. The lecture slides are very comprehensive and the professors are very knowledgeable and approachable. Weaknesses: Some of the questions on the exams test you on the smallest details from the lecture slides and are impossible to answer correctly, even if you have a good understanding of the overall concepts from the course. This doesn't seem conducive to learning and makes this course more stressful than necessary.",
                "I really didn't like how partway through the semester, the quizzes (which were every day of class) all had to be taken in person. Even worse, we students were never corrected or given feedback on the quizzes (each was worth 1 point and graded based on completion). Since the quiz information appeared on exams and in the weekly psets, it would have been helpful to at least know what the correct answers were and, better yet, how to solve the questions correctly. Also, at office hours, the graduate TAs often were confused or explained answers incorrectly, which made this already difficult course so much harder."

                "I would recommend this second term of biochem even if you are not in the MB&B major as the course content provides important fundamental knowledge on DNA and RNA.",
                "Not unless you have to take it for the MB&B major, it was not as nice as 300 was.",
                "MB&B majors have to take this course, but as an MCDB major who chose to take MB&B300/301 instead of MCDB300, I would recommend it. It is definitely more in-depth than the MCDB course, and while I personally did not like the first semester, MB&B300, 301 was a really valuable course and made it worth it to me to have taken the full-year MB&B sequence. MB&B300 covers all of metabolism, carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, so it was more surface-level and felt rushed at times, but 301 is completely focused on nucleic acids, so I felt like we learned at a much deeper level. If you are just looking to get the major requirement for MCDB done, MCDB300 may be easier, but I think the MB&B sequence is worth the extra work.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed this course, even more so than mbb300. It was a great synthesis of previous material from a variety of stem classes.",
                "Unless you have to take this class for your major, definitely do not take this class! There are better biochem classes offered at yale and some\r\ncombination of other classes will super set the knowledge youll gain here",
                "Yes, this is an excellent class and a much better (in my opinion) continuation to MB&B 300, changing the focus from memorizing specific facts and mechanisms (my view on 300) to studying experiments and developing a data analysis-driven approach to biology in general.",
                "I would recommend this course if someone is really interested in detailed accounts of the biochemical processes involving DNA & RNA. Note that this class requires a lot of study. It can be easy to be fooled by the light p-sets, but the midterms were kind of beastly.",
                "YES! I mean, you'd have to take this class anyways for MB&B, but even if you're not in the major, I highly recommend taking it if you want to learn more about DNA/RNA.",
                "Yes because it teaches you a lot of biochemistry and the professors are very knowledgeable. However, be aware that you need to study each lecture in great depth and that the course is very challenging.",
                "If you don't have to take this class for MB&B or as a pre-med, don't do it unless you're truly passionate about the subject!"
