                "The textbook was helpful and I appreciated how closely Prof. Kalla followed along with the readings he assigned. The labs were great for practicing analyzing real experimental data in R. I enjoyed the guest lecture at the end of the semester. I think it would be nice if in future Zoom or in person semesters, the professor offered open office hours where students could learn from each others' questions, instead of only having hours by appointment.",
                "I liked that the class was a seminar, it felt very intimate and engaging. The problem sets were helpful to understand the material we were learning in class. I wish we had been given some more guidance as to what the midterms would look like, but I think Professor Kalla did a good job at preparing us for them.",
                "Strength - professor\r\nWeakness - challenging midterms, but such is life.",
                "A strength of this course was the Professor. Kalla and Drew are very knowledgeable in this field and explained everything very well. A way this course could improve is improving the quality of the psets. I sometimes felt like the psets did not correlate with what we were learning. (Theres 5 in total)",
                "Great course, I learned a lot about the subject materials and the group project was rewarding.",
                "Strengths: The people! Professor Kalla and Drew (TF) created a classroom environment that was very open and welcoming to people with varying statistical and R skill backgrounds. Classmates were also engaging and the material was fascinating. There were also clear expectations set on how to participate, turn in assignments, and engage with the class material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The midterm exams were a bit rough because we were still getting used to having a time restriction on what we were doing during class, lab, and homework without a time limit.",
                "Overall, the class was very engaging and accommodating in this hectic semester. A final project instead of a final exam was a good touch to show us how field experiments work in the real world. In terms of weaknesses, I think there could be a little more connection between the problem sets and what we see in class. The lectures and discussion were very theory-based and qualitative while the problem sets were very calculation-heavy. I know this may not be the intention of the course, but I would want to see the problem sets be more of a reflection of what's taught in the lectures, based on analyzing experiments qualitatively (this is coming from a math nerd).",
                "This is a very well taught and useful course. The lectures and slides were very clear and Professor Kalla and the TA Drew did a great job at answering questions.",
                "Strengths: I like that it is a seminar-sized class (20ish people) even though most instruction is in a lecture-style format. It allows for more individualized attention as well as a more tightly-knit class, which is useful for collaboration and such. The labs were a great way to solidify knowledge of the concepts that we learned in class, as well as give us a chance to work closely together and learn from each other; I especially appreciated this because of the virtual nature of this semester. The PSets were a bit difficult earlier in the semester, but appropriately adjusted in difficulty later on, and I appreciated that Prof. Kalla dropped our lowest grade. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could have used more information the midterm exam beforehand, though it was curved well in the end",
                "I loved that this course was a seminar: it really allowed every student to understand the different components of the course. I also appreciated how the prof and TA were so available to help and support students, and in-class labs really helped us learn how to apply techniques from lecture, and made the course much more interactive, On the opposite end, Psets were definitely a challenge (though there were only 5 of them total). The strengths, though, definitely out-weighted the weaknesses. A great course, and the prof did a terrific job of adapting it to the virtual world!",
                "I thought the class was impeccably run. Prof Kalla was organized, gave good lectures, and was very available outside of class.",
                "Strengths: Lectures closely followed the textbook. Problem sets were appropriately challenging. Interesting concepts and cases. Good pace, and COVID-flexible. Group final project instead of final exam.\r\nWeakness: Midterm exams were difficult to complete in the time allotted, but grades were curved nicely."

Overall, a terrific course online (probably just as good in person).",

However, while lab breakout rooms fostered some discussion between students, most of the time was spent coding individually, and the labs were often too long to finish in time."
