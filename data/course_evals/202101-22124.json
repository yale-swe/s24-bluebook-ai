                "Strengths: There is a lot of material and the course makes sure that people with no music background will have a solid foundation after the course. The workload is reasonable with a couple of worksheets about the lecture material every week, then some quizzes, a midterm, and final. Weaknesses: The class moves fairly quickly and is cumulative, so you need to fully understand the concepts before being able to understand the next.",
                "I think the seminar format is great because you get to talk about and try out each new skill that youre learning in music theory with a small number of people. I think however that sometimes the course work required more from you than was possible at the time and it was frustrating."

                "Yes, but be prepared to work hard in the beginning to develop a strong foundation for later in the course. The concepts build on each other, so if you don't understand the first few weeks, the later portion will be very hard. Music is sort of mathy, so also be prepared to struggle a bit if you have a very humanities-leaning brain like I do. (It's not hard math, just concepts that don't come intuitively to me.) In addition, music theory is interesting but not super applicable to anything unless you want to major in Music or make your own music, neither of which I plan to do, so the knowledge I gained feels a bit useless. That being said, it was still super interesting, and if I hadn't taken it I would've always wondered what music theory is. So I'm glad I took it and do recommend it to others.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. Even if you have no background in music, it is worth it to learn about notes, rhythms, harmonic analysis, which allows you to listen to music with a new perspective.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to anyone whos ever been even remotely interested in how music is constructed. Even though the course focused on classical music mostly, I found myself being able to understand the things that were happening in the music that I listen to and that was cool."
