                "Strengths: \r\nvery low-pressure environment allows for students to learn in their own right and really find the course material fascinating; Tim's knowledge and personal experience with materials in architecture from literal atoms to historical movements; allows students to guide their own learning and explore independently what they want to do for midterm and final precedent study\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\ncovid restrictions put a dampener on our introduction to welding, glass, bamboo; an otherwise noble effort to free students of any requirements\/biases on what to do for their midterm and final projects led to an unnecessary and frustrating lack of communication, logistics, and financial support in buying materials",
                "Strength: great professor and very nice TA; the in-person labs were very fun and it was especially exciting because we actually build things in person; \r\n\r\nWeakness: Could be better during a non-Covid time; the final project (which constitutes the majority of our grade) had very little guidance (which can be good or bad) but for me it was a bit stressful because I wanted a more clear direction.",
                "Strengths of this course was the hands-on approach to learning about building materials in architecture. The in-person labs were successfully done and were both fun and educational. The only weakness in this course was the ambiguous precedent study, but this was intentionally vague in order for the most creative approaches to flourish, which I think was accomplished. I wish we were able to do welding, but according to COVID-19 safety guidelines and EHS guidelines, we were unable to do such."

                "Yes! Take this course especially if you are looking for a 5th class. It is fun, unique, and will give you a chance to learn about something completely different from your major requirement. The COVID edition in-person lab was still very fun but I wish I could have done some labs that got cancelled due to COVID guidelines. The Prof and the TA are both very nice and understanding. Prof Newton definitely cares about your well being and makes sure that this class would not give extra stress for you.",

                "I would HIGHLY recommend this course to another student, even if you're like me and not an architecture major. This is one of the few classes that is actually hands-on, and you get to BUILD things! It provided me with a new confidence in building things, and reinvigorated my creative side. I cannot recommend this course enough to every student (but smaller classes definitely benefit the best)."
