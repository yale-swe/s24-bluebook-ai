                "This class is extremely disorganized, almost to a ridiculous extent. I enjoyed lecture mostly because Professor Jaynes is a character and tells good stories. The grading of the assignments is also arbitrarily harsh and didn't make very much sense.",
                "The professor is great and the material is engaging. There are no weaknesses to this course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Jaynes is FANTASTIC, the reading are interesting, the lectures were engaging. Great class!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think there was too much focus on the specifics of mathematical models. They were brought up in class as if the class all had a strong background in them, which left those without experience confused. Understanding the math behind these studies was interesting, but the deep dive also took focus away from their implications\/effects on the world.",
                "Prof. Jaynes lectured using slides and had supplementary reading summaries. It was helpful but often times the lectures were dry and hard to focus in",
                "I think this class was interesting but it was difficult to follow in a virtual environment. It felt a little bit disorganized. I do appreciate the flexibility the professor provided during covid",
                "There are only weaknesses. The class was poorly organized, the lectures did not make sense (there was also no point in having the lectures be \"mandatory attendance\"), the homework grading was late and super harsh (for no reason). The assignments had the worst instructions ever and such hard maximum page limits -- which was all supposed to be done in groups. Literally terrible.",
                "In general, the notes on canvas and the lectures were clear and concise\r\n\r\nThe assignments didn't alway reinforce the harder, theoretical concepts (i.e. tax and wealth) taught in class. A pset on that would have helped",
                "strengths: interesting material\r\nweaknesses: sometimes it felt repetitive; the professor completely changed the grading distribution in the last week of the course.",
                "Weakness:\r\nThis course is extremely subjective. Most assignments are graded based on whether or not you repeated what the Professor wants to hear, rather than if you formed a coherent argument. Slightly disagreeing with the viewpoint of the lecture\/Professor usually results in points taken off for arbitrary reasons. When asked why points were taken off, the TAs usually cannot explain why. \r\nThere are group projects, but unless you have a great group prepare to do all if not most of the work. Despite requiring us to write down what each member contributed, there is no accountability and the same grades are assigned to everyone regardless of contribution.\r\nStrength:\r\nThe TAs were very responsive when emailed about questions regarding the assignments.",
                "I thought it could have been more structured and clearly mapped out to give some overall direction.",
                "Sometimes the lectures felt a bit unorganized.  Additionally, the lecture slides were not posted on canvas and it would've been nice to have a look at the slides before or after the lecture for review.",
                "Great lecturer who is really understanding but super disorganized with assignments and whats expected in them",
                "This course is very disorganized and the grading seems kind of arbitrary to me. When I asked for a rubric on how assignments are graded, I was told there wasnt one. I would have appreciated more guidance and direction in the course. The group assignments were also a mess because there wasnt really a way to communicate who did what work  definitely left me feeling frustrated because no matter how it was divided, everyone got the same grade.\r\n\r\nI liked that Professor Jaynes provided lecture notes that outlined each class quite well.",
                "The sections felt a bit forced, grading could be made more clear.",
                "The strength of this course is that it is quite low work load while still teaching students that care about the material a lot. It could be improved in its organization.",
                "This class is on a fascinating topic and I found Professor Jaynes to be an engaging lecturer, however, this course is extremely disorganized. Throughout the semester the syllabus changed four times (some of which was just said in class for a minute and then moved on). One of the last times it was changed was on the last day of classes, giving us quite literally no time to improve our performance in the class except for the final. The assignments were also very unclear. The prompts were not straightforward, but no rubric was provided. And all of the assignments were graded very harshly (the average for the first assignment was a 75). Lastly, most of the work in the class is done in group projects. This means writing 5 -10 pg essays in group projects, which was an extremely frustrating and challenging project. All in all this course needs a massive overhaul in its structure in order to improve -- have a clear syllabus from the get go, clear rubric for each assignment, and make group assignments minimal.",
                "Very poorly organized for learning. Lecture notes on top of a synchronous lecture on top of readings and homework assignments. The syllabus was changed several times throughout the semester",
                "The biggest weakness of this course is the group projects. Especially in the middle of a pandemic, and in a class that many students take with the Credit\/D\/Fail option, introducing group homework as well as a group final project (which counted for 40% of the grade) was destined to fail. Students were in very different circumstances and had varying incentives to do well on the group assignments which led to extreme difficulty for those who were trying to coordinate the group and get a decent grade."
