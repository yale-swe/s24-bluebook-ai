                "I would recommend! Take a look at the syllabus for the book list, but the Dictator Novel is a really great subject and the Professor Echevarria really is an expert; it is a great privilege to learn from him, and he is very patient with the undergrads. An undergrad can totally take this course and get a huge amount from it. I will say, it is best to take with a friend; we pooled notes afterwards and it really helped us an enormous amount. Also, make a note of the reading; the syllabus says around 100pages of reading per week. It is often far more than that; it is one novel for every two weeks, and the novels ranged from 250 pages to over 500 pages in length, meaning the reading was always more than that. That said, it is totally worthwhile! Several of the books have audiobooks, which I found helped me a lot to listen as I read."
