                "Strengths: Texts are fantastic and overall umbrella course is one of the best introductions to the Western canon one could get.\r\nWeaknesses: A little too fast, also if lecture notes and paragraphs were given as files on Canvas that would be helpful.",
                "Regarding essays: Professor Kreiner gives you the tools to improve on essays, whether that's by offering many office hour slots or the opportunity to revise an essay at the end of the semester. However, his essay feedback regarding logic and precision can be difficult to evaluate; I often ran pieces of evidence or theses I planned to discuss by writing tutors and my incorporation and discussion of them in my essays would still fall short of Professor Kreiner's standards. This is not a weakness, but rather something to keep in mind going into the course because Professor Kreiner's office hours are often the only way to receive guidance on essays that will reliably improve your writing for his class. On the other hand, Professor Kreiner's discussion sections were excellent; in literature more than other DS subjects, students often have to cover entire texts, and Professor Kreiner does a good job of explaining the important themes and concepts that distinguish each one. Also, discussion sections were pretty lively and often funny, which I appreciate.",
                "Strengths: \r\n-good books \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-as with every DS course, I think the reading load is too high, and creates a really strange & stressful environment where no one can read everything, the professors know this, and yet we all have to pretend as if everyone has read everything, like some twisted game"

                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in reading plays and epic poems from Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. The different texts we read led to interesting discussions that I might not have participated in otherwise. I would also recommend this course to anyone who wants to challenge themselves and improve their writing skills.",
                "The DS Literature course, yes! This particular section I would not necessarily recommend, however, I think it still has its own merits and a student can still have a good semester in this section."
