                "I think that the wording of the questions for the midterms can be ambiguous at times. The wording of the question will fail to suggest the full extent of detail necessary for the correct answers. At times, I felt I was losing points I would have gotten had I known the question was really asking.",
                "This course was taught very well and had different resources. I wish there was more than just the 3 exams in the gradebook, though.",
                "Prof Hatzios is an incredible prof. Her lectures are engaging and provide relevant info to other lectures and current issues. She also provided the online recordings that were so helpful in reviewing the material and rewatching concepts that I didn't understand the first time she taught them in class. Extremely helpful",
                "I LOVED this course! The content was so amazing! Both Professor Hatzios and Professor Yan were wonderful, and it was a please to work with, and study with, them this year!",
                "This course is low workload which is both a strength and weakness as you don't really consolidate the material as well. The class tends to go a bit fast in the first half with Yan but then slows down with Hatzios. The material is interesting but for tests you just have to cram memorize the material which is neither useful nor fun. Definitely interesting content tho. Discussion questions during lecture are useful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hatzios, lecture content was sometimes interesting, relatively low workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: inconsistent grading (TAs took off points randomly, grading felt very subjective, no explanations given), unfair exams, no psets so each exam counted for a large percentage of the final grade, poor feedback, TAs unhelpful, poor test prep",
                "Honestly the best class I have taken in MCDB. The professors are incredibly nice, the content is so interesting, and the midterms are fair. The only thing I would say is that the grading sometimes might not make the most sense, but still, thats isolated cases and it doesnt affect the final grade since the class is graded on a curve. You should definitely take it! Best bio class ever.",
                "Strengths: Both professors were wonderful. Professor Yan is so clearly passionate and excited about the material he covered. It was great to learn from him. Professor Hatzios is probably one of the best lecturers I have had during my time at Yale. She (this is so crazy!) remembers everyone's name in the class -- she calls on students by name. She promotes discussion in class and she was always so organized and clear. Overall, the teaching in this class was great and the material covered was exactly what I feel I had signed up for. \r\nWeaknesses: This course required a lot of memorization (as is unfortunately the case for many biology courses). I did not particularly enjoy sitting down and cramming facts into my head days before the exam. I don't think this added much to my learning experience either. I wish that the exams were a bit less focused on memorizing facts. I also was not a fan of the fact that the only grades in this course are exams. There are two midterms and one final and that is it. To add to this, you do not know what grade you will get because the final grades are curved, and the professors give no indication of where each student stands with regard to the curve. I think problem sets, quizzes, case studies, or projects would be helpful in this class -- to encourage us to review the material outside of just exams and also to allow us different opportunities for learning.",
                "The course material is really interesting and the slides are very helpful. Sometimes it is hard to discern which concepts are more important than others, so having something to help guide that may benefit future students.",
                "I think homework would definitely help keep me on track in terms of studying. Both professors were very knowledgable but not knowing your grade was kind of nerve wracking.",
                "This course has a lot of support with tons of office hours and TAs which is amazing. However, I wish they gave more practice problems throughout the course for optional homework. It feels like you're taking in a lot of information, but not practicing applying it enough throughout the course which makes the tests difficult.",
                "Strengths: TA office hours to supplement learning\r\nWeaknesses: exams completely determine your grade.",
                "This course was well taught in lecture, but not as much opportunity to discuss papers.",
                "professor hatzios",
                "Not many opportunities to evaluate my understanding. I would have liked like psets of some sort. Also, the grades being entirely dependent on the exams was stressful",
                "This course was well organized for student learning.",
                "This class was really interesting! Both professors were very engaging and care deeply about the content and their students. Throughout the course, I always felt comfortable asking questions and felt like I was learning both the basics and cutting edge techniques. I think the exams were a bit nitpicky. Sometimes a piece of information that had been said once would be tested even if it wasnt on the slides, making the exams feel overwhelming even if you had studied a lot. This was also compounded by the fact that sometimes questions wanted more information than directly asked for, so you could lose points even if you answered the basis of the question asked. It might be helpful to have a bit more proofreading on the exam just to confirm that it is clear what information is wanted.",
                "Not very explanatory in lecture",
                "Second half of the course could contain more detailed/technical content",
                "Strengths: Interesting content, peer tutor support, organized\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of assignments, not even optional assignments, only lectures and midterms",
                "I loved the course on the whole. I do wish wr spent longer on non-bacteria microbes",
                "Strength is the range of topics including touches of pharmacology, transmission, and classification.  Weakness is no indication of progress between exams.",
                "Some of the content on the exams was not the content emphasized in class, but otherwise a good class.",
                "Having textbook readings to assist with lecture learning. Chapters were provided but specific page ranges would have been more helpful.",
                "The level of engagement with the students was high and all the lectures were dynamic and interesting.",

                "Yes, its definitely a great bio option. Low workload but still very interesting with engaging lectures and discussion questions. Tests can be annoying as for most of the questions you just have to memorize what's on the slides. If you're a good test taker, this will be an easy good grade, otherwise you're in trouble.",
                "If you really have to take it. This was my first MCDB core class, so I don't have much to compare it to. The workload was relatively low for most of the semester since we only have exams, but a lot of time was spent studying for each exam because they were difficult. Grading was harsh, so this might not be an easy A, if that is what you are looking for.",
                "YES TAKE IT! Even if you are just remotely considering it. It is such an interesting class, with so many applications. Concepts are introduced as they come up, so even if you dont have a strong biology background, you should do well. Just go for it, and interact with the professors, they are so knowledgeable and nice!",
                "I would recommend this course to an MCDB or MB&B major who is interested in biology and microbiology. The material covered is very solid and you will come out of this course having learned about microbio.",

                "yes",
                "If this student is interested in the microbiome that surrounds us at all times, I would recommend this course.",
                "I think this is a good required MCDB class! If you are interested in the content, the lectures are really fascinating and there isnt a lot of busy work so its easier to balance with other courses. There is a decent amount of studying required for exams, and since they are the only thing contributing to your grade, they can be kind of stressful. Overall, however, the teaching team is really knowledgeable and interested in what they are teaching, making it a fun class.",
                "Yes, microbio is an important and cool topic!",
                "Yes, if the content is of interest and you are ok with your grade only being based on 3 midterm exams.",
                "Highly recommend to anyone interested in microbes! Do be warned that around 90% of the course is on only bacteria, though",
                "Great course before bio or medical grad school.  Not if just interested in the topic.",
                "Yes if you're interested in the logistics of scientific research.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, especially those genuinely interested in biology and microbiology. This course is extremely well taught. It is highly self-driven though.",
