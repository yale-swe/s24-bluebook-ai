                "By taking this course, I developed as a constructive essay critic and I became a more careful writer. I learned to spot in others' essays what works and what doesn't, and I learned to incorporate this knowledge into my own work.",
                "I learned about essay writing on a technical level by reading published essays, workshopping essays written for the class, and writing essays of my own. More specifically, I thought a lot about distinguishing a writer's voice, structuring information clearly and cogently, and using the form of an essay to explore a question.",
                "I learned what it means to write essays as opposed to other forms of writing. I also learned how to improve my writing generally, and how to explore ideas meaningfully.",
                "I developed a keener eye for what makes a strong essay and a greater sense of where I can improve as an essay writer. The weekly discussions of our readings every week were amazing ways to dissect essays we thought were great/poor. I am not an English major, so this weekly exercise was incredibly helpful in improving my own ability to critically assess what makes an essay good, bad, and everything in between. The in-class peer-reviews of our essays in the class were also instrumental in my own development as a writer. I can now better spot the strengths and weaknesses of my own prose thanks to the detailed peer feedback I got on three of the five essays I wrote."

            "comments": [
                "This course is wonderful as it is. A potential area of improvement is changing the course book. As a class, we didn't like most of the essays in this book, so it felt like we were reading more bad essays than good ones. While we can certainly learn from both, it'd be more interesting to read a balance of the two. It would also be helpful to have a syllabus.",
                "Strengths: you get to write often and get really helpful feedback; weaknesses: class setup was weird in that discussions weren't really actual discussions",
                "Strength was that you're forced to write a lot, so you'll improve as a writer. Weakness was that everybody was required to speak during workshop, which meant if you didn't want to repeat what everybody else had already said, you'd zoom in on an insignificant part of the workshopped essay and kind of make something up. Not constructive. Biggest weakness was the professor, who made a hostile/uncomfortable environment in class. Quite often we all sat there in very obvious discomfort and tried not to make eye contact with each other as she made comments about people's essays or comments about things vaguely related to people's essays.",
                "The strength of this course was definitely in my classmates. I learned so much from reading their work repeatedly over the course of the semester. I was able to articulate the parts of an essay that worked and didn't work on a much more specific level by the end of the class. Since the course doesn't have prompts, I found that I spent much more time than I would have liked trying to figure out what to write about and less time writing and revising. I also thought that the assignments being structured in increasing word counts made the course hard to keep up with in its last third.",
                "I think the peer reviews were actually quite helpful, both the individual peer to peer edits and the group comments. I went to Professor Zarin's office hours several times as well, which were helpful. One thing that might be helpful would be spending less time discussing the \"Best Contemporary Essays\" or at least setting a timer -- we always had to rush the group peer edits a bit.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is the essay assignments every two weeks. Between the peer editing sessions, the in-class workshops, the feedback from Professor Zarin, and my own thoughts, revisions, and editing, my writing improved significantly throughout the term. If you devote the right amount of time to this course you will have at least an essay or two that you are proud to take away from the class. The weaknesses are (some of) the readings, as well as the sometimes restrictive tone/environment of seminar meetings.",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed the structure of this class. The readings were never too much and, for the most part, always fun to read. The peer-reviews were also amazing. The classroom environment was supportive and in nearly every class I was blown away by the thoughtful, detailed feedback my peers gave to me and others. \r\n\r\nHowever, I wish we received more detailed feedback/edits on our initial papers from Professor Zarin. We had a few required office hours with her throughout the semester, but think some more upfront edits on our work could have been helpful for the latter essays. Also, this is a small thing, but the deadlines and assignments were often a little unclear and wish we had more clarity on the due dates at the beginning of the semester."

                "Absolutely. The skills I've developed in the essay writing process have served me for other genres like fiction.",
                "Yes if you want to write frequently, but if the class if structured around Best American Essays again, know that the readings will probably be pretty bad",
                "Yes, if you're white and have never had a critical thought about the English department at Yale. Professor seemed displeased with the contemporary political climate and made it a point to express her dissatisfaction with so-called \"PC culture.\" There was an awkward conversation about content warnings in class once, where she said her problem with content warnings was that they meant people wouldn't engage with the material at all (people in the class were in clear support of content warnings). Really outdated talking point, really beside the point of what everybody was saying (that content warnings simply ensure that you're not, like, sitting in the Yale dining hall reading a graphic account of sexual assault). My writing did improve in the class (the professor's comments when strictly related to the writing itself were overall helpful), but I feel like there are less soul-sucking ways to improve your writing than taking this class. It was clear that the professor prized a certain kind of writing (how to describe it except as...white columnist for Harper's writing about something they've completely apoliticized or, if not apoliticized, regurgitated from the viewpoint of the boring white middle class).",
                "Yesdepending on what you are looking for! Good class if you are looking to expand your essay writing skills. There are no prompts, so you definitely have to have ideas / drive behind your writing. It's also just helpful to be in a workshop setting every week.",
                "If you go into the course with clear goals and things you want to write about, you'll be fine. That said, I didn't get as much specific feedback as I would have liked, and I felt like I needed to take a really proactive role in my writing/editing process in order to figure out what to improve upon.",
                "YES!!! If you get in, take it. I had been writing/editing opinion style pieces for three years, so this course was a refreshing introduction to another form of writing. I'm really grateful we had so many essays to write  while the the work load was certainly not a joke, it meant we were consistently improving our writing. I also had totally entered the course thinking I'd already decided my essay subjects, but I quickly learned I could not predict what came out of my brain when I was 'walking with an idea,' as Professor Zarin puts it.",
                "I'm not sure if I would recommend the course. On one hand, I definitely became a better writer during the semester, though mostly by nature of writing lots of essays with increasing word count. On the other hand, the course discussions are not particularly organized to facilitate or encourage learning and growth. Professor Zarin can be overly authoritative and, in some cases, closed-minded about topics relevant to the student and professional essays we read during the term.  It doesn't always feel like students can be honest in seminar discussions, which inherently limits what students can get out of the class. The peer editing and in-class workshops are very helpful, and the class may be worth it to get constant feedback on your many essays.",
                "Yes! If you want to improve your ability to identify good essay writing while improving your own, take this course! It is not perfect (some of the readings were a little dry), but if you put in the time to complete all of the readings and edit / revise your papers, you will get a lot out of this course."
