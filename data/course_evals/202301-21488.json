            "comments": [
                "Learned about learning and teaching in the secondary classroom, not only by talking about the theory but also seeing how it is applied by Melissa directly in our class and by practicing it ourselves in our class and in New Haven public schools! I think I developed many new insights in education, including my own experiences in the past. This class has made me realized many aspects that I didn't even consider before but that are key to become a good teacher!",
                "I learned so many valuable skills related to teaching, including how to establish culturally sustaining and anti-racist teaching, how to build classroom community, how to scaffold with rigor, how to manage a classroom, and how to develop standards-based rubrics. Working with my teacher partner provided so many insights into how these principles are (or are not) applied in the classroom.",
                "This class centers on the pedagogical skills that are needed to foster an accessible, effective, caring, and anti-racist classroom. The discussions, real-life observation, and teaching we did in the class helped us learn these principles in a very real way. I appreciated the structure, transparency, and pedagogy that Melissa uses throughout the class. I have never experienced such a clear explanation of the expectations that a professor has for me and my work. Each seminar session's goals and structures were so clear and shaped by the varying needs and emotions of the students.",
                "So much! I learned about cultivating classroom community, classroom management, developing curriculum and assessments. I learned how to think on my feet during teaching segments, and I learned that teaching is most effective when students are talking, doing activities, and leading the class under a structure the teacher builds!",
                "I learned so much from taking this class. I feel much more equipped to begin teaching---I have a much better idea of how I should structure my year, my units, each day, and my small interactions with students. Not only did I learn about the theories of effective teaching, but you actually give two lessons which were incredibly helpful in framing what will work and what won't.",
                "Several theories behind secondary school teaching. More explicitly, how to build and develop a classroom community, design thoughtful lessons by utilizing backwards design, and authentically assess student understanding. The course certainly gave a great amount of insight into the lives of actual educators through the partner teacher program. Being matched with a teacher from New Haven allowed me to see how the theory was applied in practice which was especially rewarding.",
                "I learned effective teaching principles and was able to see how those work in practice through my classroom observations",
                "You will learn so much about what teaching really looks like and get practical skills for teaching. The reading material is really engaging and paired with observing a classroom, makes for a really impactful learning opportunity.",
                "We learned about the science behind learning (how people learn, why being an \"expert\" in something does not necessarily translate into being a good professor\/instructor). To this end we paired readings on theory (for example, on what makes an assessment authentic, how power enters the classroom, what makes for a generative class discussion) with tangible practices to employ and consider. For example we learned about planning backwards, that is planning from the assessment and moving backwards to design a unit. I gained skills planning lessons that fit this goal, at creating rubrics, and many resources related to teaching,",
                "I learned the pedagogy and practice of high school instruction (and some middle!). I learned about key concepts in the field of education (like backwards planning and authentic assessments) and how to apply these myself in my own classroom. This course was invaluable as I prepare to teach for the first time this fall after graduation!",
                "Lesson planning, observation analysis and reflection, communication, being present, group work. This class is an exercise in applying theory to practice in the classroom!",
                "I learned so much about best teaching practices, from content design to interacting with students, to behavior management, and much more!",
                "This class really helped me see teaching in a new light! It was so helpful to see real examples of effective classroom teaching, both through the videos we watched and also in real life through our partner teacher! Having opportunities to plan and teach my own lessons gave me firsthand experience with increasing student engagement, helping students to be autonomous learners, and building trust in the classroom."

            "comments": [
                "I believe the whole course as it is is a strength. Melissa is an awesome teacher, definitely one of the best instructors I have interacted with in my life. Usually in education studies classes you learn about what a class should look like, but you don't get to see those practices in real life either inside that education studies classroom or somewhere else. That is not the case with EDST 205Melissa makes sure to incorporate into her lessons every principle that she teaches, and encourages and helps us to include them in our own teaching practices in our class and also in the New Haven classrooms. I think the observation component is really strong too, not too small but also not to big to take too much time. The only are of improvement of the course would be the case study, I wish relating our observations to the theory was a smaller percentage of the paper, giving us to more space to reflect on the observations more. I feel like I learned a lot by observing, but not by making the connections with the theoryat times I really struggled to make faint connections that could fit the rubric prompt, and I believe I would have learned more just by digesting the observation in a different way, less restricted by the readings. All that said, the course is awesome, and it's a must take if you like education. I have done quite a few education studies classes and this has been by far the best one. Yale should have more classes and more professors like this!",
                "Strengths: the professor - Melissa is so caring of her students, understanding of student needs, and knowledgeable; all the topics covered are very interesting and insightful; readings\/preparation for class is concise and to the point; all the assignments for this class are very meaningful and build on each other in a great way\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: Applicable, very clear expectations, walked away with both theoretical and practical skills and concepts, each assessment and activity contributed to a larger goal that was effectively communicated, each seminar session was interactive, and time flys, you get to build community with an NHPS teacher and their class!",
                "Strengths: We hit a lot of areas of teaching! I loved the readings, podcasts, and videos and the various formats of discussion posting that we did. Class time seemed to fly by (it's a two hour seminar and I never found myself checking the time throughout it). Melissa does an amazing job with cultivating class community.\r\nWeaknesses: We did a lot of discussion about effective teaching principles, but I wish we did more sample lessons to see them in practice, either as students or teachers.",
                "Everything was a strength. The workload is perfectly balanced so I wasn't drowning in work but I was able to read and really really really engage with everything---this was one of the few classes that I've taken at Yale where I can tell you what each reading was about because I read them multiple times. The class times breeze by but you feel like you're really learning. The class community was really wonderful and something that I looked forward to each week. Melissa made herself so available and accessible---I could always find a time on her Calendly to meet within 2 days of any questions\/concerns that I had. \r\n\r\nI do think that one drawback of this class is that there aren't more of them. I really wish that Yale had this class for each specific disclipline like history\/social studies, English, math, science, etc. I often found myself wanting the class to be more specific to age\/subject.",
                "The course was organized and designed very clearly. Expectations were clearly delineated and the format of assessment removed a fair amount of stress from the course. However, the revision component of assignments to meet expectations was not entirely clear and I found myself struggling to understand what was necessary for adequate resubmission which deterred me from pursuing this. Additionally, the work with the partner teacher, although exciting, was difficult to schedule and felt inauthentic at times. I wasn't clear on what exactly I was supposed to be doing during the observations, especially since it was so heavily guided by the teacher. Some more guidance in class of what to expect when going into these observations (and perhaps increasing the frequency thereof) would have been helpful. Moreover, the grading in the course, although novel, was expressed numerically on the Canvas page. This left me feeling oftentimes stressed as to where cutoffs would lie and my exact grade in the course. I might have preferred a bit more guidance on how our final grade would be calculated.",
                "Melissa does an incredible job of making the classroom environment engaging, setting up the canvas to facilitate student success, and is very accommodating. The only weakness is sometimes class would have so much in it that wed be a little rushed.",
                "The course is really excellent, my only advice would be to somehow improve the observations. I found that I wasn't able to see so many lessons, I wonder if it would be improved by weekly observations or more clarity on the teachers' side.",
                "Strengths: I always felt prepared for class and that the readings were manageable because Melissa was so intentional in remaining organized and communicative throughout the semester. Her syllabus is the most organized and the canvas modules & post-class emails that recapped what to do for the upcoming class ensured I could pour my time into reading and the assignments without struggling to figure out expectations. The clarity and intentionality behind the scenes matched the positivity, understanding, intentionality, and enthusiasm Melissa brings into class. I've never had a seminar go by so fast or feel so dynamic. In short Melissa herself is a such a strength of the class and I feel lucky to be able to learn from her and the organization of the class is designed to maximize your engagement with the course material and time together in class. All around you will enjoy this class, from the theory, practice, and class community! So so so many strengths!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many at all! Every piece of work felt relevant, well explained, and expectations were always clear. At times, scheduling with our partner teachers could be difficult though it is such an incredible opportunity to learn from people who have been teaching for years.",
                "The strength of this course is definitely Melissa! And also just how practically oriented the course is to life outside Yale. I feel like the course functioned as true professional development, in that I now feel confident in my knowledge bank so that when I confront challenges in my career, I have something to fall back on.",
                "Strengths -- Very collaborative and engaging. The readings are perfectly chosen so that in class you can make the most of your time together and create generative discussion. The readings are also very manageable and relevant. The teacher partnership is SO AMAZING! Every classroom visit is a huge learning experience and being able to share that within the class back at Yale is uplifting, inspiring, and interesting every time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- There are not many at all, none that even come to mind now. This class is so pedagogically advanced in comparison to most classes at Yale. You will never have a dull moment in class, and yet you won't feel like you are overextending yourself. One potential weakness is having to develop a lesson plan without too much practice (although you do get some practice). This can be pretty tough and daunting, but Melissa is very open to meeting (even last minute) and guiding you in creating something that the students in the class you observe will enjoy and learn from!",
                "Strengths: classes are really engaging, and the classroom community is warm and accepting. The teacher partner program is FANTASTIC and taught me so much! The way that Professor Scheve designed this course to link the theory we were learning in the classroom to our partner teacher experience constitutes some of the best academic experiences I've had at Yale. \r\nWeaknesses\/improvement: Small thing - we used some strategies that we might use in the classroom to cover content material (posting to Jamboard, fishbowl discussion, etc., and this was fantastic. I would have appreciated a short (5 min max) rundown of the key concepts for the week from the reading just to make sure that I'm getting everything I need to and everyone's on the same page.",
                "The structure of the teaching segment groups not only helped me get to know my peers better, but also was very helpful in preparation for the lesson that I taught in my partner teacher's classroom. It was so helpful to get feedback in real time and see my lesson actualized, as well as participating in the lessons of my peers.\r\n\r\nIn class, Melissa made sure that we were always productive and occupied, yet it was not too fast-paced. The physical movement we did also helped a lot with engagement."

                "Definitely. If you are at all interested in education, considering teaching, or are sure that you want to become a teacher, go for it. It is a must take. You will dig into so many of the principles that make good teaching, and will get to practice them yourself. Melissa is such a supportive, knowledgeable, caring, proactive, and personable instructor, I wish everyone at Yale had the chance to take this classit is spaces like this that make of Yale such a special place and remind you why you are here!",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in becoming a teacher! This course helped me learn about so many important and relevant teaching principles. The class observations are very meaningful and helped me apply the principles we were learning in the class to real life. The lesson plan that we teach at the end is also very meaningful and a fun experience! This was one of the most fun, rewarding classes I have taken at Yale. Melissa is an amazing professor and intentionally builds classroom community, which is something very special.",
                "Absolutely!! If you think that you will teach\/work with teachers\/ inform policies that have to do with teaching--- take it!!",

                "Yes, 100% Anyone who is interested in teaching should take this class.",
                "100% recommend this course! Get to work closely with local NHV teachers and really be in a classroom for portions of the class, and it really gives you the opportunity to see how you might be a teacher.",
                "The course was extremely exciting in terms of content, but the fact that it only met once a week made it hard to engage with at times. Melissa does a phenomenal job at cultivating a classroom community that supports and facilitates learning and growth. If you are interested in teaching at the secondary level, this is certainly a course that would be a good choice for you.",
                "Absolutely, especially if you want to pursue teaching. This is the only class where youll learn real skills",
                "YES! If you are at all considering teaching, this class is a must!",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Specifically if you are interested in learning more about theory behind teaching and practice teaching. Even if you aren't sure if you want to teach this class is the right place for you. Pairing the pedagogy with chances to teach (both our peers and actual students) was such a valuable experience in enacting what we learned and in using\/building a toolbox. I may be biased, but I also think learning how to teach (at an institution full of experts) is critical (one of our first readings is about why being an expert does not inherently align with being a good instructor). I left this class better able to analyze lesson plans, designs, goals, ways of instructing and my own thought processes when I think about teaching. Most of all, I am leaving this class with an even deeper appreciation for the craft and dedication that is teaching and with an immense appreciation for Melissa and the classroom community we built.",
                "Yes!!! This class is eye opening in terms of realizing what an engaging class looks and feels like. The structure and pacing of the class is so wonderful! Working with the teacher partners is a very unique and meaningful experience.",
                "YES!!!!! This course was fantastic, and one of my favorite so far at Yale. Professor Scheve cares for all her students deeply and fosters a really warm classroom environment. Especially if you're interested in teaching \/education - this course will be CRITICAL! I feel like I came away with so much more knowledge about classroom teaching and what's important to students and can't imagine entering the classroom without that knowledge. Even if you're not teaching - I think learning about how teachers teach and learners learn is really important."
