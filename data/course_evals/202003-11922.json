                "The course is so very flexibly and really does allow for students to take their own creative approach to things. Ted is not strict with how things should be presented or how class should be run, so a lot of the time we would use class time however we saw fit, whether that was answering logistical questions that people had about the software we were using, or looking at other's work for inspiration, and literally using class time to go out and photograph. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this class really is what you make of it. This semester in particular, there were no formal check ins to hold you accountable for taking a certain number of pictures per week, so practicing your skills was really an active choice that you had to hold yourself to make.",
                "Strengths: very hands-off for COVID-era. Ted was a phenomenal professor who was flexible and knowledgeable about all things photography. Be prepared with questions to get the most of out the class.",
                "The professor and TA were really helpful and encouraging. I wish there was more content in the class, though. For instance, it would have been nice to learn more of the technical aspects of photography.",
                "Great class with lots of great advice given throughout the semester.",
                "It was a great course to have during quarantine, esp. because it encouraged solo exploration\/deeper thought about how we interact with our surroundings.",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed the creative freedom we had over our work, it really made me much more observant and aware of the little things around me. I also appreciated the critiques we had. The were chances to show what we were working on and hear from others what was working and what could be improved.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is not really a weakness of the course itself, but the online\/remote format was disappointing. I really enjoyed the course and I wish I had waited to take it in all its glory in-person."

This is one of the few classes that I have taken at Yale where I am actually excited to go to and be in class. Sharing my own work has been so enjoyable, and looking at other's work for inspiration has also been another exciting aspect about the class. Take this class if you enjoy capturing pictures, but also be aware that anything you gain from this class will be directly related to how much time and effort and practice you put into the class material itself.",
