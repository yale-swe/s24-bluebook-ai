                "Strengths: Fascinating content that made me genuinely reflect on how I should respond to disagreement and actually thus led me to change my beliefs about certain things; Readings are all excellent, clear, and selected in such a way to build off each other which is really helpful; Prof. Pittard is excellent in seminar and office hours at raising important questions and being able to have a real back and forth, both clarifying misunderstandings but also challenging (not in a harsh way) arguments put forth by students; reading responses were effective at making students clarify their thoughts while also not being overwhelming amounts of work.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes class discussion got a little sidetracked, but this is somewhat to be expected when talking about really charged topics.",
                "This is a great class! I really like the whole setup.",
                "This is a great course. I thought the mix of reading responses, perusall assignments, and final essay was near perfect. The professor might consider having two shorter seminars over the course of the week rather than one long seminar, though -- often it was difficult to maintain a clear dialectic over the course of a seminar, and I would have appreciated more mini-lectures at the beginnings of seminars.",
                "The course is well organized and the syllabus is constructed in a well thought out manner. As with most seminar courses, discussions were rarely able to cover the extent of the readings, but Professor Pittard does a good job of ensuring that the key points are covered. It is a very niche but interesting topic as well which will have one reading many modern philosophy papers. Overall Professor Pittard is a great resource--he's definitely very knowledgeable on the subject, having written a book on it among other things.",
                "Excellent course. Strengths: great syllabus, helpful explanations about content that was sometimes quite dense, a lot of feedback. I can't really think of any cons -- possibly, there could have been more intervention to prevent students from going off-topic during seminar."

This is both practically important given the prevalence of disagreement, but also is intellectually and theoretically engaging, as the abstract questions are interesting and one feels some pressure to try to resolve them due to their practical significance.",
