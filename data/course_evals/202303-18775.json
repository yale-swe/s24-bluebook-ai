                "The major strengths of this course included a structured pacing for progression, and this ensured we learned everything on time. Also, the publication of all the psets, videos, and textbook chapters needed was nice, as it allowed some people to progress ahead. However, the one thing I hope is improved is the disconnect between the lectures, quizzes, and problem sets. It felt like the pre-class quizes\/videos were a week ahead of the lectures which were a few days ahead of the problem sets. This is highly problematic because it encourages learning the content at a rudimentary level and developing the illusion of understanding to simply be able to answer the pre-class quizzes rather than being able to actually learn what is needed to be taught. My proposed solution is to centralize everything more; make the instructors follow the pacing and give pre-class quizes for content that has already been covered in the LECTURES rather than the videos\/readings.",
                "Strengths: they taught me what I needed to know\r\nWeaknesses: the class is VERY formulaic; rather than teaching the intuition behind most topics, they give me the formula right away. Sometimes I wonder why I am doing what I'm doing.",
                "Strengths: Tam is a great dude. Even though I struggled and didn't really enjoy the class, he's kind of the only reason I saw it through. Also, there's a pretty large amount of resources for you to teach yourself the material when you inevitably get lost because the pacing makes no sense. Weaknesses: First, the pacing. There's \"pre-class\" videos that you're supposed to watch before each class, but they never actually cover what we're talking about in class. They're always either behind or ahead, but never just right. It almost makes the videos totally irrelevant, since they never actually reinforce or get reinforced due to pacing. Second, the class just isn't really student-friendly. Not accepting late homework without a Dean's extension is honestly so brutal for a pset class. If you fall behind (like I did due to illness), God help you if you try to get back on track. It will fall almost entirely on you to catch up because of the third weakness: Office Hours. The profs themselves have almost no office hours, and they're at pretty bad times. Then there's the ULA office hours, which are so full, that you can sit there for hours and get maybe one or two questions answered.",
                "Overall felt like I learned the material pretty well but had to more of that on my own than I would have liked.\r\nPre class videos are good but ended up being a week ahead of the class which made them very hard to fully grasp. Midterms and final were pretty fair PSETs ranged in difficulty and time consumption but the bad ones were bad.   \r\nJust shifting the Pre class videos to line up with the classes would be a big improvement",
                "Its a good course, just very difficult because everything relates so as soon as you dont understand something its very easy to fall behind.",
                "I really appreciated the guided notes that would filled out by the course instructor so that our section could spend time going over particular questions as well as problems that would be useful for the psets. There were many peer tutor and office hour resources which was very helpful, as well as multiple review sessions before each exam that went over various topics from the course as well as previous exams. I can't think of any particular weaknesses to this course.",

                "Yes, I would highly recommend, especially if it is a pre-requisite or if it will benefit you to take calculus 3 in some way.",
                "I would recommend it only because multivariable calculus is an important skill to learn. It is not taught well, though.",
                "I had a terrible time in this class. I had some medical complications early in the semester that set me behind, and then the course just wasn't structured in a way that ever allowed me to catch up. As soon as I fell behind on the psets, completing them became a game of somehow BSing my way to finishing it on time (since late hw is not accepted without Dean's extension) rather than actually using them to learn from. There's plenty of other reasons why the structure of this class really worked against me (Tam is NOT one of them, by the way-- he's awesome), but suffice to say I ended up having to Credit\/D\/F, and even then the final was so hard who knows whether or not I'll actually get into the C range (they're very weird and cryptic about the curve of the class). So, if you're just taking the course for the challenge or because you need a QR, I can't say I'd recommend it. BUT, unfortunately, calc 3 can be important to some fields, so if you're someone who doesn't need calc 3 for your major but could potentially use the skills or knowledge elsewhere in your studies\/career, I would still probably recommend you take the class (Credit\/D if you can) just to get exposure to the material (unless you are a very good math self-studier).",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who thinks they'll need it for their major. I took it after taking BC calc senior year of high school and the transition was pretty smooth",
                "Yes but they should be prepared going into the course and have a plan on how they can keep up with the material.",
                "Yes. The concept of the 3d plane is very practical to mathematical understanding, and allows you to view basic volume and surface area equations in a whole new light ie how to derive them. Vectors and double\/triple integrals are present and applicable to many other fields of STEM."
