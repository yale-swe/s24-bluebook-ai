                "None of what was taught in class was actually tested on, though attendance was marked. A lot of students either went to class and did other work, or had their friends sign them in.",
                "I liked the course overall, but at the beginning of the semester Prof Dugdale made it clear that that previous architecture history classes have failed to survey a holistic view of world architecture, and this class would try and combat that Western biased narrative. This class, while interesting in its own right, did NOT do that. The majority of the lectures, particularly in the latter half of the semester, were dedicated to Western architecture, whereas the Americas and Africa were combined into a single week, and all of Asia and the Middle East had no more than a week each, respectively, as well. So while Prof Dugdale is a great lecturer, I wish he wouldn't paint the class as a holistic overview when it is not, or MORE preferably, I hope he could spend more time on the non-Western history of architecture in the world. I understand it's not all his expertise, but not even being exposed to the architecture of the countries of Southeast Asia etc is unfortunate.",
                "Many contents are too vague and not teaching me anything.",
                "I wanted to learn about the history of architecture, and I can assure you that I absolutely did not. The professor went on random tangents about things that were making history relevant to the present, but I wanted to learn about the HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE like when things were built and in what style etc. etc. . If you put me into most cultures right now and asked me what style of architecture was around me or what time period it was from (before 1750), I could not tell you. Absolute WASTE of a credit. Plus, the attendance policy is ridiculous. Do not take unless required. Bad course. Teach what you said you would.",
                "I liked that this course was designed to help students improve their observation of buildings. Keeping a sketchbook did not feel like a chore but rather a fun way to take notes and read the textbook. For the papers, it seemed that the TAs and professor  were looking for specific formatting/layout/analysis and did not provide good examples for how to emulate this.",
                "The class was difficult to follow and covered too many topics. The professor makes you go in person and sign in for a lecture but doesnt really provide any way for students to engage. The TA graded way tooo harsh for an elective like this. There are no assignment that help you remember the material you learned.",
                "Strengths: the sections were engaging, the lectures were interesting, no exams. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture attendance.",
                "strengths are the teaching, both by Professor and TFS. I was not a huge fan of the layout of this course. I understand one course cannot comprehensively cover the entire history of architecture, but the skew towards western european architecture was very strong in this course and I think if that was going to be the case, i wish the class would just be upfront and honest about it. Likewise, if the aim is to be a bit more comprehensive, i think that if we are going to miss out on parts of the world/kinds of architecture, we should try and miss out equally as well--- have fewer weeks on europe, and more on Africa, Asia, Oceania, Indig, Americas, etc. Maybe say okay one/two weeks for each region. As is, I felt like the week particularly on indig. americas/Africa was shockingly brief. I think this course format is partially the product of using a textbook and sticking to it.",
                "This course revolutionized the way I think about architecture. I found myself looking at the buildings around me in a whole new light. That said, lectures felt a bit disjointed at times. Professor Dugdale is quite eloquent and raises some fascinating questions, but lectures often feel like they contain more questions than answers. While that was, perhaps, the point, I appreciate when I could really see how a lecture was fitting together. My favorites were the ones that focused on a single building (or a particular set).",
                "Strengths - great lectures and engaging section meetings.\r\nWeaknesses - hard to get to know the professor",
                "I think the class could really benefit from being more focused. I understand that theres a timeline to cover but the course felt really scattered in its organization.",
                "I wish there was more interactive activities",
                "Strengths: organized, engaging lectures, relevant assignments and readings\r\nWeaknesses: could have used a bit more formal instruction on architectural vocabulary/concepts",
                "this was an amazing class. at the beginning i wondered why there wasnt that much in class participation during lecture, but then after having the discussion sections I was able to see why.",
                "I really loved this course, I was excited for our classes every week and found the information and format very engaging.",
                "I personally am just not a fan of lecture classes but obviously that is out of this courses control.",
                "The course did well to be challenging yet engaging, allowing us all to find something that truly interested us in its overwhelming breath of topics.",
                "It would be spectacular if we can have an extra seminar session with the professor talking about the architecture.",
                "The course is the exact same every year. It is not interesting as he reads from a years old script. He does not appear passionate about his subject material and I therefore was also not passionate about learning it. The final assignment was a nice deviation from the monotony of the course as we got to choose our own areas of interest to research."
