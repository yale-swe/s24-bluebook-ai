   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Many more grammar structures and vocabulary.",
    "New vocab and grammar structures, L3 focuses more on writing essays and giving presentations than L1\/L2.",
    "I learned a lot of new and helpful sentence structures.",
    "I learned how to communicate via Mandarinspeaking, reading, grammar, writing, and translating.",
    "More thorough understanding of the importance of tones and the ability to pay greater attention to my tones. Knowledge of how to write many more characters",
    "I very adequately learned the next level in my Chinese studies, greatly broadening my knowledge of vocabulary, grammar, and culture. This course was, of course, also very fast compared to my high school courses (only 20-30 new characters\/week in HS vs. maybe 60-70 characters\/week at Yale), but I was able to adjust accordingly.",
    "More than anything, I believe that I came to understand the flexibility of the Chinese language in using what I had learned to expand my knowledge even more. Before, I had solely seen language learning in Chinese as simply reliant upon rigid memorization, but through this course I've changed my view of the language to one that looks at it from a building block perspective and  builds upon the nuances and patterns present in the language vocabulary and grammatical structures. Additionally, my speaking and listening skills have greatly improved as well as I have learned ways to better my comprehension by understanding the essence of what is said and deriving details from context."

   "comments": [
    "The grammar and vocabulary is very helpful, but perhaps the course follows the textbook too closely. Perhaps there could be more opportunities for free speaking practice in class instead of just repeating sentences from the book.",
    "The class is fast paced and teaches you a lot of chinese but at some times seems to be a bit too fast.",
    "This course was a very well organized and rigorous delve into the Chinese language. The daily work was difficult to keep up with always and overwhelming at times, but I felt I learned a lot from this course.",
    "Sometimes essays and other bigger assignments overlap.",
    "Strengths: Very engaging material and teacher, clearly well-experienced in teaching this class. It was always the class I felt the least tired going into. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The professor can be a bit too enthusiastic sometimes, though that might be a personal opinion.",
    "I believe that the main strength of this course was its everyday quizzes which ensured that students were always engaged with the text and lessons; I believe that a weakness of the course was the way that grammar was taught to students. It was often presented in very rigid ways that often times made it appear as only being valid when used in the ways illustrated in the textbook, when there were tiny nuances that were present in the grammar that made it possible to be used in other ways that the textbook didn't expand upon. Additionally, the grammar PowerPoint slides often did not come with explanations of the grammar rules and just had sentence examples of the structures, which made it difficult to be used."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely, it is an important next stop for Chinese.",
    "If youre willing to put in the work, the teachers meet you halfway",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their chinese.",
    "Yes, if a student wants to learn Chinese in a fun and supportive classroom environment, Id recommend it.",
    "Yes! If you're looking for a fun way to learn Chinese, this course is pretty much all you can ask for. Friendly and engaging professor, average to less-than-average workload, and a healthy classroom atmosphere.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I think that it not only provides the essential vocabulary and grammatical knowledge necessary for improving one's understanding of Chinese but also provides you with the tools and methods to build on what you learn and use it in various  potential situations."
