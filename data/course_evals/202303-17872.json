                "Strengths: Prof. Shin is amazing at what she does. She is incredibly knowledgable and presents the material in an engaging manner. Our TA, Harry, was also superb. The sections he taught after class were pretty much essential to grasping the concepts necessary for understanding the material and completing the problem sets. I also thought that the problem sets were fair, as was the grading (though this will likely depend on whoever is the grader). Weaknesses: Not too many notable weaknesses, though I felt at times the pace of the lecture was quite quick, to the point where it felt like no one really knew what was going on at times.",
                "Professor Shin is awesome!",
                "Strengths: Professor Shin & Harry are excellent instructors! Their devotion to making sure each student understands the material made this class enjoyable, even when the content was very difficult. The format of the class (all HWs in place of exams) is well-suited for students' learning.\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "I really liked the course. Professor Shin is awesome and the lecture is engaging! I think one class on applications and where to go from here would be nice.",
                "The class is focused on Gdel's completeness theorem and well organized around that goal. It feels like all of the content comes at the right time. In the end, it all fits. It's systematic and efficient.\r\n\r\nThe textbook is clear and helpful; Professor Shin is much more clear and much more helpful. She explains everything very well and seems to know exactly what to sayit's like she has a lot of practice.\r\n\r\nHomework was fair and manageable but challenging. It required intense focus but paid that focus well."

                "Absolutely. If you are at all interested in logic or proof writing, this class is for you. As a non-math/non-philosophy major, I was a bit apprehensive going into the class, but I feel like I learned a lot, and I feel like my logical reasoning became stronger overall. Prof. Shin is a wonderful lecturer, and she creates a great classroom atmosphere. The grading is entirely homework-based, which I appreciated as I felt like the problem sets were fair assessments of understanding of the material. We had \"section\" for 25 minutes at the end of each lecture (so 50 minutes per week, as is standard), but since these were incorporated into the lecture time, there wasn't a separate time commitment outside of lecture, which was really nice. Overall, the course is just very nicely structured, and you learn a lot, so I would highly recommend taking it, even if you're a bit unsure!",
                "Yes if you can commit the time",
                "Yes! But only if extremely interested in the specific subject, or generally interested in challenging yourself.",
                "Yes, this is a great class to build a strong foundation in mathematical logic. I took this class as an Applied Math major to fulfill a breadth credit and highly recommend doing so if you're an Applied Math major.",
                "I would if you enjoy proofs and thought puzzles!",
                "Yes. I came to this class from First Order Logic. (Despite this being a prerequisite, I actually seemed to be in the minority of students, and a lot of the mathematical concepts were more familiar to them than to me.)\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for the puzzle-solving feeling that FOL gives you, then this class is a great place to get it. I had a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nI'll probably never do this kind of logic again. But I think I became a but more analytical because of this class, which is something I always appreciate. The careful and methodical thinking carried over to my other coursework. (A real benefit.)"
