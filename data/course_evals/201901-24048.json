    "I learned a lot about NATO, the Cold War, and international politics.",
    "This seminar gave us a chance to study the foundations, contradictions, and dilemmas of NATO in-depth.",
    "This class was amazing. I learned so much about NATO -- its structure, history, and future. Anyone interested in US-Soviet, or European-American, relations must learn about NATO. It is the backbone of the latter half of the 20th century and is fascinating to learn about. Furthermore, Professor Colbourn is amazing. She chose readings each week that varied in perspectives and so class discussions were spent not just talking about the history, but also how the history was written.",
    "I learned about the Cold War and international geopolitics, and as a first-time college history student, I learned how to read and understand historical articles and write historical papers.",
    "This course allowed me to critically think about NATO's history and the challenges inherent to the organization."

   "comments": [
    "I thought the class was well-structured and well-taught. Do the reading though! You'll learn way more.",
    "I think the course would have benefitted from weekly reading responses, but I felt the syllabus and instruction was very well organized and delivered.",
    "This class was excellent. Professor Colbourn made history come to life. Furthermore, she didn't consider any questions \"stupid.\" She made sure everyone in the class was engaged in discussion and made sure we didn't just stay at surface level. She also made sure that she assigned readings that were relevant and concise to make sure everyone read them, which ensured really good class discussion. \r\n\r\nThe topics were interesting and varied. I appreciated that we dug into the weeds of history, but also learnt about broader themes.",
    "I thought on the whole it was good; very little to suggest.",
    "As someone passionate about both current affairs and history, I enjoyed this class' ability to hold a conversation not only about the origins and foundational events of NATO, but apply these lessons to the present. This helped me to see the modern-day trends while still challenging me as a student of history. I really enjoyed the student-facilitation, it challenged me to pay close attention to the readings and take ownership for my learning. The only thing I would change about this course would be to have the final class on the future of NATO!",
    "The course is very well designed and I enjoyed the fact that we were able to cover all of the readings each class. The only addition that might be useful would be a more structured period in which to write our final papers, like having a draft due before the final copy."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you're interested in NATO, international politics, diplomacy, or American foreign policy, this is a good class. There's definitely a lot of reading and work though.",
    "Great class, great professor.",
    "Absolutely. This diplomatic history is indispensable.",
    "If you are interested in the history of NATO, then this is the course for you!",
    "This class was EXCELLENT! You learn so much. Professor Colbourn is an amazing professor and person. She made every class fun to attend and ensured that we all learned a lot.",
    "The history of NATO is more interesting than it's probably given credit for, especially if you don't know much about the Cold War, and Prof. Colbourn is great - intelligent, funny, understanding, and good at letting students run class while adding information where necessary or useful.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone whose interests lie in the intersection between international affairs and history. This course does an excellent job bridging the gap between current discourse and debate over the North Atlantic Alliance and the organization's history from the very beginning. A great class for learning how the past continues to impact the present taught by a great instructor.",
    "Yes. I thought it was an incredibly interesting class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any one interested in International Relations or the Cold War."
