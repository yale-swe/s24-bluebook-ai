I also learned how to write a computer science research paper, and therefore critically engage with the algorithms I was coding. Finally, I occasionally learned some tangential knowledge, like how to read computer science research papers efficiently.",

For my specific project, I learned some about Android programming, solving the TSP problem, and a bit about 2D graphics/drawing on Android."

                "The proposal and midterm progress presentations were great, I quite liked those. Poster presentation was okay -- I got put in one of the \"side rooms\" where no one really came to interact, so it wasn't that great. The in-person class requirement is fun if you use it to go to other people's presentations -- but the actual classes past the first one weren't as interesting/useful (in my opinion).",
                "There is extremely little guidance when it comes to understanding the course requirements. Students all seem clueless as to what they're actually supposed to supply in terms of the progress reports, final reports, etc. I do not understand why this is the case: should this not be an opportunity for students to learn how to approach academic research? Obviously research has a natural degree of freedom to it, but I feel that there should be a more identifiable standard when it comes to most students' first independent report. Early lectures were wasted on things like how to read academic literature or how to use Google Scholar when they could've been spent going over what the expectations were for literature review.",
                "the ethics lesson was rather basic but I'm glad we had one. I wish we had more information on how to submit our final reports and code in a nicely formatted way",
                "The in-person aspects of this class just felt like busy work",
                "Some of the meetings were helpful and the course structure allows for flexibility for students and their advisors. However, there is little guidance on how to do a project independently and how students should select and interact with their advisor, so students who are new to independent research projects may have difficulty getting organized and selecting a project that they are confident they can do well.",
                "Don't think that the presentations are necessary",
                "I did not find the \"class\" aspect of this course useful. I think it would be stronger if students were just doing research.",
                "Strength: this class builds community for the CS department since most CS students never spend time in a single room with each other and aren't super aware of what other people are working on.\r\nWeakness: we learned very little that would actually be useful in our projects and writeups. Also, there was relatively little support for my friends who were struggling with their projects and had advisors that were either unavailable or extremely difficult to work with.",

                "Strengths: An opportunity to build community in the CS department among seniors. Honestly, a pretty well done senior project class. Weaknesses: Some lectures seemed a little unnecessary to attend (the presentations among students seemed the most important)",
                "I got to pursue a field I was highly interested in with my professor. It was a highly rewarding opportunity",
                "The strength of the course is that it tests the independence of a student to do computer science work. The main weakness is that there are poor systems set up for communication. There were plenty of times where I had questions to ask about logistics, but my emails went unanswered and my only option was to ask other students. If I'm looking for logistic information about the course, I shouldn't have to resort to asking other students. This class needs an Ed discussion page to source common questions and concerns from students.",

                "Strengths: I enjoyed being able to formulate a project of my own; it was a nice change of pace from the structured classes that make up most of the Computer Science major. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked a little more guidance on writing the final report (for instance, a few examples of exemplary student papers). Additionally, it was initially unclear what the additional requirements were for a group project (I had worked with a partner on this project). Unless the intention is to leave most requirements up to the individual advisers, I think it would be helpful to have clearly written requirements for students who are working collaboratively.",
                "I think 490 isn't as engaging as it should be, but what Sohee is doing is definitely on the right track! I will say, my biggest gripe is that the schedule makes very little sense. I think that students figuring their project/advisors too late. A \"pitch\" of available projects should be recorded by professors and made available on the Canvas page before the semester begins. Then the proposal and proposal presentation can be done sooner. The midterm presentation is far too late into the semester and too close to the deadline for the final posters.",

                "The structure and deadlines of the course were integral for project completion and its strongest component. The ethics component of the course was super interesting and seeing more of those classes would be beneficial for future iterations.",
                "I think having students talk to one another about research interests as well as have professors explain their strengths/fields of interest in the semesters prior could be more helpful for students who don't have a guiding idea for their senior project.",
                "I thought that having this course to structure and frame the senior thesis around was very helpful. I'm not sure how much it benefitted students in terms of the actual lectures that happened, but it was nice to see and hear about the work that other people were doing.",
                "I think that the attendance requirement is not helpful. I had to miss out on lab meetings and other time that I could have spent working on my thesis for lectures that were frankly not that helpful for me in the completion of my thesis or my interest in CS in general.",
                "Fewer mandatory classes.",
                "I enjoyed learning what other CS majors were working on throughout the semester, however, the structure of the class isn't really conducive to attendance. The topics are not super relevant to anyone's project, and since presentations were always split into multiple groups at once, we weren't even able to learn about many other projects. Also, if projects are presented in different rooms, I would prefer rooms to have projects of different areas. It seemed like everyone in a room would be presenting similar topics or have the same advisor, which isn't too interesting.",
                "This class is stupid. It forces students to work in a lab which they may not want to do",
                "I actually did appreciate some of the class requirements (e.g., presentations + final poster) because I felt that it kept me somewhat on track throughout the semester to complete the final report. Some of the class lectures at the beginning didn't feel very substantive though, which is unfortunate because there is an attendance requirement for the course. I did enjoy listening to other students' presentations though!",
                "I really enjoyed my own senior project, the the course requirements (especially having to do them twice) added a lot of extra busy work and actively detracted from my senior project experience.",
                "Strengths: keeping us on track on our theses. The deadlines throughout the semester of submitting thesis ideas, doing a midterm presentation, and a final presentation, really did keep us on track. I also appreciated the lax in-person requirements (only needing to attend 3 classes), and the guest speakers that came in to speak. I also like that it added an extra course credit to our senior year schedule. I would definitely keep it!",
                "I think this course is pretty much perfect as-is. You only have to attend 3-4 in-person class sessions, which is definitely enough. A couple of the guest lectures seemed interesting. Other than that it's just you working on your project freely. Advisors are helpful and nice.\r\nThe biggest weakness by far was the lack of feedback--I didn't receive any feedback or comments on my project. At least a brief blurb or comment from advisors should be mandatory."

                "Obviously this course is required for the CS degree, but the experience is very advisor-dependent, as you might expect. Make sure to spend the time at the beginning of the semester looking for advisors and settling on a project that seems both feasible and rewarding, as that will likely determine your overall satisfaction with the course. The deliverables can seem annoying at first, but I actually thought that the presentations kept me somewhat on track throughout the semester, which is helpful for a class that is so independently-driven. The class lectures at the beginning were pretty dull, which is frustrating because of the attendance requirements, but I found that listening to other students' presentations was interesting!",
                "Its required. I would recommend the faculty put together a better option for year-long cs theses.",
                "Yes, because it is required to get a CS degree, and also, because it is one of those rare opportunities that allows you to explore an area of CS with all its infinite possibilities and applications to other fields.",

If you're someone who has an idea for a creative research project or just likes to explore new topics in-depth, I'd strongly recommend this course regardless of whether it's required. You'll learn a lot as long as you're engaged and interested in your project and have time to put into it."
