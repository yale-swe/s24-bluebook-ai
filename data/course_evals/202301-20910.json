                "Your experience and how you structure workload is very dependent on your advisor. Some of the milestone assignments are not especially helpful, but the annotated bibliography, ten page draft and rough draft were all helpful for my process. Also, the grading can be a bit inconsistent as it depends heavily on which faculty member reads your essay.",
                "One's success in the course is very much contingent upon one's relationship with their advisor. I had a very good relationship with my advisor who was able to synthesize competing strands of thought and recommend appropriate courses of action.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- I like the milestone assignments throughout the year and each semester that kept me one track and working towards the final project, so that it didn't all hit me at once\r\n- It's super exciting to be able to pick a topic of your own interest and have the freedom and independence to lead a research project on it, and see it come together over the course of a year!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Opportunities to gain feedback on your work are variable and very dependent on your personal advisor. I would have appreciated more opportunities to get help and feedback on my work throughout the process",
                "The history senior thesis has clear expectations, assignments, and timelines. Although one's experience writing it will inherently be influenced by their advisor  and I had the BEST advisor  the course is designed for students to succeed in writing a strong paper.",
                "I would have liked to receive more personal feedback from my instructor on the course of my paper.\r\n\r\nThe way the timeline of the paper was organized was great for getting work done ahead of schedule. I liked the level of freedom and sense of self direction that was a part of the paper-writing process, but I know others requested more direction.",
                "I loved how independent it was, which let me go at my own pace and do the work whenever I wanted and as quickly as I could. I also really loved being able to fully pick my own topic. I think most of the small assignments are silly and that's a weakness but I do wish we had a little more checkins with advisors that were substantive.",
                "The deadlines for milestones are too early and dont make sense",
                "The quality of advising could really be improved. Up until the point where I submitted a full rough draft, I received essentially zero feedback from my advisor. I tried multiple times to meet with him and talked about my thoughts and ideas, but I received very little engagement or guidance on the part of my professor.",
                "I think the History department could support individual advisors better (clearly let them know deadlines, give them basic expectations/guides etc.), which would in turn help them support their students."

                "Yes I would recommend the year-long since a one semester project is basically a term paper. It's pretty fun to do your own thing all year.",
                "All history majors have to do it, but I definitely believe doing a two semester is the right option. It also really is a product of what you put into it. The more you work and the more you really care about what you are writing about, the better time you will have.",
                "It's mandatory, so",
                "absolutely not. Please switch majors. This thesis process has to be the worst at Yale. The advisors are wonderful but you can have your advisor think your paper is a work of art and get a grader that will give you a B-. Seriously. For two semesters. Not to say everyone should care about their GPA like that (because they shouldn't!), but that's a wonderful gift while all my friends in other majors write their thesis overnight and their advisor grades it as an A, meanwhile, I spend an entire year diligently working on something with multiple drafts sent to my advisor, writing tutors, and peers and then some historian completely rips it apart. If I could go back, I'd become an American Studies or Humanities or Poli Sci major. It's unfair that the history department does things differently from other disciplines. Why? \r\n\r\nA committee of professors or your advisor should grade the thesis!!! Not one other professor, and then that grade is final! That is such a horrible system. There are so many differing viewpoints in the department. My grader thought my paper was bad, and my advisor thought it was amazing (independent from hurting my feeling). What an amazing way to feel like you've wasted a year of your life when a professor says you wrote sloppily. Please fix this for other students. I've never written a course review like this... I think this process is simply in desperate need of an overhaul. Listen to the students! They feel awful about this process. They are scared the entire time they are writing their thesis! We are undergraduates, not PhD students. People get nominated for the history essay awards with not amazing thesis grades. That's so crazy."
