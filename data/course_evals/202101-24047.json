In general, Professor Baffi is a wonderful, kind teacher, and the course mainly was challenging because it was online. However, I think I developed and reviewed grammar a lot and conjugations.",

                "The main weakness was that our class was not into participating or vibing very much, but Professor Baffi was so kind and patient and willing to give extensions. The general course material felt like a lot at times and was more heavy grammar/vocab/conjugation than speaking. I feel like the class might not feel as rewarding as learning a new language if you've done spanish in high school, but as long as you don't get too behind, it's not overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: I think the synchronous and asynchronous lectures were a lot more valuable than just completely synchronous. \r\nWeaknesses: The amount of work done outside class feels excessive sometimes.",
                "This class has a fair amount of reading, which is helpful for me to understand how vocabs are used in real-life content and to develop my own writing style.\r\nHowever, this class has a relatively light emphasis on listening.",
                "This course is very rigorous and I learned a large amount of material in a short period of time. I wish we had more time to practice speaking as we learned new verb tenses; we tended to do extensive reading/writing assignments when we learned new verb tenses but did not practice integrating them while speaking. I also wish we had more project-based assignments and presentations because the worksheets and types of assignments were somewhat repetitive. Professor Baffi had us do an assignment where we created a magazine cover and did extensive research on an environmental issue of our choice. That was one of my favorite assignments of the semester- it would have been nice to do more projects like that one."

                "I kind of gave up on asynchronous work, so I had to catch up before exams kind of quickly. It's also kinda annoying that all 130 kids gotta do the same stuff in exams cuz baffi didn't plan it, but baffi was nice and tried making stuff work better for us. when we were in good breakout rooms, it was a little better. baffi was also always willing to help through office hours or email.",
                "The asynchronous work was a really big help! However, I do think the amount of work assigned outside class could have been dialed down a bit, perhaps just to SuperSite and the readings we needed to do.",

The synchronous/asynchronous format was good, but I feel that having class every day would have been more beneficial because it would have given us more opportunities to converse with each other."
