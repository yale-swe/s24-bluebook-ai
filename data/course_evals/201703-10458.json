   "comments": [
    "I have taken several art classes while at Yale, and this class -- while being the least structured -- also managed to challenge & inspire me the most. For me, the strength of the class came from the way it was structured. The workload wasn't overwhelming, and the class was comprised of a mix of undergraduate and graduate students. This really allowed for students to express their ideas in an environment that was low-stress yet still highly engaging and intellectually challenging.",
    "This course was tremendously valuable because it provided a (rare) space for working on a large sculptural project."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is a self-starter looking to work through their own artistic ideas throughout the course of the semester. There were only a few small assignments throughout the semester, and students were given a great deal of freedom in creating their final projects. I would recommend this class to any student looking to explore and expand their artistic practice on their own, while meeting with the class once a week for discussions and workshops.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in developing a large sculptural work (object or performance) or a set of works. Discussion is an integral part of the course as well. The conversations with Professor Kersels and fellow classmates were wonderfully stimulating and memorable."
