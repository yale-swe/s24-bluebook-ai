Specifically I think there could be more scaffolding for assignments (in terms of both deadlines and details to be included) and also I think the classes themselves need to have more planning/an agenda than just updating with where we are and what challenges were running into. Possibly workshop 2-3 peoples thesis once a week? The people select which week?",

                "I think that the most helpful parts of the course were the checkpoints provided by the different assignments given over the course of the semester and the faculty and peer reviews of work. A large portion of class time, however, tended to be spent giving individual progress updates on work being done. I think these check-ins were less helpful than more hands-on workshopping of different aspects of the research process would have been, or additional peer/faculty reviews of completed work. I think the class would also benefit from more engagement with other members of the sociology faculty, who could cycle through to give presentations or feedback on different aspects of research. Finally, I think the outlining of checkpoints for work over the course of the semester could be made more explicit and detailed in its expectations."

For those with the passion and dedication, I would absolutely recommend the yearlong thesis."
