                "This is a well-designed and engaging course covering Gothic cathedrals in France, Germany, and some other parts of Europe (e.g., Prague). You will learn about the art and architecture of the Middle Ages, and about its cultural history in general.",
                "I've learnt a lot about Gothic cathedrals and could appreciate Yale's architecture so much more.",
                "Learned about the details (stained glass, architecture, iconography, history etc.) of French and German gothic cathedrals and comparing these cathedrals against each other.",

                "The class achieves what it seems it set out to, to educate students on gothic architecture and place it within the canon of art history, religious history, and architectural history. It is very effective.",
                "Strengths: even if you are really new to art history and cathedrals, Prof Jung introduces the basics very clearly and will walk you through the basic structure of a Gothic cathedral, so don't worry if you do not have any experience or background (I did not, and it didn't feel like I'm way outside of my zone). We spend usually 2-3 lectures on one cathedral, so it is a really good amount of time to dive deep into one cathedral and learn about how Gothic it is and compare it with others we have studied in class. The organization is more chronological, so you will also see how the Gothic form has changed and shifted. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: coming into the class, I was worried that the topic is too niche (as someone not an art history\/ architecture major). It can sometimes feel like there is too much detailed information about a particular cathedral that I'm not that interested in learning about. But overall I think I learned a lot from the class, and if I were given the choice, I would choose to take it again.",
                "Lectures were excellent, and assignments were manageable and interesting. One of the great things about the class is that the cathedrals are not just taught from an architectural perspective. Stained glass, sculpture, wood carving, and other media are also explored.",
                "strength: lectures are super well taught \r\nweakness: workload is a bit high (there is final exam + final paper)",
                "I loved seeing the close up pictures and different insights of the cathedrals.  I wish we could spend more time on each of the cathedrals, but Professor Jung did an incredible job of explaining each cathedral in detail, while keeping the class at a good pace.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- very well-presented and engaging\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- would have appreciated greater material on non-French cathedrals though entirely understandable given gothic history and the limited nature of the course",
                "strengths: Professor Jung loves her topic and it's wonderful to be in her lectures. lectures were recorded and slides and readings were available on canvas.\r\nweaknesses: lectures could be a bit long and many cathedrals started to blend together (though probably not a fault of the course, rather just a pattern of cathedrals)"

                "Any student interested in medieval art history, gothic art and architecture, or art or architectural history at large, absolutely. It is a wonderful survey of the aesthetic development of the Catholic church and its structures.",
                "YES! Relatively chill class, except when you need to write the essays. A very good class to learn about the Gothic form and cathedrals. From this class, I also indirectly learned a lot about Catholicism.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in cathedral architecture, the Middle Ages, or just art history in general. Beyond the period specifically covered by the course, you will learn how to understand and appreciate visual media.",
                "Yes. Prof is very passionate about the subject and the Beinecke visit was super meaningful.",
                "Yes!  Professor Jung is an incredible lecturer, and if you want to learn more about these fantastic cathedrals, this is an great class to take.",
                "YES! As a non-HSAR major, this class was a blast. I learned so much about these beautiful works of art and indulging in the Gothic style every Tuesday and Thursday made the Gothic architecture of Yale stand out to me, which was an amazingly fulfilling part of the class. Thanks to this class, I appreciate the buildings of Yale so much moreand Gothic in general.",
                "Yes, for students interesting in learning about gothic architecture and art. I would recommend it as a class for students interesting in taking a course in both disciplines, but only if the interest in gothic cathedrals is already there.",
                "yes, even if they know nothing about Gothic cathedrals, this class will make you appreciate them!",
                "yes, if you like gothic cathedrals and art history! Lectures can be a bit long though because there is no discussion section (although that could be a reason to take the class, if you don't enjoy discussion sections). You'll get exposure to many gothic cathedrals throughout europe, including the history of their conception and the art within them (stained glass, sculpture, gothic screens, etc.). You'll also learn how to read and write about gothic cathedrals."
