                "From this class, I have gained so much educational knowledge (specifically about global health) and honed in various professional skills. Throughout the semester, I was able to read many case studies on how TB high-burden countries had responded to the COVID pandemic, understand the global health financing system at the international, national, and local levels and across diseases, and navigate the global health landscape and stakeholders in it. As someone pursuing a career in consulting post-graduation, this class has set me up for success!",
                "Learned a lot about tuberculosis and its transmission, but mainly a lot about punctuality, slide creation, presentation skills, and interviewing, along with data analysis. It is very good preparation for having a job post-graduation.",
                "I think the capstone really is the most pre-professional course you could take at Yale. \r\n\r\nTeamwork, how to build a compelling and useful PowerPoint deck, thinking in terms of deliverables and value...it's rare to find classes that offer you a glimpse into the working world in such a short amount of time.",
                "We started by learning a lot about the global health system, the issues it is currently facing (notably in the COVID-19 era), and the policy formation process. Later on, we learned a lot of hard and soft skills related to problem-solving, research, and consulting work, notably deck building, narrative formation, and data analysis and visualization. It was a great opportunity to also present in front of, and solicit feedback from experts in the field and executives at our client non-profit organization. Finally, it taught me a lot about team work, effective communication, and how to best make one's work count in a group setting."

            "comments": [
                "The strength is Shan. Shan pushed me to become a better student every week. From her facilitation, I have grown so much as a student. Specifically, I have applied the knowledge and statistical skills acquired throughout the GLBL major requirements and integrated them into the project's research process. I have also developed essential career skills like project management, teamwork, and effective communication. Lastly, it has allowed me to think more critically about the global health sphere, specifically TB, and how to creatively develop solutions for problems surrounding the disease, primarily for people in low-to-middle-income countries. Very very meaningful work! The only weakness I can think of is the teamwork nature of the class. Since it is a group capstone, some people will put more effort into it than others, which can sometimes be frustrating, especially around crunch time.",
                "The professor provided strong feedback and kept us all engaged from early on, I just wish grading schematics would have been made clear from the beginning, also given that the time required to be put into this capstone was greater than that of all other capstones in global affairs.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Soe-Lin by a mile. She is so dedicated to making this capstone a meaningful learning experience for all of her students. The guidance, structure, and discipline she brings to the semester-long process are so invaluable. She also brings us lovely pastries for class, huge bonus. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It will be difficult if you're not a morning person; sometimes, we would have very early group meetings outside of class.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is Professor Soe-Lin, who is entirely focused on building your skills and building you up as a potential leader. She did a fantastic job of setting us up for success from the beginning, providing space to check in and solicit bi-directional feedback, and leveraging her connections and talents to obtain access to leaders in the field whom we could learn from. She created a great environment for our team to work together productively and bond. Know that this project will take an immense amount of time  if you are doing it right. There may be multiple decks and publications a week due, multiple meetings outside of class, and an overall aggressive timeline to getting the bulk of the work done. There were a few bumps along the way, including a learning curve on mutual expectations regarding what was expected at each meeting, and figuring out how to best present our work as both individuals and a team. But, it was an extremely rewarding experience that I would recommend to anyone even remotely interested in public policy, global health, and the non-profit/IGO space."

            "comments": [
                "YES YES YES. As a senior, I could not have asked for a better academic experience to encapsulate my Global Affairs major. From writing papers for publication, having the opportunity to interview global health scholars from all over the world, and briefing our clients and classmates on policy recommendations and data findings, I have improved so much as a communicator, a writer, and, most importantly, a student. Ultimately, compared to other capstone groups, our group has the most well-thought-out research with concrete quantitative data models to defend our tangible policy recommendations. As someone from a country deeply impacted by tuberculosis, I was moved by the impact we could make on people across the globe. I would retake this class if I could!",
                "the workload in this course is the highest among the capstones in regards to time implemented into the project. Only do it if you are looking to be proud of the work you have accomplished, but also looking to spend a lot of time towards the work weekly.",
                "It's the capstone, you have to take it. But I think there's no doubt in my mind that if you have to rank one first, rank whatever Dr. Soe-Lin is teaching first. \r\n\r\nIt's easy to look at previous years' reviews and be scared of the workload; trust me, I was. But really, the way Shan structures it, it's a whole semester of steady work to avoid a mad dash at the end of the semester. To the best of my knowledge, we were the only capstone group that had our main findings solidified by October, while some other groups were still struggling to determine a research question. You will feel like you are working far more than your peers at the start of the semester, but it is so worth it to have a stress-free finals season and be able to dedicate more time to your other classes.",
                "Yes! Walking away from this experience, there is no other capstone project that I would have rather completed. Professor Soe-Lin alone is worth being able to work alongside, given her dedication to pushing students to become better researchers, presenters, and leaders, and the welcoming environment she created for our team and project to flourish. I'm walking away having learned not just about the topics that we touched on within our capstone research, but about public policy, consulting, and leadership as a whole. Make sure that you are able to give the project the time that it deserves, as it is truly a special experience."
