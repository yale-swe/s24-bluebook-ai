I also gained a good overview of the texts we read, and learned what to focus on when reading and discussing texts. I also learned tat there can be multiple acceptable interpretations of a text, and that it is important to talk about them.",
                "I learnt a lot about how history influences the present, and of multiple different approaches that historians have had to history as well",
                "I was challenged to develop insightful, evidence based interpretations of the texts we read throughout the year. Discussion posts challenged me to contribute to class discussions through posing questions, not always giving answers. As a result my reading comprehension skills and argumentative skills (both through speaking and writing) improved drastically.",
                "History of Greece and Rome.",
                "To be honest, the skill I learned was how to read a lot of text in a short amount of time and synthesize a few key points to talk about even if I did not understand the majority of the reading. I'm glad I had the chance to read books I never would have read on my own time.",
                "Read a lot of exceptional books that I wouldn't have otherwise read, or even thought of reading. Tacitus, Thucydides, Herodotus, Livy, and Plutarch are real highlights, and Professor Barasch did an incredible job of conveying the value of each of them.",
                "I learned about various ways to approach history and political science, from Herodotus approach of valuing culture and customs to Plutarch and Tacitus more individualized and interpersonal outlooks on power and autocracy.",
                "Handp helped me become a more focused writer, helping me write essays which are tightly oriented around the prompt. I had trouble, initially, in the realm of trying to write essays which were not purple and actually argumentative, and this class helped me through that struggle.",
                "Professor Barasch taught me how to approach the texts with a blank slate so that they could leave their imprint on me. I learned how to avoid my tendency to easily reject particular texts because of my own predispositions, and I will take that lesson with me in all future classes. He was an incredibly smart and compassionate teacher who carefully crafted the lesson plans to teach us how to read well and thoroughly.",

                "Overall, it was fine. Please send an email before beginning the week of the natural slavery debate to prep people and show that you understand its implications. I know we'll read Douglass next semester, but hearing that natural slavery is \"just a concept\" is jarring.",
                "I thought the seminar format was really strong for this course  we discussed a lot of interesting/relevant topics",
                "I really enjoyed this course and how discussions went.",
                "Strengths: \r\nEncouraged back and forth discussion between students without a professor to moderate at all times which led to engaging discussion sections. Was very welcoming and encouraged everyone to contribute their ideas without fear of judgement. Discussion posts were challenging but helpful in terms of forming well articulated ideas about the texts. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nDiscussions sections sometimes felt a bit unstructured and difficult to follow. This could be improved by providing students with some idea of what passages will be discussed at length before the discussion starts.",
                "Strengths: Barasch, the history texts. Weaknesses: The Augustine reading.",
                "I truly did not understand half of what I was reading--the class went by too fast and there was so much information to remember and process that it was basically impossible. When it came to exams, I also had no idea what to study for because there was simply too much content (too many names, too many battles, too many discourses.)",
                "Strengths: Most of the readings were great; the lectures are absolutely superb. Professor Barasch is wonderful -- funny, kind, forgiving, but deeply deeply knowledgable. I loved his lecture on Plutarch and Caesar.\r\nWeaknesses: 'Historical and political thought' is a pretty vague category, and sometimes one had to stretch a bit to see how a few readings fit into it. I thought the coverage of a lot of the Christian works, apart from Exodus and Genesis, was a little weak. I also think it would be amazing if broader, survey-course-style history was taught in concordance with learning history via a few primary sources. It's sometimes hard to get a real sense of the sweep of history, and what exactly is going on in the context of the books, if one's only source of knowledge is the books themselves. For example, it would have been nice to have learned about the whole Greco-Persian war from a textbook or a lecture, in addition to reading excerpts from Herodotus' interpretations of it. Being able to better understand the 'great books' within their historical context would make it easier to understand their political and intellectual implications.",
                "I enjoyed the course material, and I especially liked when the material was made available to us as digital copies. I hope Directed Studies can provide more flexibility and affordability with the course texts in the future, whether its making more texts available on Canvas or subsidizing book-buying. I also think that there could be more of an emphasis on the political science aspect of the course; it focuses quite heavily on history, and there is less emphasis on writers views on various political systems.",
                "There were no weaknesses with the class. The professor used the canvas discussion posts to get us all involved in the class, and we were all encouraged to participate actively. I never felt discouraged from raising my hand out of some fear that I would be wrong. Though my interpretations of the texts were likely misplaced sometimes, the professor and my classmates always wanted to hear what I had to say. I loved every second of the class.",
                "I think the course did a great job of improving students writing regarding historical and political texts.  But I do think that sometimes the readings assigned were too long given how dense the content was, it was often difficult to give each reading the attention it deserved given the length.",
                "I think the intellectual rigor of the discussions was very high and the sophistication of thought made for a super interesting course. However, I think a little more structure in the discussions would have allowed students to grasp the main concepts and ideas of each text in a more complete way."

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The discussions held were always very interesting and engaging, and brought insights to the texts that I had not considered previously. Professor Barasch is great at directing the discussion towards interesting and complex points in the texts, and then leads it well, while allowing students to say what they think.",
                "Yes absolutely. The texts themselves are significant and well selected. The discussion sections very interesting and the other students who take this class are engaged and offer great insights. The variety of lectures means lectures are always fresh and captivating.",
                "DS is good. Barasch is a great section leader  he facilitated high levels of contribution and engagement. You'll likely be expected to write one discussion post a week.",
                "No. I feel like you can learn the same information in other classes focusing on one author (i.e. Thucydides) and gain a much better understanding instead of speeding through it as we did in DS. Half the time I did not understand why what we were discussing was important, and many students liked to bring up a point and only talk about that to make themselves seem smarter. Listening in class and in lecture is helpful, but I truly had no idea what was going on when I was doing my readings.",
                "I recommend Professor Barasch unreservedly. Partway through the semester I realized that he knew far more about the texts than he was letting on; he intentionally led each seminar as if he was starting from scratch, working through the texts with the students, so that the class ended up teaching eachother the material and coming to an understanding of the work as a group. It was so much more effective and rewarding to learn this way than to be told directly what the right answer was. Professor Barasch's method of teaching has given me a roadmap for how to read, analyze, and extract value from other books --- particularly archaic and difficult ones --- in the future. I'm unbelievably grateful.\r\n \r\nI recommend Directed Studies if you are sure you will be able and willing to do the readings each week -- and that you'll enjoy doing them. Maybe pull up a pdf of one of the books on the syllabus before signing up for the class and take a look through it. If it's really difficult to get through, the course may not be for you --- although, that being said, if you force yourself to do the readings, I think you'll find that the DS professors are pretty good at conveying why the books matter, and why they're so great.",
                "Yes, I think this is a great introduction to the historical and cultural trends in the Western Canon, from the glory that Greek and Roman warriors sought to the inward goodness that religious authors such as Augustine taught.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class because the professor was so amazing! Not only was he extremely knowledgeable and well spoken, but he was also funny! He made it a joy to go to class, and made the environment relaxed, friendly, and productive. Im going to miss his jokes that always made me laugh and appreciate the DS program.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course.  It provides a fascinating overview of classical historians and does a great job of focusing on the bits of philosophical insight and outside characterizations added by the historians.",
                "I would recommend DS H&P if you want to become well-versed in the history of literature and the Western intellectual tradition and are prepared to make the best out of a program that requires a lot of compromises between the amount of reading you do, the quality of essays you write, and aspects of your personal well-being such as sleep and social life. It is possible to do it all successfully, but sometimes one of these aspects has to be sacrificed to an extent and that's OK. The important thing is to learn to recognize when it is worth it to sacrifice which."
