The weaknesses of the course was that we were responsible for memorizing a lot of vocabulary and grammar rules while also having a large amount of homework each night, making it very challenging to both study the material we learned while also completing the work expected of us daily. Additionally, we were responsible for topics covered in the textbook and expected to understand these topics and answer questions about them in class without learning much about them in class. We also started speaking mostly Spanish during class very quickly. It was often hard to understand what the teacher was saying, making it hard to know what was asked of us so early on. Additionally, having test instructions in Spanish was challenging because it was often hard to know what was being expected of us on each assessment."
