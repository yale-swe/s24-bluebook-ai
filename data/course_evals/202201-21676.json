While it wasn't necessarily work that is going to be published, it was super valuable to design my own senior research from start to finish. It also gave me specific insight into how activated carbon and biochar can be used as a water filter.",

                "I think that the fact the structure is left up to the student and the PI is both a positive and a negative. It was a plus because it allowed me to construct my own project with my own timeline, but I think it could have some more set goals that make me feel like I am keeping pace and have more direction. It is tough because providing more regulation could take away from some of the flexibility, but I think that it should maybe become a little more structured overall. Perhaps a meeting with the DUS\/faculty before the start of the semester would be beneficial, as it would give us a picture of what should be completed over the course of the project.",
                "I really enjoyed working with the team most of the semester. The only thingat 5pm the night before my report was due (my report was essentially finished at the time) I was informed that the data I had been provided was wrong and unusable and I needed to find new data. So I ended up spending quite literally 12 consecutive hours gathering new data, performing new analyses, and writing basically a new report.",
                "Strengths: I loved Prof Gentner as an advisor  he was incredibly supportive and encouraging at all steps. The department is also very flexible about the direction\/shape of the project, which is helpful your senior year.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I definitely wouldve appreciate more information about deadlines\/deliverables earlier in the semester."
