                "This class was amazing. If you are lucky enough to get a spot, TAKE IT. Professor Van Doren is one of the best teachers I've ever had at Yale. He welcomes students of all levels, and his feedback is extraordinarily helpful, thoughtful, and compassionate regardless of student experience. This class was so unbelievably fun.",
                "The class was relaxed and quite low-stakes, but not particularly enjoyable or engaging.",
                "strengths: students paint both in class and for homework, we were able to go outside during warm days to paint different parts of Yale which was very nice, Adam Van Doren is an excellent professor with a sense of humor///// weaknesses: for the final exhibition, I wish students had a choice for the pieces that were displayed and that people's paintings were displayed in an equal manner (everyone displays the same number of paintings), I also wish we were able to track our grade throughout the course",
                "Super fun",
                "Students are given the flexibility to try different styles and are asked to produce a large and small watercolor each week which helps you get into the medium. That being said, class could be a bit long with lots of tangents. I wish there were more specific assignments to hone certain skills.",
                "Strengths: I really liked the small class size and how we learned the techniques of famous watercolorists and then painted on our own during class. I felt that the structure of the course really helped students improve. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It is a bit unclear how you are doing in the class in terms of grades.",
                "Strength is that the subject itself was very fun and interesting and Prof Van Doren is wonderful! A weakness however is the structure of class, I wish we had more time to actually paint during class"

            "comments": [
                "YES",
                "No, I would not. I was interested in a fun watercolor class to learn a new skill, but most of the class would be the professor talking about artists and vaguely talking about their work without teaching the students how to actually do the technique. While there were a few technique based lessons, they were very basic techniques at the beginning of the semester and we were just on our own after that, basically. If you're looking for an art history class with some painting involved, I think this class is fine, but it's definitely not a studio class. Also, the requirement of 2 paintings per week ended up feeling like such a chore.",
                "Yes!!! This course was very fun and I learned a lot!! I recommend everyone to take this course and not be intimidated by learning new things",
                "It makes sense that this class is a college seminar, not part of the art department, because it is a lot more chill than most other art courses at Yale. Crits are very low stakes and the environment in general is pretty laid back. Prof. Van Doren is extremely talented and knowledgeable, so it would have been nice for him to do more direct lessons where he teaches specific painting skills/techniques. I feel like most of my progress in this class was from practicing a lot by myself on my own time... not much learning happened in the classroom. So, you definitely only get out as much as you put in. But overall it's a super fun way to escape from your other heavy workload courses and turn your brain off for a few hours a week.",
                "Yea for sure super fun and pretty light. Even if youre not great at art",
                "This is a pretty relaxed and fun course to try something new. The lectures could be a bit disorganized and I wanted a bit more structure to the assignments.",
                "Definitely! I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot about watercolor! I looked forward to class each week and felt that I greatly improved over the course of the semester.",
                "Yes, but keep in mind that the workload is likely more than you think it will be. We had to produce 2-3 watercolor paintings a week, which was more time intensive than I expected"
