There were multiple instances where we had to spend more than an hour listening to and handwriting down 20+ sentences for homework, only to repeat the same exact process because the professor wanted to also see the sentences written in the online platform. Get ready to do a lot of useless work.",

                "I think the asynchronous class days weren't as helpful as they could have been.",
                "Strengths: The classroom community was very strong, and I appreciated the amount of support the teacher offered outside of class in office hours. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Giving us more time to review old material would be great."
