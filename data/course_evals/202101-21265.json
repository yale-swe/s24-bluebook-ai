She is excellent at engaging with student's thoughts, but also makes sure to guide conversation to the key sections of the readings. The only improvement I might suggest is that perhaps the syllabus could be distinguished a little more from ENGL 120? I imagine quite some students take both classes, and a number of readings pop up on both.",

Always available to meet one-on-one.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we were able to get some more in-class writing exercises as I feel like I couldve gotten more valuable feedback.",

I would not reccoment this class to someone with a lot of other writing intensive classes; you will get more out of this class if you can focus your writing concentration here and really be able to make use of the professor's feedback."
