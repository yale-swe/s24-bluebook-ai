Beyond that, an opportunity to track the development of common themes and questions that have been occupying humanity and learn about the world through that -- love, relationships, insatiable desire for knowledge, power-dynamics, the impact of art, god, identity, reality vs. appearance/madness, human consciousness, memory, death and more."

                "Strengths: exciting, funny, educational\r\nWeaknesses: not many, wish there wasn't so much reading so that I could finish it all",
                "I don't completely agree with the curriculum we read this semester. Overall, DS literature is very strong, but it is odd to me that books such as Frankenstein, for instance, can be counted in the Western Cannon beside Hamlet and Don Quixote.",
                "Reading load can sometimes be too high, especially for the weeks with Don Quixote and Proust. Towards the end of the semester, it can be difficult to finish the readings.",
                "The main strength of the course is the syllabus. There isn't a single book on it that isn't worth your time. The lectures are unbelievably good; the best of them count among my fondest memories of this school year. Professor Bloch is brilliant, hilarious, joyful, and kind. Most of all, it's a real privilege to be able to take three courses with the same group of students. DS is an intellectual experience, but it's also a social one. By virtue of reading the same books, taking the same classes, and working on the same assignments as other DSers, you're likely to make some very close friends. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the schedule was a bit rushed this year. Spending only one and a half days on Hadji Murat was difficult, and very few students got through all of Omeros and Don Quixote.",
                "This class had great books, great discussion (largely thanks to the Professor and my classmates), and I enjoyed the opportunity to reflect on what I was reading with regular essays.",
                "Reading assignments could be better communicated in advance: I'd appreciate having them all on the syllabus document instead of only being transmitted verbally in-section.",
                "Strengths: A great selection of literary works\r\nWeaknesses: I think the part of the semester where we spend one day on \"Hadji Murat\", and then progress quickly through Proust and \"To the LightHouse\" (and then, again, one day on \"A Raisin in the Sun\") is far too rushed. It's impossible to read all of the books in full. I think the course could be improved by removing one of the works.",
                "The books are wonderful, the students were engaged and Professor Bloch is an amazing instructor. He returned essays very promptly, was always available for office hours, and led class discussions that were intellectually engaging and enjoyable, sprinkling in humor and his own astute insights about literature and life without stifling student contribution."

Blochs seminars are always a blast, filled with deliciously out-of-pocket quips and observations that change your view of the world. I would often come out of seminar with my mind buzzing with a unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Dont believe me? See for yourself",
                "Yes, for any student who is passionate about literature and wants to be able to write, think, and read at a high level.",
                "Yes, the texts are interesting in that they take an inward/psychological turn which is very different from the texts we read in Fall DS.",
                "Yes, absolutely. DS requires hard work, but it's work that makes life more worth living.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed all of the books and the Professor. Essays were not too long and we knew when they were due well in advance, so preparing to write was not overwhelming.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes! If you're in DS, you have to take Literature, but I would highly recommend Bloch's section!",
                "I would recommend that any freshman interested in a well-rounded view of the Humanities participate in the DS program. The program as a whole provides a space and a community for those to explore the works that are foundational to our society. The beauty of the course comes not at the beginning, but at the end, when students are able to look back from the vantage point of understanding and enlightenment they have received over the course of their two semesters of enrollment. Beyond the knowledge the course provides, it is a great way to make friends in your first year, a time when securing relationships is incredibly important. DS builds in relationships from Day one with its shared classes and lectures, both of which are taught by world-class professors with incredibly deep knowledge of their subjects. Taking DS was definitely the best academic decision I made my freshman year.",
                "Wholeheartedly! DS all around was a transformative experience for me and this section was one of my favorites of the entire year. The books were superb, the discussions were fun, informative and interesting and Professor Bloch is phenomenal!"
