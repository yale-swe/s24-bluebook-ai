For instance, I got familiar with new schemes such as PLONK, FRI IOPP, the KZG polynomial commitment scheme. I learned how to write custom circuits for ZK-proof compilation in circom, a circuit-scripting language. I also developed a good understanding of common compilation paradigms for ZK-SNARKs, originating from PCPs, linear IOPs, PIOPs, etc.",
                "I learned about a variety of topics relating to zero-knowledge proofs.  I learned about both the theoretical foundations of zero-knowledge proofs and a number of applications.  The course covered recent research, including some papers that had been published within the last three years."

                "The teaching quality of this course is very high, but the difficulty is also very high. It would be better if the instructor can take a longer time on some basic concepts and explain in a more mathematical way, since we did not have much intuition at the beginning of the course.",
                "The release of HW can be improved",
                "The course covers a wide range of ZKP work from some basic building blocks including those cryptographic primitives, to real-world protocols and applications. The weakness is that I cannot see clear bonds connecting those pieces; many supplementary works are needed to fully digest the lecture slides. Moreover, some definitions are not that formal (ps: it would also be nice to see more variants). I understand this might be due to the course time constraint and the instructor also needs to make the texts on slides easy to process. So this is purely personal thought that I would enjoy more if all parameters, variables, hardness assumptions, etc, are clearly given.",
                "The course topic is interesting. However, we got too much homework at the end of the semester and no homework at the beginning of the semester. The homework itself is good, but we just hope we could get them during the semester and help us to understand the course material. The lecture is also hard to follow.",
                "Strengths: \r\nThe course material was well-selected and covered most recent literature in zk-snarks. It covered a wide range of topics at the right depth, so that students can go on to further explore each topic as they wish, while still having a good understanding of the main techniques\/concepts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nHomework sets and assignments could be more spread-out during the semester.",
                "Professor Fisch is extremely knowledgeable about ZK proofs. However, he often loses the first for the trees. We went into a lot of detail but got kind of lost on the goal of the technical detail.",
                "There were multiple times during the semester when the professor spent multiple days explaining all the technical details of a single research paper.  Whenever this happened, I found the material hard to follow.  It was easy to lose track of the big picture.  I don't mind covering recent research papers in detail, but not all of the detail provided in the lectures may have been necessary."

The workload is a lot in the case that even though we only have two problem sets, there might be in total 100 questions we need to solve, each requires us to read through half to one page problem prompts, among some are even not directly taught in class.",
