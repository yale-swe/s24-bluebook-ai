I learned a lot about different scientific topics ranging from co-generation technology to artificial intelligence. I gained a great amount of insight from hearing from guest speakers like President Levin or the guest speaker from IBM; hearing from them about their work was really interesting.",

                "Strengths: final project allows for you to choose the topic you want to dive into.",
                "Strengths -- is a seminar and group final project helps you become closer to classmates \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- students do not talk in this seminar. It is basically a lecture. Absolutely minimal public policy discussion even though in course title and description. Lack of engagement. Professor goes off on tangents. Topics are repetitive. \r\n\r\nHow to improve -- engage with students. Let them talk and discuss. Allow for students to have their own opinions",
                "I would say the strength of the course was the professor. Professor Prober is quite knowledgeable and accomplished in the subject matter which he teaches; I certainly learned a lot of content. Additionally, the guest speaking element of the course was a strength as well; hearing from real-life and high-accomplished leaders in modern technology was quite interesting, fun, and meaningful. I also enjoyed the group project at the end of the year as it gave us flexibility and creative freedom to explore topics of interest.\r\n\r\nIn terms of weakness, I think the class was more structured as a lecture; I think if there was more class interaction and activities that may be better.",
                "I think it is a little weak in the immersiveness. A lot of the time it felt like he was talking at us, but it was clear that he was very educated and passionate about the topic. The strengths are that I think the psets are well designed and I like the guest lectures.",
                "Very boring but very easy",
                "Strength: speaker series and the guests who have experience with the topics we discussed in class.",
                "Strengths: This class offered a lot of educational trips across Yale's campus from checking out Kroon hall to the Yale powerplant. Also, I found some of the outside speakers to be very informative as I was able to learn about how their line of work relates to what I was learning from the lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were frequently hard to pay attention to for long periods of time.",
                "This course is very weak. For a first year seminar, it is remarkably disengaging. The  content that is shown could be made to be much more exciting and could also be covered in a fourth of the time. Its also not a seminar, but rather a lecture built on unrelated tangents and on the absolute worship of Kroon Hall. Professor Prober is a kind man but a tedious lecturer, and is clearly a physicist, not a social scientist. Policy was barely mentioned in this course, and when it was, it was with a very uncritical approach."

                "Its a good course for students who need a science credit and want some freedom as to what they want to deep dive into for the final project.",
                "Yes, it's not really a gut science, but one easy in workload and relatively easy to get an A- or A. There's 3 PSETS and just a final presentation, would take if looking for easy sci credit",
                "No. Do not take unless you are absolutely certain you like these kinds of topics. Most of the semester is spent on stuff like trains and cars then you go into AI and that's about it. Also mainly about energy (like using renewable over fossil fuels, etc.). It is not worth the frustration and being bored.",
                "I would because it was a great science credit for students that are non-STEM majors; it was pretty accessible to learn in that regard. I'm not a STEM major, and I enjoyed this class as there was not a steep learning curve as there might have been in other STEM classes.",
                "Yes, I actually learned a lot and the psets weren't too bad. The professor is well educated on the topics. They are interesting but can be boring at times.",
                "Yes if you want easy science credit",
                "Yes, nice science credit for students, who don't have a strong science background.",
                "Its an easy science credit, but it is not as interesting as it sounds. In a fit of hubris I thought the class was going to treat the intersection of natural and social science but this was very far from the case. The homework is only hand-wavingly related to what was said in class and the slides are nearly incomprehensible. For those who want to take it: seek within yourself how many hours of your life are you willing to lose in exchange of a mindless science credit."
