                "Math 118 was by far my favorite class this semester. I learned the basics of Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Optimization, all in the context of the social sciences, especially economics. The course moves at an excellent pace, truly allowing the students to comprehend all of the material and have adequate time to do so. I really cannot hype this class up enough. I absolutely loved it, and I learned a lot of practical applications of math that I otherwise wouldn't have known how to do.",
                "I learned how to calculate partial derivatives and combine them with linear algebra to solve constrained optimization problems. The class was structured in a way that everything was tackled bit by bit and the final few weeks werent difficult because of this.",

                "Strong problem solving skill development.",

            "comments": [
                "I felt that the course sometimes moved on too quickly without connecting what we're learning and explaining how it fits into the mathematical field.",
                "The strengths are that the material is taught at a slow, forgiving pace, the math is taught in such a way that highlights its social science applications, and the math itself is very comprehendible. I hate math, and yet, this was my favorite class this semester. I honestly don't believe it has any weaknesses, but I suppose for people wanting to pursue a STEM career\/take higher level math classes, this class wouldn't do the trick. It covers multi\/linear pretty broadly, and there's a lot of material not covered in this class that is covered in Math 120 and 225. However, for people interested in Econ and other less-advanced-math majors, this class is the absolute best.",
                "Strengths:\r\nMihai was a brilliant professor. Super kind and always happy to help. The course was very well structured and the worksheets with the problem sets were usually pretty good preparation. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI wish there was more weightage given to the homework assignments and that we had more sample papers to practice from. I also wish that questions involving matching graphs and contours or true and false questions didnt feature in the tests. Its really easy to lose many points for simply getting the wrong answer in a true\/false case and that seems disproportionate.",
                "Mihai is a great instructor and keeps the class engaged. He explains concepts well and offers guidance in office hours.",
                "Strengths: Small class, so it is easier for me to understand what is going.  The worksheets provided in class helps me understand how every concept is applied.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Learning two separate math fields in one semester can be confusing at times.",
                "Overall, I think the course was designed very well. I think we learned both how to computationally do our problems and why our processes worked. I think the course could have gone even faster, as I almost wish I learned some more elements to multivariable calculus such as double or triple integrals.",
                "Strengths: The professor is passionate about what he teaches.\r\nWeaknesses: The material is a bit all over the place because you are learning two different disciplines.",
                "Its quite simple and is not very challenging. This is both a strength and a weakness obviously.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Great instructor. Provided enough motivation underlying the content given the limited available.\r\n- Solid homework schedule. Assignments helped students keep up with the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- More time developing more complicated material, such as eigenvalues and their significance with respect to the Hessian matrix.",
                "Strengths: small class size, classes were very structured with the worksheets, I liked that we were able to work with other students in the class, learn material and then immediately put it into practice, etc.",
                "The strength in this course is the amount of resources available. The feedback I receive has helped me greatly in preparing for exams as well as reinforcing my knowledge. I always received very quick responses to questions and the instructor went above and beyond to address student needs. For example, he had many office hours throughout the week and was willing to meet with students outside those hours when requested.",
                "Concepts are taught in a lecture style, which are pretty straightforward. Sometimes lectures go by too quickly, so it can become easy to fall behind.",
                "I think it was really good, it just a personal problem that I didn't understand the material sometimes.",
                "Professor Mihai was a wonderful instructor for this course. It was clear that he planned every class with diligence and he was always very positive in class. He always answered our questions and paid attention to each students' needs. His office hours were very helpful. The problem sets and tests were appropriately challenging."

                "Yes, but I definitely wouldn't look at this as a gut. It is quite hard and the grading is quite strict. I ended up with a good grade but I often didn't do well despite answering the question right.",
                "Absolutely. This class is absolutely amazing, and I cannot recommend it enough. Mihai is an absolutely amazing professor, and he makes learning math fun. In addition, the material is relatively easy to understand, and it covers enough breadth to really help students pursuing math-related degrees that aren't hard STEM.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student looking to take higher-level economics such as Econ 121 and Econ 122. Those classes, specifically 121, are mathematically rigorous, and this class establishes the formal background necessary for a smooth transition.",
                "Yes, if you are an Econ major.",
                "I supposed. Youll learn more in math 120, but this is easier and more tangible.",
                "Yes - this course is a fast-paced introduction to linear algebra and multivariable calculus.",
                "absolutely! I think I learned the most in this class than in any of my other classes this semester. I think the structure of the class was incredible to facilitate learning, and I enjoyed that we were able to ask the professor questions and work on practice problems while being taught the material.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if it is with Mihai. This course will make you enjoy learning math again!"
