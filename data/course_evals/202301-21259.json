Content-wise, we looked at a breadth of documents that traced the progression of immigration policy in the United States from the early 1600s to the present. We explored policy at the movement/local, state, federal, and international levels, and analyzed the many stakeholders in immigration policy.",

                "I gained such an expansive view of immigration policy. In a relatively short time, we covered major historical movements and periods in immigration history. More importantly, my historical writing improved exponentially. Dr. Shanahan gives the best feedback and always makes himself avaliable for office hours.",

                "Strengths: Everything! Dr. Shanahan is probably the best professor I have ever taken a course with. He truly cares for his students and wants to see us succeed. He's always readily available to meet for any reason, is excellent at leading discussions, and is truly an expert in his field; he can name sources, authors, and events off the top of his head. The syllabus is amazing, and for being so comprehensive, was nuanced and perfect for strong class discussions. Probably one of the best classes I have ever taken; everyone interested in history, immigration policy, or mixed methodology should take a class with Dr. Shanahan, even if you're not a history major! Weaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: Professor Shanahans care and deep knowledge of the course  everything from his weekly reading guide to his reading selections, workshop time to discuss our papers in class, class discussion, opportunities to meet with him in office hours to discuss our papers. Weaknesses: none.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly interesting subject matter that was diverse in its scholarly reach (lots of interesting articles from various fields). Dr. Shanahan is the real gem of this class -- he is great at leading discussion and knows everything about everything. Weaknesses: Sometimes, especially if people hadn't done the reading super closely, conversation got slow and Dr. Shanahan's leading questions were a bit too complex to really get discussion going. Hard to improve such a great class!",
                "The discussions can be a bit stilted/dry",
                "The assignments are great. I found that the class I enjoyed the most was the one where I had to lead the discussion, and I wonder if there are similar smaller assignments that might lead to greater engagement with the texts."

                "I would definitely recommend taking this course! It was awesome feeling like I finally understand immigration policy in the United States, and while I may not be a history major, came away from this course feeling like I learned so many applicable skills to my major's senior thesis. The content is clearly carefully selected, and Dr. Shanahan takes his job seriously. He deeply cared about everyone's success and wanted to see the class grow, succeed, and love the subject as much as he does. If you get the chance to take either this course or another one of Dr. Shanahan's courses, do it; it's a challenge and by no means easy, but it's 100% worth the work!",
                "Yes! Prof Shanahan is very dedicated and the content is very interesting.",
                "Yes! Absolutely! Everyone should take a class with Professor Shanahan! Especially if youre new to the history department, whether as a non major or major, I highly recommend taking his course to learn to write a term paper. I have applied what Ive learned in his classes to every single other history paper Ive written at Yale. Other professors sometimes expect you to just know how to write a 20+ page paper. Professor Shanahan lays out each step with achievable intermediary deadlines and many, many opportunities to ask for and receive support both from him and from your classmates.",
                "Yes! Especially if you are interested in immigration or American politics, it is really an awesome class. Super thorough, interesting, and complex.",
                "I would because the syllabus is interesting content",
                "Only if they are interested in immigration policy history. There is little focus on current immigration policy, which is to say that there is a lot of time spent on the 19th and 20th centuries."
