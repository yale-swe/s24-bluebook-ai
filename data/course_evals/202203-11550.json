                "I learned a lot about how to write effectively + use different techniques in order to pull the reader in and keep them engaged\/reading! I also learned about interviewing people\/writing about a person, writing about a place, and writing humor.",
                "It was enlightening to read essays for every class and discuss what we thought was effective or not effective. We also put that into practice through the essays over the semester.",

                "Great class, all the essays take a decent amount of time to write. Assignments are spaced out fairly and feedback is generally pretty good and grades are fair.",
                "Strengths: spectacular class engagement, great feedback on essays, brilliant and friendly instructor.  Papers are very efficiently spaced out, and though they are somewhat long there are only four (a fifth optional).  Readings are short, but there's very robust in-class analysis of them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not a fan of handing back rough draft comments and final paper grades in the order they were received.  The difference between submitting an essay at 8:30 and 11:30 the night it's due can be the difference between getting comments back the next day or weeks out.  I don't think it matters for paper grades, but I found myself rushing the rough drafts so I could get my feedback in time, since my first draft of my first essay was returned 48 hours before the final draft was due.  This is a small point though.",
                "This was a pretty laidback English seminar where we sat and talked about really interesting articles (that I enjoyed reading\/might have read anyways). Near the end, it did get a little less exciting\/the type of writing (esp. New Yorker writing) got a little repetitive, but the articles were still pretty interesting. A strength was also the grading system - for each essay (of four), we wrote a first draft (*ungraded*!) that we then got feedback on for the graded final draft. I was able to get a lot of personalized feedback",
                "I think the structure and goals of the course are excellent. At times I felt like I wasn't getting much feedback about my own writing, but I think the skillset that this class tries to develop is important and useful for everyone.",
                "strengths - adam is a great instructor and makes everyone feel included and welcomed in the classroom. \r\nweaknesses - some of the readings i just did not like, or found a little questionable\/problematic, like \"blot out\" and the \"city of refugees\" excerpts.",
                "For the most part, manageable workload and deadlines. Enjoyable readings and lively class discussions. Some weaknesses include how the course schedule could change suddenly and a couple readings that were assigned were never discussed in class.",
                "Strengths: constant writing, structured workshop format that was very useful, feedback on all submitted writing, interesting readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this class is mostly taken by first years and that skews the discussion a lot",
                "Strengths are well spaced assignments, opportunities for extra credit, peer feedback, and multiple drafts before receiving a final grade for an assignment. Weaknesses were feeling like doing the reading outside of class was pointless sometimes because we would spend time in class reading them anyway.",
                "Strengths: Excellent reading material, compelling discussions, manageable workload",
                "Strengths: the readings we did in class, most of the essay topics were fun to write about\r\nWeaknesses: the essay on a cultural criticism was kind of dumb in my opinion. It was hard to write about and to even come up with topics for. Sometimes due dates felt very rushed which created unnecessary stress.",
                "As a general course, I think English 120 can be incredibly varied by professor. In my particular class, the conversations fostered by the professor were fantastic and helpful."

                "Yes, even as a Senior I greatly enjoyed this class. It's a fun and different type of writing than research papers. It's fun to peer-review others' works and discuss as a class. Prof. Sexton is absolutely incredible- I think he really made the class the fun experience that it was.",
                "This course should be a requirement for Yale undergraduates.  The ability to write well is incredibly important in any field.  English 120 manages to teach a wide breadth of writing skills in just four assignments and a couple of weekly readings (short and entertaining).  It's very personal and small -- my section was tight-knit and developed rapport pretty quickly, something Prof Sexton certainly facilitated.  This class is very much get-what-you-give -- you can quickly write drafts, forget them until the final draft is due, quickly amend them based on the professor's feedback, and call it a day.  But you won't learn much, and you will not get a good grade for the class (no more than half the class can receive an A or A- in the course -- don't take this as a GPA gut if you don't want to try!)  It's hard not to engage with this course though -- the professor is excellent, the assignments are interesting and open-ended, and the class time is fun.  It's hard not to love this course; I would say it has been my favorite course at Yale thus far.",
                "Yes, if you're looking for an introduction to English seminars at Yale, a writing credit, or a place to just talk about articles like \"The Trouble With Wilderness\" and \"In Defense of Casual Sex\". The topics for the papers you write are also really interesting",
                "One hundred percent, yes. Professor Sexton makes class very enjoyable and productive, and I always felt like I learned things about writing after each class. Generally speaking I found the readings in class insightful, and the essays were fun to write. Given that the class focuses on applicable writing skills and helping us become better writers, the skills learned from this class can benefit anyone, especially those that come from majors where writing isn't a huge component of what they do.",
                "yes!!!!",
                "Yes if they enjoy creative writing. I mistakenly thought this was a course that would help me develop my academic\/analytical writing.",
                "I cant speak to other sections, but I would definitely recommend with Professor Sexton. He gives lots of feedback and has very structured workshop classes and discussions with clear goals. Its a fun class and it improves your writing.",
                "Yes, Im so happy I took this course! Prof. Sexton is incredible, passionate, and very understanding. He will want to build a relationship with you and will truly help you grow as both a writer and a person.",
                "Yes, it really helped develop my foundation for writing in general.",
                "Yes. It was a different style of writing than I had ever done before I enjoyed writing most of the essays. The workload isn't too bad and all of the readings are short.",
                "Yesespecially to students who are looking to get more into creative writing at an accessible level."
