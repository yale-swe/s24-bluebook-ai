                "This course introduced me to a history of segregation and education in the US (e.g. land theft, carceral systems, environmental racism, segregation within the classroom, etc)  as well as a history of resistance movements organizing for educational justice/equity. Some skills I gained from this course include an ability to read/comprehend legal documents, practical group work skills through the classroom facilitation presentation, as well as efficient communication skills with the supervisors of my externship (and with my externship partner!).",
                "I gained a much deeper understanding of the social, historical, & cultural underpinnings of our education system. I learned a lot about how organizing can work, what advocacy looks like, and the place for youth in law.",
                "LEARNED SO MUCH especially in regards to how to organize effectively in public school spaces. We were exposed to so many helpful frameworks and met so many current lawyers, activists, and people fighting for community power for youth. Prof MC is one of the greatest educators Ive been privileged to work under.",
                "I learned how to read long documents and extract the most important takeaways and information.",
                "As a class, we employed a historical and practical approach at looking at (de)segregation efforts and the ever-evolving sociopolitical education landscape. Throughout the course, we situated systemic education issues in the context of three frameworks: racial capitalism, racial caste, and white body supremacy. I enjoyed the consistency of engaging in group discussions that we had the liberty of selecting according to our passions and identities. I also appreciated having guest panel discussions that tied into the themes being discussed in the respective class session.",
                "We learned about the history of segregation in the U.S. and the history of school segregation in the U.S., and gained some basic understanding of education law, property law, and how these are framed around whiteness. We learned about the many factors which create and maintain school segregation, but most importantly, movements which fight for the integration of schools.",
                "Comprehensive history of school segregation and white body supremacy, interdisciplinary approach to justice (arts, writing, reading, speaking), hands on experience with experiential projects",
                "I learned about the various factors that sustain segregation in U.S public schools and the movement organization skills that can be used to tackle school segregation.",
                "The history of how segregated schools came to be was a big one for me and connecting it to the high school that I attended that was considered a segregated school. This class truly was able to bring my educational upcoming into light; I interacted more with these thoughts about my school and how it could be improved, as well as showing me the problems that I saw within my own school. This course has been very important to me because it has pushed me to a path of pursuing education policy.",
                "I learned a lot on radical pedagogy just from how the class was taughtfor example, we were asked to consent to the agenda before each class which helped me feel that I had some agency over my own education. Through actions like this, power dynamics in the classroom were confronted and unpacked. In addition to pedagogy, we studied how segregation within schools today are rooted in long histories of systemic oppression. We discussed how white body supremacy, settler colonialism, and racial capitalism work in and outside of the classroom. And our conversations were not just limited to identifying the problem but also to reimagining our systems for the healing and growth of students."

                "Only strengths. Prof. Camiscoli is a brilliant and kind professor whos passion for the material is contagious. She constantly looked to improve and seek feedback. It was truly a bilateral learning process.",
                "Strengths include the clear structure of each class day, the fostering of a community of organizers (through the practitioners professor SMC invited to the peer facilitation presentations) ,as well as professor SMC's openness to feedback. I honestly just wish we could have met for more than one day a week.",
                "A huge strength of this course is Professor MC. She is a powerhouse--incredibly supportive, intelligent, thoughtful, and well-spoken. Each seminar with her felt like a master class, and I walked away feeling educated & cared for.",
                "We tried to fit a lot into one class, so we always rushed towards the end. But I also enjoyed that because if we sidetracked to a different conversation it increased engagement with the class because the whole class was interested.",
                "The strengths were the discussion format and the emphasis on learning not grading. The weakness was that sometimes we didnt go in depth about particular readings.",
                "Strengths: informed group discussion, thematic class sessions and connecting guest panels, varying perspectives and experiences with education, powerful framing of education issues \r\nWeaknesses: classroom size did not properly accommodate all students at all times, larger classroom size or smaller student cohort would be more conducive",
                "The strengths are that it is a very intimate course and Professor Medina Camiscoli truly cares about all her students and cares so much about her pedagogy; her weekly feedback assignments meant we would sometimes see real-time changes in the class which reflected the things students did/didn't like. Also, the class is so well-structured that every week we learned about a guiding framework, reflected on the week's readings, had a student-led discussion/presentation/activity, and met with guest speakers from various careers related to racial justice work in education. While this meant we learned so much, one weakness was that sometimes classes are over-packed with material.",
                "As a sophomore, this was the best class I've taken at Yale so far. Professor MC creates such a generative, welcoming, brave, and safe space for us to learn in community with one another. The class environment and rules are clear from the very beginning, and she proactively finds ways for us to show up best in the space. She balances her own content with student-led discussion. She routinely takes feedback in a genuine way, and each class has so many varied activities (powerpoint introduction, group discussions, student-led discussions, guest speakers). Amazing class.",
                "strengths: Professor SMC is wonderful! super engaging and passionate about the material, which really helps to create an enriching classroom experience. the material is also super engaging and interesting. \r\nweaknesses: due to time constraints, it was a bit difficult to really engage and learn a lot from the guest speakers. I think having an interview project where we independently interviewed one of the guest speakers to learn more about their work would be super cool. maybe we could then share our findings with the class?",
                "The professor is one of a kind, her teaching style is one of a kind that engages her students with the material and apply it to real-life scenarios. Ever student looks forward to this class and the readings that we read outside of class are incredibly interesting. For me there are no weaknesses, I love the class the way it is.",
                "A strength was that the classes were very discussion based, giving us the chance to learn from other classmates who had been through various forms of the school system (ie. public school, private school, specialized schools, etc.) We were able to share our personal experiences and relate them to what we were learning through readings, mini-lectures, guest speakers, etc. A different group of students also gave short presentations every week, which also increased engagement with what we were learning. This class is also one that is very important to take, as it centralizes the constructions of race, class, gender, ability, etc. in our education systemswhich is important not only in reflecting on early education and high school but also in our college careers and potential teaching careers. This class is even important for people not going into teaching, as it thinks critically on the violent systems that we live in and how to rebuild them.",
                "Strengths: I cannot even begin to describe what a gift it was to have Professor Camiscoli as an instructor. She is beyond brilliant and passionate about what she teaches. It is also so clear how deeply she cares for and wants to support each and every one of her students and our learning. I truly, truly derived so much out of this course, and have left feeling empowered to effect actual change. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only thing I could say was the amount of information that could come with each lecture...some weeks, classes would be inundated with information and I wouldn't know how to best keep up note-taking wise (but I also think this is just common and a little inevitable with once-a-week courses). Otherwise, however, I really, really enjoyed this course."

I would also highly recommend it to anyone who wants the opportunity to participate in an externship with organizers in this field!",
                "Yes! This is the opportunity to learn about incredibly timely & important topics with an incredible professor.",
                "I would really recommend this to anyone interested in practicing social justice. Classes at Yale rarely feel like they do the practical part of social justice well.",
                "I definitely would because I learned a lot and I feel I was able to critically think and connect my identity and passions to the course",
                "I would if it is still being taught my Professor Sarah Medina Camiscoli. She was a powerful force within our class. The curriculum was thorough and was effective in conveying varied education issues and situating them amongst larger contexts of the education landscape.",
                "Yes, definitely! Professor Medina Camiscoli is such a great professor and mentor. I am so happy I took this class with her. You will learn so much about school segregation and social movements in the U.S. education system, and reflect on your own schooling experiences. I learned so many frameworks that opened my eyes to new ways of thinking. Also, having the opportunity for an externship as a final semester-long project was such a great and fulfilling experience.",
                "Absolutely!! Take this course. This course has an urgent focus on American segregation and modern movements for collective liberation and love. This seminar style class is the best I've ever taken. Professor MC has a thoughtful balance between powerpoint explanations, student-led discussions, art/other medium, group discussions and share outs, guest speakers, etc. The class passes so fast because she plans out things so carefully and the discussions/activities lead organically into one another. \r\n\r\nNote to trans and non-binary students: Professor MC is amazing with this. I'm a trans girl of color, and throughout the semester, I was changing names and pronouns and always, Professor MC validated me and made it a safe space for me to express/exist how I needed to. There are very few spaces on campus where I feel safe and seen, but Professor MC did that and so much more.",
                "Yes! wonderful opportunity to take an engaging and inspiring course on a real-life problem. you leave this course empowered with knowledge on the subject and ways to tackle it. Also one of the best class communities i've experienced at yale!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! This course teaches you so much and genuinely brings you more into the problems of the school system and different tactics/manners that have been used in the past and present in order to bring change.",
                "Yes!! The class was organized very well with each week being dedicated to a specific question, including: How does the theft of land and segregation of property impact schools? How do carceral systems contribute towards school segregation? How do districts, zoning, and enrollment impact the demographics of schools?  How have movements reimagined schools to pursue racial justice? etc. \r\n\r\nWe often had guest speakers coming in who did powerful healing work in resistance to violent systems of power. For example, we had organizers from Texas Climate Jobs come in for a week where we studied environmental racism and its impact on schools. We also had the option of doing an experiential project where we worked alongside such organizers, which again helped us go beyond readings and actually practice what we were learning.\r\n\r\nProf Camiscoli was also an absolutely wonderful and understanding instructor, who is deeply committed to her students and making learning more accessible. Prof Camiscoli always included forms of information outside standard readings and academic articles, including videos, podcasts, art, zines, and webinars, which helped me better engage with the material. She was always open to feedback throughout the semester, having weekly feedback forms rather than just one mid-semester and end-of-year-one. I appreciated this as it allowed for more consistent input from students, incorporating our needs into the class. Her background in organizing also made the class one of the most powerful classes I've taken at Yale, as we got to meet and talk to various organizers actually putting what we'd talk about in class into practice. Prof Camiscoli brought her own experiences into the classroom, which made the class feel like a warm and welcoming space for us to share as well.",
