                "I learned about the history of England from King Henry VII to the Revolutionary War and the legacies it continues to leave today.  In the process, I also sharpened my research skills and ability to synthesize different sources to produce strong arguments.",
                "This course helped me develop skills for quickly reading and assessing historical articles as well as articulating arguments in historians terms.",
                "Knowledge-wise, this class really expanded my understanding of Early Modern English history, especially the 17th century, which I haven't really studied before but I now think is super important. Skills-wise, the detailed guidance and structure of the papers, especially the final paper, was really helpful in honing my skills as a historian and writer.",

                "The discussion was very lively; everyone participated and Professor Hill was a great mediator. Overall, I really enjoyed this course. Every week, discussion would flow enthusiastically through the almost two hour window.",
                "Class discussions and papers were always engaging, but the reading load could be a little heavy at times.  Sometimes our weekly readings were not finalized until five days before class, which made prep work for seminars a bit difficult.",
                "The syllabus, structure, and format is all very good. If I had to suggest anything, a very slight increase in the professors involvement in discussion might help save time when it comes to those students who struggle to be concise.",
                "Strength: a wide variety of sources; very knowledgable instructor; clear course structure and assignment guidelines\r\nWeaknesses: seminar discussion was sometimes a little unfocused\r\nPossible improvements: More organized seminar discussions. I also think our treatment of pre-Stuart England and post-Walpole England was a little cursory; maybe we can take out one of these two topics to make more time for a more detailed study of the other",
                "Strengths: The classroom environment was very engaging \r\nWeaknesses: There was no structure to the class and the readings were often extensive and not discussed during class."

Studying colonialism, government power, and empire requires approaching the historical developments that made them, and this class does a great job of guiding you through the past.",
                "Yes! Really important stuff, relevant to US history and European history, great professor, interesting discussions.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone interested in early modern english history. I would also recommend this course to first-year or sophomore intended history majors, because the clear structure and guidelines makes it a strong introductory class to college-level history.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you have prior knowledge and interest in British History."
