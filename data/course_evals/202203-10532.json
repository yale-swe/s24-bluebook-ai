                "This course is an interesting balance between a survey course on the history of western Classical music from 1600-1800, and a course that analyzes and discusses the ways in which the musical \"cannon\" from the time period was formed, including the music that was ignored/left out. I think that what you get out of this course depends a lot on your familiarity with the material coming into the course: if you're new to this material, you get a ton from the information presented about music in Europe from 1600-1800, and learn a lot about how to listen critically to classical music; if you have familiarity, some of the discussions on cannon/music from the Americas is very interesting.",
                "This course gave me a broad overview of Western classical music from 1600 to 1800. It covered the musical conventions and trends of the time, and taught me how to identify pieces of music by their musical qualities.",
                "Not only did this course give me a thorough framework of understanding of music between 1600 and 1800 (not an easy task!!) but also got us thinking about music history as a study. There was a coherent sense of chronology both historically, culturally and musically. We also acquired listening skills, where we didnt just listen to music and identify it but could hear the historical context in the music and understand why it sounded like that.",
                "I learned a lot more about the baroque area of music history, which I was not as familiar with. I thought it was really cool to see how music interacted with social and cultural events and to see the through-line of musical expression through the 1600-1800s",
                "- Western art composers and works from 1600-1800 in Europe\r\n- Themes in western art music and trends by decade\r\n- Critical listening skills\r\n- Important dates and historical/cultural events from 1600-1800 that shaped music  at the time",
                "Learned lots of information about the history of European art music in this period. Synthesizing historical themes in and through music. How to do research in the field of music history.",
                "I learned what expressivity meant and how it changed from 1600 to 1800. I learned about the emergence of instrumental music and how instruments began to take on a more individualistic role in comparison with voices. I learned about the origins of opera, which I did not know much about before, and how opera was reformed many times, often influenced by political or philosophical ideology. A specific thing that was enlightening for me was learning that the Bach sons were important figures in the transition from the Baroque era to the Classical era. I think in general I learned a lot about how to deeply analyze instrumental music from the Baroque and Classical eras.",
                "In taking this course, I gained a greater appreciation for opera and Baroque era music. I learned about not only the prominent musical styles and composers of the 17th and 18th centuries, but also the socio- and geopolitical backdrops that influenced the development of these styles.",

                "I think this course would do very well as being broken up into two courses, nor not de-facto required by the music major. I think it was taught very well this semester, and the material is engaging, but if you're someone who is coming into the class with knowledge of a lot of the material already (but have to take it for the major), time could better be spent elsewhere. I also feel like the quizzes, which are pretty much weekly, and administered in sections, would be much better off being online to open more time for discussion in sections (though I realize there are questions about academic integrity were that to happen).",
                "This course did a really good job of focusing on the big picture of music history, not just making us memorize individual pieces of music. There is always the question of what gets included and what gets left out of a music history survey course, but I think this course did a really good job of selecting pieces to give us a decently broad overview of the time period.",
                "I thought it was a great class! It was also taught with a sense of self-awareness. We engaged with the course material but also asked why we considered this was the material we consider important to study. We engaged with the study of music history itself and frequently questioned the canon, what it was and why we study it.",
                "I really liked the structure of the class. The way the quizzes were spaced out made things much easier to manage. I also thought the lectures were extremely engaging.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Excellent lectures, with very engaging lecturers (both prof Peritz and Allison). Even though this isn't the type of music that is most interesting to me, I always found myself really engaging with the lectures and always looking forward to class. Professor Peritz is great at keeping class interesting and fun, and she always has high energy that brings up the mood of the whole group.\r\n- Interesting questions that went along with each lecture, about the broader themes in music at the time. I liked that these were broad enough that we could think about how they connect to more modern styles, so that those of us who are more interested in modern music could connect with themes directly.\r\n- Helpful sections (when we didn't have a quiz) that clarified terms from lecture and let us dig deeper into contect. Allison did a great job of facilitating these and bringing everyone's voice in, especially after lectures where only the same couple of people spoke over and over again. Those of us who don't have extensive background in western art music had more of a place to contribute in section.\r\n- I definitely learned A LOT of content over this semester overall\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- There was a huge focus on memorization, which I felt did not contribute to my critical understanding of the content. The requirements of memorizing dates for every piece and composer, cities for every piece, along with term definitions, composer/song names in different languages (especially for those of us who are not familiar with western art music or europen languages) felt excessive and unnecessary. Even though it was emphasized in class that this was NOT about memorization and was really about understanding, with dates/cities/composers/songs/terms on the quizzes, I spent the large majority of my studying time memorizing. When I tried to explain a concept in my own words instead of a memorized restatement of what was said in class, I would often get points taken off on my quizzes, so I found it safest to just memorize everything. \r\n- I felt that there could have been a lot more resources for studying for quizzes, such as study guides, lists of songs/terms that could be on the quiz, etc. The work for this ended up falling on a couple students who put in the work on these and helped the rest of the class; this could have easily been solved by giving these resources to students directly so that they could learn exactly what will be on the quiz. \r\n- I found the 'no technology' rule in class to be a weakness of the course. When studying for quizzes, my written notes prevented me from searching for specific words in a document or copying information into a study guide. I also think that eliminating technology creates a weird divide between people who have accessibility accommodations due to disability and those who don't.",
                "I expected this course to involve a huge amount of memorization of pieces of music and facts, and while there was a good amount of that, the things we had to memorize were always deliberately chosen to be the very important subset, which I am now grateful to know, rather than the old approach to this class, which would have had us memorize tons of useless facts and pieces of music. The lectures and sections were interesting and engaging. It was a bit odd to have two sections for such a small course, but it was nice to have a very small class size.",
                "Overall I loved this course and I don't have many suggestions for it. I like the listening and term quizzes--I appreciate that there were two different kinds of quizzes and that the lowest grade from each was dropped. I liked the research paper as an opportunity to explore something new, and the final analytical essay was a great way to wrap up the course. I also loved the trip to the Beinecke. I always learned a ton in the lectures. \r\nI have two suggestions for the quizzes. For the listening quizzes, I think it could be cool to have the unfamiliar listening on more than one quiz. I think it could be really useful for life and for extending our knowledge beyond this class to have more practice using our skills to analyze something new. And for the term quizzes, those sometimes felt really laborious and just that we were regurgitating stuff we had memorized. So it could be nice to add some sort of short analytical question at the end of each quiz that forces us to think about larger themes from the past two weeks or so instead of just memorizing definitions.",
                "At first, the (almost) weekly term/listening quizzes seem like a lot, but in the grand scheme of things it is much more manageable than a huge final and it also ensures that you're keeping up with the material on a weekly basis, as opposed to cramming everything at the very end of the semester. Having not taken MUSI 350 prior to this course, I wish there had been a little more upfront discussion of the historical context of the music we studied, but as the semester went on, the dots started to connect themselves.",
                "Weakness: content could be more inclusive. \r\n\r\nStrength: structure and delivery of the class was great."

If you're interested in music from this time period, as not-a-music-major, I would highly recommend this course: I think that's sort of the ideal audience for the class as it is. If you're looking to just take a basic survey of Western classical music, I would take one of the 100's level courses that offer a broader examination of music history, as this class can get pretty specific.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Peritz and Allison were both fantastic, and the course covered a time period in Western music history that I did not know a lot about.",
                "Yes I would absolutely recommend if you would like to gain a thorough framework of the origins of classical music as we understand it today. You also have the freedom to delve into one topic that is particularly interesting to you.",
                "Absolutely! Especially if you arent as familiar with this era of music.",
                "Yes, for people interested in western art music and looking to be more knowledgeable on the most famous composers of the time. You definitely learn A LOT in this course, and the lectures are worthwhile. However, expect a large workload, mostly of memorization; if memorization is not one of your skills, you will not do well in this class, regardless of how engaged you are with the content. Also, if you do not have a background in western art music already, be prepared to be aggressively humbled throughout the course. There are a few people who have spent their entire life doing this kind of music, and they will have a huge leg up in the course and will dominate class discussions. \r\n\r\nFor music majors, this course is pretty much required, which I do NOT think should be the case. I think it would have been more fun if everyone was there to learn, not to fill a requirement. Overall, I found the course to be engaging and meaningful (mostly because of Prof. Peritz and Allison... probably the best people to teach this but there is only so much you can do with a survey course), but the content is so specific that I don't think it is helpful for all music majors.",
                "If the information in the syllabus is information you want to know, then yes. I found this course to be rewarding and gave me some important preparation for my future in music. If you're not interested in western classical music this course could still be interesting to you because it examines broader ideas of social trends through music, but come with an open mind and be ready to work. Students with a strong prior background playing and listening to western classical music will have a huge advantage in this course.",
                "Yes! I got out of the course exactly what I wanted to, so I would definitely recommend it to others who want to learn about this period in music history.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student who is at all interested in music or music history. Classical/Baroque era music is definitely not my wheelhouse and I still thoroughly enjoyed the course. The assigned music was always compelling and carried with it some kind of sociopolitical weight beyond the pitches and rhythms, which made the material all the more fascinating to study.",
                "Yes. Especially if you are interested in music from the western canon. It is great for beginners and also for people with a bit more experience too."
