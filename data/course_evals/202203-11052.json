                "This course served as my introduction to Middle English, and to early important works of poetry. This course did a fantastic job of both instilling knowledge of how to read these works, and how we might interpret them. This course also worked to develop the skillset to work with poems in essay-writing.",
                "I definitely improved at being able to read ancient poetry. While the language was difficult to decipher at first, it became much easier over the course of the semester. As this was my first time ever taking a literature course like this, I did feel behind in terms of deciphering themes and such, but this class helped develop my skills in that regard as well. This course, despite me middling in mediocrity within it, was a good look into the English major as a whole. I think I'll continue!",
                "I developed a greater understanding of English poetry through our class discussions and personal analyses.  I also honed my skills as a writer to craft more detailed essays than I had ever written in high school.",
                "My writing improved a lot, and I expanded my knowledge of classic English poetry.",
                "I gained a new appreciation for poetry along with the skills needed to engage with it and extract meaning from it. I learned how to analyze not only its structure and literal meaning but metaphorical meanings as well.",
                "My writing -- particularly literary and poetic analysis -- improved significantly during this course. My deep reading ability for poetry improved dramatically. I also added to my knowledge of the English poetic canon: Milton, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Chaucer are some of the most influential and commonly referenced poets in the English literary canon. Knowledge of each of their work has been incredibly helpful for understanding illusions in other literature and philosophy I have read.",
                "I learned how to read Middle English poetry and how to analyze it.",
                "I learned how to critically read poetry in both more detailed and more holistically contextual ways than I ever have before, in addition to learning how to read Middle English writing to begin with. In learning how to read and engage with texts in new and creative ways, my writing also reflected these developments and become more complex, subtle, and sophisticated over the course of the semester.",
                "Close reading, analysis, and writing",
                "I gained a very valuable foundation in a literary canon which has informed my reading of my many other texts in other classes/in my free time. These references which would previously have been lost on me have lent me a really cool insight."

                "As a foundational course, it would have been nice to have more chances at revisions so I could learn from my mistakes. Granted, it did seem like most of the people in the class had very strong english/philosophical backgrounds---many words were thrown around in discussions that made absolutely zero sense to me---so the revisions might not be necessary for everyone. However, coming from a school that didn't really touch on English Literature at all, some leeway would have been nice. Otherwise, I think Dr. Nicholson is a truly fantastic seminar leader! She is fantastic at leading and controlling discussions to get us where we needed to go. She truly made class a joy, despite my struggles within it.",
                "One thing I really liked about this course was the discussion format, because I felt very engaged and encouraged to share my opinions in class. I also gained some great insights from my classmates' observations and ideas. I think the course could be improved if we were to receive feedback on our first or second assignment drafts of the year instead of only the third, because that feedback was a turning point for me in understanding how I could improve my writing.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, engaged instructor\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of readings, a monotonous format\r\n\r\nI wish we had more time with each of the texts. I often felt rushed.",
                "Strengths - great texts, structured course, organized, good balance of writing/reading\r\nWeaknesses - got slightly repetitive (maybe other forms of essay assignments besides analysis could help with this)",
                "Strengths include discussion management, quality of syllabus, pace of reading, and generative writing prompts and feedback.",
                "The professor was very enthusiastic about the material and gave very helpful comments on the papers.",
                "The number of assignments, the speed with which we worked with them, and the spacing between each assignment was challenging but manageable. I loved the variety of texts we used, and class discussions, and our assignments associated with them. I cannot think of a weakness of this course! The pacing, quality, and quantity of our texts and assignments were excellent.",

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student because I think the subject was very interesting, and reading and writing about this literature is valuable even for a non-English major such as myself. The difficulty level was very balanced, and I also really enjoyed the professor's teaching.",
                "Yes, but I would tell them that they should only take it if theyre interested in trying out Middle English. (You would be bored out of your mind if the subject matter didnt interest you.)",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class. Even though I a came in not loving poetry, I learned how to appreciate it and feel I gained a lot of valuable skills. This was also a class where I noticed a real improvement in my writing skills. Also great to read some classic literature I would not have otherwise read.",
                "Yes, 100%. This has been my favorite course at Yale and has invigorated my passion for literature. I came in not planning to major in English and am now considering a major in literature. It is quite manageable for non-English majors as well (a background in history, philosophy, or religion certainly helps, however).",
                "I would only take this course if you need if for the major or thoroughly enjoy English poetry.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Nicholson makes incredibly challenging texts accessible and digestible. The way she facilitates discussions allows the whole class to follow the text while drawing unique, meaningful conclusions about both small moments in the text and the larger whole of the piece. The texts are interesting, classroom discussions are engaging, and Professor Nicholson's feedback is clear and sure to make you a better writer.",
                "Yes, it was a great experience and I loved Professor Nicholson!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Its a very valuable basis for anyone, especially English majors or other humanities students."
