It sometimes felt like the projects and assignments contributed nothing to my learning. Also the course is Portuguese but we only learn about Brazil and Brazilian Portuguese. I would like to learn more about the language and culture from Portugal. However, this is something that none of the Portuguese courses here seem to offer.",
                "Strength was definitely the professor who really cares about her students",
                "Strengths: Giseli is a fantastic professor. She is supportive and engages with each of her students to form a connection and foster their linguistic development. She is genuinely caring and seems very invested in the success of her students to acquire Portuguese.\r\nWeakness: This course advanced a very selective interpretation of the world. For a course that I enrolled in with the intention to learn a new language, I would have appreciated less instruction of one sided political ideology and instead had that time for more instruction of components that foster overall language acquisition skills. The emphasis on politics seemed misplaced and many students were not yet equipped with the linguistic ability to positively or negatively discuss the complexities of preferred world structure in a foreign language they are acquiring and instead complied with the given views. This aspect diminished my enthusiasm for the course and missed an opportunity to further engage me in Lusophone culture."

                "I would. There is a lot of homework and a lot of time you have to dedicate to this course but overall it is worth it.",
