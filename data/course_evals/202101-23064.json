                "Great intro course.",
                "I did not feel that this course taught much more than high school AP physics 1 which I already took. I wish less time was spent on simple topics like kinematics and more time was spent explaining the more complex areas and helping students get an intuitive understanding that was deeper than the equations.",
                "This course covered a lot of content but not overwhelmingly. The exam content was relevant to class materials and it was easy to know what you needed to study for. However, a few more problem solving sessions would have been helpful, in addition to covering why kinematics equations work.",
                "Strengths: Homework load is very manageable. There were plenty office hours offered if you needed help. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Reading the chapter ahead of time REALLY helps, but he doesn't tell you what chapter we'll be going over that week. Otherwise, lectures were hard to follow and he rarely summarized key points so everything was just kind of lost. Quizzes asked for information that was not in the textbook or taught in lecture. The tests included a lot of examples where you didn't have numerical values, but just the variables. Very confusing.",
                "I think that the class is very accommodating to beginners of Physics and does not have us do the same problems over and over, which I really appreciate. I personally do not like lectures with attendance as a grade component.",
                "The professor was a big strength, and I felt the weekly psets were generally helpful for learning the content. One weakness was that the content moved very quickly and tended to get ahead of the assignments, making it sometimes difficult to switch gears or learn the newer content in class when you may not have figured out the previous content that it builds on yet.",
                "The pace of the course is very quick, but reasonable depending on the background of the students. I believe that if this was the first physics course a student had taken, then it would be much more difficult to follow along. Nonetheless, the professor goes over many example problems which is very helpful.",
                "The course was pretty effective in going over physics concepts. I do think it would have been beneficial to have more practice problems in class.",
                "This course is unorganized and goes very quickly. The professor is used to teaching during the summer, so I'm guessing he used the same course time as the summer. This made the class hard to follow and we also learned topics that were not relevant for the course.",
                "Strengths: GREAT PROFESSOR!! Kept class engaging, super thoughtful, incredible support from TA's and Prof.\r\nWeaknesses: goes a little fast through lectures",
                "The lectures go super fast, but then he offers 2 weeks at the end for review before reading period. Having discussion section would have made the class much better.",
                "Overall the course was taught well, but it was sometimes hard to follow problems when they written out due to the different colors and papers being used. Also, I would have liked to have required mandatory sections, which I believe were cancelled because of scheduling conflicts. I think this would have pushed me to learn the material earlier and better, as I often forgot or didn't make use of office hours."
