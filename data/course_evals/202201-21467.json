What I found a bit difficult in the course was its organization. It felt like we weren't necessarily moving chronologically or thematically; if the order of the texts had been rearranged, I may have gotten more out of them.",

In terms of weakness, there were just moments in the class where there would be silence because the discussion dried out.",

I am deeply grateful for the amount of effort she gave in helping me improve as a scholar and writer. The syllabus is also incredibly well crafted. The only downside is at times the seminar discussions meandered and could have been more pointed.",
