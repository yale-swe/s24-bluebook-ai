                "I think just the virtual format made it hard to communicate sometimes. Other than that, this class was so great. I learned so much about Japanese and Stever-sensei was amazing.",
                "The course is taught by one of my favorite professors that I've had at Yale, and I enjoyed the small class size with dedicated classmates. \r\nThe main weakness is the workload. Homework consistently took longer than any other class, and I spent the majority of my study time doing Japanese homework per week. Long readings with new vocabulary and grammar, content worksheets and grammar practice all took time, but the additional quiz every class meant there was just too much review that needed to be done, especially given that class was sometimes only two days apart, in the middle of the week when other homework would be due. \r\nThis workload would probably be easier for our class's native or heritage speakers, but I'm finding myself having to take time away from Japanese because I cannot continue having to rush other classwork to get everything done.",
                "I think the final project is a bit odd given this all virtual setting. Besides that, all course materials are carefully thought of and very well designed to keep us informed and engaged."
