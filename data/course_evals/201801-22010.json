    "This course introduced a range of important Spanish literature starting from the 18th century to the present. The readings gave the student an idea of what the popular writing style was at the time the piece was written, as well as what the historical context was at the time.",
    "I am now much more familiar with both modern Spanish history and modern Spanish literature. Beyond that, I am much more comfortable with reading in Spanish and have also written my first long (beyond 7 pages) research paper in Spanish!",
    "I improved my Spanish reading and writing skills a lot and got a lot of practice thinking about, speaking about, and writing about literature.",
    "Intentar hacer esta evaluacin en espaol; tngame misericordia...\r\n\r\n- Por primera vez (!), aprend mucho sobre una cultura que no era la ma\r\n- Por primera vez, estudi poesa en profundidad\r\n- Mejor mi escritura por escribir el trabajo final para el curso\r\n- Aprend mucho sobre porque los espaoles son cmo son\r\n- Aprend cmo hacer investigaciones en clases de humanidades (pero si me queda mucho ms para aprender...)\r\n- Descubr que leer la literatura puede ser muy divertido, interesante y edificante",
    "I learned much more about spanish literature and culture! I also improved my spanish literacy and speaking skills",
    "I learned a whole lot about the history and political\/social climates of Spain. We read some great texts that very much helped improve my language skills. Many opotubites for discussion in class."

   "comments": [
    "This course is very interesting and well taught. Each class discussion is a good combination of literary analysis and historical understanding.",
    "The course does a great job in picking works of Spanish literature; I was generally never bored by a reading, and the reading load was always manageable. I also enjoyed how interactive the course was--some Spanish seminars tend to turn into lectures where there is very little professor-student interaction. Finally, I really appreciated how the final paper was broken down into smaller assignments, so I didn't have to write an 8-page paper in a day.",
    "The course was well-run - the class discussions were a good mix of questions from the instructor and discussion among class members.  The reading was a significant but manageable amount.",
    "Puntos fuertes:\r\n- Las lecturas eran geniales\r\n- Haba tantas pelculas como lecturas\r\n- El curso de verdad ensea sobre la cultura y vida de los espaoles\r\n- Se nos daba mucho contexto sobre cada lectura antes de que la leyramos\r\n- Me gustaba que trabajramos mucho en grupos pequeos en clase\r\n\r\nPuntos dbiles:\r\n- Lo mucho que discutamos el contenido explcito de las lecturas, en lugar del verdadero significado; intente dar pruebas\/tareas para las lecturas, para que se entienda que hay que leer las lecturas muy bien antes de venir a clase",
    "The strengths were in the selections of amazing materials and in the engagement and preparations of the instructor",
    "A major strength was the way the class was oriented. Leslie is an amazing discussion leader."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in Spanish language, history, and culture. It is a highly engaging course and very very well taught by Professor Harkema!",
    "This course is a wonderful first L5 Spanish course to take! It is not too overwhelming, and Profa. Harkema is always there to help you. The course is a perfect mix of history and literature--by the end of it, you will have a comprehensive understanding of modern Spain (starting from around the Enlightenment) and how its literature reflects certain historical developments. The final paper is daunting at first, but you will be very proud of the final product!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who loves Spanish and Spanish literature and is willing to devote time and thought to it.",
    "Absolutamente! Est bien organizado y se leen las mejores lecturas de la tradicin espaola. Adems, se aprende mucho de la cultura espaola. Esta clase era una experiencia fantstica.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Loved the teacher, material and organization of the class:)",
    "Yes, the texts in the course are manageable and fascinating."
