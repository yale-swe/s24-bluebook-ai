   "comments": [
    "I learned so much in this class. I came in not even really remembering the basics of biology from high school and I left feeling comfortable discussing somewhat complex topics in immunology and the spread of disease.",
    "I learned about the biology of the pathogenesis of Malaria, Lyme, Dengue, and other diseases. I also learned about the biology underlying immunology and immune responses.",
    "I developed a solid understanding of the biology behind vector-borne diseases, but also a sense of effective public health responses to such diseases and the prospects for human efforts to eradicate vector-borne diseases.",
    "I am taking away a clear understanding of the immune system, of vector borne diseases, and the biology of diseases from taking this course. It was exceptionally run.",
    "Understanding how vectors work and how diseases and parasites spread.",
    "the scientific nature of vector-borne diseases, how to discuss\/think\/write\/ask questions scientifically, in general",
    "Lots of information about immunology, transmission of disease, differences between bacteria\/virus\/parasite, and specific causes and effects of malaria and Lyme disease especially.",
    "I learned so much in this class that it is hard to know where to begin. That in itself was my problem though because I was just constantly receiving information that at first, I did not know how to handle it especially since I had no sort of background with this information. After a while things got a lot better and I found myself applying the things that I picked up in class in my everyday life. Professor Belperron is very intelligent and passionate about what she teaches and it really shows. To be honest, that's what truly kept me engaged throughout the class. I do not regret taking this class at all even though it was challenging.",
    "To think analytically but also inventively. The class encouraged understanding and forward thinking ideas, not merely memorization and regurgitation as can be expected from other Yale courses."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really liked the course and appreciated the information we were taught. I also liked how Professor Belperron integrated group projects and individual presentations on other topics to help us better apply our knowledge. I felt that she sometimes went too fast in class that it was hard to capture and understand all of the information.",
    "Strengths: Covers important topics, gives you fundamental biological knowledge that make you much, much more qualified to consider public health challenges from diseases like malaria and Zika. The final paper was fun to write and I really appreciated what I learned.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Its always a bit weird being in a seminar classroom for an entire semester without learning peoples names. I wish Professor Belperron would have facilitated that, e.g. by requiring us to say our name before talking for the first couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness was the sheer number of topics we covered. Professor Belperron seems to be a firm believer in a teaching philosophy thats something like If I teach way more material than you could possibly learn, then youll still learn more than if I had covered less material. Fair enough. But even you insist on throwing tons and tons of densely packed slides on your students, I would still have preferred going more in depth with a the most important diseases (Malaria, Dengue, Zika, Lyme) and a handful of the best interventions than glossing over ten variants of  the same tick-borne disease and nine different ways of making vaccines.",
    "Professor Belperron's lectures were quite helpful and clear. I liked the format of quizzes, tests, and assignments because it encouraged us to learn the material in a holistic way. One weakness was that it was not clear what function some of the readings served, and professor Belperron seemed to treat them as supplemental rather than necessary.",
    "Strengths: Everything. Specifically the instructor- Professor Belparron is the best professor I have taken a class with at Yale. She made this course extremely interesting as well as highly accessible for the scientifically challenged. She is always available for questions and encourages them more than any professor I've had. This may be the best class I have taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The subject material can be challenging and the pace is high, but I didn't find that too much of a barrier to taking this class. Otherwise it has no weaknesses.",
    "Strengths - really in depth. Small class size good for conversation and participation",
    "I think the strengths of the course is the organization. All the material builds on itself in a way that is really helpful for a non-science person. Additionally, the second half of the course really focuses on student-generated research, which allows you some control of your learning. No big weaknesses for me.",
    "well-organised class materials and readings, variety of class forms (lecture, quiz, panel discussion, group presentation) which allowed us to actively engage with the contents of the class",
    "The work load was a strength of the course. The course is designed so that you are continuously engaged with the material so not to fall behind in coming seminars. The class is a continuous mix of both lecture and discussion, again encouraging continuous engagement with the material."

    "Definitely take it. I was my favorite class I took this semester even though I am not generally a fan of science. You will learn so much and Professor Belperron is very fair with grades",
    "yes especially to those who would like to understand basic treatments and mechanisms of diseases from vectors that may not want to take a hard science course",
    "Yes! It is not a gut science AT ALL but it is an interesting science credit that is both challenging but also rewarding. I'm really glad I took it and it made me more interested in science, which I never thought I would say a year ago!",
    "Id recommend this to any student with an interest in public and global health, *especially* if you think that you can work in those fields without understanding the biology. Because you really cant. Sure, you can talk about malaria for tens of hours without ever touching upon the biology of the disease. But after taking this class, Ive realized that that wouldnt be a good idea.",
    "Yes. This is an excellent course to take if you are looking for a science credit that is a bit of a challenge but very rewarding. The material is really interesting, and it ends up covering quite a lot. The quizzes and tests were very fair, and lectures were engaging.",
    "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. Professor Belparron is the best professor I have had at Yale. She makes science easier for the scientifically challenged, and the subjects of this class are so important to anyone even remotely needing to understand disease or medicine.",
    "maybe. It is not an easy science and I would recommend the student be really interested in the subject material.",
    "I would recommend this to any non-science person looking for a science requirement.",
    "Yes, especially if you're thinking of doing job\/research in the areas where vector-borne diseases constitute a social problem. This class is really tough for non-science majors, but it's great to learn about the complex nature of each disease and you can ger a grasp of why these diseases still constitute one of the most serious social issues in this era when science\/medicine has much developed",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking for something really challenging and if you do not care so much about your grades. I learned a lot from this course but my self esteem definitely too some hits during the semester. Professor Belperron is very welcoming, intelligent and engaging so that definitely helps.",
    "I would recommend taking this course since the course material is not only highly interesting but taught in a very understandable way for science and non science majors alike."
