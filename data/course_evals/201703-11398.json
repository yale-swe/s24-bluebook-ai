   "comments": [
    "Refreshingly (for an art history course), this class did not expect the tedious memorization of objects. Though a component, this course stressed the interrelation of the topics we discussed and their modern day importance. I learned a lot about synthesizing seemingly unrelated objects into a narrative, which is a good skill for an art history major to have.",
    "It's a great lecture course and the material is presented in really engaging ways, but when it comes to exams you really have to engage and do a lot of the work of synthesizing on your own.",
    "In this course I learned how to use art and sculptures as texts. I learned how to draw conclusions from artifacts and generate arguments from them.",
    "This course not only allowed me to explore a topic I was entirely unfamiliar with in an exciting and always interesting light, but it also helped me re-imagine my skills with the subject of art history. The methods of teaching and learning about Mesoamerican art and architecture, which consists of a wide variety of structures and medium, gave me a good foundation in historicizing material culture that I am sure I will use in other coursework.",
    "I loved this course and was excited to go to lecture! Sometimes its nice to have a class that is just a lecture, especially if the professor is as knowledgable and passionate as Professor Miller. I learned about Mesoamerican civilizations in more nuanced ways, and I imagine I will retain that informationwhat makes something Olmec, etc. I think I will best remember the more abstract and fascinating aspects of Mesoamerican culture that can apply to other cultures, too: that generations want to edit out what past generations believed, that power was complex and belonged in many places.",
    "I learned a great deal of information on art and architectural history spanning from the Olmec to the Axtec (Mexica) civilizations.",
    "I was able to learn about a culture I knew very little about and enjoy it. The teachings style of Mary Miller is also so captivating and incredible that it is something everyone at Yale should see at least once.",
    "I learned so much! Without having taken an art history course before, I learned a bit about how to talk and write about art. I also learned so much about mesoamerican history.",
    "In this course, I learned to appreciate and identify certain motifs in MesoAmerican art, as well as to respect the process of creating such objects. In learning the context in which objects were made, I was able to make connections I would not have otherwise. Mary Miller encouraged us to respect the lives and origins of the objects she taught us about.",
    "I learned so much about ancient mesoamerican cultures, how they lived, and different tropes of their artwork. By then end of the semester, I could easily distinguish between different locations, materials, time periods, and cultures. It was a great survey of ancient artworks! Mesoamerica is so interesting and often there is more information available about the European past. I learned how to memorize and study for identification quizzes, which was very new to me, as well as to write papers about art, which was a different approach."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought this course was well taught and well structured, both in lecture and in section. One possible area of improvement is more something to add as opposed to something to change. I struggled a lot with trying to chronologically orient myself in the subject, because the course was structured around different groups that were in different geographic areas. I think perhaps at the beginning of each new topic, it might be helpful to show some sort of timeline, showing overlap in cultures, because at present the organization seems to imply that the cultures are chronologically disparate, though we did talk a little about how they interacted. Perhaps a more clear timeline would be helpful.",
    "The strengths are the quality of the presentations and the various ways in which the collection at the art gallery is utilized. The weakness is in sufficient overview of the scope and scale and geography and chronology of the material.",
    "Very, very interesting course and presented in a way that shows the core themes easily within the objects and readings. A few problems: readings uploaded sporadically \/ often after they were due, image slides uploaded late or not at all, some other organization with exams and things.",
    "This course was an excellently executed lecture. The pace was great and the sections provided more material. The assessments were very fair.",
    "The tests are incredibly hard and the powerpoints posted were not useful.",
    "A clearer slide list with dates, culture and location would have been very helpful.",
    "The lectures were incredibly stimulating and the material was fascinating. Encountering objects up close was a major highlight for me.",
    "The only weakness of this course is that it is so different from what manys tudents have learned before, more regular review sessions would go a long way in understanding all of the information and how it fits together.",
    "FANTASTIC COURSE! To be honest, I can't think of any weaknesses. The lectures and sections were very engaging -- looked forward to go to every lecture. Mary Miller and the TA's were incredibly knowledgable.",
    "This course is great in that it covers a lot of material and is well-organized. I also like that there was never too much to absorb and if it ever got overwhelming, Professor Miller was helpful in dropping hints telling us what to focus on and how to make sense of the information. The course gave us more information than we needed for the exams, but it was enough to make us appreciate the objects and have something to draw from on exams.",
    "This course was so engaging. The lectures were so fun and interesting to listen to. There was never a dull moment and both Mary and Andrew were great at presenting the material. Section was always interesting, and I loved the opportunity to spend so much time at the YUAG and the chance to handle pieces and look at collections at the Beinecke. This class was great at really synthesizing the material and giving us exciting opportunities outside of the general lecture format. The main weakness of the course was the slides that went along with the lectures. We had multiple identification quizzes, but the information we needed to identify (material, year, etc) was not given to us on the slides, and often couldn't be found other places. Often the cultures shown on the slides were vague as well. In summary, the slides and pieces should be more clearly labeled and cohesive to make the pieces we learn about more accessible. Also, sometimes it was unclear if we were expected to know new material presented in section for quizzes or not.",
    "Strengths: The instructors are the biggest strength of this course. Professor Miller and Andrew Turner have so much expertise on these subjects and are eager to engage students. The material is fascinating and presented in a way that balances breadth and depth. Lectures are engaging and Professor Miller makes time for student participation. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The handouts were helpful but could be better organized."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course! Though it may seem like more of a niche topic, it is terribly interesting and could not be taught by a better or more knowledgable professor. I didn't really know anything about Mesoamerica at the beginning of the semester, and now I have a much greater appreciation and understanding of the subject. This is a good class for anyone interested in precolumbian American art as well as anyone who wants to take a mid-level art history course but is scared of rote memorization.",
    "This is a great course for getting an introduction into the subject with one of the best instructors.",
    "So amazing! Mary Miller is such a great lecturer and this history is so fascinating!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone at Yale. This area of art history is unlike many others and deals with widely applicable themes in a really unique, interesting way.",
    "YES! Mary Miller is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. Her knowledge, passion, and respect for the material is evident.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If History of Art is not their declared major or one they are considering, it could prove very challenging and perhaps overwhelming as an introductory course to the field. This was not my first HSAR course, and I enjoyed it a great deal. The challenges it posed, in being different in subject matter and perspective than other courses on western art (and thus for me requiring different study and note-taking strategies), have helped me improve my critical thinking with HSAR subjects immensely. Professor Miller is a fabulous lecturer, and the events she recommended and facilitated outside of class were beneficial and memorable.",
    "Yes, take this! If you want a lecture that will both excite and not-kill you, this is the one. Professor Miller is a gem and I was excited to attend her lectures. I would recommend looking over the PDFs of the lecture presentations every few weeks, just scrolling through them so your eyes can remember the images. This makes studying for the quizzes and tests way easier.",
    "If you are very good at memorizing things, this is the course for you. If id's are not your thing, do not take this course.",
    "Yes, the subject was interesting and Professor is a leader in the field.",
    "Yes! This course covers a great deal of information on a region with an immense and complex history. Studying the art of various civilizations in Mesoamerica provides the opportunity to analyze continuities and changes within the region before and (as covered in the final class) up to Spanish colonization.",
    "Yes! Mary Miller is a great teacher.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone that is interested in the subject matter.",
    "Take this class! You learn about the scale and scope of Olmec, Maya, and Aztec achievements through their stunning (and often enigmatic) monuments, paintings, burials, and other remnants of these major Mesoamerican cultures here with us today. Prof. Miller is a wonderful lecturer, and demands that you think with her during her lectures. You'll be on your toes as she imparts origin myths and political dynasties and guides your eye toward recognizing the way style and power intertwine.",
    "YES! 100%. I think most students would find this course interesting, whether or not you know anything about art history or mesoamerica.",
    "Would recommend if an art history student or interested in the material. Prof. Miller is amazing and provides little outlines at every class meeting which are great to take notes on. She is also just a wonderful instructor and person who loves the material she teaches and reads carefully everything you turn in. it's great. Material is really cool also!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was just so enjoyable! It is a great introduction to art history and archaeology classes. There are also so many opportunities to get involved outside of class. It was overall an incredible experience not just because of the material but because of the new opportunities presented to me.",
    "Yes!! This is one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale. If you are interested in art history or interested in learning about the cultures of Mesoamerica through art, this class will be fascinating. Professor Miller is awesome and so eager to share her expertise. Lecture is fun. The midterm and final were definitely challenging and required memorization of works of art, but it was worth it."
