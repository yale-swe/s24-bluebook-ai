                "A huge strength is Professor Chapman! Her analysis made the Shakespeare readings so fun, and I also enjoyed the wide range of contemporary poets that we got to read.",
                "I thought the syllabus for this class was unique and fascinating, and it made for great reading (and viewing/listening, for those Shakespeare productions that were included). I appreciated how pairing Shakespeare with contemporary poets illuminated the texts of both eras of writers. In class, discussions focused more on Shakespeare and poetic composition, but the discussions were sharpened by the inclusion of modern poets. The exercises we were given helped to hone our poetic skills over the semester. It was a bit difficult to balance the workload at times, but the readings and discussions were great!",
                "This course is a poetry class. I think a lot of students in this class made the mistake of taking it for the Shakespeare  which, in their defense, was an understandable thing to do given that it counts as a Renaissance credit. This class, in my opinion, should NOT be a Renaissance credit. You will not learn significant critical analysis skills, nor will you get better at analyzing Shakespeare as literature. Instead, after Prof. Chapman walks you through the plays, you will then analyze the language as poetry. I became a better poet in this class; I do not feel like it was a good use of my Renaissance credit. Prof. Chapman herself said the English department would not let her call the class \"Reading Shakespeare for Craft,\" as it does not make sense to read Shakespeare for craft in 2023. Nevertheless, there was a constant clash between the Shakespearean language and the contemporary poetry that we read/wrote, and I would love to see the class be condensed into simply a creative writing poetry class, because I think that would make more sense in context of Prof. Chapman's goals. There were also WAY too many assignments. Even though the class was taught once a week, assignments were due at least twice a week, with each assignment usually having multiple parts as the class tried to tackle both the Renaissance credit and the creative writing credit. Sometimes (with good intentions) Prof. Chapman would add new assignments like to go watch a departmental reading and/or write a personal essay. Sometimes workshopping poems outside of class would get added to the workload. For me, it was often overwhelming, and a lot of the prompts did not feel thought-through enough, which makes sense given just how many assignments were assigned. It was also difficult for Prof. Chapman to grade the sheer amount of assignments she assigned, and so it was hard to get feedback on the poetry we were writing throughout the class as part of the assignments. The prompt for the final essay, as well, asked for way too much  a close-read of two poems, analyzing both content and poetic form, as well as a discussion about the nature of poetry and why we write it. In any other English class, that would be far too broad of a prompt for an essay, however, as I've mentioned before, this was not a traditional English class."

This is definitely a great way to complete your Renaissance requirement, if you are an English major; you read Shakespeare plays alongside watching or listening to a production, which makes it much more engaging and easy to get through. However, there is a lot of work; there is a writing assignment due before every class along with the readings, and many of these assignments have both a creative and critical element that take a lot of time if you want to do them well. You will be writing a lot of poems, and you will get out of the creative aspect of the class what you put into it. It is also extremely well organized.",
