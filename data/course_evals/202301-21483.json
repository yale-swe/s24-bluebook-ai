                "Our class was not given a teaching fellow, which made organizing help sessions difficult. This course could be improved with a teaching fellow. Also, more structure in the planning of the course. It felt like we switched between undergraduate and graduate material several points during the semester, and I think it would be more helpful if one approach were taken.",
                "This course was poorly designed and barely cohesive. Most lectures seemed to connect only loosely to the next. I think if the course were deliberately mapped out in advance, this would aid significantly in the cohesion of the course. If this did occur, we could not tell.",
                "I think this course would be best taken when it isn't cross-listed, i.e. when it's either 442 OR 526 but not both. Both the undergrad and grad-level topics were super interesting but I think they each deserve their own course. That being said, one of the strengths of this course was the way it was able to treat topics at increasing levels of difficulty so we could see various applications of what we were learning."

                "It gives a very broad overview of the material of nuclear and particle physics but you leave feeling like you didn't learn much.",
                "I would not recommend this course to a friend. I don't think this was a good use of my time. I didn't learn much at all and any engagement I had with the course felt like busywork. Lectures were not designed well. Problem sets were not helpful. Questions in class were not answered. If the only difference between going to class and skipping and just reading the lecture notes later is the ability to have your questions about the content answered, I just don't think one can justify going to this class.",
