                "I learned an incredible amount about the social, economic, and political context of contemporary Britain throughout this course. Professor Phillips did a fantastic job leading us through the intricacies of the texts and linking them to the realities of life in Britain. Out of all the English courses I have ever taken, I felt this class was the most comprehensive in connecting the works to landmark political and social events in England and allowing me to gain a richer understanding of the texts. I also really liked that we looked at many different genres (films, books, plays).",

                "We got to closely examine post-war British literature with a wide range in genre (perhaps the widest range I've ever been taught in an English course at Yale).",
                "A wide and thorough reading in contemporary British fiction, examining novels, plays and films from mid-20th century to the present day"

                "I really enjoyed the student presentations at the start of each course. It was a really useful way to individually dive into a specific work, and I also very much enjoyed hearing my peers' interpretations. Having a formal introduction also meant that we understood the work in its social and political context and were able to draw connections between different works. The reading load was also great because none of the works were extremely long, it meant that in every class we had the time to touch on all the important moments (and made it so that it was very likely we had all read the full book!). One thing that I would improve would be that our work was not returned with grades throughout the term, and that made it difficult to know how I was doing in the class. While it did mean that I simply focused on the material and assignments instead of focusing on grades, it would have been useful to know if there was something in particular I needed to do improve in.",
                "The strengths of this class was how relaxed the environment\/discussions were. The only weaknesses were that we did not read any secondary sources that put the readings in context.",
                "I really enjoyed the diversity of the material, including form (plays, poems, films, novels) and identities (class, race, gender, coloniality). I think the formal variation (genres) is a real strength of the class, made me engage with literature in a way I'd never been asked to before. It was nice that Prof. Phillips asked us to do a quick mid-term essay. because it prepared me for the final paper. It was also nice to be able to talk to him about my writing. The presentations also worked really well, because I think it forced me to push myself out of my introverted comfort-zone (couldn't escape speaking in class when it was my turn to present).",
                "I thought it was a great course! I loved the readings and discussions, and always looked forward to class. My only real note for improvement might be to include some discussion on how to approach a 25-page final paper. The professor provided great help when we met one-on-one, but the length of the paper was certainly daunting and it might have been nice for him to disclose what precisely he was looking for. But this is a very minor note, I really loved the class!"

The works were highly engaging and I had not read most of them before, and the professor's approach to teaching them helped the information stick deeply in my memory. This class was a great balance between Professor Phillip teaching and students offering their own interpretations\/questions.",
