I also learned a lot about the history of DNA / RNA through the various informative documentaries that we watched, as well as some more modern tools like Illumina sequencing / ChatGPT through the midterm presentations.

                "-packets are very well written and explanations make a lot of sense. Physics lab should take notes\r\n-year long process thats connected is very satisfying\r\n-good classroom environment\r\n-sometimes we do things just to take up the full 4 hours. Id suggest to design so that if people finish early they can leave. I dont think watching some of the documentaries should be mandatory. Altho theyre cool, on a busy week it feels not optimal",

                "Strengths: The course is excellently organized and a lot of time, care, and dedication was clearly put into its pedagogy. For scheduling conflicts, the teaching staff are highly accommodating. Aruna and the teaching staff are always there extra early, setting up the labs and open to student questions. I love the amount of hands-on work in this course; it truly gives exposure to a breadth of techniques. It is a rarity to find a STEM course that is genuinely fun and enjoyable all the way through; of the 41 courses I've taken at Yale, this would undoubtedly rank in the top 3. Finally, the sense of community fostered in this course is underrated and I've made many friends. In particular, I thought that having group discussions for triplets of conceptual questions was quite innovative, if not in concept then in its implementation, which fostered engagement.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The quizzes were somewhat difficult, but I think that forces you to learn more.",

Overall I think the content was important and I learned a lot, but some of the assignments did not feel very enlightening, and the project we conducted throughout the term was nearly the same as the Lim and Sauer paper that it was based on, so the findings just felt a bit redundant",

It provides a solid foundation from which you can learn the specialized skills for a particular research lab. Every now and then, I'll remember a useful tidbit from this course while in the lab!",
