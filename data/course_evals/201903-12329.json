    "I learned all about london and its different aspects. I loved how the class was broken into different subject matters so that you could get a comprehensive view.",
    "I learned such an amazing overview about London. Since we went over so many different topics, I felt like I could learn a lot about the stuff I was super interested in, but also find new things that I thought were great. I would totally recommend this course to anyone!",
    "This, hands down, has been one of my favorite courses at yale. Prof. Wrightson is so knowledgable, friendly, fun, and engaging. The course is so well-organized, the discussions are great. I return from each seminar learning so much. I enjoyed exploring the lives of London's people and London itself through writings and voices from the 17th to 18th centuries.",
    "This course gave me an in-depth understanding of London as it grew from a small port city in the early sixteenth century to one of Europe's most important destinations by the 18th century.",
    "Each week, we focused on a different theme of early modern London, from the plague, to literacy, to royal London. I learned a ton about each week's theme through interesting course readings and discussions. I learned how to manage a heavy reading load as well as practiced analyzing primary sources for both the short and long paper."

   "comments": [
    "Wrightson led interesting and engaging discussions. Reading was manageable and the projects and presentations were fun!",
    "This course is excellent. Very engaging and has a lot of really interesting things to learn about. If you love London, or this time period of history in general, you should take this.",
    "Nothing to improve - it was so magnificent.",
    "I really appreciated the way that the course was designed with its weekly themes. We covered a ton of interesting topics, and Professor Wrightson always chose extremely interesting readings for us. I also really enjoyed the presentations each week -- it was great to learn from each member of the class about a subject that interests them, and it was a nice way to break up a long seminar period. It was overall a great class, but I sometimes wished that we could have pushed our discussions a little further rather than sticking so closely to the arguments of the readings."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely would! Professor Wrightson was an amazing Professor and I learned a lot!",
    "Yes!! It was great. The readings were not too long and the in class discussion was very great. Professor Wrightson really knows what he is doing.",
    "Yes!! But unfortunately Professor Wrightson is retiring and will not be teaching it again. Whoever teaches it next, should it be taught, will have very big shoes to fill.",
    "This is a rather reading intense course however, as a seminar, most of the reading will be gone over in class so missing a reading or two will most likely not reflect poorly on your understanding. There are only two written assignments, the first being rather simple and as such the student must use class discussion to explore the topics. For anyone interested in London or the Early Modern period, this is the class for them.",
    "Yes! Professor Wrightson is so great and knowledgeable and one of the best history professors around. This course was so interesting and I'd recommend taking it just to learn about the fascinating people and places in London from 1560-1760.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in history. The course covers a broad range of themes, allowing it to appeal to students with different interests."
