                "I really enjoy the size of the course and the types of readings that we did. I think that some more literature on what drives the continued existence of museums (be it legislative, financial, etc.) Could have rounded out our understanding of why museums behave as they do these days. For example, what are the nuances of a \"conditional gift\" to a collection - more broadly. I do wish we had some more time to work on the final project as well. That helped me get to know some of my classmates better.",
                "I loved having the exhibition proposal be such a large part of the course, as it really brought to life the issues in our readings and discussions. The one weakness of the course was that I wish we had figured out our group assignments much earlier, because I do think we would have been able to put much more long-term effort into the proposals throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: our class discussions were always engaging, especially because all my peers were from different graduate programs, so discussions involved a really diverse set of perspectives. The four field trips (especially our trip to the American Museum of Natural History) were probably my favorite part of the class, as we were able to apply what we had learned in readings and discussions to real-life issues at museums and conversations with curators. These were also great opportunities to ask questions that we were not able to answer in class. Finally, the proposal design process was well-set up. I appreciated that we had regular deadlines for drafting our proposal narratives so that we could receive feedback from Peabody staff. \r\nWeaknesses: I do wish we had started designing our proposals earlier in the semester, as things felt a bit rushed at the end.",
                "Perhaps knowing the team for the exhibition proposal slightly earlier (just a week or two)",
                "Great readings, but maybe we could start the proposal discussions earlier in the semester."

                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to other students as it really shows how complicated the historical narratives and stories of museums can be.",
                "Yes!! This has probably been my favorite class at Yale. Since the final project was to design a proposal for a student exhibition that will be displayed at the Peabody's reopening, we got a lot of support and feedback during this process, and it felt like we were working on a project that would actually have a purpose. I also really enjoyed our readings, discussions and field trips. The field trips and discussions allowed me to apply and question what I learned in our readings. Chitra is also an amazing professor with a wealth of knowledge and experience in museums.",
