You do some skill-based things (excel work) but that is not the main focus of the class, instead, you develop a fantastic round view of the industry and how it impacts so many areas.",
                "A true understanding of private equity.",
                "Comprehensive overview of the industry and deal process. Cool deep dives.",
                "I was very excited to take this course because it directly relates to my work after graduation. Professor Bradley was great -- she had very comprehensive and clear lectures that taught us about the industry, and she also assigned books that were quite useful and that I look forward to continuing to reading as I work in the industry. Her course supplemented my preexisting knowledge nicely, and I will definitely reference this information after I graduate!",

                "We went over how to analyze a fund's track record, calculate key financial statistics, look at ESG, and others. We did not do any financial modeling, but we did do activities for the other mentioned topics.",

                "Really well organized, made topics that are difficult, easy to understand. Maybe more participation\/discussion, but overall this was an excellent class.",
                "Honestly very few weaknesses. Amazing class",
                "Professor Bradley's teaching style is great. She went through the material in a clear manner, and I would say that this is one of the courses where I learned the most. The main weakness was the weekly assignments and the take-home exams. They intended to have us engage further with the material, but their tedious length and heavy references on the books felt a bit like busy work. If the length of these assignments were reduced and designed to be a bit more dynamic, the course was perfect!",
                "The strengths of the course are the content and the professor, but the course logistics could have been a bit better. That being said, this was the first year the class was offered, so I'm sure there are a number of logistical difficulties associated with teaching a course for the first time.",
                "Syllabus is comprehensive and Professor Bradley is very knowledgeable about the field, having started her own firm. Her personal anecdotes are very informative and relevant to the lecture material. The course could be improved by having more student engagement with each other. A suggestion would be forming small groups earlier on for assignments, and assigning quarterly projects rather than weekly homeworks.",
                "A ton of work, it was good to learn but really exhausting to do all the assignments. It was way too much",
                "It was very detailed, we got a lot of feedback on our homework and were able to hear from interesting speakers to give us different perspectives",
                "The course was truly excellent on nearly every front and Professor Bradleys effort and care was apparent. If anything, the midterm exam was overly extensive and to have a final exam, presentation, and paper was far more rigorous than any other course Ive taken. These probably should have been a bit limited. Additionally, the course felt a bit like a lecture rather than a seminar and more discussion would have been nice.",
                "The course is good because the readings are interesting and Professor Bradley's worksheets really make sure that you did the reading. On the flipside, sometimes it felt like the worksheets were looking for something really specific in the readings and felt more tedious than helpful. I wish the weekly worksheets were shorter but more intellectually stimulating (i.e. more case studies rather than copying directly from the textbook). In general, while I certainly learned a lot, I feel like the class required a lot of time and effort than really needed to learn the content thoroughly. In short, too much busy work, but good class overall.",
                "Strengths: targeted readings, clear lectures, guest speakers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some times too much reading and work. Many emails"

                "Yes! Professor Bradley is a gem. College seminars are fantastic and this one is no exception. She has so much passion and energy for her students and even though it was her first time teaching she put so much work into the course to make it great for us. I would highly recommend this course no matter who you are as private equity effects so many companies and aspects of life today and understanding it should be important to everyone. Professor Bradley also brought in a range of great speakers who were fantastic to listen to and learn from.",
                "Yes, this was the most informative, real-world skills class I've taken at Yale and I am sure it will help in the future.",
                "Definitely, if you have any interest in PE.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It was very accessible to students both with and without backgrounds in the field, and I think that it is a great seminar experience for anyone looking to understand a bit more about finance before graduating without an excessive amount of work! Professor Bradley's personal experience and storytelling are also wonderful additions.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this to anyone interested in a career in finance, regardless of your knowledge base coming into it. The content is very applicable to almost all career paths, and the professor is amazing.",
                "Yes! Professor Bradley is super engaging and cares about everybody's pace of learning. She doesn't hesitate to answer questions about the material and often supplements with stories from her own career, which I found super interesting. She also brought in guest speakers towards the last couple classes that each offered a unique perspective on the finance\/PE industry.",
