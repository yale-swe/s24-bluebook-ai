Comparative Politics also helped me develop insights regarding why different states developed the way they did, and what effects their trajectories had on  current political and social spheres.",
    "I really learned about the basics of comparative politics, while developing my political science writing and critical thinking skills.",
    "I think, from the readings especially, I was familiarized with the field of comparative politics and its application.",
    "I learned the aspects of stateliness, what makes democracy, political ID, different types of conflicts, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about different governmental structures and their various applications to global politics.",
    "It was a great introduction to political science.",
    "This course was structured in a way that was not conducive to deep learning about the field.",
    "I got a general overview of comparative politics.",
    "Learned more about being able to write political science writing",
    "I learned a lot about politics.",
    "General introduction to comparative politics.",
    "I gained a better understanding about political structures and setups around the globe.",
    "A framework for understanding the political systems and structures of different countries, the nature of identity divisions, the relationship between various social factors and political topics. I am grateful that I learned how to wade through dense journal articles.",
    "Reading scholarly articles in an effective way; writing briefs; writing research papers using the concepts we learned in class.",
    "How to read academic papers.",
    "I developed the ability to analyze governments and their systems across the globe.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures were well organized and filled the time well. Also, sections were very helpful in reviewing information covered briefly in lecture and in complementing lectures in general. I think some readings could have been cut out entirely from the syllabus, however.",
    "There was a lot of reading that had to be done. They had readings for each class, and additional readings for section that we had to write weekly responses on. I found myself only doing the section readings week to week, and cramming the other ones before exams (especially since section readings were not tested on). Readings were tested on in exams, so it would have been helpful to maybe have sections covering the class assigned reading, or going over them in lecture.",
    "I think that it would be useful to learn more about current events to understand the issues. The class was pretty dry sometimes and it could be helpful to learn more about current events to keep it more interesting. Also, some of the questions on the test didn't really test you conceptually and were subjective and counted for too much. There were a lot of multiple choice that were very specific on readings that I had done and didn't get the answers because they were just too specific.",
    "Strengths: Interesting content, well-delivered\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough application of content to current cases, mundane lectures at times",
    "The strengths of this course pertain to the wide array of regimes which are covered, as well as the highly interesting papers assigned throughout the semester. I developed a new sense of curiosity for global politics, and began forming my own questions to greater understand how different types of government led to the formation of certain social identities, and political cultures.",
    "Strengths: lectures were very organized, the professor clearly loved teaching, and I enjoyed discussion section. Weaknesses: sometimes lectures would feel very far from the actual material of the reading. Additionally, the professor never really tried to learn our names, so it was easy to become disengaged with the class.",
    "I think the lectures could be a bit disorganized or seem far removed from the subject matter",
    "This is an amazing class, very interesting and well organized.",
    "We almost never finished the slide shows in lecture.",
    "One of the weaknesses is that we almost never got through all the slides.",
    "Very low engagement- long readings for homework that are barely discussed in class.",
    "The content seems to really diverge from the material in the textbook during the second half of the course, and the professor tends to go on tangents and often does not finish the lecture material on time.",
    "The Papers shouldnt be graded out of so few total points because each small mistake translates to a huge drop off in percentage points",
    "it was good",
    "Material poorly taught and very abstract. Too much detail in lectures and readings that is not covered in the exam. Section was very helpful, though.",
    "This course does a good job of providing a basic overview of different political setups and organizations outside of the United States",
    "The course is clear and well-organized.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, lecture slides are often organized into unclear bullet points. Also, it is sometimes unclear how much we need to retain from the very technical readings.",
    "The reading was dense so I could not spend as much time analyzing the readings each night as I would like. The lectures were not that engaging but section is always interesting and engaging.",
    "The topics of the course were arranged in a logical manner, making it easier for the student to digest the content of the readings and lectures. The writing assignments were purposeful in checking for the student's understanding and ability to apply the concepts learned to current international events.",
    "Best part about this course was the section discussions!!!",
    "Reading many texts for a lecture and taking notes in class are very important for this course.",
    "More focus on short papers. Students were not provided adequate assistance in writing these papers.",
    "This course is very interesting and adds the necessary context to the political current events, which made for an engaging and helpful class."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Probably not. The material and class itself began as engaging and interesting but slowly devolved into ambiguity.",
    "I would recommend this course as I think it's a very good starting point for any student interested in political science or who wants to have well-informed conversations about politics and current global events.",
    "Maybe - it was an interesting class, and I really enjoyed the way that it intersected with my other political science courses in learning these basic concepts. Overall, I liked the material and what I learned, but it wasn't the most engaging class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend if you are a political science major because it helps you in other classes too to understand the content and concepts.",
    "Most definitely! I really enjoyed the course and everything I learned, despite the course's drawbacks.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone who is curious about global political regimes. If you put in the effort, you will come out of PLSC 116 with a much greater knowledge base about global affairs and the histories behind different states.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they were interested in comparative politics. It does use a textbook and some of the readings are pretty dull, but the professor tries to explain all topics during lecture, and discussion sections really bring the subject matter to life.",
    "I think I would recommend it to someone who is willing to engage very much with the subject matter, but if they arent already interested, I wouldnt recommend it.",
    "Yes, this class is very interesting and helps you better understand political science.",
    "Yes, it is a good introduction to political science",
    "Yes. It is a great way to learn the global dimensions and institutions of politics.",
    "I would not recommend this class. Very poor.",
    "No, never.",
    "Not particularly. The material is not particularly in depth and you can take seminars in political science that might be more meaningful for learning.",
    "Maybe it was interesting but graded very harshly",
    "of course it was interesting",
    "Yes, as a good introduction to comparative politics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as it engages with current political happenings that could concern us on a global scale.",
    "For people who want a better understanding of the news, this is a good introductory course, but I would not describe it as super inspiring or anything. This is what I would picture as the typical undergraduate course. I enjoyed it, though, and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. Gave me a solid understanding of comparative politics. I learned a lot of introductory material that I know will be helpful in my future political science class.",
    "Yes. Gives a good overview of the topic but goes really fast.",
    "Yes",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student because of the interesting lectures and the wildly engaging sections."
