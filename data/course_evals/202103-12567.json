I improved my writing, paper analysis, and learned how to explore the psychological elements of art.  I grew immensely as an academic and general person in this course.",

                "strengths: focuses on conceptual understanding of work to reinforce knowledge learned instead of pure memorizing like other art history courses. trip to the MET and sections in the YUAG  strengthened learning by seeing the works up close and in person. created an engaging learning environment i was excited to go to class/section each week. \r\n\r\nweakness: some of the concepts were challenging to understand so it could have been helpful to go over recurring concepts (tronnie, Kenlijkheyt, houding, etc.) for individuals without previous art history background",
                "Strengths - low stress way to get into art history\r\nWeaknesses - none really",
                "Could probably improve variation in learning rather than solely lecture. Could also definitely have been more organized in terms of assignments and details.",
                "A big strength is that this course solely focuses on one artist - Rembrandt, so that we are able to cover a range of different styles he had developed throughout his lifetime. We are also able to compare Rembrandt's work with his contemporaries, so as to better locate him in a specific historical and artistic context. Another huge plus is that the YUAG has a great collection of Rembrandt's prints so we were able to appreciate them in person.",
                "Sometimes the assignments were a bit unclear/open-ended but Prof Suthor is the nicest person!",
                "The content was great and Professor Suthor's analysis is fantastic. I believe the class lacks engaged discussion. The content would be more lively and keep student's attention more if we were able to more actively engage with the professor. It can be hard to keep engagement when the professor discusses dense material for such a long period of time. I think slowing down the lecture and opening it up for more questions and discussion would benefit the class.",
                "Strengths: sections at the YUAG. My TA was great and I loved engaging with Rembrandt's prints in person. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings were very heavy/dense. At the beginning, lectures were hard to understand but they got better as the semester went on. Also, the course largely focused on aesthetics. I wish we could have learned a little bit more about Dutch art as a whole and the history during the time. I feel that I have a great understanding of Rembrandt's own paintings, but no nothing else about Dutch art itself.",
                "Interaction with materials at the YUAG was a big plus, lectures were not particularly engaging and did not feel like they built on prior lectures or had any sort of larger course narrative."

                "I would strongly recommend this course as it has been one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Suthor is an engaging teacher who creates a learning environment where students can enjoy going to class and gaining knowledge. The information I learned was taught in a conceptual way that I can understand and remember for long after college and enjoy going to museums. I knew nothing about paintings before this class but now I want to go to museums in my free time and engage in the art world/further my art history learning.",
                "Yes, I would! A great way to start with art history.",
                "Yes! Very interesting if you want to learn about Rembrandt.",
                "Yes - whether or not you have prior experience in art history, it's a good idea to get to know Rembrandt a bit better with this course! Because Prof. Suthor put a lot of emphasis on the methodology of looking at a painting instead of specific art historical facts, even non majors are able to enjoy the class without getting swamped by memorization.",
                "I loved it!  It wasn't an easy course for me but I think it pushed my art history writing skills and the people were great.",
                "Absolutely.  This is only my second HSAR course and it was my favorite class I've ever taken at yale.  The Professor Suthor is phenomenal, my ta was wonderful.  I learned so much in the course, a happy surprise as I took it as a fun class, not expecting to be too involved beyond class work.  It was my refuge during a very difficult semester, so thankful.  Professor Suthor went above and beyond to help her students, she gave me the most compassionate and comprehensive advice on my written work that I've received from a Yale instructor.",
                "I would recommend this course only to students who have a true passion for art history and who have already taken at least one introductory art history course. The material is dense and can be dry at times but is worth learning in the end. Professor Suthor is a wise teacher, however, she speaks quickly which can make it hard to understand. It is an amazing class, but if you have trouble paying attention don't take it. If you do decide to take it then you will gain so much critical thinking and analysis skills.",
                "If you are an art history major and like Rembrandt, then yes. Before you take this class, make sure you are okay focusing on one artist. I think sometimes it is great because you develop a deep understanding of their work, but at times it can be a little repetitive.",
