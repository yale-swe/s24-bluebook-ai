   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There is a lot of information presented in a short amount of time, but there are plenty of resources available to the students if they are struggling. Office hours are held literally all the time with talented TAs, peer tutors, and even the instructor to answer questions about homework assignments or exams. The one thing that bothered me throughout the course was inconsistencies in grading of homeworks. I noticed that even though I submitted similar answers when compared to my classmates, there was sometimes a 10-12 percent difference in grades.",
    "It was nice that this course was recorded online, but I feel that that also prompted me to go to lecture less and pay less attention to it... The slides had a lot of examples, which was helpful but also made it very hard to review because the most essential information was hard to find (buried within the pages and pages of slides)",
    "All courses at this university should be live streamed and recorded. Amazing. 10\/10. Really vital for students with learning difficulties who can't sit through a lecture and focus and take effective notes, especially in a QR course.",
    "Overall I found the course to be effective at teaching fundamental knowledge of statistics that can be built upon in greater detail in further classes. The integration of technology I found very effective, especially recording the lecture so they could be viewed later. I also enjoyed how the 2nd midterm was able to be taken outside of class.  At times homework problems could be worded vaguely, but because students can ask questions on Piazza these issues were easily cleared up.",
    "Strengths - clearly organized, amazing professor, easy to get help\r\nWeaknesses - none",
    "I really appreciated the flexibility that JDRS provided us this semester. For example we had the opportunity to go to class or watch the lectures online. Also, we were able to do the second midterm and final as take home tests, which allowed me to study for it at a rate that I chose.",
    "Strength: The course was easily digestible. The problems sets were tricky, but they synthesized course material well. I went to office hours to complete them, and I think I learned more in office hours while doing the problem sets than in class. Weaknesses: The class itself tended to be long and boring. Also, the two midterms were hard, and I felt that they did not represent the material we covered in class. Finally, this class would really benefit from an optional section. This would help break down and practice all of the information that we learned in class.",
    "I really liked how this class was set up with a big lecture for the first 8 weeks and a split into smaller groups based on interests for the last 5 weeks. I think the weekly psets definitely helped me better learn and apply the topics covered in class. I also appreciated that the lectures were recorded and I could  watch them on my own time. Additionally, I loved and appreciated all the help from the wonderful peer tutors and the amount of office hours they had.",
    "Strength: Very fair, good office hours available, recorded lectures and notes\r\nWeakness: Lectures are sometimes difficult to understand",
    "Strengths: I like how the class accommodates a variety of learning styles. Personally, I loved being able to watch the lecture at any point (and at two times speed).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we didn't use Minitab, as it seems that other programs like R and SPSS are more commonly used. I think the class would be much harder to follow if I used SPSS on my own, because every class example (and even some questions on the final) use Minitab. Also, I think the class slides are a bit confusing to study from.",
    "The lectures were recorded, which actually makes a lot of sense, and saves a lot of time for the students so they don't have to be running around. Not many improvements I can think of. Fun environment if you went to class. Non stressful midterms and finals.",
    "The course covers a good amount of material and is well-paced. There are also a lot of resources and options available for the course, from being recorded\/streamed online to flipped classroom videos for your own reference to lots of TAs\/office hours to exams being available online. I think that the organization of it could be more clearly communicated from the beginning, since each class isn't really separated into its own topic and so sometimes you don't know what you're going to cover that day.",
    "The course is VERY fast and some of the concepts that should've been stressed more weren't. I wish more time had been spent on regression as a whole too.",
    "Strengths: clarity in content, great teacher, exciting lecturer\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: easy to do the bare minimum (could watch lectures online, open more exams, etc). \r\n\r\nImprovements: make us show up to lecture",
    "I really liked how the professor recorded lectures and put them in the media library on canvas",
    "The course is fine overall. However, the course had little to nothing to do with political and social science, and the two sections were combined. I wonder why the distinction exists - it should just be one class. The open note format of the exams is nice in that it reduces stress, but it makes it easy not to learn much in the class.",
    "It was a huge lecture and not a lot of engaging work, as is with most lectures.",
    "I think the course is very well structured as it is.",
    "Good course",
    "Strengths: all lectures are filmed and powerpoints are posted online so its easy to compare your notes and make sure you didnt miss anything, study guides are really useful for exams, lots of office hours\r\nWeaknesses: none, just make sure you pay attention and youll do well",
    "I felt that the online structure of the class was a bit disengaged at times. That being said, Professor Reuning-Scherer was an energetic lecturer and the TFs were incredible. However, at times I felt that information both in lecture and in the PDFs are presented in disorganized ways, or that we would spend a lot of time on easier concepts but speed through more difficult concepts",
    "LOVED the recorded lectures & the notes. JDRS uses Canvas better than any prof Ive ever had. Subject is undeniably dry but JDRS knows it and makes it as fun as possible.\r\n\r\nPSETs are good and TAs are nice. Overall Id say its a well done course",
    "Very well organized, notes and lectures very clear - LOVED THE PROFESSOR JRS makes the class worth taking",
    "Amazing professor and TA's were super helpful. Office hours were always very helpful.",
    "I think homeworks are worth too much. Everything else is great.",
    "while the overarching theories and big ideas of specific concepts were presented well in lecture, these didn't necessarily translate into knowledge about how to approach homework problems, which had more to do with specific data",
    "I think the professor was very engaging, I think making class mandatory instead of taping the lectures would have encouraged people to take it more seriously",
    "This course was presented live, as a traditional lecture course, and the lectures were recorded so that students could choose their class experience. The professor and the teaching fellows also offered office hours throughout the week at varied times, which also facilitated student learning.",
    "This course is goes really fast so its hard to learn during class - there is  a lot of self study",
    "I wish Minitab was more integrated into exams\/that exams mimicked problem sets in a more coherent way. I also think that students should receive clearer feedback on where they missed points on problem sets.",
    "The problem sets (except for two of them) were very manageable and I LOVED being able to watch the video lectures instead of going to lectures (because i had a class that ended slightly before this lecture on the opposite side of campus and getting to the actual lecture was a HIKE)\r\n\r\nI was very confused about who was a TA for what section, especially towards the end, and that did make finding help a lot harder.",
    "I liked how the course was video-captured. It made following the course content very easy and accessible.",
    "The teaching is very effective, as the instructor is particularly engaging and capable of clarifying abstract terms. It could be improved if there are more exercises.",
    "Strengths: accessibility to office hours, great professor",
    "This is a great course because while it is engaging and teaches you a LOT, it is extremely flexible. All the lectures are recorded and can be live streamed online, and students also had the option of taking midterms and finals online as well. The professor is extremely engaging and makes the best jokes (that are normally very bad, but make students laugh). Classes are very entertaining yet allow students to learn lots of information. This course also has a multitude of office hours that allowed students to get help whenever they needed.",
    "I liked the weekly p-sets because they would always review what we learned throughout the week. I don't think there were many weaknesses. I mean, the course was recorded, which I really liked, but it also allowed me to miss class sometimes and fall behind. But, thats not really a weakness of the course.",
    "The teaching assistants were extremely available and helpful for this course, with their abundance of office hours. The homework was challenging, but not impossible, and the instructor stressed the importance of learning the material rather than worrying about the grade. Having the lectures be recorded was a major bonus for myself, as I do not learn particularly well in the lecture setting, so after lecture, I could rewatch any part of the class that I had trouble with. I do not have any criticisms of the course.",
    "The course was well organized.",
    "I thought that JDRS was very engaging and the problem sets did a good job of covering topics that we actually went in depth on in class.",
    "The tests seemed unrepresentative of the problem sets  they were testing us on different things. But the problems were creative and interesting.",
    "2.\tThere are tons of office hours for this class, so it is easy to find time to go get help from either JDRS or peer tutors or TAs, which is great.  They will walk you through the problems if they have to and explain every part of it.  Lectures aren't super interesting but that is partly due to the material being taught, in my opinion.  The problem sets seem to be pretty fair and are a good way to work through the things we are learning in class step by step.  It would be nice if we could see feedback straight on the pdf that we turn in; it is a little difficult to figure out where we are going wrong on the homework when we have to refer back and forth to the rubric.  JDRS links some supplementary material on his slides, but some more stuff might be nice, either other videos to watch or other practice questions.",
    "The strength of this particular course is that everything is explained well in lecture and then the TAs can help you if you dont understand something in office hours. All of the lectures were broadcast online live so that really helped me to engage with the course. One of the midterm review sessions was also broadcast live. Minitab, which is the statistical software used during the course, is easy to understand and use. The only weakness was that the final exam was online, which was helpful in taking the exam, but I think the final exam answers were marked by a computer because if you didnt put the exact one word that was deemed the right answer you lost points, even if you wrote that one word and then another word to make your answer more clear. I think if the final exam answers could be checked by a human this would improve the experience greatly, Becuase I emailed the professor saying I lost a point even though I got the right answer but never heard anything. Also there was a huge disparity in how some of the TAs graded the psets.",
    "The fact that this course had video capture technology was incredibly helpful for me. I am a slow learner when it comes to math, so being able to pause the lecture and spend as much time as I needed taking notes was amazingly helpful, as was being able to pause, rewind, and rewatch whenever I didn't understand something fully the first time around.\r\nThe pace of this course is very fast, but because of the lectures being online, I did not feel overwhelmed. The problem sets were well formulated to make sure that we understood and could apply the material.\r\nMy one complaint would be with the TA feedback on the homework assignments. I found it somewhat difficult to understand, and the medium to be not very user friendly.",
    "This class was very interactive and there were always office hours that I could attend. I was also very appreciative that JDRS always made himself available.",
    "I very much appreciated the course's flexible structure, and I benefitted from the ability to go to class whenever I wanted to. However, I can see how this might be challenging for those who struggle with time management.",
    "I thought it was perfectly structured."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a Political Science or Psychology major because it counts as a required course. For psychology specifically, this course is more engaging and rewarding than the PSYC 200 option. If you can, TAKE THIS CLASS WITH JRDS!! He is so much fun and does everything he possibly can to make the course interesting and fun for his students.",
    "Yes. Go to office hours.",
    "Very much. I found the class structured effectively, and the implementation of technology allowed the class to be far more flexible than any other class I have taken.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn statistics. It's a great intro to the field and well-organized. JDRS is the best!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if a student is interested in learning an introduction to statistics.",
    "I guess? If you need a QR and you are a Political Science major, why not? It is better than Intro Micro, and you will actually learn some information about statistics. I did not find this class super interesting and useful, but I am glad I took it. Be careful though, grading is ambiguous, the midterms were very hard, and it is pretty easy to be lost. However, the final was much more approachable and representative of what we actually learned in the class.",
    "I never took a stats course before (in college or high school) and was nervous about taking this course thinking many other students would have had more experience. However, this course was actually designed and taught as an intro course. The pace of the course was nice and the material wasn't too difficult to grasp. It was a very chill class and I am glad I took it to get a basic foundation in stats. However, the course could also be easily put to the side to focus better on other courses (which I definitely found myself doing) and I feel that I would've gained and learned more from the course had I dedicated more to fully understanding all the topics well. The last 2 exams were take-home and open note which I found very convenient and the exams weren't hard either.",
    "Yes, the course content is useful and it is not too difficult of a course.",
    "It is an intro class, so you will definitely walk out with the foundational knowledge for later statistics courses. However, I really would have preferred to learn from a program other than minitab, so I ended up feeling like I didn't learn a lot of \"usable\" knowledge.",
    "I would recommend this course if you just need a stats requirement for pre-med. The professor is charismatic and excellent. There is so much office hour help to get you through it. Overall, it is a very low workload course. The second midterm and the final were take home. Low stress. No competition. I never went to class and still managed to do well. If you want something intellectually stimulating I would say take a different stats course. If you just want a fifth class that you sometimes forget that you're even taking, take this class.",
    "I'd recommend this to anybody looking to gain a basic knowledge of statistics as applied to different fields. You do less work by hand and a lot of it on the computer, so if you want to get a sense of the mathematical foundations this might not be the best one, but good for social science majors looking to understand the stats\/quantitative side of research and things like that.",
    "Yes. This should be required for all Yale students. The skills learned are useful and interesting, and are definitely applicable to almost all majors. JDRS is a legend that kept class interesting and truly wants to be there to teach students about statistics. The workload is easy (short problem set most weeks) and the examinations are easy as long as you paid attention to lecture. If you even put in a tiny ounce of effort, it is easy to get an A. This class knocks out a QR requirement, teaches useful skills, and is enjoyable thanks to an awesome and kind professor who wants everyone to succeed.",
    "Yes, if you want a good intro to statistics and a course that works with a busy schedule or a different learning style, this course definitely will work for you.",
    "Absolutely, I really enjoyed the class and the professor is great",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend it to a student who wants a basic survey of statistics.",
    "Yes, it's a relatively fun course where you learn a fair amount with a light workload.",
    "This class is so well organized and taught in a very engaging way. He records lectures and makes the course material very accessible. The problem sets you get weekly are a bit challenging but at the end I feel like I always understand the material, which can't be said for all classes. The exams are very much not surprising and I think a very fair representation of how much you understand the material. I feel like there was a lot of support from jdrs and from the TAs all the time. And since so many people take the class it's really easy to find someone to work on problem sets with. Would recommend.",
    "Yes. I would recommend. This is a great introductory class to learn about statistics in general, whether or not youll be a stats major.",
    "Yes I would in order to gain a basic understanding of analyzing data",
    "I would because stats is a difficult subject, but the way this class is set up makes it easier to handle.",
    "This is a decent basic stats course. However, I would not recommend this course if you are interested in learning other programs besides Minitab, as this course is quite Minitab heavy",
    "Its a good QR! Pretty gutty if JDRS decides to do take home\/open note exams again. If you wanna learn more about stats take it! Also take it if you want a nice review. JDRS is fun and cute and lectures are recorded so its mostly breezy.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes - JRS is an excellent professor and stats 100 is essential for any working knowledge of statistics",
    "Yes! I definitely recommend this class to someone who needs a QR!",
    "Stats 102\/103 was straightforward and fair",
    "I would recommend the course to a student whose career and \/ or academic interests pertain to data and statistical analysis.",
    "Its a requirement for a lot of subjects, so most people will end up taking this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that has never taken a statistics course before because it gives a good overview and a strong foundation of statistical ideas. For students that have already taken a basic statistics class, I would not recommend it because they become bored by the review.",
    "I think it is a very good intro class but not very deep into stats",
    "Yes, it's a relatively painless QR credit and you get an overview of stats.",
    "Definitely take it you're looking for a manageable (QR?) credit. But I was kind of upset that 102\/103 didn't really have a lot of resources to help you learn R, so I probably would have liked to take 106 instead",
    "This is a very solid course. Learned great skills and was taught in an accessible way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The professor was engaging and funny. The material was presented as clearly as possible given the complexities of some topics.",
    "Yes. I think it is an ideal choice for people who have not had statistics before or would like to consider majoring in S&DS.",
    "Yes",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It teaches a basis for all static analysis, and provides information on techniques for analyzing data, and how to get conclusions from that data, using examples that are applicable in the real world. The class teaches basic information that would be useful to all students wanting to know about stats and number analysis.",
    "If you want to learn about the basis of stats, I think you would like this course. You aren't required to do actual math, but learn how to use certain methods in different situations.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The instructor and the teaching assistants were extremely helpful for any problem or concern that I ever had. I feel like a background statistics is a necessary or useful insight to have in any field, and this introductory course was excellent.",
    "If they want a practical and useful QR, I would recommend this course to another Yale student.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any and all students! It's so important to have some knowledge of statistics for any major or career, and this course is a ver un-intimidating overview.",
    "Yes  the material seems necessary for many social science courses.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course.   It is not particularly interesting material to learn; it is fairly basic, and even when it gets complicated it is not explained in a way that I could understand or appreciate most of the time.  It took a long while before I could get a grasp on most of the material.  JDRS does his best to make the lectures more palatable, but they are pretty boring besides that.  After the first half of the course, staying in 103 ended up looking like the best option to me just because it was the least of all the possible evils; all of the other sections, Life Sciences and Medicine, sounded like they were going to be worse.  If you have to choose, probably choose this section.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student Becuase if you listen in lecture and go to office hours and the review sessions you can understand the material and do well in this course. I think these statistical skills are useful for life.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Although it is fast paced, the instructor does everything he can to help his students learn the material. Having the lectures videotaped and available as a resource makes this a much more manageable class.",
    "Yes! It is a great skill set to have!",
    "Yes, very much."
