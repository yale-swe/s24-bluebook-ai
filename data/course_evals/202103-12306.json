                "The course gave me a great understanding of physical science as well as the social impacts of fossil fuels.",
                "I learned a lot about fossil fuels and their technologies. There was also a lot of geology and geological history in regards to coal and petroleum systems which was interesting. You also learn about fossil fuels and their connection to climate change towards the end which was why I took the course.",
                "This course is a wonderful introduction into the different types of fossil fuels, how theyre made, and their applications. Further, the course covers our energy system and various ways were hoping to decarbonize the grid.",

I learned content-specific formulas as well as computational skills to compare data. I also learned about the necessary geological environment required for different fossil fuels to develop over time on a scale of millions of years."

                "I think sometimes it was hard for me to recognize when something was important to focus on in the course and when there were details meant to support our studies if we had questions\/were interested in studying further. But I thought that many of the topics were covered in a very clear, understandable way, and I learned a ton.",
                "Strengths: If you are interested in this material, this class is fantastic. It gives you a very thorough, apolitical understanding of fossil fuels as a resource, and then provides you with the information contextualizing fossil fuels as an energy resource and the driver of climate change. The problem sets are all very interesting. The study sessions are very helpful and give you access to talk to the professor about anything you would find interesting to ask him about. Workload is very manageable so you have time to pursue things you find interesting in the course without sidelining the main material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much at all. I think we may have lingered on tectonics for a bit too long but that's the only topic I thought wasn't well timed.",
                "The curriculum for this course made perfect sense to me, I don't believe it needs to be improved. Professor Oristaglio clearly works to keep it up to date and he is very knowledgeable about this subject.",
                "Very well structured class. It was really great that we had lectures recorded even though we were back in person this semester (the recordings are really helpful if you want to rewatch them for the midterm or final). One weakness is that there is a lot of information in the slides but you dont necessarily have to know all of it so as you get more familiar with it you have to learn what content will be important and on the exams.",
                "This course does a fantastic job at outlining various topics and the concepts driving them. The material is incredibly clear and concise. The only drawback I found was the course being taught all the way in the geology department.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Oristaglio was very understanding and accommodating with extensions and recording lectures which made the course easier to handle \r\nWeaknesses: The grading system was quite harsh; at times, it felt a lot like an intro EPS class talking about tectonics\/geology, even though an intro EPS class was required",
                "Good lectures",
                "The strengths of this course were the evenly scheduled problem sets and the grading system of the course. \r\nThere were no perceived weaknesses of the course."
