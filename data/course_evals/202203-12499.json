                "The projects were really cool and gave us the opportunity to work with cutting-edge hardware and contribute to real research.\r\n\r\nI think the course would have benefited from more practice with Verilog early in the semester. The paper discussions/reviews didnt really work, and I think that is because many of us didnt have the background to understand much of the content (cryptography and security) at this level. Maybe starting with some classic papers on programmable hardware and more explicit instruction in reviewing research papers would have helped. \r\n\r\nUltimately, there didnt seem to be that much unique content at the intersection of FPGAs and cloud computing until security came up (nor in the Verilog textbook), which made several lectures feel repetitive. I think a more historical presentation of reconfigurable hardware, its adoption in the datacenter, and how it impacts security could make the course more engaging while preserving the link to the professors research area."

                "I can recommend it to graduate students and advanced undergrads looking for novel, open-ended work in engineering. Less so for a general EE/CS audience if you just want to learn advanced digital design and FPGAs right now, but I think it has potential to work well with a larger class and a TA. This semester, it felt like the professor wasnt able to devote enough time to it."
