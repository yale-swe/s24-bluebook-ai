                "Learned about reception studies, Latin America during the colonial era, an introduction to Latin from Colonial Mexico, and how to deal with questions about antiquity, race, colonialism, and classics.",
                "I learned a lot about the landscape of colonial Mexican Latin including race relationships between Spaniards, Indigenous people, and Creoles. I learned about how Colonial Mexico built off of the legacies of Virginian epic and eclogues. I became a much stronger translator, and analytical thinker. I learned how to look at transcriptions and identify scribal errors. I think the biggest insight that I am taking away from this course would be that history and the truth are subjective and malleable depending on who is telling it and how it is being told.",
                "My Latin fluency increased drastically, and I learned how to read and synthesize texts much more quickly. I also learned how to be more critical and to truly analyze the underlying tensions in each primary source.",
                "I learned that there is an entire literature written in Latin from Mexico after the Spanish Conquest. More so than any other Latin class I have taken, this class allowed us to interrogate the foundations of Classics as a discipline, to question standard approaches to Latin literature, and to learn about the world of pre-Conquest and post-Conquest Mexicoits peoples, its languages, its landscape, and its histories."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the professor, the students, the discussions, the concepts/themesa fantastic course! \r\nWeaknesses: some of the Latin readings were confusing and don't come with English translations, so I was sometimes unsure of whether I was translating correctly; we were assigned a lot of secondary reading that often wasn't discussed in class. I think this could be improved by having a contextual/content-based introduction to the texts before we read them for each week.",
                "Strengths include reading Latin from a time period and by people who I have never read Latin from before. I thought it was so amazing that we got to see Classics in a new context and see how it has been transformed by readers and writers from Colonial Mexico. I think the strengths are that the course is structured very intentionally to make connections between eras, genres, and people from different positionalities in Colonial Mexico. The essay prompts got you to think about how the context surrounding the text affect what can and cannot be said in them. The quizzes did not only focus on translation but also synthesizing secondary sources to the passage, which I appreciated. I think a weakness would be that sometimes I was a bit lost with the historical context before diving into very advanced and detailed sources about events that I was not very familiar with. I think that this course could be improved by having short lectures or more broad informational historical background. I would also love to have a longer research paper as an assignment!",
                "I think that at times the amount of material could be overwhelming, and I think a bit more context information about all the secondary sources could be helpful! Sometimes the secondary source readings were really dense, and it was hard to connect them to the primary source readings/topics at hand.",
                "No particular weaknesses. My only suggestion might be to make the final exam a longer take-home essay rather than an in-class essay or exam."

                "Yes. I think that every Classics student should take this course, or something like it. You might go in thinking that it's not directly relevant to antiquity, but you would be surprised; this course has made me rethink so much of what I've learned in Classics so far, and the class makes us talk about topics that aren't, but should be, discussed in most Classics courses. It makes you think about why we study Latin today, how the discipline of Classics came into being, what the role of Latin/antiquity is to societies outside of the ancient Mediterranean, and how Classics has historically been used in colonialism. Professor Valdivieso is absolutely incredible. She invites us to speak about our opinions but also makes so many insightful comments. I left each class having felt that I truly learned something new that I could carry forth into my studies, even if I don't pursue \"Latin from Mexico\" further. The only warning is that this class is a lot of work. There is something due (a quiz, reading response, or paper) every single class, and each class also has Latin and secondary readings. Some weeks we would have to translate 300 to 400 lines of Latin, read 80 pages of scholarship, and take a quiz/write a reading response. But don't let this dissuade you. Professor Valdivieso is incredibly accommodating and kind, and the work you put into the class is well worth it.",
                "Yes! Absolutely.",
                "YesProfessor Valdiviesos is one of those rare professors who is simultaneously interested in the subject matter and able to communicate it in a digestible and engaging manner. 10/10 course, highly recommend for Classicists looking for a break from Classical Latin.",
                "Yes! I absolutely loved this class -- it truly changed the way I think about Latin texts.",
                "If you are a Classics major or have enough knowledge of Latin to take this class, please take it. There are very fewor maybe noclasses in the Classics department like this one. It is an especially good class if you want to experience a wider variety of texts in Latin than the more typical Classical canon allows. Such a good class.",
                "Absolutely! So few Classics courses highlight non-European perspectives, so this course was not only incredibly refreshing but also points to a gap in the curriculum that needs to be filled"
