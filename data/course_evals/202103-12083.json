                "I learned how to \"see\" like a photographer because learning how to take a picture is a simple enough task but learning what to take a picture of and what is worth photographing is another level of difficulty, and I felt like Danna excelled at this.",
                "i really got to learn the basics of photography: composition, lighting, story etc. i learned how to use a DSLR and printing skills",
                "I learned about the skills and technical side of photography, and I learned about how to make photographic work that conveyed messages. It allowed me to approach photography as a form of art making.",
                "Camerawork/using a digital camera\r\nEditing + printing photos using photoshop\r\nCritiquing photography\r\nAppreciation for the art form\r\nBeginning of an understanding of composition and form.\r\n\r\nTaking this class, I thought a lot more about how I see the world around me, and how I can communicate using images. In addition to technical photography skills (as listed above), I spent a lot of time thinking about what parts of my life I wanted to share, and how to make art out of my everyday experiences.",
                "I developed the ability to take better pictures (thinking more about color, framing, composition) as well as some of the technical elements of using a camera through experience (and learned some tips and tricks from the professor. I also learned a little bit about how to use photoshop to fix up photos, and use photoshop to prepare and print out photos on paper. We also learned about different approaches and philosophies for taking photographs, challenges with taking photos. And we also discussed several contemporary photographers, their practice, and learned how to talk more constructively about photos and photography. Overall, though this course, I feel as if my way of taking photos has improved quite substantially.",
                "From this course, you learn a lot about the history of photography, how to use a camera, and what art you are drawn to making. The way that this course is designed strongly encourages self-exploration and encourages students to make work that they are drawn to making.",
                "A new way of seeing and capturing the world through photography.",
                "I learned about camera handling, composition/framing, style, and artists' stories.",
                "Taking Danna's class, I really learned mostly to think about what I was taking pictures of. Important subject matter and learning to capture things from a unique perspective in order to offer something with your pictures will become your ultimate focus. Keep on trying and trying, and a good photo will pop out every once in a while. And for now, that's all it really takes. That's what you'll learn in this class, and you'll have a fun time doing it, as you get to see yourself and your classmates develop their own style and have ideas really come into fruition.",

                "some strengths were that it was a very supportive class and I feel like even if I was a beginner photographer I learned a ton",
                "Very good class.",
                "The course was a great introduction. I learned a lot of the basics of camerawork, editing, and printing, as well as exploring the medium and expressing myself. I'm not a super \"creative type\" (with especially little previous skill or practice with visual art), and I found the class accessible, fun, and rewarding. Danna is a great instructor. The artist talks were also super cool and eye-opening.\r\n\r\nThe class is very flexible, which is great because people can really go in their own directions with the work. The downside of this is that one has to take more initiative to get a lot out of the classit can sometimes be easier to do less work than you ought to, because there are not very many deadlines or assignments.",
                "The course is structured quite well and I felt was very conducive to being creative and taking risks. I am not sure I have many weaknesses to list. I think the only thing I would change is getting to see more sources of inspiration and resources like the YUAG a little sooner so we could access those more! But that is a very small point.",
                "Absolutely no weaknesses. This course is designed so literally the only objective is for you to feel supported to learn. Danna is of course the biggest strength of the course. She has so much knowledge about photography and still manages to encourage students to try new things. Danna enough is reason to take the course.",
                "The course was a great balance between teacher-led and student-guided. Danna was very responsive and receptive to our needs, extremely encouraging and supportive, and allowed us to make work we enjoyed and can be proud of. May not be the best format for those who want very structured class schedules.",
                "One thing I would have liked in the course was a day or two on fine tuning the camera work/technical skills. Like how other art classes may have a time to paint or sketch a still life, I think a day or two spent on the class taking pictures of a still life to learn as much technical skills as possible would have been really nice."

I came in with 0 experience and learned a lot. I've come away from the class with a new skill (I'm definitely gonna keep taking photos, whether it's just for myself or at events and stuff), as well as some new thoughts about what art I wanna make, and how to look at photos.",
                "Yes I would! You will learn so much! Of course how to take photos (or better photos), and more importantly how to think about photos, compose photos, discuss photos, and see sources of inspiration.",
                "Absolutely! Especially take it if Danna is teaching. You will learn so much about photography and feel supported doing so.",
                "Absolutely! For those who are beginners in photo, this was a wonderful and gentle introduction into a medium that can be generative for your practice.",
