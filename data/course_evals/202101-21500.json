                "The strengths are the structure of the course. I really liked how the class was broken up into sections and I think the smaller class size fostered a better learning environment. I do not really see any weaknesses.",
                "Great class, but I wish there was more practice material for exams. The PSETs weren't really like the tests at all, and the practice tests for midterms weren't enough practice material",
                "The scheduling of the course seemed like it didn't always align with problem sets. I remember a problem set being due on a given Wednesday and then learning a concept that was being assessed on the problem set the day after it was due in class. Besides that the virtual lectures were still effective in delivering content. The only thing that I would recommend is having a TA or two in each lecture to go around and help the professor with breakout room work.",
                "It was difficult to learn remotely. It would have been nice to have had the classes recorded.",
                "For virtual learning, course was taught very well. Lectures were engaging (for a covid year), and course material was taught in a very digestible way.",
                "The professor was great and explained all the concepts throughly. There were also a lot of resources available to the students. I do not think there are any major weaknesses.",
                "I think some of the weaknesses of this course was that a lot of time it was very hard to digest material because every class we were learning new material. Some of the strengths were that the course load was pretty manageable with just one p-set a week and I found the explorations very helpful.",
                "I thought this course moved at the perfect pacewe covered a lot of ground with each class, but never so much that I felt lost. At the same time, I sometimes felt as if we hadn't covered all the topics necessary to answer some of the p-set questions; I spent a lot of time reading the textbook on my own and also searching things up online.",
                "Strengths: extremely well organized in Canvas, great instructor, well organized course overall. Weaknesses: not much of a break on problem sets on the week of midterms, but honestly nothing else.",
                "Strength\r\n- lots of resources for help",
                "Lots of in-depth instruction. Could use more difficult examples such as those on psets and exams.",
                "One of the strengths was Brett Smith, who is an experienced and very approachable professor. He is always available and highly encourages his students to come to him for any help or guidance. If you take this course, I recommend you take his specific section. The only weakness is the content, which can often feel detached from its applications, since this is an introductory course focused mainly on honing in the skills rather than exploring how they are applied in the real world. Often times, this made the class boring, but that is to be expected from an introductory math course."

                "This class made me feel engaged over zoom which was wonderful. The professor would constantly have polls and ask for people to explain their answer choices and reasoning. He also used breakout rooms in every class which helped break the monotony of just sitting and watching the professor.",
                "Like I said in my last response, I think the breakout rooms are great for individuals to work together to test their understanding of the material being taught in lecture, but if they get stuck the professor isn't always there to help because they have to bounce around from group to group. I think that having a TA or two in the class that could assist the professor with these sorts of things would be beneficial.",

Although the breakout rooms seemed like another good way to keep us engaged, I ended up in a breakout room where everyone kept their camera off and no one would discuss the questions with me. Perhaps this could have been remedied if we had switched breakout rooms partway through the term or had simply been in a different breakout room every time.",
                "The course took full advantage of Canvas and its features to keep things organized. It was also helpful that the instructor encouraged everyone to have their cameras on to make as much of a classroom experience as possible.
