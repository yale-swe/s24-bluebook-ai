Very grateful to be a part of this course and learn about a new field. I was able to gain interviewing skills from this course and it was part of my final paper for this class as well.",

                "strengths: Prof. Escamilla Garcia is an extremely passionate, knowledgeable, and approachable professor -- he made the course one in which students were extremely comfortable and eager to learn more about; the readings were usually pretty manageable lengths; the midterm and final were also very fair and manageable; Prof. Escamilla Garcia also makes it very fun to be in his class and was very flexible with deadlines, etc. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: none that I can think of! maybe that we didn't always discuss the readings as in-depth as possible, but i still felt i got a lot out of what was talked about instead so honestly no complains",
                "Strengths were the readings and the expertise of the professor\r\nWeakness were the lack of rigorous discussion in class",
                "The professor is passionate with this subject, so it makes it makes the class more engaging and fun. He is also incredibly understanding and gives many opportunities to get feedback on the work we produce it class. A professor I will remember forever, he looks out for your best self-interest, but pushes your learning more.",
                "Strengths: Incredible professor, really engaging material and good readings\r\nWeaknesses: It wasn't always clear what the expectations on bigger assignments were until they were graded"

His lectures, readings, and background knowledge are helpful and insightful in guiding class discussions and helping us understand difficult topics. This was an amazing course, and I would love to take any course with Professor Escamilla!",

This course allowed for a place to venture on your own and conduct interviews related to the material we learned in class. It taught some important skills and expanded my knowledge within the subject of the class.",
