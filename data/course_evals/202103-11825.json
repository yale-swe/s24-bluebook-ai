                "Got the opportunity to really study and engage with several Shakespeare plays (in both text and stage formats). Our seminar group got pretty close and had a lot of fun together and really excellent discussions. The creative writing assignments were really cool and definitely expanded my perspective as a writer/poet.",
                "I learned to think more intentionally about line breaks and sound in my poetry. I also thought about the role of Shakespeare in the cultural sphere of the modern United States.",
                "This was a great opportunity to develop a creative practice while engaging with some really incredible works.",
                "We close read three different Shakespeare plays, and used this close reading to inform our own poetry! It was an incredibly illuminating course and the workshop/seminar format greatly improved my creative writing and awareness of the power of certain words.",
                "I learned how to read Shakespeare thoughtfully and with a critical eye for his poetic craft. I also learned apply Shakespeare's method to my own poetry and used his work for inspiration. I also had to chance to workshop my poems with the class which was a great help.",
                "As someone with more Shakespeare experience than poetry experience, this course opened my eyes to the craft elements a poet must consider when working. Most importantly, I walked away with a newfound respect for and fascination with the power of images in writing.",
                "this was an amazing course, def one of my favs at yale... studying shakespeare as a poet rather than a playwright was an incredible  and unique experience",
                "This class's unique focus on both creative writing and critical analysis lends itself very well to immersing yourself in all facets of poetry. The close reading of Shakespeare, looking solely at its poetry, was stimulating. Professor Chapman's thesis, that Shakespeare is still curiously relevant to modern poetry, began to come into focus as the course progressed.\r\n\r\nThe workshop classes were of course a highlight and were incredibly beneficial in progressing as poets. Both your classmates' and Professor Chapman's comments were always helpful and enlightening."

                "I felt like some of the critical assignments were a bit like busy work. But in general, I felt the course was super conducive to engagement and learning. Definitely have to read the plays though or you're gonna be lost.",
                "This course's strengths were a welcoming learning environment and a genuine grappling with some of the central tensions of poetic compositionthe use of abstraction, the positionality of writers, etc. I benefitted most from the craft elements of this course, which included exercises in alliteration, readings on line breaks, and discussions on image clarity and strength. I did not benefit as much from (though I did enjoy) the times when we discussed the Shakespeare we were reading as if we were in a non-craft literature class (is Lear capable of loving? etc.). I understand how interpretation and craft can blend togethermaybe, for example, a student could, inspired by Lear, write a poem on the human capability to love, and employ elements from Lear's masterful range of language to do soand I know some of my classmates found this to be true for them. But I think future iterations of this course could perhaps focus more on meaning/interpretation as they relate to craft. Relatedly, I think it could be nice to spend more time in workshops.",
                "Professor Chapman is lovely and the syllabus is packed with interesting content. Sometimes it felt like we were doing too many things at once, but ultimately that made the class very satisfying.",
                "Strengths - Professor Chapman!!! She's incredibly accomplished in her craft, and brings kindness, compassion, and humor to the classroom. Her insights are always constructive and well-informed. I also enjoyed having one critical and one creative response per week; it helped develop my skills in analysis and creative writing alongside each other.",
                "Strengths: engaging discussion, manageable (and arguably fun) workload, well organized workshops\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: ...honestly none",
                "clearer direction on what the final paper should look like as it is a huge critical writing project, but the course is mostly creative writing throughout",
                "The class covers a lot of different subject material, including three Shakespeare plays, a host of different contemporary and modern poets, and of course your own poetry. This meant the material was always fresh and interesting, but came at the expense of feeling somewhat unfocused at times. With the obvious time constraint of class, it meant sometimes that we weren't able to spend as much time on some things as we would have liked.\r\n\r\nProfessor Chapman was also able to invite the director Sam Gold to talk to us about Shakespeare, which was enlightening.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity to recite and perform poetry at the end of class was an absolute highlight."

Students who have previously taken workshop courses and are considering taking this course because they wish to improve their craft may find that this course focuses a bit less on craft than they would like and that this course's workshop environment, while very supportive, does not dependably lead to useful edits. Professor Chapman, however, gives clear edits and is very helpful in one-on-one meetings.",
                "Yes absolutely, especially if you're primarily in it to write some poetry.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely!! If you enjoy writing poetry or Shakespeare whatsoever, I strongly recommend the course. What made my experience great was the people in the seminar; there was a real community in the classroom, so come to each class with an open mind!",
                "I would 1000% recommend this class to another student learning to learn more about Shakespeare and writing poetry. I honestly enjoyed doing the work for this class and I got the sense that most of my classmates did as well. I came out of this course feeling like a stronger scholar of Shakepspeare and a better poet.",
                "Yes! This was one of my favorite classes at Yale so far. The approach to Shakespeare is really not intimidating and Professor Chapman gives detailed and constructive feedback on all assignments. I feel like I learned so much about writing and reading poetry.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. The atmosphere of the class was everything an English class atmosphere should be: explorative, critical, and fun. A great choice for anyone interested in drama and poetry, the course uses a poetic lens to provide a bright, fresh outlook on Shakespeare's greatest works.",
                "absolutley. you get out of it what you put into it. be prepared to work diligently. it is a lot of reading and writing but so worth it and so fun.",
                "Interested in reading Shakespeare, contemporary poetry, and writing your own poems? If yes to all three, then definitely take this class. Not too high a workload and very fun atmosphere in class."
