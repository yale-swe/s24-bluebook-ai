                "The problem-solving approach that Professor Ozolins implemented was amazing. Practicing is a must for good mathematicians. Something that in my opinion could make the course even better is spending a little bit more time on proofs. Knowing how to intuitively derive a certain formula is a useful skill.",
                "This course was formatted well and showed the formulas necessary\/ how they worked very well. Some of the homework tended to be tougher than anything talked about in discussion and lecture.",
                "A weakness is that the material is very hard and was quite difficult to learn online. However, there was so much practice given before exams that I was able to feel prepared.",
                "Strengths: straight forward content (goes by the sections in the book) and grading is straight forward, Vidvuds is a good at explaining the concepts and nice!\r\n\r\nWeakness: if you are not a math\/engineering person, the concepts are difficult to fully understand.",
                "Vidvuds is the best. Great professor and a better person. He wants his students to do well, and he tells them what he expects out of them to be able to do math-wise. He is always available and he is extremely helpful and informative.",
                "Strengths: Vidvuds is amazing. He's extremely kind and attentive and helpful. If you go to his office hours, you will learn a ton, get ahead on the problem set, and also just have a good time because he's a great person to talk to and be around. His recorded lectures sometimes move too quickly, but then you can ask your questions in class. Weaknesses: I felt like the course was more work than it could've\/should've been--for every class we had to watch the pre-recorded lecture, which could go to an hour or over long, and answer a short pre-lecture quiz. Two classes a week added up to around 3 or 3.5 hours on average, not including lectures (which added another 2.5 hours) or the problem set, which could easily double that time or take even longer. I think it could've been a bit easier on the workload if the pre-recorded lectures were dropped, and instead, he did live virtual lectures during class time. I think this would also be more conducive to asking questions. We could then take the short quiz post-lecture instead.",
                "I really enjoyed this class. I think the system where students watch a prerecorded lecture and then come to class with questions works very well. I think it would be helpful if the professors, similar to how they started to operate towards the end of this semester, bring a few prepared questions to class, just to get everyone thinking about the subject matter.",
                "A strength is the amount of practice and preparation done for exams. \r\nA weakness is struggling to catch up on new concepts when getting slightly behind.",
                "Cool problem sets and reasonable tests.",
                "Excellently taught class.",
                "This course manages to fit a large amount of content into the semester through good pacing and good instruction.  Plenty of materials are distributed for each topic, so my learning was completed without having to access outside materials very frequently.  The flipped style of viewing a pre-recorded lecture and taking a quiz before class and then using class for review, questions, and practice problems is a good way of making it easy and routine to engage deeply with all of the content given.",
                "This course is taught really well (even over zoom!!). The course is structured with a lot of room for messing up, especially at the start of the semester, and this growth-mindset takes a lot of stress off the learning process. I highly recommend anyone who wants to take multivariable calculus to take this class.",
                "Strengths: the support we were given in class, with the professor doing questions and answering any questions. Learning the theoru via prerecorded lectures allowed us to fully grasp the concepts in our own time and ask meaningful questions in class time. \r\n\r\nWeakness: problem sets on weeks with tests- sometimes this got to be too much and the problem sets had to be completed last minute.",
                "Strengths: Lots of practice problems were provided for us and all of the lectures were recorded so if i wanted to go back and rewatch something I could. Vidvuds was also very accessible and replied to emails and questions quickly. \r\n\r\nWeakness: In the first half of class there was less student participation aspect in the live lectures but in the second half this was addressed by Vidvuds having us solve problems first before going through the solution",
                "The class was divided into three sections which made it easy to learn the information for each section of the class. Weekly problem sets were not too long and were helpful in mastering the topics. The exams all had a fair difficulty.",
                "This course was excellent. All around splendid job.",
                "lack of consistency between difficulty of example, pset, and exam problems",
                "This course was very good in that it offered a flexible option for those that preferred purely recorded lectures or those that preferred to have more engagement with the non-mandatory synchronous sections.",
                "This course has very difficult material and you must put a lot of effort into it but since the class is small the resources are extremely helpful. Vidvuds cares so much about how his students are doing in the class and devotes extra time to ensuring that everyone is on track. There is an abundance of office hours, review sessions, peer tutor availability, and practice problems to help you understand the material.",
                "This was a very strong course! If I had to suggest one improvement, it would be to have structured lists of notes more often. Occasionally there were lists in the notes (e.g. the four equivalent statements for conservative fields), and it would have been helpful to have more of these (e.g. a list for ways of graphically judging curl and divergence). However, this would lead to more of a \"high school\" feed of information rather than us making sense of it on our own, so I don't know if this would overall improve the course. It is just an idea.",
                "The instructor was very involved in helping his students learn the subjects.",
                "In the second portion of the semester where Vidvuds had us do problems in real time was very helpful. I am not really a fan of the sort of learn before class and ask questions during format, but it was the best use of time.",
                "Office hours were strength.",
                "The main weakness I noticed was that the main professor's office hours were on Monday and Tuesday, and I would have preferred the Tuesday session to be further into the week. There were more office hours available, but not with Professor Vidvuds, whose teaching style I preferred. I enjoyed this course a lot, and Vidvuds was great. Who knows what the office hours will be next time."

Otherwise, it's one of the most useful courses I've taken so far.",

If you are not required to take this class for your major, I wouldn't go out of my way to take it. The weekly p sets are sometimes hard to do (especially if you are taking several STEM classes) and you get a p set even on the weeks with midterms. You are most likely to be in a class full of freshmen (prospective engineering majors).",
                "I would recommend this course to students needing to take this course as a requirement. I have heard it is a little less stressful than Math 120, however, I still learned a great deal and enjoyed it as much as one can enjoy a math course.",
                "Yeah, if you want or need to learn this stuff, because its great stuff.",
                "Yes, I've heard that it's better than Math 120. Vidvuds is great, there are tons of office hours available to you, the grading was kinder to me than I expected, and I feel like I did learn multivariable calculus. Math is not my strong suit but I've grown in confidence in grappling with really complicated concepts that I'm proud to have a handle on now.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are familiar with either Calculus BC (Calc II) or multivariable calculus and who want to expand their knowledge of multivariable calculus and some of its practical applications.",
                "I would recommend it because it opens up the opportunity for other advanced courses.",
                "Yes- easy tests, cool problem sets, lots of help with dropping problem sets etc.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they found MATH 120 difficult.  The instruction was clear, thorough, and given through positive professors.",
                "YES!! TAKE THIS CLASS!! The professors genuinely know what they are talking about, and I don't think you even have to be that \"good\" at math to do well (given that the class is growth-mindset based). As long as you have an interest in math and are willing to put in the work to understand lectures, you will be able to do well while having fun in the process :)",
                "Yes, I think it it a better alternative to MATH120 since there is a smaller class size and you can contact the professor much more easily.",
                "Yes, I was considering this course and Math 120. This course had fewer tests, the class size is smaller as well which meant the course in its entirety also felt more intimate and office hours were very helpful.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because Professor Vidvuds was great and the class was not too difficult or had too much of a workload. The lectures were engaging and it was easy to have any questions about the topics clarified.",
                "Absolutely. This course seems to be much better taught than MATH 120 (from what I hear from my peersof course, I haven't taken it myself). It isn't \"watered down\" for engineers: a full understanding of the material can be achievedthough for those looking for complete proofs of theorems, you would probably have to read the book and spend extra time with the professors. Extra help was always available, however. Overall, this was a fantastic foray into multidimensional calculus from a practical, but uncompromised standpoint.",
                "this course is a great refresher\/challenge for those who have already taken multivariable calculus\/have a strong grasp of calc 1\/2; it is not for those who haven't taken calc in 2 years\/aren't great online learners",
                "Yes. This course is a great course in that it was easy to understand while also providing a challenge for those looking for it.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who needs to take multivariable calculus. If you put in a lot of effort and complete all of the PSETS and pay attention in class, you will be able to do well in the course. It is really difficult material and I struggled a lot with it but the resources available to help you are abundant and it creates a great environment for learning.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in multivariable calculus or need to take it. Professor Ozolins is a fantastic explainer, the grading scheme was clear and not too harsh (I thought it was absolutely perfect), and the class also seemed to attract a nice group of students.",
                "Yes i would, i learned a lot.",
                "Yes, it's interesting material (assuming you like math) and Vidvuds is a great professor. I think it's a good course to take and credit\/d if you like math, but aren't \"good at math.\" The 3d stuff is pretty cool and it's fun to be able to do\/know how to do the integrals.",
                "If it is this or Math 120, this is a good option.",
                "I would recommend this course. It was challenging, but I feel like I learned a lot and my time was maximized."
