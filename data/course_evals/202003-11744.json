I had difficulty understanding the importance of the different things we were learning and their applicability to different math problems. The fact that this class had no consistent homework made it difficult for me to put theory into practice.",
                "I think having psets or at least practice problems here and there would have helped me digest the material better. But I also do think the focus on presentation and teamwork challenged me a lot (I learned LaTeX for this class and I'm forever grateful!!).",
                "The topics were interesting and the project-based format was a unique and fun way to learn them. We were divided into groups for the midterm and final and worked on a few problems together as a group and then presented it to the class. It was definitely more engaging than doing a regular pset. \r\nWeaknesses -- it's sometimes hard to understand Professor Jones' teaching style and honestly, it was very hard to stay engaged with the class throughout the semester and I didn't learn that much.",
                "One weakness of this course is that there was not weekly homework. This can make it hard to really apply the material and learn it well, and you kind of just move along passively with the course until it is your turn to do a weekly homework.",
                "Strengths: group projects are great for solidifying knowledge of certain material \/ problems. I think it's great to avoid exams in the online format because they are not conducive to learning. peter jones is super super kind and caring and open to meeting with students individually. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very poor lectures. Textbook sucked. didn't receive any feedback or grades the whole class.",

                "The strengths of the course consist of a good level of interaction thanks to the virtual whiteboard, interesting presentation sessions where one can learn of applications of certain theorems and work with other members of the class. It was probably the one class I had this semester where I met most of the people in the class and had to collaborate with them on a presentation.",
                "I'm sure this course is taught very differently during a normal, in-person semester, but it just didn't work this time around. The only assignments I was ever given were two group projects (for which I never received feedback or a grade), and the lack of graded weekly p-sets meant most students got by without having to learn analysis (me included, to my shame). But really, what do you expect when students have other hard classes with regular assignments, as well as all the other commitments we typically make -- most of us need grades as a motivator (even just for completion). Now, the projects were pretty interesting, but I do not feel even remotely prepared for Math 305, which I was looking forward to taking next semester. All this said, the professor is really sweet and clearly enjoys teaching. I guess he just didn't think any of this through when planning this class.",
                "Honestly, I was very disappointed by this course. The lack of structure and very confusing notes the written by the professor made it impossible to build a strong foundation of analysis. I plan to take Math 305 next semester, but feel in no way feel that 301 somehow prepared me for it. If you're a math major, or just someone looking to learn higher level math, I'd recommend skipping this course and taking something more engaging. The only \"upside\" was the workload was incredibly low, if you absolutely need this course for whatever reason. But, overall, stay away from this course.",
                "Maybe it was just because it was online, but this class had basically no strengths and plenty of weaknesses. Professor Jones repeated himself often, and the course didnt really feel like it had any kind of progression.",

The use of a virtual whiteboard was useful to visualize most things at times, but it could be useful to standardize virtual teaching methods in the math department and provide training. Sometimes, I would get lost as to where the Professor was pointing at due to the absence of a pointer on the screen. The class itself often times lacked structure and did not follow the textbook. It would then be easy for me to get lost as to where we were going next.",
                "This class had very low engagement, even compared to my other remote classes this semester. The professor essentially just talked about whatever analysis topic he felt like, writing down notes on a tablet as though he were jotting things down for himself to remember later. His stories were sometimes interesting, but the most common emotion I felt during this class was an overwhelming sense of frustration at the lack of substance I was being taught.",

The first half is just a repetition of what you already learned, and the second half becomes a somewhat random assortment of topics without following a particularly obvious train of thought. If you have not taken 230-231 and have never seen the topics of the first half, then the course is probably a good introduction to a lot of those topics.",

The professor is extremely knowledgable and can explain all the details very well. But if you want to learn the material from scratch just from attending lectures and doing no readings from the textbook, I don't really think this is a good course for you.",

The course provides a nice introduction to analysis concepts but it is important to stay on top of previous concepts to understand new ones being taught. The class sometimes lacks structure and does not necessarily follow the textbook so it is important to attend the classes.",
