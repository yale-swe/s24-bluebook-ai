                "Absolutely fantastic class. Great course to dig into some higher level philosophy on the issue of violence. The class doesnt really discuss political violence in a throwing Molotov cocktails at an autocrat sort of way, but rather a broader discussion of violences role in history, and how philosophers consider violence as reasonable or unreasonable. \r\nGreat class. Boris Kapustin is a very engaging lecturer, and it says its a seminar, but (especially when the readings were really dense) its more like 60% seminar, 40% Boris mini-lectures. Very valuable mini-lectures",
                "I learned A TON from this course about how to read philosophical\/political theory and assess it in terms of case studies and historical examples. I found it really interesting to consider super-relevant examples of political violence (Nazism, Ghandi, the French Revolution etc) in terms of the theories underpinning this violence. The course taught me about human nature and human capacity for violence\/terrorism.",
                "The course was amazing! Although political philosophy, by itself, is a very hard subject, the course gave me a lot of insight into philosophical works that I would not be able to understand by myself. The readings were sometimes very dense, but Professor Kapustin's explanations made them very clear. There is not much in the course, except for the weekly readings that you should not leave until the very last day! Overall, I am very satisfied with the course!",

                "Strengths: Professor Kapustin is a great lecturer (and a very kind man) who will make you feel truly enlightened week after week after week. Even if you think you're not interested in the material, there is always something so interesting to say about the reasons people hurt each other, and you really will enjoy his explanations of how different theorists have approached political violence--I found this class super applicable to my other classes, and I'm not a PLSC or EPE major. I looked forward to this class so much because I was confident I would be always interested in the material, even for weeks where I hadn't had the chance to finish every single reading. \r\nWeaknesses: none, loved this class",
                "There are no weaknesses in this course! I enjoyed every bit of it. The biggest strengths of this course are the curriculum of the course and the instructor -Professor Kapustin.",

                "Yes definitely (and I have!) I really think this is such an awesome course that I learned a ton from. I had never really read political theory before and this class made me so interested in reading more, and more broadly in the themes of the course. The material is all accessible (but it's all challenging -- readings are super dense!) and really engaging. If you're at all interested in conflict resolution, systems of government, and the history of conflict (ie revolutions, civil wars, genocides etc) then you will find something super interesting in here.",
