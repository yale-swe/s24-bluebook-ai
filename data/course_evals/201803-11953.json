    "I learned to speak a lot of Spanish. I learned how to be able to get the gist of what a Spanish speaker is saying and the gist of Spanish writing. I have become far more fluent in Spanish and am able to hold basic conversation beyond just yes and no responses.",
    "I learned how to speak as well as listen to and read Spanish very well.",
    "I learnt basic Spanish grammar, a lot of vocabulary and I was exposed to Spanish and South American culture through movies, music and books. I developed skills in Spanish pronunciation, composition and comprehension.",
    "I feel like I developed a strong foundation in introductory Spanish, and feel well prepared to enter L2. I developed the skill of speaking, reading, writing, and listening to Spanish at an introductory level, and I am surprised at how much Spanish I was able to learn in only one semester.",
    "I learned much about spanish!",
    "I learned a wide variety of Spanish vocabulary and grammar. I began the course knowing a few common words and phrases, but am now able to converse in the language,",
    "I learned the basics of Spanish grammar, and the vocabulary necessary to help me navigate various common scenarios.",
    "Basic conversational Spanish.",
    "In this class, you learn the basics of spanish grammar and speaking."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Well-paced, good progression of difficulty, useful materials\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The online (VHL) homework didn't feel extremely useful",
    "A strength is that the course is very well taught and engaging, inspiring full participation and engagement in the students that take it. It is also well planned and tested, graded fairly and imparts a huge amount in a short amount of time. \r\n\r\nIt could be improved by having more independent reading throughout the course. I also think that the Aventuras online homework is unnecessary and does not contribute significantly to the learning process, but takes a lot of time.",
    "The strength of the course was definitely its practicality, relatively low workload (compared to other L1 languages), and positive learning environment. As far as L1 languages go, I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "This course moves very fast, but the professor's accessibility and the way in which all of the elements truly depend on one another make it easy to learn. However, I will say a downside is the 4-minute oral exam. I think this course would be improved by either shortening the time or adding a midterm 2-minute oral exam so that students feel more prepared to speak for a sustained period of time.",
    "The course moves very quickly to being taught completely in Spanish. This is a strength in that it forces students to learn quickly. However, despite this being an introductory course, many students taking it have already taken Spanish in the past. This made this type of language immersion much easier for them to manage than students who have no experience with Spanish. This also made it so that the professor had a false sense of how much students were picking up from her course, and how much was knowledge students had prior to the course.",
    "The class was very good, one thing I think students could benefit from would be to have more casual conversations in Spanish.",
    "Very good with Spanish immersion. You learn a lot from not speaking English in a class period every day. \r\n\r\nWould prefer better placement of students who had taken Spanish before and those who had not. For L1, expectation should be that the student had never taken Spanish.",
    "The professor was very engaged and material was taught in a way that covered many topics. While it is difficult to learn all of the material if you have no prior Spanish experience, the course is very well taught. However, technical topics (such as grammar) were not always covered well and were sometimes left unexplained.",
    "The strength of this course is that the engagement in class is basically mandatory which facilitates learning the language much better. I feel the course could be improved at the end of the semester since the final 2 chapters or so seemed to be breezed over, and then you aren't ready for the final exam."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is an excellent course for learning Spanish.",
    "I would recommend this course because Spanish is a great resource to have and it's a great class in general.",
    "Yes. Fascinating language, very enjoyable and challenging learning process, and the student gets a lot out of it for the time he or she dedicates to it.",
    "Yes, I would. Relative to other languages at Yale, L1 Spanish is both manageable and practical. As someone not interested in pursuing language as a major I would absolutely choose to take this course again.",
    "Absolutely it was incredible",
    "I would recommend this course with the caveat that it will be very difficult to catch up to the level at which some students start the course.",
    "Of course! I enjoyed it and learned a lot",
    "Yes. Spanish is a relatively easy language to learn, and it has a really high payoff.",
    "Yes; it has homework everyday, but it is a good class",
    "Yes, the format makes the course difficult but fun and engaging, and ultimately conducive to learning large amounts of Spanish in a short amount of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you've never taken spanish before and are interested in learning a new language."
