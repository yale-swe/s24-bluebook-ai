                "One of the biggest strengths of the course is the consistent workshopping and demanding nature of the course. In the Advanced class, Marc really pushes you to have your script done ahead of time against a deadline. While this can be stressful at times, it also ensures that you have or nearly have a completed first draft of your thesis by the end of the Fall semester. The entire class is discussion based, with generally one student's script being the subject for an entire class period. Students are expected to read their peer's script before coming to class and prepare several pages of careful critique an analysis that their peer can use for rewriting. \r\n\r\nAnother big strength of this class is that Marc brings in a guest critic for every student that workshops. These guests are either alumni or other connections Marc has that have experienced success in the film industry, so their personalized feedback during workshops is really insightful. Outside of class, Marc will also schedule individual consultations where he will go through your script with page by page edits. Your script will definitely get the time and attention it deserves in this class.\r\n\r\nI think the biggest weakness of this course is probably the lack of set structure and lack of supplementary assignments, especially at the beginning of the class. This class is treated like a continuation of the previous two screenwriting courses, so Marc expected us from week 1 to already have our idea in development and have pages written. The pressure was on to develop a single idea extremely quickly, and there weren't many smaller assignments in the beginning of the semester that established a solid starting point. I think having a mini pitch assignment on week one would be helpful, where students could write the loglines for 5 ideas they have, and we could discuss these and help each other narrow down the idea. In other screenwriting classes, we have done supplementary assignments outside of just writing the script that helped us understand our characters, flesh out a story world, and give our stories better structure. I think this would have been very helpful for students, especially because the intermediate class only requires a 30ish page script, so a feature length script is a HUGE jump."

                "If you are a film major looking to screen write, I absolutely recommend this class. If you are looking to try screenwriting as a fun college experiment, I would direct you to other screenwriting classes like Screenwriter's Craft or Writing the Television Drama. Brian Price has offered a good one in the past two semesters as well. I think the structure of those courses are more beginner friendly because they work from the ground up and place a heavy emphasis on structure. Students that are not wanting to write a screenplay for their thesis or pursue screenwriting after graduation should not take this class."
