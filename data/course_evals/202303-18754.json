The assignments weren't always the most useful thing I could be doing for my thesis at that time, but the fact that they existed made sure that I did them when I might otherwise have kept putting things off.",
                "Strenghts: I made great progress on my thesis and received consistently helpful feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You have to check Canvas regularly for updates on readings, presentations, peer reviews, etc. Updates are not regular.",
                "I think much of this course would be more beneficial in the latter half of the thesis writing process. I felt like I was frequently under pressure to write pages and turn in assignments when I would have appreciated more time to take stock of the research in the field and work with that. For example, in the first month or two of the course, we were expected to turn in an annotated bibliography -- this felt like a waste of time, and by the end of the semester I had moved past the sources I used in the bib. The course could be improved by being more understanding of different research processes, or maybe having a bi-weekly course all year instead of a weekly course in one semester."

Professor Hierro is incredibly warm and supporting through the process and cares a lot about your individual growth and success as a student with your essay. She is very engaging and also does a lot of work to help find sources for her students which is always appreciated.",

                "If you have a solid relationship with your thesis advisor and regularly meet with them, I would not recommend this course (some of the students in the course were technically enrolled but did not attend). This course felt extraneous and created unneccessary work that I will not end up using in my final thesis, and my meetings with my thesis advisor were much more productive. If you need frequent deadlines and do not have a hands-on thesis advisor, this might be the course for you."
