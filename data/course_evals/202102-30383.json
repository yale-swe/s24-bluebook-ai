                "The ability to understand large data sets and understand hypothesis test",
                "Wow, I learned a lot about biostatistics. I also learned about the kind of teacher that I would like to be one day. Thank you!",
                "Fuller understanding of what biostatistics truly means - concept of probability, hypothesis testing, etc. Also learned how to code in R.",
                "Very good foundational knowledge in Biostatistics and facility with coding in R, having had absolutely no prior coding experience. I've come away from the course with greater confidence in my ability to critically evaluate data and to design ways to use and compile data to arrive at evidence-based decision making.",
                "I gained tremendous knowledge in biostatistics and value skills using R computer programming.",
                "Coding in R\r\nIntroductory skills related to biostatistics",
                "The level of knowledge learned and insights in this course is extraordinary.  However, I believe that the sheer volume of material and the emphasis on programming in R and the pace of the course, made true understanding of the concepts for those without a background in statistics difficult.  I am afraid that after the residue of the exams passes, there will be very little retained information here-I think less material and more depth would have been much more effective and less overwhelming for students.",
                "I learned  how to use R  in Applied Biostats. I also learned a great deal of concepts and how to formulate an hypothesis, test the hypothesis using various statistical  tools .",
                "I learned R on a deeper level and was very impressed with how we can apply R in a public health setting. I enjoyed working with the data sets and interpreting them accordingly.",
                "-For someone with no background in statistics, I feel like cramming R into 7 to 8 weeks was very difficult.\r\n-Found that I developed some comfort using R's basic functions, but not sure I can fully independently use the complex functions on my own just yet.\r\n-The primer that we took precourse was definitely helpful.  I would say expanding on the primer would be helpful before we actually took our statistical course\r\n-truly feel that Yale faculty were extremely supportive and encouraging.  I feel like I probably would have dropped out if I did not have such great encouragement from Mike in the TF's\r\n-Felt that the labs took longer to the to do then expected\r\n-Statistical analysis is much more complex than I imagined",
                "I learned a lot about biostatistics and how this relates to work outside of the classroom.  It also will help in interpretation of others' studies.",
                "From this course, I gained substantial knowledge in  biostatistics concepts and acquired new skills in the use of R.    I also gained new insights from this course specifically knowing the data you are to work with and not just trusting the data given to me or my staff when related work comes to me in my future work for public health.",
                "I learned basics regarding how to use R and statistical methods.",
                "Knowledge and reinforcement of statistical best practices, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression.   I also learned fundamentals of R, which is a completely new programming language for me.  I was a little worried that an online only curriculae wouldn't be engaging enough, but Michael Wininger brought such enthusiasm and energy to the course, but it translated really well onto the computer screen.   Kim Gannon and Sreeja Kondeti, the discussion leaders (DL) for the course were really adept at explaining complicated statistical concepts, and R programming difficulties.   Kim was the DL for my group, and she really helped me to figure out the concepts needed to complete the laboratory assignments.  She gave wonderful explanations and seemed to understand where most of us were getting stuck on a problem.",

                "Foundational biostatistics and R skills",
                "1. Refreshed my statistics and quantitative skills through the lens of biostatistics and epidemiology. \r\n2.",
                "I developed my r programming skills and learned the basics of selecting key data elements and performing simple manipulations. Furthermore, I learned about parametric and non-parametric tests depending on the distribution of the data (normal vs. skewed). Hypothesis testing was also covered fairly extensively for a beginning course along with linear and logistic regression. Mike continually encouraged us to \"know your data\"; its so important in the real world as often erroneous conclusions are drawn from datasets. Mike said a few times that he wants us all to be able to import a data set and \"do something interesting with it\". I can indeed do this now (with perhaps a little aide from his notes).",
                "Some skills in using R.\r\nBasic understanding of statistical analysis of data.",
                "I learned about a number of hypothesis tests and basic statistical concepts. I improved my R coding skills, and learned to identify weaknesses in published literature.",
                "What didn't I learn in this course - WOW - so much in 7 short weeks. I am now amateurly proficient in R and know how to analyze my data to make the most out of the analysis.",
                "How to use R to perform statistical calculations. Understand the fundamentals of biostats.",
                "I began this course as a novice in statistics and left with an understanding of how to code in R as well as a better understanding of statistical concepts. I know have an understanding of how to write and execute code as well as compute important statistical values that I will utilize in my public health career."

In addition, showing up to Prof. Wininger's office hours, as well as those of our teaching fellow, was a great opportunity to get additional help and insights.",

I realize a copy of issues can also prevent this",

                "First, I had to open my mind for a challenging course and had to find substantial and quality time to learn from the front-loaded designed modules in addition to heavy challenges in my current job.  I also did not hesitate to reach out to the teaching fellows and my professor when I needed to clarify or follow up including but not limited to the use of the Canvas discussion board, emails, synchronous class times among others.  I also reached out to my cohort mates and joined in study groups as long as my work and family schedules allowed.  I have to mention that Kim Gannon as a teaching fellow was helpful and patient at least to me during our lab assignment sessions that she was tasked to handle in this course.",

                "1. Collaboration with cohort classmates through study groups\r\n2. Establishing set times for personal study as part of my routine\r\n3. Review topics covered before going through the course content\/lectures. This served as a primer, so I was not seeing the introduced material for the first time\r\n4. Creation of personal study sheets by topic and subtopic",
                "1) I watched the videos and followed along in r; 2) I printed the video transcripts for off line learning; 3) I spent some time just practicing\/playing around in r so the fundamentals, e.g., setting working directory, reading in a file, and performing simple tasks such as mean and mode were not challenging. 4) I attended Mike's Monday sessions via Zoom as he often introduced new concepts at those meetings.",

                "I found the work load incredibly difficult to balance throughout this course. The volume of information that we were expected to learn in 7 weeks was too much for being working professionals and too much information for such a short time period. I was a part of a study group to help us try to reinforce the large amount of information being taught each week and devoted far more than the 8-10 hours allotted for the course each week. I found the TF sessions and peer review sessions to be the most helpful to my learning."
