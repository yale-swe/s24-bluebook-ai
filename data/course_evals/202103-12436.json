                "Strengths: Professor Reiche is amazing! She presented the topics in an organized and clear way, which made understanding the course concepts much easier. The smaller class size also allowed students to easily ask questions during lecture. In addition, problem sets were structured well to develop a better understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We spent a lot of time reviewing basic probability concepts and setting up choice under risk and uncertainty. Focusing less on these topics in class and spending more time on applications or extensions of the models in the latter half of the course would have improved the course.",
                "Good course structure and lecture\r\n\r\nProblem sets often required outside work",
                "The professor and TA are extremely supportive. Lecture can be fast paced at times, but theres a lot of time in between psets to clarify doubts.",
                "No weaknesses. The course starts with a review of probability and this gives a good introduction to the math that will be used in the course. From there the course builds on itself and allows students the opportunity to understand complex concepts.",
                "The class was really well taught Professor Reiche was great! I thought at some points the class was a bit too methodical, and I would have enjoyed more of an intellectual challenge.",
                "The course is quite based in the existing literature. It would have been great every now and then to zoom out to think about whether the theory matches the reality. Additionally, the professor would go fast enough so that she said we didn't need to take notes because the slides would be online, but as the material built on itself, and assumptions made in past slides, it was often really convenient to have those slides out, or to have taken the notes to e able to follow along meaningfully.  I think this should be suggested to future students, especially if the professor insists on maintaining a certain speed (presumably to get through more material, which is great that she wants to teach us more), to have the online slides out, or to have downloaded them before the students come to the class (classroom in the basement of Watson did not always have the best WiFi). (The slides can also be used to go a little ahead, as well as review something that was not quite heard properly, among other possible use-cases.)\r\n\r\nI also wonder if periodic low-stakes quizzes (NOT \"pop\") could help enforce learning of the material."
