Now that I have them I am very happy I wrote them, and they were very useful for the final paper. I appreciated Professor Greene's comments on them; instead of just giving a grade, he would go through them and note where I had the right idea and where I may have misunderstood something. I learned from that too. I must say that the reading was very long and very dense for the class. I will also note that for students who prefer to use dictation for whatever reason, almost none of the PDFs are dictation compatible, which for me meant many additional hours of reading by hand."

The weekly reading responses can take some time, but they do contribute to understanding. This course would be even more fun in person!",
                "I would recommend. It is required for RLST students, so tough for you. The benefit is that you get to meet all the other RLST students in your year, which is cool. But for everyone else, I would recommend reviewing the syllabus and seeing if the topics interest you! My class did have a student who was not RLST, and it is absolutely worthwhile for students who have an interest in the subject and just want to take the course as an elective. I thought this year's topicritualwas a really great one. Professor Greene really gives a lot of free reign to apply the material to subjects of interest in class and in our reading responses and papers (for me this meant military customs and rituals), and these do not have to be overtly religious or associated with a religion (again, I was focused on the military)."
