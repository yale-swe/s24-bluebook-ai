Another strength is simply the act of writing itself. The way the course is structured necessitates that we write multiple essays spread across various types of writing. This breadth and subsequent feedback helped me develop an increased fluency in different types of writing. In line with feedback, the feedback mechanism for the course was also instrumental to the strength of the course. Through \"workshops,\" we were able to peer edit work, and those being edited were able to ask and have their questions answered. The diversity of opinion again contributed to the quality of writing."
