This could definitely be a problem for some, though the class seemed pretty self-selecting to students who are okay with that. Most students were humanities-esque majors, like sociology, anthropology, or English I think. Very much an opt-in course. You can choose to do the readings and participate, or not. So I guess it was run just fine for the kind of student it attracts."

                "This was a strange class. I kind of fell into taking it. It didn't fulfill any requirements for me, but I had heard good things about Paul North and the description of the course was intriguing. This was the first time he has ever taught this course and he came up with the idea for it himself. The readings he assigns are all books that he read at some point in his life or studies, and enjoyed, and so had us read. This is not a bad thing. But anyone who needs structure in a class should stay away from this class and probably away from Professor North. This is kind of like a DS or Humanities seminar. It's a group of smart students--almost all non-stem students--sitting around a table once a week for two and half hours discussing books and ideas about life. Some of the students were a little pretentious, but I think overall everyone was kind of confused about what the class was actually about. It seemed like most people were there because they either knew or had heard about Professor North and lots of the students were friends before taking this class together. The readings were quite random, but good. We read Marx, Engels, Weber, Ernst Bloch, Paul Scheerbart, Foucault, Agamben, Toni Morrison...so, all over the place. The class was essentially based on a word that Professor North made up himself: \"conviviance.\" We read these books and tried to find examples of people living together well. \"Non-cynical social thought\" is already vague as a title for the course. Most students in the class were cynical about the world around them and about people, I think. Not a bad thing. The \"social thought\" part of the title is kind of broad, basically encompassing most of the readings we did. They could almost all be described as \"social thought\" in some way or another. I think Professor North and the TA are both communists or Marxists, so there was a bent towards Marxist authors and books. The class was enjoyable. It was pretty low stress and was certainly thought-provoking, but I left with no hard skills. I think I became a better reader and analyzer, which is good. The class was very \"fluffy,\" meaning there was lots of pontificating and intellectual discourse, which can be fun. It was definitley \"up in the clouds.\" But a quantitatively-oriented student would look at this class and immediately run."
