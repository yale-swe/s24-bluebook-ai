                "Strengths: Professor Wooster. He is the man and loves to help his students succeed. Weaknesses: Sometimes it is hard to glean the information introduced in class so well. However, professor Wooster is so enthusiastic about the stuff he teaches that it kinda makes up for it. Overall he still is a pretty good teacher.",
                "It is a good course because the concepts are interesting but it could be better organized and slightly better taught. Lecture got confusing many times because following along was tough.",
                "Weaknesses - more office hours open (especially closer to pset due dates), and review sessions could go a long way in facilitating learning",
                "Strengths: Great and engaging professor. Lots of fun examples, while also teaching quite a bit of probability.\r\nWeaknesses: class accelerated a bit toward the end, making the last few lectures hard to follow. Would have been better if we kept the same learning pace throughout",
                "Strengths: the course was well-designed and lectures were very engaging considering how abstract the concepts were. Prof. Wooster is fun and approachable, and every concept we learned was immediately backed up with examples. \r\nWeaknesses: some of the problem sets contained problems that were literally not solvable without advanced math skills or going to office hours. This wasn't a very effective way to get the class material across. The course also seemed to lose its focus towards the end of the semester, once we started learning about exponential distributions.",
                "The course definitely had very challenging homework, but the professor and the TF had lots of office hours that I went to multiple times a week which helped a lot! I feel like I challenged myself and I learned a lot out of it.",
                "Strengths: Bob Wooster, psets were a good balance of doable and challenging, as were the exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, a good professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class sometimes felt not the most engaging, although I think Prof. Wooster tried to incorporate in-class activities.",
                "The professor is incredible and super kind! Student learning was always his priority.",
                "This course covers a huge amount of content, and I do not think there were enough office hours held throughout the semester. I think that this course needs more TFs and ULAs and more out of class support. However, I enjoyed Prof. Wooster's teaching style and lectures were engaging for the most part.",
                "The strength of this class is that there is a good balance between definitions and explanations, and then actual examples or practical applications of the concepts. The exams are also very fair in covering content that students are comfortable and familiar with. However, the weakness is that the homework is very difficult, and that class content can sometimes be fast-paced and mentally taxing. However, office hours with the professor and TA's and ULA's usually help a lot to combat these difficulties.",
                "Its hard for someone without experience in a lot of types of math\/stat classes.",
                "There were a lot of strengths in the course, mainly the structure of the course and the delivery of the content - Prof. Wooster is an excellent instructor. Sometimes, I felt as though the homework problems were much more advanced than what we did in class, and perhaps we weren't fully prepared to access the more challenging ones.",
                "It is taught very well and the problem sets really help you learn the concepts. Focusing more on review during the end of the semester might make it better.",
                "More office hours at night to accommodate athletes",
                "I think this course could be improved if before the final there were review sessions to help students re-familiarize themselves with the content.",

                "Absolutely. Prof Wooster is great and it's awesome for the S&DS certificate. It doesn't nearly go into as much depth as 241, but for people who haven't taken multi yet, it really is a good intro to how probability theory works. Maybe don't take it just for a distributional requirement, but if you have a desire to learn about probability, this course is great. It does start out a lot easier than it ends, but I guess that's any theory class.",
                "I took this for the certificate. It is a good course. It is interesting content and the course is not super difficult. I had a tough time but as long as you go to office hours and work with friends on the pset and study very hard for the midterm and final, it should be alright.",

                "Yes, if you are taking for the Certificate in Data Science or want to learn probability theory. It still requires a solid math background though so Id keep that in mind, you definitely need calculus for it",
                "I was one of the few students in the class who wasn't pursuing the S&DS certificate. I recommend the class to anyone who has not had previous training in probability and wants to learn more. Note that you do need some math skills, so make sure you know how to deal with basic sums, derivatives, and integrals.",
                "Yes, chances are if you're taking it you're doing the certificate, I loved this class and Bob is great",
                "Yes if you can go to office hours for psets and you're willing to work very hard to understand the concepts!",
                "If you're interested in probability and\/or trying to complete the data science certificate, absolutely. It's a great balance of educational while not being too stressful and lectures were usually engaging. The professor is charismatic and sweet and made the class so much more enjoyable than it may have been otherwise.",
                "Yes, if they have any interest in probability or the data science certificate I think it is a great option. However, if they are considering the S&DS major, they need to take S&DS 241 instead.",
                "I totally recommend this course to someone who has never taken a probability course before. The professor is incredible and you will learn a lot.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student completing the stats certificate, or if you are really interested in the topic.",
                "I would recommend this to any student with no background in probability who wants an elementary understanding of the subject.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely - and certainly if Prof. Wooster is teaching again! Having a strong grasp of probability is of paramount importance in scientific fields across the board.",
                "Yes. I thought I really disliked probability but this class kind of made me like it.",
                "Yes, if they are perusing a stats certificate",
                "If you are interested in the certificate then I would recommend this course over the other probability courses.",
