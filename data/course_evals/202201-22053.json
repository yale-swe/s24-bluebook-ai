                "An sense of Tokyo and of urban development as a broader theme in history.",
                "I learned how to evaluate my own perspective on other cultures.",
                "This course introduced me to a much more intimate view of history, focusing on the conditions and experiences of Tokyos citizens in addition to the big picture. It also taught me how to skim sources for content, as this is a necessity to even try to do the readings.",
                "I learned a ton about different areas of Tokyos history, culture, design, etc. The course was both very extensive in the amount of material it covered, but also went into topics in depth.",
                "History of Tokyo, from the start of the Edo period to modern day. Edo as the Shogun's seat of power in Edo-period Japan, the Meiji Restoration, and the postwar period in Tokyo.",
                "Knowledge: Unsurprisingly, so much more about Tokyo's history and culture. However, what I especially enjoyed was looking at the aspects of Edo/Tokyo that I had no idea existed - the relationship between Yoshiwara and Ukiyo-e artworks, the importance of US Air Bases in protests and the complicated relationship between Japan and Korea (in addition to what I'd previously read about Sino-Japanese relations), and in the modern-day aspects about Sanya in contrast to Yanesen. I also loved reading about a wide range of related topics, from architecture to fashion to art. Those are academic topics I otherwise would likely never engage with at Yale, and although we didn't spend much time on each due to time constraints, I still very much appreciated learning at least at an introductory level about the connections between these aspects and the wider history of Edo/Tokyo.\r\n\r\nIn terms of skills, I hope I improved a lot in learning how to approach a broad range of different readings, considering their strengths and shortcomings in forming an opinion on the quality of writing and to what extent the sources' ideas should be taken into consideration when discussing wider themes in class. For example, in any topic, I learnt to combine what was stated in a primary source, a foreign material and even visual sources to argue something, and that was a great experience that I'm sure will help in future reading classes.",
                "I learned a lot about Tokyo history and Japanese history, as well as current social issues and challenges in Japan. My ability to read and evaluate academic documents also improved a great deal."

                "This course was fantastic. Even though this year was the courses first, it was taught excellently in every way. I would have perhaps appreciated some lessons/advice in the way or research, particularly given the language barrier.",
                "There were some readings assigned that were never discussed or were less relevant to the theme of that classs discussion. Being able to bring in two of the authors we read was one of the highlights of the course",
                "The course was certainly designed well for anyone who did all of the readings; unfortunately, there was too much reading assigned per week which was difficult to keep up with for most students.",
                "Strengths: discussions are engaging, assigned readings are from many different kinds of texts, workload is reasonable, and the professors are really considerate and accommodating of extenuating circumstances. \r\nWeaknesses: Class discussions sometimes went over time, or we didn't get to discuss all of the readings.",
                "Strengths are definitely the instructors and how they lead each seminar. I thoroughly enjoyed my time (even if not having done the readings) each class and felt fully able to share my thoughts with others and learn from the wonderful ideas of my classmates and the professors. We explored a broad range of topics for Tokyo, which I felt especially during the final project gave a wonderful contrast of ideas and perspectives on the city that I considered together when writing and that gave so much depth to the city, I wanted to learn much more about. Lastly, I really appreciated the fact that the readings were chosen so well to introduce us to themes before the lecture, especially with the primary sources!\r\n\r\nOne thing I personally feel could've made my experience even better. Perhaps having more writing tasks and sacrificing some of the readings on order to make that possible. While I really enjoyed the readings, I definitely did not do them all, my fault completely but I think a lot of that was slowly trying to adapting to the amount of readings in college classes and not doing so successfully. As this was also a writing course, I believe that if we had more writings and fewer readings, I would not only find out more about how to improve my style and clarity of writing, but also have a mix of tasks to split focus on and complete both to a higher standard.",
                "A major strength of the course was the knowledge and expertise of the instructors, as well as their love for the subject. Additionally, the instructors did a great job bringing other academics and authors to our classroom. One weakness might be the writing aspect of the course, since it did not seem like we focused a lot on writing skills in the course."

This course can be interesting for everyone, and was a good introduction to history classes at Yale for me.",
                "Yes, if someones interested in Tokyo, theres no better course.",
                "Yes. This course was a perfect first year seminar. While I have a deep interest in urban studies and history, this course was conscious that many students may not have the same familiarity with these topics.",
                "If you have any interest in early modern or modern Japan, I would recommend this course. While I would have preferred some more emphasis on modern Tokyo, the topics explored are fascinating.",
                "If youre willing to do the reading, I would definitely recommend the course. When else are you gonna get to do a deep dive into a whole foreign city and its history?",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course, I am not a humanities major, but Profs. Botsman and Thornton were really helpful to me in learning how college writing works. The workload is very reasonable, and I found the final project pretty fun.",
                "100%. I know a large reason I took the course was because I was already interested in Tokyo's History and Culture prior to Yale and had planned to apply for the seminar since last semester, but after learning everything I feel that any student looking to explore history and writing in general will gain so much from the course. Definitely there are times where one feels out of depth because of the nature of the content, but each lesson was engaging and really relaxed in a good way.",
                "Yes. This course has been a fantastic introduction to Japanese history, and the instructors passed on their passion for the subject."
