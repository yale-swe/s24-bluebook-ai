The topics we learned were all relevant to current-day Chinese social trends and attitudes, and I often found myself being able to talk about topics such as Chinese musicians, artists, political movements, and more at the weekly Chinese table."

We were also able to have talks with experts in certain topics; for instance, we had a Zoom with Peking opera actors, and we had an in-person talk with Professor Zhengguo Kang on political dissent. I think the workload is a little on the heavy sidewe are asked to create a digital book of all of our writings from the semester, and mine ended up being around 50 pages. While the Chinese content with which we engage is diverse and plentiful, it also means we have to write often and write extensively on the content."

The course units are all very relevant and are things native Chinese people would be interested in or talk about in their free time."
