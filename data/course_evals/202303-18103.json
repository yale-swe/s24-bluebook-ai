                "I did not learn very much because the class was taught as a lecture not a seminar, but the lectures gave context rather than offer any analysis.",
                "After not taking Spanish since my first year at Yale, this course was a fantastic, supportive environment to revisit and deepen my knowledge of the language. I learned so much not only about Jorge Luis Borges and his writing this semester, but also about the history and literary traditions that inspired his stories. Professor Gonzlez-Prez is a fantastic instructor, and I thoroughly enjoyed attending this seminar throughout the semester.",
                "I learned a lot about the culture of fiction in Spanish",
                "I learned about Borges and his writings by looking at a variety of short stories across several of his publications. We studied the historical context of these works and focused in on the meaning of certain allusions in his writings. I also improved my Spanish vocabulary and writing through the papers and readings for this class.",
                "I learned a large amount about Borges and his life story, as well as more information about the 20th-century intellectual environment that he came from and the work of philosophers and thinkers that he often drew upon and referred to in his stories. We analyzed many of Borges's most important and well-known works, focusing on short stories but also reading essays and poetry and identifying key themes and questions in his writing."

                "I liked the readings that Professor Gonzlez-Prez had instructed us to read in the course. I also like how the class was set up to read and discuss the story. One improvement would be that for the quizzes we take, Professor Gonzlez-Prezcan clarify which quotes are the ones we should pay attention to the most for the quiz.",
                "I think that there was a group of interested and interesting, engaged students in the class, but unfortunately that energy wasn't really put towards anything. Anibal is a wonderful lecturer, but there were essentially no opportunities to talk or to interpret as a group, which seemed like a missed opportunity. I really enjoyed the content though",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Loved the stories chosen \r\n- Prof. Gonzlez-Prez is fantastic. I loved his insights about Borgeshe obviously is very intelligent and knowledgeable on the subject material\r\n- I enjoyed the creativity allowed in the essays we wrote!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- For the quizzes, I memorized up to 300 terms sometimes and only 10-12 were on the quiz. It would be helpful to be given a list even of 100 terms from which 10 will be taken, or more of an idea of what to study. I spent many hours studying for the quizzes and I don't think my grades on the quizzes reflected that.",
                "I did learn a lot and improve my Spanish writing the very long and challenging term paper. Unfortunately, that was the most I got out of the class. \r\n\r\nThis course was taught mostly as a lecture, and the lectures mostly covered historical context rather than analyzing the stories. There was very little discussion or analysis. I did not get to practice and improve my spoken Spanish or close reading and analytical skills. Moreover Borges is one of the most interesting writers of the last few centuries, and his works reward extensive conversation and exploration of precedent texts, but we spent most of the time discussing the politics of the different decades when Borges wrote each story. The class covered many of the 'greatest hits' of his obra, but it did not dive into any of the interesting obscure work of his, including his essays, film reviews, lectures, and more than two of his poems. Even if we had read the same stories we did and had spent all of our time analyzing these stories as a class (or even listening to a thorough analytical lecture), that would have been great, but unfortunately I learned very little about Borges, literature, or Spanish. \r\n\r\nThis class could have opened the minds of all of the students, changed how they understood the world. And the students read every story and came to class prepared to engage, with questions, ideas to discuss. Usually students just coast through such easy classes, and I have never before felt the class actually wanting more but being unable to engage because of the lecture format (in a seminar class).",
                "The strengths of this course were the material and Professor Gonzlez-Prez engaging teaching style. I learned so much about Borges and Latin American literature this term, and Professor Gonzlez-Prez kept our class excited about Borges' stories through his own enthusiasm over the material. While I do not think that this course had any obvious weaknesses, my only critique would be that I wish we had a few more opportunities to engage in critical discussion amongst ourselves rather than merely having call and response questions during the lectures.",
                "It was organized very well and I learned a lot!",
                "The strengths of this class are the readings. The stories are interesting and it feels like an accomplishment to know so much about one author. The professor is knowledgeable about the subject. The weaknesses are that the lectures don't have often have slides or a notes equivalent. This makes it really difficult to pay attention as I found myself stopping to look up a word and then losing track of the lecture. I wish there were more discussion in the class. It is a small class, but really more like a lecture. Because it is entirely taught in Spanish and I have weaker listening comprehension in Spanish, I found it really difficult to absorb all the information I needed for this class. More detailed notes or slides and discussion should help. The TA did make very detailed and helpful study guides that definitely saved my grade in this course. It seemed like the students who had studied Comparative Literature or knew some about Borges and Philosophy already were ahead. Some of that was never explained and I had never studied a lot of the works Borges was influenced by so I felt at a disadvantage. The quizzes in this class are memorization based and don't check your understanding of the story on an interpretive level. There is a midterm and final that allows for deeper analysis, but memorizing niche characters, places, and even quotes for a quiz seemed pointless as they didn't change my understanding of the work at all.",
                "This course is nearly all strengths, I thoroughly enjoyed it! A key strength is the writing that we got to read through this class. Borges is truly a literary genius and this class was an incredible opportunity for me to discover a wide range of his works. Completely understanding this writing requires careful analysis, so I'm thankful that the class allowed for this. The professor is also fantastic: kind, knowledgeable, and an engaging lecturer. I always enjoyed interacting with him, whether inside or outside of classes. The in-class quizzes and midterm were manageable. The final paper was a significant time investment but well worth it to truly analyze a Borges story in-depth; however, I wish that the expectations for the writing were clearer, as this was the only paper assignment of the semester."

                "I would recommend this course to another student but only if they feel that their Spanish skills are enough to both understand and initiate conversations, but also read and understand the stories.  This course was intriguing as we were able to read and understand more about Jorge Luis Borges as a writer but as a human being during harsh moments in history.",
                "Yes, certainly, as an easy and enjoyable class. Reading Borges is a must for any student of literature!",
                "Yes! It was really interesting. You don't speak a ton of Spanish, it is mostly listening to the lectures and reading\/writing. But the stories are really cool and I loved reading them and learning about literature, especially as a STEM student who doesn't get to do that often.",
                "Borges is one of the greatest authors of the last century. He can change the way you see and understand words and the world. As the class was taught when I took it, you will learn more in less time by reading the syllabus on your own.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Gonzlez-Prez is a fantastic professor, and Borges is a fascinating and unique writer that I had so much fun reading throughout the semester. While the class' four quizzes can be a bit difficult, this is hands-down the best Spanish course I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes! It was very interesting and you learn a lot",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course if you already have a background in Comp Lit, need this for the Spanish certificate, or absolutely love Borges. This class is a lot of work, but if you put time in to read the stories fully and make sure you understand it entirely you will do well. The grading is very fair and once you take the first quiz you will know how to complete the others. They are memorization based, which is frustrating as you can't demonstrate your learning by analysis or interpretation of the story at all. The stories are interesting, but very hard to read in English and Spanish. Your Spanish reading and writing skills will have to be at an almost fluent level, but they will certainly improve throughout the class. To me, this was sort of a \"just push yourself to get through it\" kind of class.",
                "This class was not really seminar-style, so it was more the professor just lecturing about the texts to the students. It worked fine, but if you are looking for a very interactive class, this one isn't it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to those at all interested in literature, particularly Latin American literature! Borges's work is absolutely brilliant, and it's an unparalleled opportunity to be able to dedicate an entire semester to reading it. in addition, conducting the analysis and background learning done in this class truly helps to understand his writing in new, profound ways. The class is engaging and the workload is light, with the exception of the final paper. However, I would recommend this class to students who are confident in their Spanish skills or are ready to be challenged with this writing. Borges's writing can be difficult to understand even in English, and I often had to turn to a dictionary and\/or translation while reading; thanks to this class, I've greatly improved my reading abilities in Spanish and expanded my vocabulary to include some of Borges's favorite obscure words!"
