                "I learned so much in this class. I started out having very little professional drawing experience, but by the end of the semester, I was very impressed with how far I had come and how far everyone else had come too. I learned all the basic techniques of drawing and that there is no correct way to draw; an artist is an artist regardless of style or methodology. I learned a lot about myself in this class and spent a lot of time self reflecting in my art.",
                "Drawing! This class mostly focuses on observational drawing, but it was not closed off to abstraction. I found that I trusted my hands much much more at the end of the class.",
                "I developed better understanding of how to use a range of materials, including graphite, charcoal, conte crayon, and ink. With these materials, I gained valuable knowledge on how to articulate form, volume, and space for a given drawing. I learned techniques in mark-making, additive\/subtractive drawing, figure drawing, and a whole lot more. This felt like a fantastic and broad introduction into drawing.",
                "Art is very free and subjective. We learn by doing and do not be afraid to just start.",
                "I had no art experience prior to taking this class, and I improved beyond my any expectation this semester. This class was so much fun and the only one I truly looked forward to going to. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested.",
                "An amazing course all around! Thoughtful lessons and very encouraging professor!",
                "I was a new artist and was very nervous but now can actually take pride in some of my drawings!",
                "As someone who had some drawing experience going into this class, ART 114 equipped me with the vocabulary I needed to describe my work.",
                "Drawing in many mediums (charcoal, pencil, ink)",
                "I gained the confidence to draw which I did not have before entering the class, even though I am an intended Art major. Professor Dang is a wonderful professor and is encouraging to all skill types.",
                "I developed basic skills required for drawing such as an understanding of composition, light and shadows, cross hatching, and how to draw from life.",
                "Artistic talent, critique, and vision and discussion of art in a new way",
                "I developed my abilities in drawing with charcoal, graphite, and ink. I also developed my skills in figure drawing and compositional arrangement. I practiced close looking at my own and my peers' compositions."

                "This course is amazing how it is. The assignments are timed out great. They are explained very well, and Professor Dang and Rachel were very helpful the entire time. All the assignments helped me learn how to draw while still being very fun and enjoyable. I also loved the lectures on technique that we would have. The art shown as examples was very conducive to my learning and gave me inspiration for my own art.",
                "The courses greatest strengths stemmed from two sources. One of these was the range of subject matter and materials used, which openned up countless opportunities for learning. The second was the professor, Rachelle Dang, whose continuous support of her students lead everyone in the class to grow and develop no matter their initial skill level. No extra attention was given to students with greater abilities or their work looked at differently. Both the professor and format of the course lead to an incredibly inclusive environment.\r\n\r\nAs far as weaknesses go, I did not find many. One thing that was not entirely up to my hopes during the course was our use of ink. We only explored ink as a medium for one or two days and did not use it extensively or make any very concrete work with it. If there had been an in class activity where we rendered real-life objects with ink instead of the in class activity of a sort of free-draw with ink I feel like my ability to use the medium would have increased more.",
                "This course taught you a lot about how to draw and provided ample opportunity to practice. However, it could have a bit more 1:1 feedback from instructors.",
                "The professor allowed us to learn from our mistakes and guided us",
                "Strength: crits were really interesting, had lots of time to practice, got to explore and analyze a bunch of different styles \r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes a lot more time consuming than youd expect (dont underestimate how much time youd put into a drawing)",
                "Professor Dang is great! I really don't think there's anything to be improved upon in this course.",
                "Strengths: in class activities and homework where both engaging and helped improve my skills greatly. The directions for assignments were not always strictly followed which I really appreciated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "I thought that a strength of this course was that it enabled students to explore each topic and approach each assignment through their own lens with their own styles. A weakness was that often the lectures took up too much of class time and we didnt even get to draw in quite a few of the classes.",
                "This was one of my favorite courses, I loved the tight-knit group of people and the teaching style of Professor Dang to bring out the best in her students",
                "This was a wonderful class and a great mix of lecture, in-class assignments, and group critiques. I think that class was divided, time-wise, very well."

                "Definitely. This course does a great job at teaching drawing basics in a fun collaborative way. All the assignments were enjoyable to complete, and you were still learning and pushing yourself at the same time. Professor Dang was amazing. Her lectures gave great examples of techniques that we would practice in our art, many of which were really inspiring. I learned a lot about myself in this class and how I can reflect myself into my art. I came into the class not knowing much about drawing at all, and by the end I was amazed with how far I had come. Take this class!",

I have been doing art in my free time for much of my life, but I still found this course incredibly valuable in its concrete lessons about form and value. The course made me far more comfortable with the practice of drawing and helped me realize the fluidity and ease of drawing compared to many other mediums. I believe having taken this course will greatly benefit all types of art I make in the future.",
                "Yes! This was Ana amazing class to get a feel for your artistic side even without any prior experience. I learned so much and had a great time every class.",
