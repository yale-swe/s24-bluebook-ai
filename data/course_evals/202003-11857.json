                "strengths: well-taught course, skills were interesting and useful\r\nweaknesses: no graded work we turn in until the last week, so some students got behind (but that was really on them). Just make sure you keep up because each week builds on the last week.",
                "This was a difficult course to run this semester due to pandemic restrictions. Therefore, I don't think the strengths and weaknesses I would list would be applicable in any other year.",
                "This course was a challenging one for many reasons. Firstly, it was easy to get behind on all components of the assignments, whether DataCamp or the work we were supposed to be doing after the Zoom calls. This meant that by the time the final project rolled around there were immense amounts of work to do, and with little support or guidance. The final project itself was worth 70% of the grade between the data table and the report which feels very unfair. Additionally, there was no option to turn in any code at all for the data table so it was either a yes or no, with no option for partial credit at all. It felt very frustrating to work on this final project in this manner. Similarly, some individuals in the class were able to provide their groups with data tables, so the amount of work one had to do was entirely dependent on who was in your group.",
                "Professors van Wolfswinkel and Nelson did a lot of great work to make this course work this year. I thought the set up was a creative use of the class, with focusing on in person lab work in the first section and analytical methods in the second. Professor van Wolfswinkel's slides were an incredibly helpful reference, and having the clear structure of the DESeq vignette was helpful too. A lot of my learning was a bit back ended, however, since I would generally do the DataCamp exercises in one go and then eventually forget the concepts they were about. Doing the actual project taught me a lot, but it would have been a bit less overwhelming if it wasn't so concentrated at the end. Part of this definitely had to do with my own engagement throughout the semester, but I think clearer expectations of assignments would be helpful. For example, starting with the vignette would have made it much more clear to me what we were working towards, because I didn't appreciate how everything fit together until the end. And while the slides and example scripts were great resources, I think we also would have benefitted just seeing Professor van Wolfswinkel navigate the computing cluster and R through screenshare, because it's all a bit oblique to begin with. I learned a lot in this class--these are just a few things I've been thinking about since turning in the project.",
                "strength was the skills it endowed me with by the end. i went from not knowing a single R command to being able to (of course, with resources) analyze a set of real RNAseq data. another strength was datacamp, which was really helpful (and sometimes even fun) in the way it's structured to give us the tools we need to ultimately complete the final project. datacamp allowed us to work at our own pace, revisit concepts we're struggling with, and get real practice with coding. the weakness is that because it's a class mostly on coding, some parts of the lectures e.g. going through the specifics of the commands were not engaging. one suggestion for the future (if the course continues to be online) is to have breakout rooms after the lecture to work on the activities or to code together so that we can put what was lectured into practice.",
                "The strengths are in the freedom to take your time with all the assignments. The weakness lies in the fact that there weren't more specific tutorials at the beginning of the course. It was very fast paced at times, but when asked, instructors would slow down to ensure people understood.",
                "It was sad we couldn't have lab in person but I felt like I learned a lot of coding skills and got to practice more scientific writing."

                "Absolutely. This is a well-taught, interesting lab and the least workload for a lab credit you will ever have at Yale. I took the second half of the course (343L) which during covid was a remotely taught data analysis course using the data from the first half (342L) of in-person work. Note that you can take only the second half, but must speak with the instructors. Also, to get into the lab you need to email Kenneth Nelson in January the year before. Overall, I learned a lot and enjoyed practicing my coding skills. I enjoyed learning how to evaluate RNA-seq data, which was honestly really cool and will be useful in the future. The professors care about student learning and supported us quite well. The workload is very very light and the only graded assignments were the Datacamp coding modules and a final analysis and report. The course was structured incredibly well, with each week building on the last so by the final report, we could complete the analysis of an RNA-seq experiment all by ourselves. Be aware, however, some students did not keep up with the assignments (since they were not turned in) and therefore struggled a lot on the final report. That's on them, just make sure to keep up since the skills do build on each other.",

As someone who has never coded anything in my life it was incredibly challenging to start from scratch. For someone who has coding background and is curious about the intersection between lab research and coding it would be very interesting.",

                "Yes!!! The lab portion was very fun and the work never felt like busy work. Even though it was tough at some parts (especially because I've never coded before), I felt very accomplished in that all my work throughout the half of the semester culminated in analyzing and obtaining results from real data.",
                "Not sure, if you are dedicated to learning alone, yes. Otherwise maybe only complete the prior course and leave the analysis aside.",
                "Yes!! If it's in person I would take it. I learned so much and it was a really cool topic."
