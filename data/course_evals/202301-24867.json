                "interesting concepts but a lot of material",
                "Strength: super cool speakers brought in from leading companies. Weakness: lectures were sporadic.",
                "The strengths is the course itself is really interesting and we can learn the world of blockchains from it, starting from basic to advance.\r\nOne weakness may be the organization of the timeline. Finally, we are a little fall behind our original schedule and thus we did not go deep into the topic of zero knowledge proof, which is the most interesting part in my own opinion.",
                "It should be recorded.",
                "Better slides / lectures, recorded lectures",
                "The course gives a great overview of the major topics in the crypto space (how cryptocurrencies work, how to code Ethereum contracts, etc.) and helps put a lot of the different areas of research related to crypto into perspective. The psets can feel highly technical at times, and I would have liked a more structured teaching approach (high level before low level) so we could become familiar with the necessary vocabulary in a topic before diving into say the mathematical weeds. The psets do feel quite challenging as they also grapple with topics at a very technical level, so I found using OH often. That being said, I found the Solidity projects to be more rewarding than challenging.",
                "The content is interesting and I enjoyed the guest lectures. The psets/projects also effectively complement the information given during lectures. The workload of the class could be less backloaded - having a pset, project, final and report (for grad students) within the last few weeks of the semester is overwhelming and, in my opinion, unnecessary. I also found the final very difficult and could not finish it within the 3-hour timeslot.",
                "It actually requires a lot of prerequites to fully understand the course materials.",
                "Ben is very smart, but sometimes we lose the forest for the trees. There is too much specific info that we don't need to know and are never tested on, and then it is very confusing since we have some specific info that we need to know. This course can be streamlined and made more conscise."
