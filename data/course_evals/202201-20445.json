                "I wish we werent made to talk about topics we had so little vocab to talk about, like class and patrimnio, even though I understand that the point was to learn about not just language but also Brazilian culture. I wish there was separation between deep complex topics (conducted in English so people in the class actually understand and can participate) and the usual language 101 like verb tenses and weekend activities \/ colors \/ family. What ended up happening is not delving into any social issue enough and also not knowing some basic spoken phrases.",
                "A lot of culture was learned but not a lot of vocab was practiced. A lot of people ended up having to translate stuff often because we didnt test vocabulary a lot. There was a lot of busy work that was given out for homework that was so time consuming but it didnt really help improve our ability to speak the language."
