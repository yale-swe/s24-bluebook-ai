                "I learned so much in this class -- theories of cartography / geography / space / mapping, how to place academic arguments in conversation with each other, how to analyze maps with nuance and care, and more broadly how to think about space and its representation in political / historical / other context.",
                "This course isa must for someone who is looking to learn how to engage with theories about telling and organizing history. I think the best assignment for this were our weekly assignments where we had to create questions for the authors we read based on their theory not the actual historical content. We also had an assignment where we had to redesign a map, which not only teaches you malleable maps are, but also proves to you how malleable history is in general. If you are looking for a course on the history of maps and want to leave knowing facts about the different cartographic techniques this is not the course for you.",
                "This class not only does a great job of exposing you to a wide range of analyses on cartography, but it also teaches you HOW to read and write history. The class is not a survey course on the history of cartography, so you won't be looking at a chronologic history of maps, or even necessarily the most popular or important maps ever made. However, every book you read (of which there are a lot) looks at the practice of mapping territory from a different angle. By the end of the course, I felt like I could really think about maps in so many ways and select the right mode of analysis for any type of project or paper. Additionally, you will get to practice your own map-making skills (however this is mainly self-directed).",
                "I learned entirely new ways of understanding, reading, challenging, and using maps. This class reprinted my perception of how space is not only understood by ourselves by how perceptions of space have been crucial aspects of self-identification throughout history. This class also really helped my historical writing skills with its large research project.",

                "Strengths: great (if sometimes long/dense) readings, fantastic group of people, interesting conversations with a good balance of input from students and Prof. Rankin, really interesting assignments, low stakes presentations to get feedback and learn about what our peers are researching. Weaknesses: I was so inspired and excited by the other students in the class (very much a strength!), so it would've been great to do some type of weekly check-in or otherwise have a more structured effort to build class community.",
                "Overall, I enjoyed this was my favorite class of the semester! The readings and assignments were challenging, but I felt like I was learning to grapple with actual historical theories and become better at deciphering the argument from length, lengthy texts. We did ice breakers for the first two weeks or so and I wish we continued this trend throughout the semester since this was a class that met only once a week. I think the experience could have been improved by some more time speaking to the professor outside class hours. I think hosting a couple office hours throughout semester (does not have to be weekly) would have helped immensely with this.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Level of engagement from everyone in the course is very high due to how organized and the course is. Due to the amount of reading and Prof. Rankin's expectations about weekly discussion question submissions, everyone is always very prepared.\r\n- Prof. Rankin is extremely smart and clearly wants everyone to succeed. He is very generous about always meeting with you to help you figure out your project or final paper (if you do take the course, make sure to take advantage of this!)\r\n- You will leave the course as a much better academic reader and writer. I now feel confident in my ability to quickly scan long texts for the most salient information.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- In-class discussion was often a back-and-forth between whomever raised their hand and Prof. Rankin. I would have liked if we had more opportunities to directly respond to other people directly rather than raising our hand and being called on. Always needing to raise your hand made things a little bit stilted.",
                "Prof rankin is amazing, and the readings are long but highly engaging. Prof leads a very interesting discussion and I learned so much about cartography, but also about historical themes and writing.",
                "No weaknesses, seriously! Probably the best organized, structured, thought-out course Ive taken at Yale. No discussion was extraneous. All brilliant. Prof Rankin knows how to juggle every part of being a professor first and foremost a great teacher, discussion leader, excellent feedback provider, not to mention his own stellar work as an academic."

                "Yes, if you're prepared to read a lot and read it thoroughly! The readings generally took me most of a weekend day to get through, so adding in the occasional reading and writing assignments made for a significant time commitment. That said, the discussions were great, Prof. Rankin is great, and I will never see a map the same way again -- I'd highly recommend the class!",
                "Yes! If you are looking for an interdisciplinary class that touches on themes of critical geography (of which Yale seems to have relatively few courses) this is amazing. You read a bunch of foundational texts in the study of cartography and by the end of the course you will be familiar with many of the major references in the readings. However, you should only take this class if you are willing to put in the time for the readings (roughly a book + an article a week). Even though the amount of reading was significant, nothing felt superfluous and I am glad that I put in the time to do it all. I *feel* so much smarter after taking this course and I bet you will too :)",
                "If youre looking for a course where you engage with maps on a deep and unique academic level (this course literally covers its own field of history; that of maps as textual sources), this is for you. If youre looking to learn about projections, mapmaking and cartographic history, this isnt for you.",
                "Yes, this is among the very best classes Ive taken at Yale. Take it if youre lucky enough to get a spot!!",
                "Absolutely. This class is a harmonious balance of what makes a Yale course great engaging discussion 100% of the time, an intelligent, stimulating professor, and meaningful reading and writing assignments."
