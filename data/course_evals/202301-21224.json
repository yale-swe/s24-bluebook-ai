                "This is a great course, as all the ASL classes are. It has good content and pacing, but it also has a heavier workload than L1-3. Since I don't think this increased work really improved my knowledge of the language, it was a bit frustrating at times to have such long assignments. We also had more assignments than the other class, so it would definitely be an improvement to have the classes standardized.",
                "The strengths of this course is the multitude of opportunities we get to apply our foundational knowledge and the feedback we receive.",
                "I really enjoyed the content of the course and its many opportunities to practice communicating in sign. Learning about Deaf literature truly was fascinating. I think the only way this course could be improved is if the syllabus were a little more clearly structured. Towards the middle and end of the semester I lost track of the learning objectives and when one topic ended and another began.",
                "strengths: took a more holistic, cultural approach to understanding Deaf culture as part of ASL\r\nweaknesses: INCREDIBLY disorganized (sometimes given less than a day to complete HW assignments, create presentations, memorize and film content, do incredibly long journals assignments, etc). I really loved ASL through L2 but felt like at the higher levels especially, the classes are a bit of a mess. Also felt like the expectations for hours/projects outside of class were not reasonable; it almost felt like they assumed we take no other classes outside of ASL. I really wish my experience was better and that the dept took a more organized approach to teaching/assigning things bc I otherwise would have loved it so I'm hoping they are clearer with students moving forward."

I believe that in this course more than others the emphasis on Deaf culture and Deaf literature really contributed to my understanding of ASL and the Deaf community. I think this course is a great next step for those interested in continuing their study of ASL and Deaf culture."
