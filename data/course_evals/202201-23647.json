                "Good discussion of current events and media coverage.",
                "I learned a lot about reading media objectively. I examined different sources and the agenda broader news organizations have in conveying their stories",

                "I learned a lot about how to Analyse the news, and about how politics influences even the most basic of wording.",
                "This course challenged me to think critically about how I interact with the news, politics, and journalism as a whole. Professor McEnroe's course taught me to look beyond the surface level of what I'm reading and dive deep into the underbelly of political journalism. For example, what is being covered by major news outlets? What isn't? If it isn't, why isn't it? Where did you find that information? In this course, we also learned how different mediums of news are making journalism expand into outlets we haven't had in the past; what does this mean for vetting \"facts\" or reporting on issues? This course helped me understand how to navigate politics, news, and journalism, all while having an incredible seminar and really enjoying all the writing assignments."

                "Strengths - discussion, variety of topics\r\nWeaknesses - loose structure, but was also helpful at points",
                "This was a great class with an amazing teacher. McEnroe is awesome. There were no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: I loved Colin's chill vibes, and how ridiculously well-connected he is! The journals also did force me to consume different types of media\/journalism, although I wish we had a \"master doc\" of sources or something to make life easier and explore new things. Weaknesses: The course was just too open and lacked structure at times. The last couple of weeks especially decayed into \"let's talk about social media and Twitter,\" which is fair because they were relevant but also would have appreciated some more variety.",
                "Strength - Colin is engaging and knowledgeable\r\nWeakness - not a ton of structure",
                "Strengths: super interesting and really fun political science seminar. The final project was particularly great! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very few. Sometimes we didnt get to talk about everything that I would have liked to discuss because we ran out of time in class and had gotten carried away talking about other things.",
                "The curriculum was uniquely tailored to this class which was really nice. I feel like we covered a bit of everything with a good amount of detail. Class discussions were great and Colin did a great job giving us necessary insight",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that Professor McEnroe adapts the theme of the seminar depending on what is happening in the news cycle. While we did have some days where we covered specific themes that had us dive into the archives, we were mostly talking about how major news were covered by different outlets and how people are consuming those particular news. The course was also delightful to be in; conversations were intellectual, improvised, and hilarious. I enjoyed this course and Professor McEnroe's teaching style -- high expectations and high return from him to us on instruction and course preparation."

                "Yes! Great class to wrap up your semester, really pushed me to keep up to date with the news",
                "Yes, absolutely. If you are willing to read a lot of news, write weekly journals, and actively engage with Mr. McEnroe and the rest of the class, you will have a lot of fun with this course.",
                "Yes! It's a chill relaxed course where you basically dissect the media\/journalism\/news with your friends\/peers. If you have a friend or two in the class, it's even better. Overall, a fun class without any pain; as long as you keep up with your response papers, you should be fine (and the papers are so open structured that you can do whatever you want w\/ them). Also, Colin is just too fun to pass up a class w\/ him",
                "Yes. Enjoyable. Relatively low workload.",
                "100%. This is a terrific and engaging course if you love reading the news!",
                "Yes! Such a wonderful experience which helped me question the news from the lens of academia and my personal consumption",
                "I would definitely recommend this course because it is a fantastic way to develop a more critical perspective on journalism",
                "I really enjoyed it. Discussions were interesting, it was a fun class to be in, and wasnt too much work.",
                "Yes absolutely. What a fun, challenging, and thoughtful course. Professor McEnroe has been one of the highlight instructors of my time in academia so far. If you're interested in politics, journalism, ethics, podcasts, being a contrarian, or maybe challenging the way you think a little bit, then do not hesitate to reach this course. Highly recommend."
