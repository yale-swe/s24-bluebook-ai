                "there is a lot of content to cover and the professor is very responsive to students and the questions they have; we don't get to go over exactly everything, but what we go into we go into in depth. I also liked that people were brought in to speak to us more in depth about their specialties",
                "I thought the lectures and section were very good. I got a lot out of both events and there was ample material you had access to. I thought lectures being recorded was also extremely helpful to look back at lectures and add to your notes. I think the class could be improved by providing more ways to organize information about different hominins. There was a lot of information that was covered with each hominin and it could be tough to keep track of the larger picture story and how each hominin contributes to it.",
                "This course was well-organized with clear instructions and expectations. You have access to all the lecture slides and download each one before class. You receive a helpful study guide before every quiz and the final exam, highlighting important questions to focus on as you review. There are also three extra credits distributed throughout the semester with hard deadlines but clear instructions (no science background is required).\r\nMy favorite part of the course is definitely the sections (a combination of discussion and lab)! In discussion sections, we talk about so many interesting topics I never thought about before, such as debates surrounding genetic ethics, anthropological collection ownership, and the actual biological consequences of the constructed social concept of race. In lab sections, we got to examine real specimen of Darwins finches and try to figure out the phylogeny tree as he did; we got to examine casts of Lucys bones and compare with modern humans skeleton; we got to practice forensic anthropology with casts (its basically trying to determine the age, sex, height, identity, cause of death of deceased individuals from bone remains etc. it was mind-blowing - like in a crime movie!!!). I would take this class even for sections alone! They opened my eyes to so many cool things out there and made me view many important topics in a completely different way.\r\nI personally found the quizzes (11 multiple choice + 3 short answer + 2 bonus in 20 minutes) a bit tight in time, though they are not designed to be. Sometimes I struggle with finishing in time, especially when the short answer questions require some more thinking - not really slow-thinker-friendly, but still doable.\r\nAnother thing to note is that Professor Thompson stopped posting the lecture recordings publicly halfway into the semester due to low in-person attendance. You can still request access if you miss a lecture occasionally (I did once and Professor Thompson was extremely supportive and helpful in making sure I can get access to it). I have nothing against her decision (in fact, Im quite supportive of it) since its totally understandable and reasonable, but I have to admit that it posed a small challenge for me as I previously relied on recordings for quiz review. It was not a big deal as I changed my study strategy soon after to focus more on class notes and slides, but if you have to rely on recordings every time, then you have to rethink before taking this class. However, Professor Thompson did make all lecture recordings available again before the final exam.",
                "Strengths: Low workload, interesting guest lecturers from Peabody and School of Medicine\r\nWeaknesses: 9 am class in Watson, Exams every 3rd class are necessary to keep people engaged but become tedious",
                "Overall very good.",
                "I didnt like the quizzes every week in a half. Especially the quizzes that fell in the middle of the week, which was most of them. She somehow expected us to learn a new lecture in Monday, posted the study guide Tuesday, and then take a quiz Wednesday at 9 am. That may have worked if the class was in the middle of the day and I had two days to really study. Learning it in one day felt just like cramming. Maybe a quiz every two weeks would be good, something that always fell after a weekend so I had a little more time.",
                "lectures were bit out of topic, no actually all the lectures were off topic.",
                "Hated the exams. Anxiety provoking. Wish they could have been on a scantron and pen and paper. It is hard to be doing such a fast paced exam on a computer that is constantly getting emails, notifications, etc. I really dreaded each exam, even the ones on which I got perfect or near-perfect scores.",
                "The course is VERY well organized, which I really appreciated. The regular open-note quizzes are an incentive to keep you from falling behind. Sometimes it felt like they were too often, but I'd prefer having multiple smaller tests to having only one or two big ones. The course had more readings than felt necessary sometimes.",
                "The weekly quizzes were timed and I wasnt able to finish in time and that ended up hurting my grade in the long run",
                "strengths: tied in recent anthropology research, covered lots of material\r\nweaknesses: lectures felt rushed (behind syllabus)",
                "The regular short-assessment aspect of this course is a unique strength. It drove learning in a non-stressful way.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this class also has a lot of room for improvement. The slides are very disorganized, making it difficult to study for short exams even when topics are provided ahead of time. The disorganization also made it difficult to situate topics chronologically. I have now completed the class and still have very little clue when everything we studied took place. This could have been remedied with a simple timeline that is shown consistently and indicates when the current topic dates to in a way that makes it easy to place in the broader course context.\r\n\r\nThe lack of coordination between content covered in lectures and content assessed on exams was a constant source of frustration. Little effort was made in lectures to distinguish between important take-home lessons and tangential information that wouldn't appear on exams. Questions that were completely unaddressed by class content appeared with shocking frequency on exams. It was a regular and frustrating experience to see a question that clearly dated from a previous year when that topic had been covered but had not been covered at all or in the necessary depth this time around. Even though I studied thoroughly for each exam from the materials provided, and have thousands of words in study documents to substantiate that claim, I found myself guessing on about a quarter of exam questions.\r\n\r\nI also felt that the class didn't take the students' time commitment seriously. We regularly spent the first 10-15 minutes of class addressing questions that could have been answered in office hours and were therefore behind on lecture content for almost the entire semester. This meant the syllabus was less helpful as a reference and that we had to watch an entire lecture on our own time at the end of the semester to prepare for the exam. The assignments themselves also often felt like busy work where the time investment to complete them was not proportionate to the learning opportunity. This is the only class I've had at Yale where the principal source of required readings is entire chapters from an introductory textbook. The time\/learning ratio is worse for this kind of learning than any other. The section activities also felt more like high school labs than a real college course. One section was even justified as an opportunity not to learn the material, but to gain an understanding of how difficult that kind of task must have been for early scientists to conduct.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think the content of this class could be so much more interesting and pertinent. Most of the heart of this course tracks the human ancestral fossil record, what anthropologists have discovered when and where. While I understand this is central to the work of those in the department, it is far removed from what most students will find interesting and helpful. I took this course because I wanted to learn how human evolutionary history influences the world today. I wanted to know how it might explain why we are so addicted to our cell phones, why we have an obesity crisis in some parts of the world, and why we are so quick to form prejudices and stereotypes. We addressed none of these questions, with the exception of one short lecture on the neolithic crammed into the final day where we touched on the most obvious aspects of the second one. I am much more likely to find answers to those questions useful than I am information on the names and dates of specific fossils.",
                "Strengths: frequent but short exams makes this course a lot less stressful since it emphasizes consistent engagement, very manageable workload, clear organization, variety of tasks for discussion sections, many extra credit opportunities so any student who wants to do well will be able to\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we ran behind on a lot of lectures so the course content often didn't align with the assigned reading schedule"

As long as you know the amount of work you're signing up for I think it's a good class to take if you need a science credit. If you're particularly interested in the story of human evolution I think it's a great initial survey course for this. I certainly am glad I took this course.",

                "I would recommend this class as a fifth credit  you can get a good grade as long as you study and you do learn some interesting things. However, this is NOT a gut! You need to put in a good amount of time and effort for preparation before each quiz to actually do well.",
                "I would take this only if you feel capable of hauling yourself to class in Watson at 9 am every Monday and Wednesday (and every third class you have a short in-class test at 9 am too) and would like a relatively laid-back science credit.",

                "If you are not anxious from tests at all, then this could be a good course for you. Otherwise it is probably too stressful to have to take an exam every 3 classes that is very fast. Although the questions weren't necessarily hard, and we received study guides for the exams, it was often hard to tell which lectures were covered for a given exam based on the syllabus, so you ended up needing to be a slave to the study guides, not knowing what material would be tested outside of it. However, on the final exam, the study guide was not enough, and required a re-deep dive into the course to prepare.",
                "I would recommend this course. I took it because I needed a science credit and wanted one that actually related to my interests (psych and humanities), and it served this purpose but it was not a gut. It wasn't as hard as most science classes at Yale are, but I ended up putting about as much time into it as I put into my other classes. That said, it's really interesting stuff and relevant to any field that has anything to do with human behavior. The study guides were helpful.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in learning about human evolution. Good science credit for humanities majors, too.",
                "Only take this course if you want to become a biological anthropologist. Otherwise, there are many other science courses that you will enjoy much more and still won't struggle to do well.",
                "I'd recommend this course for any student, since it's a really relevant blend of biological and social science. As a STEM student, I really enjoyed getting to view the science of evolution and biological variation through a social lens. There's very little work outside of studying for the short exams, which is nice since the exams really pushed me to digest information and understand big concepts without having to do any busy work. The amount of extra credit available provided a lot of flexibility and also helped keep this course low stress. Above all else, I think the content is very relevant, especially the later lectures that discuss the concept of race and the applications of biological anthropology. I think this course is especially great for first-year students since it's taught in a very accommodating and flexible way, and could really introduce some new career options to students.",
