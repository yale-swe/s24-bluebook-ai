I felt that meeting four times a week (with a fifth day asynchronous) was very beneficial as the continuous practice of the language helped me improve consistently. I also though the wide verity of assessments (tests, projects, essays, etc.) were nice to have as the gave a more well-rounded picture of improvement. There were no obvious weaknesses that I noted.",
