There was an overarching topic of unconscious motivation and goal pursuit. I thought it was excellent.",

We talked about how decisions and behavior are influenced by the past (carry-over from recent experiences, as well as older experiences), the present (situational triggers, mimicry of the actions of others, etc.), and the future (unconsciously held goals). One of my major takeaways is that the unconscious does a lot more than I'd realized, and so even when I think I'm making decisions fully consciously, there's a lot I'm not aware of.",

The slides were disorganized and hard to follow especially if you are reading them without the lecture. The Canvas page was difficult to navigate due to the readings being filed in a non-uniform way.",
                "I wish there were other assignments other than just exams.",
                "there were only three exams, so it was not that much work. if you went to lecture and did all the readings, it wasn't hard to study and do well on the exams. very interesting course content.",
                "To be honest the course was super interesting in the beginning but very repetitive towards the end.",
                "The strength of this course is the content, which is super cool. The weaknesses are the slides, which are confusingly organized, making it harder to follow along in lecture.",
                "I liked the chronological structure of the course, but many of the experiments overlapped and were reused between lectures.",
                "Strengths - really interesting content; Exams are challenging but not too difficult; lectures do a good job of synthesizing / going back to previous lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Recorded lectures would be nice in case of needing to miss class. A few other assignments or papers so our grades aren't just based on exams!",
                "Terrible curve that is solely predicated on your peers performance, an 80 has traditionally been viewed as a B- in an uncurved class, but in this class, if all your peers do well you could end up with a grade much lower than that. Practice problems to prepare for the exams also wouldve helped a lot.",
                "Formula for succeeding in the class is pretty simple. Go to class, take notes, and study those for the exams. From my own personal experience, if you are looking for an A in this class, you better take the best notes ever. Some questions on the test were things that went right by my head in lecture because things moved fast, and you can't miss much because everything is fair game for the test.",
                "Boring and just memorizing so much",
                "Strengths: interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: not very engaging",
                "The only three assignments are the three exams, with each one weighing more as the semester passes. This was a strength in that there wasn't any work to do throughout the semester, but you had to study really well for the exams. The weighting of the exams is unfair in that it puts the last exam at such a higher weight than the other two (almost 40% of your grade is the third exam that is at the end of the semester when we are all overrun with work for other classes). Prof. Bargh also lectures incredibly fast, and so it's hard to get down the notes that you need to for the exams.",
                "Strength: covers a lot of material, non-accumulative midterms\r\n\r\nWeakness: slides are not really organized and sometimes the class goes by too fast",
                "It was a fascinating course and well-taught, although I think many students became frustrated at how it was graded-  on three non-cumulative exams and nothing else. Its important to have good study and test-taking skills for this class.",
                "I found the lectures engaging, and I liked the readings. The reading load was manageable.",
                "Strengths: material was often very interesting and engaging. Weaknesses: often presented in a boring, list-like way that did not invite critical thinking about the subject matter.",

Its a great class to learn about a bunch of cool psychology studies. The slides are somewhat cryptic and very disorganized, so attending lecture is a must in order to do well. Prof. Bargh is retiring though so it might be different with a new professor.",
