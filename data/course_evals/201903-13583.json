    "Its very interesting conceptually, and I love the teacher. It could benefit from perhaps a more structured curriculum.",
    "The weekly topics are intriguing, and the readings are relevant. The lectures could be more engaging.",
    "It covered everything with great breadth, but there were sometimes I wish we could have gone more in-depth on a particular topic, or focused more on primary sources, but overall I really enjoyed the different topics we covered.",
    "There were a few things in this course that were unique and interesting. First, there were the classroom journals every week. These were similar to reading questions or short essays, but I liked that they were regarded as journals, opening them up to our own individual thoughts and curiosities as we read the material for the week. Also, Professor Shin often asked each of us to read from the lecture slides during class, lowering the barrier for more nervous or shy students to participate. And there were multiple presentations in which students shared with each other our research and thoughts. This felt less like a typical class and more like a weekly gathering to share ideas, which was really nice and led to a lot of learning!"

    "Absolutely!",
    "definitely. neo-confucianism in korea was a course that i learned so much from.",
    "Yes. All the people in the class, including the professor and all the students, are very insightful. I came into the class knowing nothing about Neo-Confucianism and now I feel like Ive learned a ton.",
    "Yes, if you have an interest in Neo-Confucianism and want to study it at Yale in a context outside of China or Japan.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It encouraged each of the students to come up with their own questions and thoughts, and was a good comprehensive exploration into the concept and history of Neo-Confucianism."
