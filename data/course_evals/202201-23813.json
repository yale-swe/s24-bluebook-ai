                "There was such a well-thought-out range of art that I began to appreciate all departments and think critically about cross-departmental connections. I was able to think through rational and creative challenges a museum curator faces. I really enjoyed wall label writing and have a new appreciation for it.",

I also learned more about art from the early modern period, in a range of different mediums, and about how that art traveled."

                "A strength of this course was the number of guest talks, which provided a wide introduction to different areas within the museum. I do think this presented a bit of a challenge, though, because some of the classes felt more like lectures than seminar discussions, and at times I would have appreciated an opportunity to talk more with the class and hear what my peers thought about the various issues raised.\r\n\r\nThe assignments were also a huge strength of the class - writing object labels was not something I'd ever been asked to do in any of my previous classes, and I appreciated that we went through multiple rounds of edits on them. \r\n\r\nI also think a strength was how seriously Jessie took the class, not just as an academic exercise, but as training for a new generation of curators."

It is pretty laid-back but you get so much out of it by engaging. This is an extraordinary and unique course that any student at Yale should take with our Gallery being so accessible.",
                "Yes I absolutely would! Especially anyone interested in a career in museums or in the art world, this course was incredible and so informative and interesting.",
                "Yes, I would, especially if you are interested in working in museums or thinking about the role of art museums. The class strikes a nice balance between being art historically focused (on the early modern period) and museum focused. The work is nicely spaced out and there are no major paper assignments, just a series of shorter papers, object labels, and a final project. The final project (designing a museum exhibition proposal) gave us a lot of creative freedom and was a fun, engaging project."
