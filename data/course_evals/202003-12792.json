                "This course enabled me to apply all of the skills I developed over the course of my time at Yale including regional analysis, quantitative reasoning and international relations theory. Additionally, the Capstone project was a phenomenal opportunity to refine my experience working on a team and learning to add value in different ways. After having completed this project, I feel much more confident in my understanding of the military, great power competition, and the international stage at large.",
                "The knowledge, skills, and insights developed in this course were not only about the academic material--learning about national security interests and great power competition--but also about professionalism in general. This course was really valuable in teaching me client-management and team-management skills. Though I would not have chosen this course to be over Zoom, I will admit that, more so than any other class, this course taught me about group and professional dynamics in a virtual setting, which I believe are valuable insights when entering the workforce next year.",
                "I learned about US military strategy; US SOCOM and its main divisions\/functions; and a specific country whose allegiance concerning the United States is uncertain. I developed skills in cleaning and organizing data and model building\/analysis.",
                "1) I learned the fundamentals of strategy, helping me to scaffold decision-making in my own life. \r\n2) I learned about the process of consulting for a high-powered client. I learned that sometimes, the best consulting advice is not the \"correct\" advice, but the useful advice that the client  finds helpful where they are. I learned about how to determine when this is the case."

                "This was my best course experience at Yale. It provided students with an incredibly engaging topic with lots of flexibility on how to approach it. Colonel Erfourth also brought in a series of experts to work with us which proved invaluable both for our learning and for the quality of our deliverable. There are virtually no ways in which I could imagine improving this course. For next year, I would suggest removing individual assignments on the syllabus just as we did this time around to allow students more time to work on the final product. This change was incredibly helpful to all of us and I think it will be beneficial to students in the future.",
                "Strengths of the course: \r\nThere were so many strengths of this course! For example, I thought the organization from the get-go was really phenomenal. It really set the group up for success. Similarly, I think meeting in August and doing most of the readings during the summer was really smart. It helped balance our the work throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course:\r\nThe only criticism that I have of this course was the heavy emphasis on planning at the beginning. To be clear, I think this planning was very helpful for the most part, and essential to producing our report. That being said, I do think the level of planning was a little excessive and maybe wasted time toward the end. In order to improve this course, I would suggest planning to take up only a third of the total time. If the course was taught over 3 months, I would suggest the planning phase take up only a month (September) and then there should be a transition to begin the research for the deliverables at the start of the second month (October).",
                "The strengths of this course were the opportunities to engage with professionals with vast experience in military operations and planning. While most students came to the course with 0 understanding of the US military\/military strategy&operations, our professor, as well as the other professionals with whom we worked, spent numerous, valuable hrs catching us up to speed on the workings of the various institutions. This time was extremely valuable; in some cases, we not only spent our time together discussing questions but also were able to seek direct feedback on our work products. The main weakness of the course was that our pre-session work was unproductive. One of the main problems our team faced was a lack of alignment regarding the assumptions undergirding our work. As the team grew more acquainted over the course of the semester, it became more clear that everyone brought in different perspectives that shaped how they approached the project. For example, some members of the group were hard realists; others were liberalists; etc. Because we failed to align on fundamental assumptions earlier in the semester, our group ended up wasting time on surface level disagreements that could have otherwise been resolved more easily. While this issue was nothing disastrous, it could have greatly increased the efficiency of our work.",
                "This course's strengths are the constant hands-on advice delivered by COL Erfourth and what you can learn from his decades of accumulated experience. This is helpful for anyone looking to work in any field.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, I think the course can improve by pruning readings and early class time so these aspects of the course have a greater impact on the final product. I would have found it helpful to be told emphatically and several times that I needed to be prepared to trade correct theory for best practice."

Our classes were generally pretty great."

Not only was working on this problem very gratifying because of its significance, working for a client like USSOCOM was great practice and experience for the real world. If a student is looking for an intellectual challenge, with a lot of rewarding outcomes, this is the capstone for them!",
                "If a Capstone course with Col. Erfourth is ever offered again, I would highly recommend it. What I love about the Col is that he is a no-BS, straight shooter who genuinely cares about the learning and success of each individual student as well as the composite team. Despite that he is a formal professor, he is the best educator I have taken a class with at Yale. If you have any interest in military strategy & operations, this is the course to take. The only caveat is that taking a course with Col involves an extraordinary amount of work - reasonably equivalent to that of two separate courses - because you are both absorbing knowledge (about the military) and applying it in order to create a strategy product.",

I learned useful things, I made great friends, and the work I did had the potential to have a significant impact on the world. Not bad for one course! All Capstones are a lot of work; not all of them mean something."
