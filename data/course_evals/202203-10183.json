Michael was an excellent professor and really helped me sharpen my writing skills. \r\nIn class we learned a lot of history and philosophy mainly on Derridas concept of hauntology. We also ready essays on the belief of ghosts as our section is called the anatomy of ghosts.",
                "I learned about Hauntologies which is really fascinating if youre into ghosts. I learned that things are not always what they are perceived to be and that there is a lot of room for interpretation and risk when writing! It taught me how to write a college paper in a fun and new way.",
                "I developed insight on how to write a college-appropriate paper analyzing intricate texts and ideas. I also learned how to do a close-reading of pictures and texts.",
                "This class was an amazing introductory writing course that both provided insight into writing college level papers as well as exploring interesting higher level concepts like hauntology. These higher level connections made the class engaging and meaningful, connecting interesting readings to students own ideological perspectives.",
                "I experienced my first insight into college writing and as such, I learned how to write concisely and efficiently to an academic audience. I also learned much about hauntology and the different ghosts of society."

                "Michael really helped my write better so that was a strength. I also learned how to annotate better and from a complex argument. Class was taught well. \r\nWeaknesses sometimes Michael cancelled office hours and he is slow at replying to emails. This semester might have been an anomaly though.",
                "This course was strong in interesting reads with a professor willing to dissect these texts. The professor was also engaged in helping the students along the path of this class. Some papers were more helpful than others, and this was discussed in our final class period.",
                "This course is incredibly well structured, with a clear connection between assigned readings and assignments given. Each reading builds off the previous, and class discussions dissect each reading to provide various interpretations and dialogues.",
                "This course had a strong approach to teaching writing in academia, especially with the different types of writing that were assigned. I also enjoyed the various discussions we had about the unique topic of ghosts, especially the complexity and depth that we covered. However, I would have moved some of the readings in order to introduce certain topics first."

                "Yes! English 114 is an amazing class to dig into writing; the subject on ghosts was just an added bonus because of how interesting it was! This course is instrumental in one's time at Yale.",
