    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale, definitely the best lecture course I've taken. Magaziner traced colonialism on the African continent from its very beginnings with Arab traders to European colonialism all the way to present day questions of Chinese investment. He does a great job emphasizing that there is no way to simplify the African continent or colonialism on it into a single narrative. We learned about kabakas in the Kingdom of Buganda, young female spirit mediums, how the World Wars played out in the often neglected African theater. This course is a great starting point, even if you've never learned about African history in depth. It's also really interesting to learn about colonialism across the world, and how it varied\/didn't vary.",
    "I learned about African History and how to be conscious of the generalizations people make about the continent.",
    "In depth historical analysis. The two papers are limited to the books and supplementary readings, so you really have to dig deep with the resources provided.",
    "A good overview of colonialism on the African continent that I felt like was continually referenced to in other classes I took but not explained",
    "Historic reading of novels, history of African colonization",
    "I learned the outlines of the colonial and post colonial histories of many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. I also learned how to read novels in conversation with history.",
    "This was the first official History course I have taken at Yale, and as a result I'm now considering a History PhD at some point in the future.  While the course explicitly focuses on introducing students to histories of colonization and imperialism in Africa, the sub-question that brackets the course is \"How should I talk about Africa?\"  The purpose of the course is not to answer the question, but to complicate and challenge its premises.  In one sense, the course reminded me how much I love the depth and complexity that history can take on.  In another, it reminds me how insecure and contingent each and every detail and 'finding' is.",
    "I learned a lot about this history of colonization and how it has affected modern politics.",
    "I learned a lot about how history is a very nuanced and amazing subject to study. You get to learn about the stories of Africans from the first point of colonialism through the future though fiction novels. This is a one-of-a-kind course and you learn how to read fiction novels from a historical perspective!",
    "Understanding on the history of colonialisms in the different regions in Africa in the broader international context",
    "I learned about different forms of colonialisms and imperialism in Africa, colonial resistance, decolonialization and post-colonialisms, and the legacies of colonial institutions. I also was able to read some important works of African literature and gain insight into how complex African history is.",
    "This course taught me how to think about history differently and gave me an entirely new perspective through which to study historical events and current events.",
    "Introduction to African history starting in teh colonial period through decolonization",
    "I got a broad overview of major trends in African colonial history",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding and respect for history as being about much more than a dates, facts and sources, and instead providing nuanced and complex explanations of how the world works and why it's important. The practical knowledge that I gained about the African continent was absolutely illuminating and incredibly important. This course definitely altered my world view for the better.",
    "This class helped me gain immense insight into African historical narratives as well as modern African lives.",
    "Developed an good introductory knowledge of European colonialism across the African continent. At times Magaziner teaches a revisionist form of history which is new and exciting! We also read amazing novels written by African authors which you rarely would get a chance to do in Yale's euro\/white-centric courses.",
    "I learnt how to not generalise about a continent and its history and pay close attention to the perspectives through which it is told.",
    "The course offered me a different way to view and understand history and especially Africal colonialism.",
    "I believe this course has given me an in-depth perspective of what it means to thoroughly look at the history of colonialism in Africa. The focus on personal stories and impacts of the systems of colonialism gave me an understanding of the time period that I hadn't been exposed to before.",
    "I learned about the creation, development (or lack thereof, I should say, thanks to the European colonial powers), and independence of European colonies in Africa.",
    "I learned a lot about colonialism in African nations (mostly sub-Saharan African nations). Personally, I most enjoyed learning about what various African states were like pre-colonization and how the legacy of colonialism has affected politics in modern African nations, as I had never been taught anything about either of these topics before.",
    "Taking this course was an incredible introduction in",
    "I discovered a great deal of content through reading many african literature books. Developed the skills of putting fiction into a historical context.",
    "I learned how to think critically about the macroscopic, philosophical reasons for which colonialism is destructive but also the minute and practical ways in which it affected societies across the continent of Africa. I feel like I better understand the lasting impacts of colonial presence in Africa, too.",
    "I learned a lot about different experiences in Africa under colonialisms. I also feel like I gained a better sense of how to approach history that is typically understudied and why the study of history is important.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of African colonialism and was provided with many new perspectives on the subject.",
    "How to write history paper \r\nNew knowledge about Africa from a different perspective \r\nRead more books",
    "I had almost no previous experience learning African history, so this course provided a very valuable overview. I feel like I am conversant now in at least the major events in African history in the past century and a half. In addition, it helped me to see the African continent in a more realistic light."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: That the required readings are all novels. I think this is up to people's preferences, but I genuinely enjoyed reading fiction for this course. It made it easy to complete readings, and didn't feel like work. It also balanced out the large amount of information that the course encompasses, and allows us to understand a bit of cultural history as well. All of the books are by African authors, with the exception of one that we read to understand British racist thought during the period of colonialism. Magaziner is also a really engaging lecturer -- he makes it feel like a story, and you can tell that he thinks about every word that he puts forth in lecture. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that really affected the way that I felt about this course! Magaziner does cover a lot of information, and it can sometimes be frustrating to feel like you're not getting all of the details, but that's kind of impossible to fix given how much he covers.",
    "The main strength of this course was Professor Magaziner. His lectures were the most interesting and entertaining I have ever experienced in a Yale course.",
    "It is a nice change from a lot of history classes. Reading fiction books is something different and a break from a lot of classes. With that being said, reading a book a week is a lot.",
    "The lecture was such a broad overview it felt hard to situate yourself in what was going on if you hadn't been familiar with African history or World History on some level prior. Maybe going in chronological order or being more specific with themes",
    "This course has interesting lectures, but if you don't have a TA who is willing to facilitate conversation to link the readings with the lecture, the course can seem disjointed. I often struggled with relating the novels back to Magaziner's lectures, and I believe that to be due to a lack of structured tying-in done by my TA. Magaziner is also rather strict with extentions\/reading drafts\/etc to the point that it seems to be tedious and not beneficial. Not sure how I felt about not being able to have a draft read over twice before submitting a final paper worth a large chunk of the grade. Magaziner also tends to call out people talking or texting in lecture -- for some, that can be anxiety provoking, and for others, a much needed wake up call. Regardless, I think it boils down to your wanting to be in the class and wanting to give it effort. Definitely the better way to go into this class.",
    "Strengths: lectures were engaging, reading novels was interesting\r\nWeaknesses: too many books to read thoroughly, having section",
    "Professor Magaziner is the strength. I felt that my section was pretty weak, however. I rarely felt that the discussion about the books informed the lecture, and so I found writing the papers slightly more difficult than I believe they could have been.",
    "Strengths: the lectures are absolutely amazing, and I learned a lot. Professor Magaziner is engaging, clearly knows a lot about what he's talking about, and makes a concerted effort to answer questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: section discussions were often a bit unfocused. I think it would have been helpful to have a bit more structure, otherwise it was easy for me to just slide through saying a couple of takeaways about the readings without actually thinking much. The papers didn't have much direction which made them difficult for me to write at times, but they weren't too bad.",
    "Sometimes I struggled to connect the novels to the lectures directly, and it felt like analysis in conjunction was fairly shallow during sections.",
    "Strengths: Magaziner truly packs an incredible amount of material into this class while making lectures very engaging and thought provoking. The readings are really interesting because they're all novels, and you only have to read the supplemental readings that are actually on themes \/ countries that interest you, making you more engaged with the historical articles when you do choose to read them for the papers. Can't emphasize enough how interesting lectures are. Weaknesses: sections could have a LOT more structure",
    "Professor Magaziner is a highly engaging and dedicated lecturer, as well as a very helpful person to speak with.  In particular, he advocates an approach of \"radical ignorance\" in studying and writing history that locates atrocities while displacing them from Western standards of destiny and normalcy.  The course also benefited from its engagement with works of fiction from African authors as historical texts, and might have benefited even more from more extensive engagement with secondary (academic) sources to further contextualize the novels.  To be fair, my TF made sure to thoroughly contextualize the novels before each discussion.",
    "It was a very informative class, I just didnt understand sometimes how the books we read interacted with the lectures.",
    "Strengths: Magaziner is great! Content is very interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures jumped around a lot and sometimes it could be very confusing to follow (but I guess that is the point of the material--it is a very complex history)",
    "An amazing course! I learned and understood a history that usually goes unmentioned, and apply it to my understanding of global history. Professor Magaziner is one of the best lecturers at Yale, and the lectures were amazing. I think this year, there was a lack of communication between the TF's and the Professor in terms of the expectations on the assignments (i.e. how many outside sources were required, i.e.) but I think this could be easily fixed with establishing a clear example\/expectations of the assignments to be shared by the TF.",
    "I think that one of the unique and most meaningful aspects of the course, and the part that I most enjoyed, is being able to read a different African novel each week. It's so difficult to take a historical approach to analyzing each novel, but it is so rewarding. The papers were similarly much more challenging to write than I anticipated, but I found the process of writing them so enlightening, in a way that I haven't found other papers to be. And having the creative option for the second\/final essay was likewise a challenging but also very freeing experience to be able to express through a different medium all that I had learned throughout the course and the connections I made. The course lectures were incredibly engaging, and and at times, made me tear up as I learned about the injustices of colonial powers and realized how truly little I knew prior to this course about the African continent. However, I do wish that we had more specific and concrete facts or dates in lecture (and perhaps in supplementary readings). I oftentimes felt like we were learning about broad trends and stories, which is also valuable, but I think it sometimes made it difficult to draw our own connections (which I often feel is made by understanding details and observing patterns across these historical details).",
    "The assignments were quite confusing for me. I think I was mainly confused because there weren't clear expectations communicated about the papers and it'll be great to have Prof. Magaziner go over the assignments in class. \r\n\r\nFor the first paper, it was challenging to tie in two\/three novels, academic papers that were \"supplemental readings,\" and lecture notes, which necessitated  students to find broad themes that connected all three, but also write with a lot of depth and originality to the topic. \r\n\r\nFor the second, optional creative assignment, it wasn't clear what would be considered a \"good\" creative assignment and there seemed to be conflicting suggestions between the TAs and as the semester went on as well. It would really benefit the students if there were clear expectations announced on what the creative assignment should accomplish for the all students in class (not individually during office hours or section), so everyone's on the same page about what's being asked of them. \r\n\r\nThe lectures themselves were really great, but the unclear expectations surrounding the assignments made it really stressful.",
    "The lectures are interesting, and the themes of the course were well-taught. It is difficult to follow the timeline of events if you have never taken an African history class before.",
    "Strengths: great lecturer, interesting topics, learned a lot, light work, not difficult assignments, interesting novels\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes hard to keep straight historic throughlines of specific countries due to focus on regional trends",
    "Strengths: Magaziner's lecturing, discussion section being focused on the novels (since they're not addressed in lecture)\r\nWeaknesses: lecture sometimes felt disorganized but Magaziner is so eloquent that it didn't really ever bother me",
    "This class is generally fantastic, the novels are a joy to read and Dr. Magaziner is a very engaging lecturer. The class is very broad in its scope and this occasionally makes it difficult to understand\/contextualize the material.",
    "The workload is honestly rather high which of course is readily available information that I knew prior to taking the course. Perhaps picking shorter and slightly more impactful books as part of the syllabus would help. Please reconsider making students read The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born and King Solomon's mines.",
    "Lecture is super engaging and I looked forward to going everyday. The only weakness is you are expected to fully read an entire 170-300 page novel every week. I took the class credit D, so didn't engage with the novels as much as I liked, but if you have good time management, the novels are a good way to break up more dry forms of academic writing from your other courses.",
    "Weaknesses - it covered a lot of information in a short time period which became difficult to remember.",
    "The stregnths are the content and lectures. The weaknesses are the lack of conversation in section.",
    "Strengths: \r\n- didn't map a single narrative across the entire continent\r\n- engaged with art! I thought this was an important way to talk about the subject matter because art is so personally driven! (it was also a nice way to begin every class)\r\n- connected the past to the present day very well without shaming or discrediting African nations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- hard to follow along in lecture even with the outline\r\n- didn't engage with supplemental texts as much as I would have liked",
    "This course has no weaknesses that I can see. Its fantastic. Its strengths: the course topics are absolutely captivating, Professor Magaziner is a once-in-your-college-career quality lecturer, just truly, astonishingly good, the TFs are excellent, you read fascinating novels by African writers instead of a textbook, and the final assignment can be a creative project of your choice. What more could you ask for?",
    "The lectures were incredible and I enjoyed learning about history through literature. A way this might have been improved would be by making key supplemental readings mandatory, and by having the novel of the week be considered as part of the historical context in which it was written (for example, considering the political roles of Chinua Achebe and Ngugi wa Thiong'o, discussing Zimbabwean history as we read Nervous Conditions).",
    "I wouldve like some more assignments, and not just essays. Maybe a small writing after every two or three novels and a presentation or something of the sort twice.",
    "Enjoyed the lectures of the class as they were very engaging and gave interesting insight into the topics at hand. I also liked the format of analyzing history through the books of african literature. However, I felt as if these two parts of the class were disconnected. The section and the lecture often felt like two separate classes. It could be improved by incorporating more historical content into the weekly reading and discussing that during section, or by bringing the books into conversation during lecture more often.",
    "I think the main weakness is that while Professor Magaziner stresses the importance of NOT FLATTENING history, our work in discussion sections was often doing just that. By reading novels set in countries which we did not learn specifics on or spend a lot of time talking about, we often had to make gross generalizations in order to speak about the ways in which the novels related to reality \/ course material.",
    "The lectures are incredible, and I really enjoyed reading novels and discussing them in section. I appreciated how much material was covered, but at times it was a lot to take in, especially towards the end of the semester. I also wished a bit more of a preview for each novel and how it fit into the history covered was given in lecture.",
    "The readings and essays should not be on novels. Incredibly difficult to analyze for a history course.",
    "More time to read the books",
    "Strengths: Amazing lectures. Books were usually relevant to the course material and almost always really fun to read--much better than other materials. Writing assignments were challenging but relevant, and sections felt useful. Students were very engaged in the course, which made the learning experience much better.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could be improved with a few more guideposts: a couple words on the slide to indicate which heading the slide falls under, for example, and a few more specific references to the books in the lectures. Also, lectures sometimes felt a little too fast-paced: I understand that there was a lot of content to cover, but some of it got lost because of how much there was."

    "Yes! It's a great course for history and non-history majors alike, I think it's a good way to see if you're interested in the major. Magaziner is a great professor, take at least one class with him before you graduate. He's a really nuanced thinker, a phenomenal public speaker, and funny to beat.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone. Through African History, I have gained an understanding of History as a whole.",
    "I would. The lectures are very interesting and it is clear the Professor is knowledgeable of the subject.",
    "Yes! It's a great lecture and the workload is pretty chill, just a book and recommended readings each week. I would look at the recommended readings as they're a good help for the paper.",
    "very interesting, but very difficult to do all the reading",
    "Absolutely. One of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Yes absolutely! This is the type of class I would highly recommend taking regardless of whether or not you are explicitly interested in African history. The kind of thinking you do in this class is truly demonstrative of the thinking I consider the value of a Yale education, and I will look back on it as one of the classes that has made the biggest impression on me.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It really made me understand how little I know about Africa (a HUGE, complex, fascinating continent with so many different histories), and also some of the reasons why, and why that's messed up. Take it!!!!!!!!!!!!! It really made me want to take more classes about Africa and also made me recognize how it'd be very difficult to take classes about everything I want to learn more about in my short time here.",
    "I recommend the course to everyone, regardless of major.  In some sense, the course is a history of white supremacy as it was built through Euro-American domination of global markets and politics, and I consider it a productive first step in beginning to understand the full scope and depth of empire.",
    "It was a very informative class, but it might have been too broad.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but make sure that you have enough time to put in the work. You are basically reading a novel a week, and you pretty much have to do it to stay on track. I didn't like how the grading worked and it was very elusive, with a sign-in in lecture.",
    "Absolutely! If you are a student of history, this is really an essential understanding that you must have. If you're just interested in surveying a history course, this is also great to take  -- the assignments are not too hard, the readings are manageable, and the lectures are phenomenal. Definitely a must take!",
    "If youre prepared to do all the readings.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Magaziner is an incredibly passionate and engaging lecturer, and you come out of every reading and course assignment (two papers, one of which can be a creative option) with new insights and perspectives. The novels we read in the course are beautifully written and deeply moving. However, this class is not for the fainthearted -- while it is very fun and a different type of work to read novels for a history class, it is not easy; in fact, I found it incredibly difficult to take a historical approach to analyzing the novels and write essays putting these novels in conversation with one another. However, it is an incredibly rewarding and fun experience. I even took the class Cr\/D but found myself spending much more time on the class than some of my graded courses because it was so interesting and enjoyable. I would highly recommend it to any student willing to engage with the material and the course.",
    "Recommend it for the lectures, but the assignments are quite confusing.",
    "100%. This course will hone your academic skills such as critical thinking and writing, but most importantly it will open your eyes to the real history of colonialism that is not often taught.",
    "I would if someone wants to get a good introduction to African histories! The lectures and readings are great. That said, it's not really an ideal class to Credit\/D because you'll end up doing the same amount of work I think.  Section is painful to get through if people don't read.",
    "Yes; great introduction to Sub-Saharan Africa",
    "I would 100000% recommend this class! Magaziner is a BRILLIANT lecturer, reading a novel each week was a really refreshing change to my typical workload, the papers (we had a choice to either write 2 10-page, or write 1 10-page and do a creative project) were actually a joy to write, and I finally got an overview of Sub-Saharan African history (since colonialism, at least) which I feel is surprisingly hard to get at Yale.",
    "Absolutely, this class was a great experience and the format of reading novels was a unique spin that worked great",
    "DEFINITELY.",
    "Yes. This is an amazing class everyone interested in history should take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Magaziner really knows his stuff, has some great perspectives and knows how to tell history like a story. He is also witty and makes some hot-take jokes in lecture. Content is also amazing and the two essays aren't that bad (as long as you keep up with the novels!) Section was also very interesting since they were based on the novels.",
    "Yes! It is an important course in terms of its content and it forces you to challenge coloniality.",
    "Absolutely not. Awful class. Magaziner sees the world through a narrow lens and if you disagree with him, youll do poorly. He severely misunderstands international politics.",
    "Prof Magaziner is an incredible lecturer. I learned so much from every class, and the chance to read so many excellent novels was very exciting. This class is great even for people who don't think they're super in to history. I went into the class knowing almost nothing about African history, and although it would be impossible to cover anything in that much depth, I came away knowing so much more about the continent and the effects of colonialism.",
    "Definitely",
    "Yes! This course takes an amazing look into the affects of colonialism in a whole and nuanced way. Even for someone who is from an African background or is already familiar with the histories discussed in class, they will leave each lecture with a new perspective.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Its probably a tie for my favorite class ever between this and Con Law. Professor Magaziner is the best lecturer you will encounter at Yale. Make sure you grab a front row seat every class. The TFs are excellent, you read really fascinating novels, and you can essentially come up with anything as your final project (as long as it relates to the class materials). Its a blast, and youll learn so much. The only problem this course has is that is has to end someday.",
    "Absolutely, even if they have not taken a history course before and especially if so; fiction provides an unparalleled and exciting lens through which to understand history.",
    "Yes, I would. It was an interesting course that taught me histories I'd previously not known anything about. I feel like I now have a much greater understanding of how colonization impacted (and continues to impact) African states and peoples.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student as a thought-provoking way to learn about African history and the ways that history forms part of the present.",
    "Amazing class !",
    "Definitely, but only if they are prepared to read a novel each week. The class was very enjoyable and I loved being able to read about different countries in historical context and in fiction as well.",
    "Absolutely. It is a great way to become acquainted with literature from the African diaspora as well as learn a great deal about the colonial history of many African countries.",
    "Yes, definitely. Professor Magaziner is an amazing lecturer, and if you're interested in history in general and especially colonial history in Africa, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes, but be prepared for a lot of reading, especially for such a big lecture.",
    "Yes. Very interesting and tasking",
    "I would recommend this course almost without reservation. If you are prepared for reading (although not an insane amount, since the novels are a lot easier to read than textbooks, in my opinion!) and some writing (although again, only two papers), then you should 100% take this course. The lectures were an absolute joy to listen to. Sometimes I felt like I was frantically taking notes trying to keep up, but stress was alleviated when I remembered that I wasn't going to be tested on the minutiae of what we learned in class. If some facts or dates slipped by, or if a particular topic was hard to follow or less interesting, I didn't have to worry about learning all the details of that one. The nature of the class means that you can afford to focus on some topics more than others, which is great if you're interested in a particular facet of African history or of the discipline of history in general--I'm more interested in social history, for instance, and find rulers and politics and wars less interesting. It was so refreshing to get to take a course where we read novels as historical sources instead of as literary items. I definitely learned better this way, and I had a lot more fun. Professor Magaziner is an absolutely amazing lecturer, and although he can sometimes be tricky to pin down for office hours because of his schedule, he is extremely generous with his time and expertise when you do get a chance to speak to him. Don't pass up the chance to learn from this professor. If you know nothing about Africa, all the more reason to take this course. You probably have all kinds of biases and assumptions you didn't even realize you were holding (I certainly did), and while this class won't change all of them, it will certainly help you gain an understanding of Africa as a place with a rich history and complex social interactions, contrary to the stereotypes that paint it as a monolithic continent. This class will also directly address, at times, the origins of these stereotypes, and examine how Africa's history has contributed to its place in the world today. This was an absolutely invaluable course to gain a greater understanding of the world. I'm almost certainly not getting an A, but it was SO worth it."
