            "comments": [
                "Films selected by the professor are all fantastic, and lectures are engaging but can be a little long. Would suggest putting films in conversation with modern films or classics that we know.",
                "I thought this course was wonderfully developed and presented, I enjoyed all the movies and all the discussions. I wish it was a year long course that also covered topics like the development of feminism in Italy, the changing role of the church, anti-establishment sentiment",
                "This course thrives on the great class discussion and format; discussing a director, seeing their film, then discussing said film. I thought the division of the course into thematic units was also great.",
                "Strengths are the format of the syllabus and Prof. Marcus herself. I really like the structure where Tuesday's class is background on the time period/director, Wednesday screenings, followed by a lecture on Thursday about the film. Also, the order of the units makes a lot of sense chronologically and thematically. Prof. Marcus herself is the other main strength. She is so knowledgable, and so passionate about the subject that it's impossible not to care too.",
                "Professor Marcus is clearly passionate about what she's teaching, and I really enjoyed the numerous opportunities to participate in class and hear from classmates.",
                "Professor Marcus is a great lecturer and she gives ample opportunity to participate in class even though it is a lecture style class. The films we watched were carefully selected to allow us to get an overview of nearly 60 years of Italian filmmaking in one class. The four essays and exam are doable in terms of workload whilst allowing us to digest the material in great depth.",
                "strengths: fun films\r\nweaknesses: not so fun essays occassionally",
                "- Professor Marcus is great!\r\n- A lot of engaging films showing differen facets of Italian Cinema",
                "Maybe removing the final exam element of the class and leaving the grade to be decided by the four essays throughout the semester",
                "The lack of a discussion section is really a weakness for this course, it could really benefit from it. I just personally dont think 1-on-1s with a TF is enough to flesh out ideas for an essay, especially when the TF is in a time crunch to do the same with several other students.",
                "The syllabus was great and Professor Marcus is so knowledgeable about the material. The class could probably be a little bit shorter (maybe a 50 minute lecture instead of a 75 minute lecture), but I have no real complaints.",
                "Strengths: great films, great lectures. Well-organized. Cons: my paper grade stayed lower than I wanted even though I thought I incorporated the feedback. Class is sort of a gut in terms of work and content, but not in terms of getting an A.",
                "The course is strong in its syllabus and in its Professor and TFs.",
                "Professor Marcus is very kind but sometimes I would have rather she lectured and gave us more concrete knowledge or background on films or history as opposed to encouraging lots of student participation which it felt hard to engage with in a huge student lecture. Either the class should be a highly participation-based seminar or a large lecture where she does most of the talking. The in-between does not work as well.",
                "In general, the films are wonderful -- especially the first five or six. Some of the later films weren't quite as interesting. The course is a very basic introductory lecture, so if you're looking for something more advanced or in-depth, this course isn't for you. Personally, I didn't find the teaching style used in this course effective. It's a large lecture, but Professor Marcus asks for lots of student input. Sometimes this was valuable, but it often seemed to stall the momentum of the class and prevent our analysis from getting very far. The reading and writing assignments aren't very well structured -- the readings were almost never referenced in class, so there was no incentive to read them. Each of the four papers require you to write about 3 films in 5 pages, which obviously means it's difficult to make a sustained argument about any film in particular. Finally, four papers plus a final exam felt excessive for such a basic class.",
                "The films are all great and Marcus is an insightful lecturer. However, it is too much time spent in class. The lectures should each be 50 minutes, not 80. I would also urge her to reconsider her note taking policy, which forbids computer notes. I also felt that having a paper due a week before the final was a bit unnecessary and think it should be one or the other.",
                "This course is very engaging but is ultimately limited by its lecture style. I would have much preferred a seminar, but it is fantastic regardless.",
                "h",
                "Professor Marcus is definitely a strength of this course: she is very kind and passionate about the material. It was a bit off having a lecture with a participation component of the grade; however, as long as you participate a few times a week you will be fine. The only concern I had with this course was how little time there was to write each of the four papers (about 4 days). Aside from this, the course was wonderful.",
                "Definitely essay heavy course - I took for WR credit so that was difficult but understandable. Professor Marcus was great as was my TA. Felt I improved over the class.",
                "Only weakness: lecture could be more structured",
                "prof marcus is a great lecturer!",
                "Overall this course was fantastic. I think the class could be a little bit more efficient if the way we watched clips in class was more streamlined.",
                "Strengths: Great film selection and good historical context!",
                "Professor Marcus is an absolute treasure, so knowledgeable, kid and always helpful and available.",
                "Everything about the course was great, but I feel like the final exam wasn't a good final assessment and a final essay would've been better",
                "During class, it was often difficult to write everything down. There weren't provided notes on what the professor talked about, so you'd just be relying on your own notes, which mattered more for the final exam than for other parts of the course. That said, I enjoyed the films and discussions very much."

                "Absolutely! If you are interested in film, Italy, or anything in between, this class is great. The workload is light and the intellectual reward is still high. You watch some amazing movies and learn new ways of discussing them. For people without a background in film, the topics are still very approachable.",
                "Yes, it was an interesting adventure into the world of film.",

It was fun analyzing films together in class, and I really appreciated all the one-on-one support you could get in the class, whether that be to improve your writing, discuss films in more depth, or just talk about life.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any Yale student regardless of major. As an introductory style course, you will be surrounded by people who have more experience in film and people who are taking their first film class. As such, it is easy to speak your opinion in class and contribute to the discussion. Learning about Italian cinema gave me such a fresh perspective after being indoctrinated with decades of Hollywood throughout my life.",

If you can keep up with the movies and really put your head down when writing these essays it should be reasonable; if you need this class for a WR credit its probably one of the least intensive writing courses offered, but its still a good amount of writing for someone who doesnt write.",

                "Yes.",
                "good",
                "I would recommend this course to another students, especially if you are trying to find a relatively easy WR credit. This being said, the short turnaround for papers and the fact that there is also a final exam and weekly film screenings may not make this as light a workload as you might expect. This said, the course was really engaging and was really different from other courses offered at Yale. Professor Marcus is very passionate about the material!",

                "Tentatively. Professor Marcus is great and I found lectures (when I attended) to be helpful and interesting. There is little to no preparation or instruction on how to analyze films, what terminology to use (this learning must be done (on your own (http://filmanalysis.yctl.org/basic-terms/) or by her example). Participation is difficult since the class size is large and only about a dozen out of sixty people spoke which hampered discussion. Also I personally didn't enjoy many of the films although it was such a joy to watch them on the big screen in HQ.",
