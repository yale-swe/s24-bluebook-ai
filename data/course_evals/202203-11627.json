                "strengths: kind and caring, accessible professor and really helpful TFs, if you need help, they will help you. \r\nweaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: cool to see how some of this work relates and is seen in the real world/current events and topics. Weaknesses: psets were long and quite difficult. Also lectures often moved pretty fast and it was unclear at times what we were going to be covering.",
                "Could be improved by recording lectures. This significantly helps for revision prior to exams.",
                "I LOVED THIS COURSE! best econ course ever and one of my favorite classes at Yale! strength: professor Peters!!!! weaknesses: they should give students an introductory guide to excel so that they struggle less with excel questions. you learn so so much in this course and the professor is super super engaging despite the big class size and there's a feeling of class belonging. The course, with Peters, also lets you understand the connection of what we study to current events and it is the first course that made me appreciate economics fully and feel comfortable with it.",
                "The content of the problem sets and exams come out of nowhere even if you attend all the lectures and listen to the professor carefully. The lectures or sections do not teach anything that is relevant to the exams. For the exams, you just have to figure out things by yourself looking at past exams.",
                "Strength is when Professor Peters uses our models to explain real events. The biggest weakness was that the solutions never had the algebra worked out and it was sometimes hard to figure out the steps used to arrive at the correct answer.",
                "Peters is great",
                "Strengths: Professor Peters is a very good lecturer, especially considering how the class is a general econ class, which tend to have very boring lectures. The course is also very committed to showing how the dynamics you are learning about manifest in the real world which is great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Problem sets and tests are far more difficult than you may think when simply going to lecture. Often problem sets require some mathematical reasoning that is relatively bizarre and not taught in lecture.",
                "Professor Peters was engaged and excited about the material. The biggest issue with this class is that the problem sets and exams are way too difficult relative to what youre being taught in lecture. Last springs final averaged a 50%, our final will probably be similar. What is the point of making the exam so difficult that the average raw grade is an F? Arent you just failing to teach the material sufficiently well at that point?",
                "Professor Peters is an excellent instructor, and you should absolutely try to take the class with him. The course is much more manageable in terms of math compared with ECON 121 (which in my view was a lot more calculus, whereas this class is more algebra and at most taking a first order condition or two). This was one of the better required economics classes I've taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness was that we fell behind -- at some points nearly a full week behind -- the questions that problem sets were asking. This was a frustrating experience since we would have to do problems for the problem sets due on Wednesday with material that we were touching on only on Monday. I noticed that my learning and retention in the class dropped once we fell behind.\r\n\r\nAlso, problem sets don't really get graded...I thought that I would be getting more feedback on problem sets. This is fine in terms of grades -- it's easy to get 100s -- but takes a little more effort to figure out/understand what you got wrong.",
                "the exams were hard, the psets were too easy in comparison\r\nits a lot of work for no intellectual payoff or engagement\r\nwe got no feedback on exams and barely any feedback on psets.",
                "Strengths: semester is very logically laid out - I like how we build to the AD-AS. The TA's are great and all super competent, same with the peer tutors. The exams are difficult and required me to put in a lot of studying. The concepts in the class were very well explained. Also really like the incorporation of current news into the lectures - it motivates what we are learning!\r\nWeaknesses: the course moved at a slower rate than the psets and by the middle of the semester we were an entire week behind, and by the end almost 2 weeks. This meant that to know how to do any of the problem set you had to learn the material entirely on your own which led to a lot of confusion and then wasted time when I just had to sit through lectures of material I already knew because I had taught myself it the week before to do the pset. Luckily, the solution for next semester is easy, and since the course slowed down at the end (delaying the last pset by 2 weeks), we should have just done this once we started getting off track.\r\nSecond weakness is that the TA's didn't tell us which problems we got points off for on a problem set. Even when I went through and compared my pset to the solutions after, there were so many differences and I could not tell if some of my differences in wording / graphs were okay or that's where I got points off. So I could not learn at all from getting things wrong on the problem set which wasn't great.",
                "I felt like, compared to the introductory macroeconomics course, I learned a lot more applicable/relevant topics in this course. The lectures were mostly very engaging and the TFs were very helpful. I didn't like how there was kind of a disconnect between Problem Sets and lectures, though that could have been because we were running behind in lectures.",
                "Well taught intermediate macro course. By far biggest weakness is that the homeworks would be due before we learned the material in class which sucked.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were clear and engaging\r\nWeaknesses: Course lectures fell behind schedule, meaning that psets tested material we hadn't learned yet. Psets emphasized mathematical computation over economic theory. Exams featured overly complex models. We received little to no feedback on psets. Psets occasionally included concepts from micro without re-introducing them for students who had not seen them in a long time.",
                "See recommend section",
                "Strengths: learning\r\nWeaknesses: Exams are brutal",
                "Overall, it was a good course, and Prof. Peters is a good lecturer! The weaknesses of the course are that 1) the problem sets often had nothing to do with class (Excel busywork that taught us nothing or tedious derivations based on the fringes--not the fundamentals--of economics), 2) the exams didn't seem like they were testing us on what we'd spent time on (the exams tested us on whether we'd done the practice tests, not so much on whether we understood the actual material).",
                "This was a large lecture class so connections to the professor and TFs during sections were difficult, despite there being office hours; often at weird times of day, and very few before the midterm/final exams. The exams themselves were very difficult, and the p-sets were often ill timed compared to the material learned in lecture.",
                "Insightful and good focus on current news\r\nCan be impersonal at times",
                "Similar to most other core economics courses at Yale. Strength was that the professor was engaging and brought in relevant articles.",
                "good",
                "Strengths are the amount of resources to learn and weakness is ambiguity on what specific topic and math skills should be known .",
                "Professor Peters is a great lecturer that keeps the class engaged, especially when talking about current events and applying knowledge from class to what's happening now. The weaknesses of this course include the problem sets, which are too big of a jump from class in terms of material covered. The psets introduce new mathematical concepts that are almost impossible to complete by yourself. I'm a student athlete so it's extremely difficult for me to make it to multiple office hours, so the psets were a huge challenge each week.",
                "- the psets are soooo long and sometimes not really relevant to the material, just super mathy and time consuming\r\n- lectures were interesting, esp w current events added in",
                "Prof Peters is a clear lecturer who makes incredible, easy-to-follow slides. At times, the class moved a little slowly and some of the material was similar to ECON 116, so perhaps it could've been covered faster. The tests and problem sets are quite long and math-intensive. A small algebra mistake can cost you dearly.",
                "Section was unrelated to the weeks lecture and difficult to follow. I also wish there were more office hours. I think the problem sets could also have been a little more related to the lectures.",

They are sort of complementary to class and they help you understand the topics better.",

It is extremely relevant content that has made me feel empowered about my knowledge of the #1 most important issue to American voters this fall: inflation. I was so inspired at points in this course that I almost wanted to pursue an econ PhD. Prof Peters is the absolute best of the best. We are so lucky to be able to learn from him. There is so much help from the TA's. The course is challenging and required me to put in a lot of work, but I really enjoyed doing the problem sets and stretching my knowledge in the exams.",

                "Yeah it wasn't bad but hopefully the psets line up more with the material next time. Also there was wayyy too much pointless math.",
                "Only if you are a) required to take it or b) very interested in economics. Prof. Peters is a good lecturer, but the course was not well organized. The lectures fell behind the psets, which meant that we sometimes had to look ahead in the slides and teach ourselves material before it was introduced in class. This negatively affected my learning, as it made some psets guesswork rather than an opportunity to practice familiar concepts. The psets and exams also prioritized mathematical adeptness. They had extremely complex models to the point where even copying out a previous answer could be time consuming. Even if you had a strong grasp of the economic concepts, you could easily get lost in the excessive computation. Psets often had points deducted without an explanation, which made it difficult to learn from our mistakes.",
                "No. This class is required for the econ major. I would not recommend the econ major because intermediate macro and micro are that bad.  (I am a senior majoring in econ and this was my last econ class at Yale). Major in history instead.\r\n\r\nI believe that this class, in connection with its requirement for the econ major, will be partly responsible for the next financial crises. Why? The econ department does two damning things in my opinion 1) it funnels kids interested in the economy/business into finance, which may not be socially destructive itself, but the marginal value to society of a smart Yale kid going into finance is certainly much lower than that kid doing something else. 2) establishes \"math\" as the hurdle to being an econ major. At the same time this both pushes very smart but not quite as quantitative oriented kids away from being \"economists\" (I doubt Adam Smith's models were as math intensive as the two people on an island with two goods models in intermediate micro. Zero Adam Smith is required for the major), and in addition to dissuading non-math focused individuals, the math-modely way these classes are taught actively reduces students ability to think critically about the real world.\r\n\r\nEcon 122 teaches relatively complex (for me) models, which the first google result will summarize and then say \"this model is said to have almost no value in understanding real-life phenomena.\" Not only will no counter-points to the model be mentioned, but the basic assumptions that underly the model are ignored. This leads many to treat econ 122 as purely a math class. But as a means to understand world behavior, the curriculum I believe actively diminishes it it, erodes a healthy lens to evaluate world problems, and hurts the confidence of students to think independently. For example, the Solow model for capital growth, completely fails to predict what has been observed for 200 years. This is mentioned, yet briefly, and half the class is devoted to the model. The internet will say some of the models surrounding monetary policy, inflation, and short run phenomenon poorly predict reality, but they are so poorly taught that I don't even feel equipped to talk about them (will probably get A or A- in class). I only have a queasy feeling of a very specific way to understand these issues being shoved down my throat, but I am unable to contextualize this because there is absolutely zero emphasis on understanding the world. I think this intellectual dishonest and immoral.\r\n\r\nThat is potentially the biggest problem with this class and the econ department (at least how it is taught to undergrads). There is a callous disregard for the real world, which to me speaks to the growing irrelevance of econ departments and all of academia.\r\n\r\nWhen you listen to people working for macro hedge funds or professionals who really understand macro issues, this class leaves students unequipped to understand what they say or even try to contextualize it. There will be aspects that kind of sound familiar, but overall intermediate macro fails to provide a framework to understand the economy.\r\n\r\nThere is almost no history in required econ classes. There is no discussion of differing/evolution of economic thought in required classes. When elective classes teach these ideas, they get no departmental focus.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me the department is run by those who wish they were smart enough to be in the pure math.\r\n\r\nThis is not liberal arts. The economics department and Yale are failing to produce leaders who will understand the world. \r\n\r\nLastly, I will say I expect nothing to change. Some people are smart. However, as an institution, Yale, and a department, economics, they are incompetent, arrogant, and hopefully destined for failure.
