                "I practiced speaking in Spanish and also practiced some grammatical and writing things, but I didn't really learn that much more than what I had learned from  taking Spanish in high school I just practiced it more. We also read a lot of random things and watched a lot of kinda weird movies\/short films occasionally.",
                "I developed my ability to speak, understand, and write Spanish.  I also learned about cultures of hispanic countries around the world.",
                "I think the class does a good job at involving Spanish into everyday use while analyzing texts and the like.",
                "This course is mainly based on getting more comfortable with the use of language skills. It focuses primarily on reading, listening, and speaking at medium proficiency levels. Overall, the course assumes knowledge of the majority of Spanish grammar, most of the grammar work is review.",
                "Definitely helped me refine my Spanish fluency, and increased my level of proficiency.",
                "I learned a lot about how to navigate many conversation topics in Spanish concerning art, culture, and politics.",
                "Increased proficiency in the language by analyzing Spanish texts, films, works of art, etc. There's an emphasis on cultural skills as well as grammatical."

            "comments": [
                "I think that the biggest issue with Spanish 140 is that all of the sections have to take the same tests and assignments so and assignments so even though professor glenski might have wanted to do something different she couldn't and often did not know in advance what was actually on the tests so that was frustrating I also realize that most of the material for tests and stuff I had to practice outside of class and while we learned and practiced things inside of class I feel like having 4 days of class in person was not really useful to me and felt not connected to the assignments we had.",
                "There is a lot of speaking, which is good.  I also loved the cultural project towards the end of the semester.  It was fun to learn about a topic of my own choice and allowed me to engage with an aspect of hispanic culture.",
                "The main problem with the course is that the tests do not reflect material you learn in the course. A lot of the grammar is not taught or covered in the class. Another weakness is that the umbrella course does not have good communication with individual teachers. The students were constantly confused as a result and had no way of learning how to better succeed in the course.",
                "Strengths: The class is very discussion based, which gives you a great opportunity to work on your speaking skills every day in class. The content used to stimulate class discussions was far more interesting than expected for an L4 class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The main weakness of this course is the coordination between the Level 4 Spanish Umbrella and your particular professor and section. There was often miscommunication or a lack of information given to professors which negatively impacted the course. All of the exams and quizzes are written by the umbrella coordinator, but the content of them was never shared with individual professors. Many times when asking a professor about the content of an upcoming exam, you will hear a response \"I know as little as you do.\"",
                "Strength: professor was very clear with her expectations, was always open to questions. \r\n\r\nWeakness: not enough in-class time spent on grammar",
                "Strengths - the topics covered in class were interesting and the instructor was amazing! Professor Glenski was very good at working with the material she was given and engaging all students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Prior to all tests or exams, students were unaware of the material that would be covered exactly, as was the professor. The use of an umbrella course makes it difficult to study and disseminate clear information",
                "Because this course has an umbrella course it feels limited in how much the teacher can personalize the coursework. The main weakness of this course was that we never practiced grammar in class, which made a lot of students feel unsure about using the grammar since we never practiced with it. All of that said, I thought Profesora Glenski was fantastic."

It is nice to have a seminar class and see people If you like your  Classmates but having Spanish every morning at 9:25 AM hurts the soul.. I do think that if you want to learn Spanish then it's then taking 140 is a necessary evil to get to higher level classes that can be really cool however currently the way the class is set up you're mainly just do it A bunch of random grammar vocabulary and readings or films the That don't really feel connected.",
