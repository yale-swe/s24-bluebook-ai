                "Strengths: Kind instructor, well-taught, good study guide, straightforward exams, relatively quick grading and feedback.\r\nAreas for Improvement: It was difficult to find good images and they were sometimes labelled incorrectly, the slides were not always informative in helping with studying, and the exams would be the very class after we'd just learned the concepts (this one was likely due to it being a summer class).",
                "Strengths- Good science course to get your distributional requirement \r\nWeaknesses- Course was not that engaging",
                "The fast pace is both an advantage and a flaw. Having some graded take home papers in between could be helpful. There were some online ressources available but they didn't quite take the form of the final quizzes.",
                "Good outline of the class \r\nthe quiz picture cannot load sometimes",
                "The course was very informative. Every topic was covered on time. Professor Sargis even provided useful extra information. I was well informed about all the topics to be covered, the quiz dates and all the material was easily available.\r\nSometimes it was difficult to identify bones and their features in the pictorial form. The pictures were missing in some quizzes and we had to view them on our second device.",
                "Strengths of the course include that the images used for labeling the bones are very clearly defined which makes it easy to learn and remember them. In my opinion there were no weaknesses in the course - it was one of the best I've ever taken at Yale.",
                "On the third exam, there was super little time to study for (in my opinion) the hardest exam out of the four, but either way I think it was manageable. Professor Sargis just forgot to post the lecture before the day of the lecture so that's why it was really hard, I think."

I took this course expecting it to be a fairly easy science credit to take over the summer, but this could not have been further from the truth. Unless you are prepared to study for hours and hours memorizing bony features and muscle attachments of every bone in the human body for each exam, I would not recommend this course.",
