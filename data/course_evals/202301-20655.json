But problem sets are easy enough (while still helping to reinforce learning) that it doesn't feel like Kononov is trying to kill you. Take home exams are fantastic for the same reason.",

We also briefly touched on some more advanced ideas (universal properties, projective spaces, k-algebras) which usually only appear in later math courses, so it is cool to see the connections and applications to other areas of math.",
