            "comments": [
                "The amount of work towards the second to last week of the course was tremendous. I think the work could be spaced out better, but overall it was very good, no complaints.",
                "The main strength of this course comes form the sheer quantity of material. To keep up with the class, students need to do a lot of work, and thus their Chinese abilities improve dramatically. This is also a major weakness of the course, as for many students, they do not intend for a foreign language class to take up so much of their time at Yale and will often prioritize it lower than some of their other classes. There is no good way to improve this problem because at this level of Chinese class, the material will become more challenging for students. It is, however, very jarring at the start of the semester, how much more rigorous CHNS 153 is compared to CHNS 152. Possibly changing some of the curriculum for 152 or 153 would make the difference feel less dramatic.",
                "Strengths: very accessible professors, good lessons, great vibes\r\nWeaknesses: some of the curriculum is not very applicable to average conversation",
                "I feel like last semester, we did more actual learning of grammar in class  my professor would spend more time explaining terms and helping us understand them. I think that was more useful.",
                "Strength: I think that this course covers a variety of important topics and has many activities like essay writing, presentations, etc. I also like that a small class size encourages participation in class. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I feel like theres not too many speaking opportunities beyond answering questions in the class.",
                "Strength: Excellent feedback from xu laoshi on writing, especially when visiting office hours \r\nWeakness: Still too much focus on knowing how to handwrite as opposed to understanding and using new vocab.",
                "This course was incredibly fast paced, and while this was helpful in cramming a lot of different topics into the semester, it also made it difficult to have a good understanding of any concept. I struggled a lot trying to follow, and spent almost 70% of my semester workload on trying to manage this class."

                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in improving their Chinese language ability and have taken CHNS 152.",
                "Yes! If you liked 152, you'll like 153. Difficulty\/workload is comparable to the end of 152.",
                "If they want to learn more Chinese, then yes. I think it was beneficial, if at the least to keep my Chinese ability alive.",
                "Yes if you want to improve your Chinese and have fun at the same time.",
                "Yes! To continue learning important vocab",
                "Yes if youre interested in learning languages in college and wouldnt have the self-discipline to self-learn",
                "If someone is already decently fluent in conversational Chinese (as in lived in China for a few years), this course would be a perfect fit. However, if someone doesn't have a decent fluency in Mandarin already, this course would be very difficult."
