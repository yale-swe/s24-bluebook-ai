                "The lectures were very interesting with a good combination of topics being on slides and the professor writing on the board and going into more depth. There were many short videos mixed into the lectures showing how topics related to the real world or how they were studied. I loved learning more history in different lectures and then how the math relates. Overall from the engineering internship interviews I've had the topics in class relate a lot to it and I thought it was at a great class. The exams are very closely related to homework questions and there is nothing out of place with the questions. I thought the grading was fair. I went into the class expecting it to be extremely difficult and miserable and it ended up being my favorite class this semester!",
                "Strengths: efficient and understandable teaching (which made a complicated topic much more manageable). We had a couple of special lectures which were cool and showed us how we could apply what we learned to the real world.\r\nWeaknesses: Review sessions would've been nice before tests.",
                "strength: professor is decently engaging even though most of class is proofs that i spaced out during, you get to drop one of the midterms, psets are very doable and match the difficulty of exams\r\nweakness: fluid mechanics is hard obviously",
                "I think the format of 4 exams/drop the lowest score is the best for this course as the third exam is pretty tough as it covers a particularly challenging set of material, but splitting it into 3 doesn't really make sense, or at least it doesn't give enough opportunity (in my opinion) to really test your knowledge of all of the material.  4 exams is good because we will study for all of them and therefore solidify the material best but there's still enough leeway to score well overall if you did poorly on one.",
                "Lectures were very straightforward. Being able to supplement in person lecture with covid recordings made it easy to stay on top of the material.",
                "The course moves a little too fast for my personal opinion, but otherwise I thought it was great.",
                "I think it was fire course overall, good idea dropping lowest midterm",
                "Professor Smooke's lectures are pretty interesting, especially the interesting \"bonus\" content/lessons on some real-world applications of fluid mechanics concepts, such as various types of natural disasters, supersonic aircraft, and more. \r\nI think the lectures could be improved by focusing less on derivation, and more on the different iterations of each equation (how does each equation change under incompressible, inviscid, irrotational, adiabatic, etc flows?). Personally, I found that when 45 minutes or more were spent on derivations of fundamental fluids equations in lecture, I found it hard to follow, and had trouble figuring out how to apply these equations to the homework. A few more example problems in lecture would have been nice. I also think that 4 exams is a lot but if he continues with the policy of dropping the lowest exam score, then that would be more reasonable. I also think that it's a bit much to have problem sets due every single week, even exam weeks (especially when psets are only worth 20%). This made exam weeks for the course more stressful and took time away from studying for the midterms.",
                "I would like to see some more focus on applying this knowledge. I do like the theoretical basis but I would also like to deep dive into the industry problems that can be solved with the topic.",
                "I thought that all of the content was very tried and true, and I could tell that this class has been taught for many years. I did wish that I could access more resources on canvas, like perhaps the lecture slides. We got recordings from like 2020 which was nice but still. I thought that the problem sets were very good and helpful to gain the skills needed for exams. Perhaps maybe like a couple less psets, especially the ones you had to do over breaks.",
                "Very good course. I wish there was a bit more design and practical background knowledge of fluid systems taught, but if all courses were taught this quickly, rigorously, and thoroughly, we would all be better engineers.",
                "This course has way too many assignments, and the pace really picks up the further you move into the course. I think having lecture slides posted would be so much more helpful, as it was often difficult to take good notes on the lectures. I think that fewer psets would lead to better engagement, as there is rarely time to really dig in and understand a topic (having a pset on monday, exam on thursday, and pset the following monday 3+ times in the semester). The strength was that the real world examples used like natural disasters were interesting and told with excitement by Smooke.",
                "The strengths of this course is the lectures which are very complete, the homework which matches the lectures well, and mainly the testing structure which is 3-4 Unit Tests throughout the year replacing a final exam. This decreases the stress in the class as there is less material to study for each test.",
                "The material was well-paced and I think the structure of the course made sense except for the timing of the exams. They should have been more spread out and I still don't really get why the 4th exam was one week of classes after the 3rd.",
                "This course is reasonably paced with very fair, well-structured exams. Dr. Smooke is a very engaging lecturer; he dedicates a few lecturers each semester to explaining how real-world disasters occurred given fluid mechanics principles, which I really enjoyed. One improvement that could be made to this course would be not assigning a problem set over Thanksgiving break (having problem sets due during exam weeks was somewhat reasonable as this class has many exams, but having one over Thanksgiving was not).",
                "Prof. Smooke is a good, solid professor. He is experienced at teaching fluids. I appreciate that he posted the lecture videos after lectures so we could go back and review concepts we did not understand.",
                "This course is very organized. On Canvas, each week has a dedicated module which includes that week's problem set, asynchronous recorded lectures and practice exam problems, solutions and formula sheet if it's an exam week. There are three ULA office hours each week. Exams are closer and closer apart as the semester progresses. This course is fast paced, so one weakness is that if you fall behind, it can be difficult to catch up.",
                "the course was very well structured to go through the curriculum, and the videos were also very helpful to rewatch to solidify understanding.",
                "The lectures of this course are very well taught and organized, making them very easy to follow along to. For many of the equations, the derivations are also taught, which I think helps students better contextualize those equations. Additionally, plenty of real world examples are sprinkled throughout the lectures, which both makes the lectures very engaging and also gives students an idea of how the different phenomenons learned in class actually take place in the real world. I do not have a weakness of this course in mind."

Some problems sets can be long, and there are problem sets even on exam weeks but I thought it was a good class, maybe a high workload if a non engineering student. Guessing most people reading this need it for a major requirement so not much choice haha.",
                "I would recommend for anyone who needs to know the topic.",
                "Smooke is a chiller. Fluids definitely has some hard content, and the 4 exams (no final) makes it quite condensed, but the fact that theyre non cumulative and that the class is curved at the end makes it very reasonable. Hes a pretty good instructor; the content is explained clearly, and he always includes some fun side tangents or historical tidbits that are interesting. Sometimes the psets arent super correlated to the example problems he explains in class, but the textbook is very explanatory. Overall well organized course, pretty standard pset-exam engineering format, but probably could do with 3 instead of 4 exams.",

I also think it's not very challenging material (at least compared to BME?) so I'd recommend it even to those who aren't MechE",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course. There are a lot of exams, and a lot of psets, but the psets are not overly long and the exams are fairly mild. Dr. Smooke is also a very fun lecturer, and you will learn a lot in this course.",
