    "Very clear lectures, informative modules, and lab reports that help you learn the material.",
    "Strengths: Workload was very manageable, and the exams were fair. Weaknesses: Very harsh grading and the lectures were often very informative but dry.",
    "strengths: small class size, good hands on experience\r\nweaknesses: would like to receive powerpoints after each class",
    "This course is great! Couldve gotten more info on the final paper before it was assigned but besides that it was great"

    "This is probably a more interesting lab class than other ones offered here. Also it's in the morning which is nice if you have practices in the afternoons.",
    "Yes - if you're at all interested in neuroscience and hands-on experience, or really want a better understanding of action potentials, take this course.",
    "Yes absolutely.",
    "No, I wouldnt recommend this course unless the student was very interested in behavioral neuroscience.",
    "Yes, if students need a psychology lab course with a intimate class size.",
    "Yes!!",
    "I think that the content of the class is very interesting for anyone who is interested in behavioral neuroscience, but I would not recommend this class in general."
