                "In the first half of the course, I gained a broad understanding of the various engineering disciplines offered at Yale--general focus, potential careers, applications, and a specific focus in each that was expounded in labs and with homework. Throughout this process, we frequently used Arduino hardware and software, the Processing coding platform, and 3D printing. \r\nThe second half of the course allowed us to apply these skills to a real world project. In doing so, I furthered my knowledge on each of these fronts and learned about the difficulties of implementing them in actual use. I also learned much about the necessity of iterative design and the difficulty which comes with integrating a bunch of disparate parts into one functional system.",

Weekly assignments often involved coding using Processing and Arduino, which were not too difficult to learn for someone with no programming experience. There were also lectures that offered introductions to mechanical, biomedical, chemical, and environmental engineering topics. Additionally, I gained skills in data analysis, scientific experimentation, 3D printing, product design, and collaboration. For the second half of the course, we worked in small groups for our final project. The design projects taught me a lot about creating unique products that solve real-world problems and did a great job of integrating many of the topics we learned in class.",
                "I grew more comfortable working with arduinos, wiring, soldering, 3D printing, and was exposed to many different types of engineering. The last portion of the class is very project-based, which taught me a lot about prototyping, troubleshooting, and working with a team.",

All in all, because of the in-person aspect, I've gained so much new experience in hands-on work in the field of engineering.",

                "Coming in with little engineering experience, I was able to gain a lot of knowledge and skills from each discipline such as learning how to code. I also was able to learn a lot being in the CEID working on our project with the tools and machinery such as 3D printing, arduinos, and soldering.

These ranged from coding using Processing and Arduino, learning how to build simple electrical systems with an Arduino Kit, learning CAD design and using a 3D printer, and many more hands-on workshop skills such as soldering and wood-gluing.  Most remarkably, I got the chance to work through an actual real-world engineering problem and work with my team to come up with a solution! Through this, I also learned design thinking, iterative design, troubleshooting\/debugging techniques, and other project management adjacent skills.",

                "I think the greatest strength of this course is its grounding in what it's really like to be an engineer. The lectures were interesting, especially when our professors brought in experts in their fields to talk to us. However, the design challenge part of the course was what made absolutely incredible.  Rather than leaving our lectures and PSETS in the realm of theory, we immediately set out to apply them. Aside from furthering our knowledge, this was just an absolute blast--especially during a pandemic when we were often confined to our dorm rooms for class. Working with my teammates and pulling long hours in the CEID was awesome, and it was truly rewarding to watch it all come together. \r\nThat said, I think the course's greatest improvement could be made in some of the earlier lectures. While its obviously difficult to survey an entire branch of engineering in a total of 110 minutes, some of the topics we covered sometimes felt too niche within that broader context.",
                "Strengths: Gives a great introduction to engineering and then it get you interacting with the concepts you learned",
                "I really appreciated the hands-on parts of this course, and the project based assessment.",
                "The professors are incredibly intelligent and caring people, they devote a lot of time to this course and ensure that everyone is able to learn different concepts. A lot of time is spent in the CEID, which lets you get to know the space very well. Many opportunities for office hours and extra help, even when some of the homework assignments can get a bit challenging.",
                "The first half of the course is spent learning new topics in engineering each week. While the lectures were informative and easy to understand, they were not very interactive and sometimes got a little boring. Also, we did not have much homework that required us to directly apply the formulas\/principles learned in class, which gave me little motivation to pay attention in class. I thought we didn't spend enough time learning about some of the specific disciplines of engineering (BME, ChemE, EnvE) to actually get a grasp of what the field entails. Sometimes a whole unit would just be a guest lecturer from the field delivering a two-day presentation. I found that this class was better in helping me decide whether or not I wanted to do engineering, rather than figure out which engineering major I wanted to pursue.",
                "Strengths: Dean Vince + Professor Wilen are so, so kind and helpful! They always make time to help with our projects outside of class and spend hours making sure we have all the support we need. Taking the course also makes you really comfortable around the CEID (center for engineering, innovation, and design), which is so nice because it's probably one of the coolest resources at Yale. Finally, this class is very project-based (you get to work with real clients) and hands-on, which was especially refreshing during this largely virtual semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the lectures were less engaging if we didn't get to do as many hands-on components (ex. chemical engineering was less accessible compared to electrical engineering) but overall such a fun class!",
                "A major strength of this course was that we were able to incorporate everything we learned throughout the semester in the final project. I did not think there were any major weaknesses",
                "Strengths of this course included having guest lecturers that were able to give unique insight into their field and as well as just the project part of the course. It really gave a great experience even with Covid19 of the planning and design process and all the skills and knowledge we needed for projects were gained either through the lectures\/labs or from hands on learning during the project. I think the weakness of the experience with the course this semester was due to Covid-19, which made it harder for us to work with others in person because of social distancing.",
                "I think the lectures were not super great representations of each of the various fields of engineering, but overall a very enjoyable and fun class i looked forward to.",
                "Strengths definitely exceed the weaknesses of the course. The fact that you spend time with other students working on a real engineering project by tackling an existing problem makes ENAS 118 unique. If students were allowed to choose (or come up with) their own final project ideas, this would make the course even better.",
                "Strengths: The final team project and the in-person laboratory component. The final project takes a ton of time and effort, and in my case, I got so sucked into it that it felt like my day job and I ended up putting in tons of extra hours out of my own volition. But whatever you put into it matches what you get out of it--and it ended up being such a fulfilling and exciting learning experience. No matter what project you get assigned, you get to build something really cool and worthwhile, and you learn a ton of things along the way. In my case, I also found great friends in my teammates, which is an awesome plus. Similarly, the in-person laboratories are designed such that someone with ZERO programming or robotics or electronics experience (like me) can quickly and easily catch up and learn new skills. Working in the CEID was also just so much fun. Our professors were great and so, so devoted to us, our questions, and our projects. I found the assignments extremely manageable, especially in the weeks before starting the final project. The things they teach in the lectures are never graded\/tested, though some concepts get applied in the laboratory, and I think that was really conducive to focusing more on learning and absorbing instead of being stressed or pressured academically. I can't really think of any weaknesses; I loved this course a ton.",
                "I really enjoyed the project based portion of this course. It was very fun and satisfying to use the tools and lessons from the lectures and labs to work on a project from an actual client. I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone who has any interest in engineering.",
                "Strengths: there is incredible one-on-one support by Dean Vince and Dr Wilen. They are incredible. The class is also super hand-on and you get full access to the CEID. It teaches you a lot about all types fo engineering. \r\nWeaknesses: not really a weakness, but I would have liked if we could choose the final project we wanted to work on. there are no weaknesses to the course.",
                "Strengths: new topic every week with many different projects and assignments keeps the class exciting, amazing professors and facilities.\r\nWeaknesses: if you are brand new to engineering like I was, it can take a bit more time and effort to do the homework and learn how to code, and the homework can be very tedious, but the professors and TAs are great and you'll be fine if you put in the effort."

                "Even when we attended in-person lab, everyone still had to log on to the Zoom, which didn't really seem necessary. Other than that, the professors did a great job of mixing virtual and in-person styles of learning, and were always very conscious of our health and safety. Office hours was offered both in-person and online, which I found very helpful (especially during the second half of the course) and allowed for much more flexibility than most of my other classes.",
                "The socially distanced labs worked out great, and Dean Vince + Professor Wilen + TAs put in a lot of effort to be accommodating when some people couldn't be there in person. \r\n\r\nIt was a little bit difficult to work on projects in teams when we needed to all be six feet apart and when we had to leave campus early, but the professors handled it well and made sure that we were able to get everything done in the end.",
                "It was incredible that the professors and staff were able to incorporate such a big in-person part. I think the course truly demonstrated how in-person classes can be done during a pandemic.",
                "I think the adjustments made for COVID 19 were very well implemented. I do not think I missed a significant amount of information by listening to the lectures online but doing the labs in person was very important",
                "For the most part, the practices used for learning due to Covid19 were pretty successful. Virtually, breakout rooms were used whenever we needed smaller group discussions or when we needed to meet and work with our project teams. At the end of the semester, we were all able to present our projects through Zoom screen share. At the CEID, social distancing measures were strictly enforced.",
                "It was a little annoying not being able to work next to each other in the CEID and it was a little annoying not being able to go to the CEID 24\/7, but not unmanagable.",
                "The in-person lab and all the safety measures were an absolute success. Students could work in the CEID without posing risk to others by constantly sanitizing their hands, keeping distance, and sticking to adhering to the attendance limit.",
                "I think keeping the in-person laboratory component was essential to this course, and I feel that the professors managed it very responsibly, with proper social distancing, occupancy, and sanitation measures. Recording the lectures also allowed our classmate who was studying remotely to join us along practically every step of the way. The Zoom\/in-person hybrid office hours also worked really well, because the CEID usually wasn't too full at night, but it was also convenient enough to just hop on a Zoom and debug code using the share screen function. It was understandably difficult to work together as a team on our final projects in the lab while adhering to strict distancing guidelines, though I can't imagine any way around it. One thing that could be improved was communication between the teams and the professors, which usually just happened through email, but sometimes not all members would get the email or the email might not be opened in a timely manner which was difficult for time-sensitive things. I would suggest using a platform like Slack to have teams in different channels that professors could easily check and access while keeping all members on the same page.",
                "The instructors of this course were incredibly cautious and really careful with COVID-19. Although many of the classes were virtual, we were able to work on labs and our projects in person in the CEID. This of course, came with strict social distancing regulations. It was a little difficult to work on the same code or wiring as my team mates at times. After a while, however, you learn to just take turns or use a separate zoom call to look at someone else's computer screen.",
                "The in-person lab was super well organized and all of the covid safety measures were followed. I felt safe and was never concerned. The online lectures also ran very smoothly.",
                "I was one of the only people in my class taking this course remotely, but my professors and classmates were very accommodating. I watched recorded lectures and attended live zoom classes when I could. The professors mailed me engineering supplies and I was able to perform all lab activities remotely over zoom from my bedroom. Doing the final group project was tricky because of time zone differences and because I wasn't there in person to physically work on our prototype, which is something I was bummed about, but we made it work. It is possible to do this course remotely, but if you have the option to I highly recommend taking it in person instead."

If that sounds in any way appealing, take this class. Even if you have zero experience save a fascination with engineering movie montages, take this class. You will be taught everything you need to know and nothing quite captures the feeling of getting it all together in the end.  In the beginning of the semester, the problem sets are relatively short, and the latter half's work is just the design challenge.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in engineering as it is fun, interactive, and gives you an overall view of the various paths engineering can take you down.",
                "Absolutely. Great instructors, great course material, lots of hands-on experience.",
                "Yes! This class is so much fun and gives you insight into engineering at Yale. The professors put a lot of effort into making this course run as efficiently as possible. I was unsure if I wanted to pursue engineering, but after this course I am very motivated to continue with more engineering courses and spend time in the CEID.",
                "Yes!  This class is great for first-years who are unsure if they want to be an engineering major as opposed to a non-engineering science major. The workload is totally manageable, especially since the professors are super nice and always available for office hours. As long as you hand in the assignments on time and ask for help when you need it, this class is an easy A. The design projects in the second half of the semester were really fun and exciting. This class is also a great way to be introduced to the environment of the CEID and get to know some of the faculty there. Definitely unlike any other STEM class at Yale!",
                "Take this course if you're interested in engineering (or want to try it out I recommend this course to all my friends in an attempt to get them to switch over to engineering) and enjoy project-based learning. I feel like this course is especially beneficial if you want to pursue CS\/EE\/MechE just because those are the most accessible through the Center of Engineering, Innovation, and Design. \r\n\r\nProfessor Wilen and Dean Vince are incredible!! And you get to work with clients to develop a practical product, which is so rewarding. There's nothing like spending all afternoon in the CEID surrounded by 3D printers and people working on interesting projects.",
                "Yes - highly recommend it for any student interested in the applied sciences.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students no matter their major because I learned so many things that could applied to other work",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is great that it covers all of the engineering disciplines so it is a good course for anyone who is unsure about  engineering or which discipline they want to pursue.  The final project is a great way to put all the skills learned in the class to use.",
                "Yes, definitely. It was a very very enjoyable class and the work never felt tedious and annoying. It was a great exposure to engineering and good for those who do not have a lot of experience, giving them real projects to work on.",
                "If you are uncertain whether you want to become an engineer, take this course. If you are interested in entrepreneurship, take this course. If you want to learn the basic steps of  making real mechanisms, take this course.",
                "Absolutely! It's a great way to find out which engineering major is the best fit for you, but even if you don't end up deciding to major in engineering, it's a ton of tinkering and building fun with a lot of opportunity for hands-on learning. The earlier weeks have a very light workload, but once the final project starts, it's a pretty heavy commitment. In my team, we ended up spending more time than was probably called for because we were simply OBSESSED with our project, in the best way possible. And it ended up being my favorite class of my first semester at Yale. I wish I could take a class like this every year.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone who has any interest in engineering. This course taught me so much about design and the types of things that each engineering specialized in. Some of these concepts didn't stick the first time around, but by applying these skills in a project, I felt very accomplished and happy.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a lot of work, especially if don't have any prior robotics or CS experience. However, you learn so so much and it's extremely fun. Towards the middle of the semester, you start working on the final project with a real client and the topics of the projects range from medical to environmental devices. It is super fun. Towards the end of the semester, I stayed in the CEID the whole day every weekend, soldering wires, making holes, and putting screws. I learnt so many different skills in this course. In the end, I was able to put together and program an actual working device. This course showed me what engineering really is and that it can be super fun. I am beyond grateful I took this course and would take it over and over to anyone interested in innovation and making things.",
                "Absolutely! If you are at all interested in engineering, take this class! It gives a really good overview of the different engineering fields and presents it all in a very accessible way to even those who have no previous engineering experience. Plus, Vince and Larry are amazing professors to learn from!"
