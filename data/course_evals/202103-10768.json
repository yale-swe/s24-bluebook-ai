They are a weakness because it means you're writing a 3-page paper every week.\r\n\r\nStrengths: usually interesting readings, lots of discussion, final project with a lot of room to explore\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we could have addressed some of the problems that characterized a lot of the readings (i.e. racism, sexism, eurocentrism, etc.)",

The discussions were always fruitful and helped clarify some of the more difficult philosophical ideas encountered in the weekly readings.

However, if you are a Religious Studies major and this class doesn't fit into your junior year schedule, DEFINITELY rework your schedule and take this course. You do not want to be taking this during your senior year. It's too much.",
