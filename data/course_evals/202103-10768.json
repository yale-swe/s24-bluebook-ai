They are a strength because it means you HAVE to do the readings, so you're prepared for class and definitely prepared for the final paper. They are a weakness because it means you're writing a 3-page paper every week.\r\n\r\nStrengths: usually interesting readings, lots of discussion, final project with a lot of room to explore\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we could have addressed some of the problems that characterized a lot of the readings (i.e. racism, sexism, eurocentrism, etc.)",
                "The syllabus was well-organized and flowed logically through a variety of theories of ritual and religion in society. The discussions were always fruitful and helped clarify some of the more difficult philosophical ideas encountered in the weekly readings. I also appreciated the opportunity to receive frequent feedback on essays, which was useful in gauging comprehension of the weekly reading and main ideas of the course."

The readings take a lot of time, and you have to do all of them because you have to write the 500-750 word weekly reading responses every week. However, if you are a Religious Studies major and this class doesn't fit into your junior year schedule, DEFINITELY rework your schedule and take this course. You do not want to be taking this during your senior year. It's too much.",
