    "I feel that I gained a deep understanding of an area of study that is traditionally underserved, and that I got some really profound insights into the history and contemporary culture of the Spanish Caribbean.",
    "I learned about contemporary caribbean literature that reflects common social themes and issues",
    "I developed literature reading and analysis skills, and my Spanish language skills.",
    "I improved greatly in my abilities to comprehend both written and spoken Spanish, and I got better at writing about complex topics. \r\nI also gained a much more complex and nuanced perspective on the history and culture of the hispanic Caribbean and improved my understanding of race and identity.",
    "I learned an incredible amount of the Caribbean culture in general.",
    "This course was a good tasting of literature from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. This course also included historical information about the islands as well as cultural movements."

   "comments": [
    "I really loved this course. The readings were excellent and class was always super engaging. Really a tremendous Spanish seminar. One small suggestion would be to get to the more contemporary writers quicker. It felt like we could have spent a bit less time on Pals Matos and Guilln.",
    "Prof Anbal was such an engaging and interesting lecturer!",
    "This course has an amazing reading list.",
    "It was a great course, so interesting and you learn so much not only Spanish but also about Caribbean literature.",
    "This course provided covered a lot of readings, which provided a comprehensive sampling of Caribbean literature. This course also required that we attend a charla, which was a really cool part of the course. The only weakness is that there was only one essay at the end with an emphasis on tests throughout the course. I wish that there were also essays as writing shorter essays throughout the semester helps me wrestle with the text."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student who was already fairly comfortable with their Spanish abilities. The readings would definitely have been difficult for someone who wasn't already fairly fluent. But other than that, I would recommend this to anyone.",
    "Yes because it gives an interesting survey of contemporary literature coming out of the caribbean",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! It was a great experience.",
    "Prof. Gonzlez is such a great professor, he's so knowledgeable, approachable and warm that it makes this course amazing. The reading list is great and he is super helpful if you go to office hours.",
    "I would definitely recommend. I have never had such an understanding, kind, and knowledgable professor who teaches SO MUCH without stressing out students.",
    "This course is great for anyone who is interested in the Caribbean. There is a fair amount of reading, so if someone is looking to get their language credit and isn't actually excited about this literature, they might want to take a course with less work. However, I loved it!"
