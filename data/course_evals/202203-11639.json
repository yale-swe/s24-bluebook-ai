                "As hard and abstract as it is, I definitely learned a lot in this class, not only in Microeconomic Theory but in Mathematics as well. Beside what you'd expect in an advanced microeconomic theory course (e.g. abstract mechanism designs and a detailed analysis of different equilibria), this course taught me a lot about real analysis, constrained optimization, and basic topology. In the first week of class, you're already asked to prove sets are convex, closed, etc., which I had no clue how to do. If your only math experience is multivariable calculus (mine was linear algebra, discrete math, and multivariable), be ready to spend a lot of time reading extra material, specially on real analysis and Kuhn-Tucker conditions.",

Pareto efficiency: in 115 you draw a simple Pareto frontier, in 125 you solve a maximization problem to find the full set of Pareto efficient allocations. It's more of a math class than a traditional econ class.\r\n\r\nI learned how to solve utility maximization and profit maximization. Using optimization techniques, you get a general method for most economic problems. Be aware that the content is quite theoretical; you'll see variables more than numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in econ research, this course may be very helpful. If you're interested in applied econ or econ policy, do not take the class!",

                "Strenghts: small class (suffering together is a great bonding experience); professor is organized and posts many practice problems before exams (with solutions!); the TA (Davide Bordoli) literally saved my semester with his OH and sections; very in-depth and proof-based.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be more engaging or interactive  having a 5-minute break, for example, would be amazing, as most people's brains get overwhelmed by the immense amount of material covered in each lecture. Most people I talked to said their brain would \"stop working\" in the middle of the lecture, and the last 20 minutes usually contain the most important (and often complex) results, which the entire lecture has been building up for.",
                "This course was the definition of trauma bonding. We struggled through the material, but by god did we struggle together. I believe either a stronger math requirement or a simplification of course material would go a long way. The course was advertised as only needing a multivariable calculus course but knowledge of real analysis was needed often.",
                "Main gripe was with how notationally inconsistent everything was. The professor used different notation in lecture from the TA, who used different notation from the textbook, who used different notation from the lecture notes provided, and I think that made things unnecessarily confusing. Sometimes we would also jump straight into definitions and proofs without being given much of an economic intuition beforehand, which made it tricky to follow sometimes.",
                "Pros and cons of this course's mathematical approach: \r\n\r\nPro - you can generalize the results. Remember in 115 they always said a market was two people, or demand curves were linear? I did not enjoy the oversimplification, but in 125 you mostly get rid of the restrictions.\r\n\r\nCon - you're gonna be confused for some time before things start to click. That's simply the nature of this class, but it's an awesome feeling when you finally do understand something. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to study a lot of material on your own time, since the course is a little ambitious in terms of what it covers. The textbook can be more helpful than the lecture notes at times, but you should use both to get a strong understanding.",

                "Make sure you know what you are signing up for. This course goes over Advanced Microeconomic Theory, by Jehle and Reny, which is also used in many graduate and early doctorate programs. If you would like to see what a rigorous, proof-based treatment of intuitive notions from basic microeconomics looks like, definitely take this course. I learned so much in this course and would recommend it 100% for those considering a PhD in Economics (or Applied Math), but know what you're getting into. You will be using a lot of real analysis and optimization.",

                "I would recommend taking the course AFTER taking real analysis, not just multivariable calculus. Take it if you're on the mathy side or are interested in taking grad-level economics courses later. If you want more of an economic intuition, take 121 instead.",
                "I would recommend for people with lots of free time. If you're an econ major who feels like none of your classes have been challenging so far, just take this one!\r\n\r\nRecommend if you like math, no recommend otherwise. For self motivated students, you really can get a lot out of this class. However, if you like to skip lecture and cram before exams, please don't take this class. Not crammable.",
