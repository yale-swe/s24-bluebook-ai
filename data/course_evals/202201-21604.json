The teaching in the videos was unambiguous, in-depth, and easily understandable all at once. literally fantastic.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the time in class didn't always feel the most useful, mostly because I feel like I prefer to learn in the classroom than by watching videos on my own time.",
                "I think a cheat sheet on our tests wouldve been useful because there was a lot of information to memorize.",
                "I think classes could be made more engaging and interactive.",
                "Nice assignment schedule",
                "videos before class helped a lot, well organized",
                "The course material is excellent, but the way it was taught was pretty bad in my opinion. I wish that instead of watching explanatory videos in advance of the class we couldve had the class time for explanation of concepts and videos for practice problems. Instead, we were made to watch videos and class was a weird hybrid of review + practice which didnt help at all when approaching the PSets. Honestly the Ximera saved me for this class.",
                "One strength of the course is that there are many resources available to you to help you comprehend the course material. The online content, lecture, office hours, peer tutors, and many other forms of help are all available to students to help them do well in the course.",
                "Having problem sets due the same week as an exam was a huge weakness. Although the material of these problem sets was relevant to the exams and therefore helpful to study, the timing could have been better. I think it's an issue of course organization.\r\n\r\nA huge strength of the class are the peer tutors. Emily in particular was incredible at filling in the gaps in my learning and helping me fully comprehend concepts.",
                "Strengths: this course provides a good overview of the concepts, which are essential for more complex courses in math and physics. I enjoyed having a smaller class size, which made it easier to ask questions and interact with my professor. Personally knowing my professor from classes made me feel much more comfortable attending office hours and asking for help. Although the problem sets are generally more complex than examples reviewed from class, they follow directly from what was done, which I enjoyed. I liked the chance to expand on what I learned from class in problem sets and appreciated that they were also easier than the exams, which were fairly straightforward (so that if one understood the problem sets well, they could succeed on exams). Weaknesses: although this course does teach all the necessary concepts, it is overall poorly designed. In the case of my section, I watched lecture videos or read the textbook prior to class, only to relearn the concepts in class and\/or review many redundant examples. Overall, I had to spend many hours inside and outside of class learning (and relearning) topics that were not particularly challenging. The class is overall effective in teaching but could be improved by removing some of the redundancies--lessening the work that must be done outside of the class and including more teaching (and less examples) inside of the classroom. The workload of the problem sets were fine, and I did enjoy completing them. It was just the pre-class work that was more tedious and unnecessary."
