                "I liked the different places and various assignment but I I wish there was more communication on what the assignments were. It became a little confusing towards midway crit.",
                "Strengths: good crit feedback, color mixing help\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not very much outdoor painting, disorganized scheduling, supplies (canvases especially) not always provided",
                "high: lots of opportunity to paint, improve technical skills, interacting with peers low: not a lot of support from teachers outside of class, lots of work",
                "Strength : a lot of time painting. The TA, Bryan Sanchez, was also wonderful\r\nWeakness : not enough class time",
                "Weaknesses: I believe the structure of the on site painting classes could be greatly improved. In the first few weeks of the course, when it was sunny and warm outside, we stayed in class and did indoor observational paintings. Then, when it started getting colder and colder, we did on-site observational paintings. This was really tough, as your body gets really cold after painting for 4 hours outside in cold weather, no matter how many layers I put on. I definitely think the on site observational paintings should DEFINITELY be done at the beginning of the semester, and do more in class observational paintings in the winter months. I also believe there should be a 15-30 minute break in the middle of class, as the 4 hour long period is really long and tiring.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Lots of different prompts for painting. Wish we did more nature painting, however, and less building-based painting.",
                "Strengths: having time to paint, working and exploring with gesso and surfaces, mixing colors \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could have a stronger prompt/theme throughout - or less, but right now it feels sort of muddled in the middle",
                "I enjoyed the outdoor painting sessions and various subjects we were challenged with, but I felt that a lot of the assignments were too tightly structured. We didnt really go over many painting techniques in the name of not being too prescriptive in an advanced class (which is fine and makes sense) but then a lot out assignments had such strict rules that it felt like a basic painting class. I found myself a little frustrated with that.\r\nAnother note, I felt that the critique time distribution was a little unfair. Certain students in the class consistently went at the very beginning or end and thus got less feedback if people were late or if class ended mid crit.",
                "In terms of strengths, I appreciated the freedom we had with the final assignment as well as the classes we spent learning how to stretch and gesso canvasses, especially because these are skills I will take with me for the rest of my life. In terms of weaknesses, student participation decreased significantly over the course of the semester, and I feel as though student engagement was low in general by the end.",
                "Art courses like this one would really benefit from having more supplies available, in this case paint (we only had acrylics, and oil could have been a great addition)"

                "Yes",
                "Probably not. The course was not structured in a way that encouraged synergy between the professor and students. Live feedback was never given during the creation process, and a majority of the work took place outside of class. The homework workload was intense and assignments were often not communicated clearly to the class. Scheduling was also confusing: our final homework crit was pushed up a week without warning, making it impossible for many to complete everything. Less outdoor painting happened than what was advertised. Little instruction in painting was given, we were exposed to the most new information during Mona Brody's guest workshop. The TA was fantastic though and gave great insight.",
                "yes! a wonderful class for painting and learning about architectural painting, painting outside",
                "Yes. I especially would recommend the TA, Bryan Sanchez. He was very helpful and responsive and a great educator.",
                "Yes, BUT only if they change the order of on-site paintings. It was really unpleasant to paint outdoors in cold weather and I had a really hard time enjoying those classes. However, if this changes, I believe this course was good for students who like painting.",
                "yes! lots of fun, but very time consuming.",
                "Yes, for those who want time to paint and work on a larger final project!",
                "I think it depends on what they want. If they enjoy painting and dont have a consistent practice but want to start a routine, this would be a great fit. But as someone who already regularly draws and paints, I felt constrained with the assignments.",
                "I definitely would, especially if you want an excuse to paint during the semester. Although I often rushed some homework assignments outside of class, it felt good to dedicate four hours every week to painting and creating. Although it's easy to not show up, I urge you to go and, regardless of the essays or exams you have coming up in other classes, enjoy those four hours that past you set aside for yourself. I had almost never used acrylic before this class, but it felt so freeing to layer and relayer and not worry about how perfectly an image was blended because the more mistakes meant more layers which meant a fuller image.",
                "This is a wonderful course for students who already have some familiarity with painting and would like to challenge themselves to improve observational skills, and learn more about painting materials (brushes, paints, manipulating them) and working on different surfaces"
