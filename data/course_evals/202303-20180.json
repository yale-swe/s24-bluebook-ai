                "I learned so much about the science of the climate and of climate change! Especially in a time in which science is so highly debated, I think it's important for everyone to have some basic scientific literacy in contentious topics. Before taking this class, the only thing I could say to refute claims that climate change isn't real was \"97% of scientists agree.\" Now I know all about climate models and why the wind blows like it does and what's making the sea levels rise. This is a science credit that you'll actually use in your daily life if you're not a STEM major.",
                "I learned a great deal about the science behind anthropogenic climate change and its socioeconomic and cultural impacts. I learned about some of the landmark policy decisions, past and current, that shape our mitigation of the climate change crisis.",

                "This class provided an excellent survey of global climate change. I learned the historical context critical for understanding the contemporary changes. This class also provided an overview of some of the specific scientific processes at play, without drowning lectures in obscure details. We covered the recent history of addressing climate change and covered current events at the beginning of each class.",

                "A deeper understanding of the problems that our world faces, both in combating climate change and surviving it.\r\n\r\nAlso, it teaches you how to understand scientific papers (a good skill, even if you're a humanities-centered student).",
                "This class was extremely robust in an extremely vital way. A range of topics were covered, all from a very beginner perspective so that it was friendly to people who weren't extremely well-versed in the exact science behind climate change. I feel very comfortable explaining to other people what I learned in this class.",

It explained the basic workings of the Earth and related them directly to climate and how it can change thereafter. I now feel confident explaining often talked about climate phenomena and how they are linked to change. Moreover, the policy aspect taught me lots about how politics interact with this science.",

                "strengths: mary louise is very passionate about her work and wants us to learn. she does experiments to keep us engaged and teaches at a pace we can all understand\r\n\r\nweakness: noah. noah is rude, condescending, and teaches with the goal of making you feel dumb. he consistently tries to prove to us that he is smarter than us and he should be because he is the professor and we are students! hated every class that he taught.",
                "more structure, better notes and slides and a more specific framework. at present, everything blends into one.",
                "Strengths: covered a lot of topic in an easy to understand way, the weekly writing assignments were also a great way to practice a bit of academic writing without being overwhelming and engaging with content outside of class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the exams DO have trick questions, and they weigh a lot of the grade, I don't feel like overall grade in the class represents my understanding of the content.",
                "The course and course material were great! I learned a lot about climate change, and the assignments all felt worthwhile. Both the instructors were pretty nice and very knowledgeable. I can't think of any major weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: The weekly writing assignments. I feel like that was where I learned the most about the topic, and it was nice having a bunch of low-pressure, fairly straight forward assignments take up such a large chunk of our grade. Definitely took the pressure off a little bit for the two exams. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't love that the exams were multiple choice and kind of nit picky. I think the students that went every day to the lecture would have been better served at displaying their knowledge through more of the written, short answer questions and less questions asking, for example, what degrees of celcius a specific volcanic eruption lowered the earth's temperature. At that point, it's luck if you remember the exact number.",
                "I thought that Noah's slides were sometimes unclear. If they had more text it would have been helpful. Other than that, I thought the course was excellent. Both professors were super invested in the subject material (which makes sense, since climate change is an existential crisis).",
                "Strengths: This class instills students with a terrific overview of climate history and contemporary solutions. I appreciated how this class engaged by STEM and non-STEM majors, emphasizing the relevance of course material on our present and future lives. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lecture slides are a bit convoluted. Midterm and exam questions nitpicked random statistics from lecture that had not been key concepts from the semester.",
                "This course is incredibly unorganized and would benefit from slides that are more concise or perhaps materials that can supplement the slides to help student learning.",
                "This course could be structured much better. TF grading is very inconsistent throughout the class papers with some grading extremely harsh. None of the class slides have any words on them so without attending lecture (and even then) there is no way to go back and review concepts you don't understand. The professors speed run through complicated topics trying to cram lots of information in a 1 hour 50 minute class but neither take the time to slowly unpack the concepts. The professors tell you there are no trick questions on the exams but this is not true, some questions are oddly specific and barely touched on throughout lectures which is unfortunate given the exams are a huge chunk of your grade.",
                "Strengths: breaking down key climate concepts into the science and policy influences.\r\nWeaknesses: the dual-taught design meant class content could at times be better organised.",
                "Having two professors who ran on different schedules made some weeks fairly awkward, as the assignments wouldn't match up with the lectures, or the lectures were given out of order.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, both professors were incredibly engaging, and just lacked a class that was willing to engage with them back.",
                "I think a major weakness is the way the exam was written. A lot of the questions required memorization, which I do not think is an accurate measure of the way someone has learned material. And a lot of the time it was the most obscure arbitrary information (like a date or specific number of tons) that was said once in class, but it is ok to be tested on, because it was said in class. This is unfair. \r\nOther than that, the material was engaging and I enjoyed coming to class twice a week.",
                "Strengths: accessible for students with any background and interests.",
                "Honestly I learned a lot more about climate change than I thought it would. This course covers an array of topics but is taught in a way that you leave with the biggest takeaways. It can be hard to adjust to two different teaching styles but taking notes and looking back on the slides is very helpful.",
                "Strengths: Mary Louise's lectures, Noah's assignments, weekly assignments were usually very manageable and at least somewhat interesting\r\nWeaknesses: Noah's lectures, because the course is co-taught the assignments were sometimes out-of-synch with the lectures and some topics were covered twice, lectures in general could be kind of boring and tough to sit through",
                "Test are direct correlation to slides. Assignments take 1-2 hrs",
                "The professors are very knowledgable about their specific fields but the course lacks a clear direction. The topics weren't presented in a cohesive way. Also, every few weeks, the professors would switch which meant students had to keep adjusting to the different teaching styles. I think that the concepts in the course could be rearranged so that they build on top of one another. Also, the professors could communicate more about the topics that they were covering because some things were repeated.",
                "I appreciated that this course covered so many topics in climate change, but it often felt disjointed and random, lacking continuity between lectures. Additionally, I found many lectures to be repetitive of the same very simple, basic concepts, such as climate change disproportionately affects those who did not cause it. While this is extremely important to be aware of, I felt that our time could have been spent learning more rather than repeating this.",
                "The grading of the course was very relaxed and TAs proved useful if you needed support throughout. However, the two lecturers instruct very differently, not necessarily in a bad way, but it felt that sometimes communication between them wasn't clear. Moreover, at times the 75 minute lecture dragged out a lot but if you keep attentive, this course is engaging. That being said, I did enjoy having the different perspectives from the 2 instructors.",
                "I enjoyed how the course both had a very contemporary outlook with a focus on the COP conference, whilst giving a wider historical perspective and teaching us about historical phenomenon such as the Younger Dryas.",
                "Strengths: lecture class; professors are nice and care about the topic. Weaknesses: boring if you aren't interested in the topic and confusing at times when you do not already know some of the lingo around climate change.",
                "Good introductory-level course, imparted important concepts with a not-TOO-heavy workload.",
                "Would have enjoyed a touch deeper understanding of the science. Maybe a pset would;ve been nice??",
                "strengths: the earth science portions\r\nweaknesses: the generalizations and overarching statistics without a deeper meaning seemed like it wasn't worth the time",
                "Despite what the instructors said, the exams were full of trick questions and questions that focused on minute details rather than larger picture things. Grading on the reading responses was subjective. I liked it when we talked about the political and social implications of climate change.",
                "Strengths: good spread of topics, engaging at times\r\nWeaknesses: some concepts required more STEM background than others to fully understand, making some students more confused than others. lectures were sometimes also very repetitive, especially when talking about the effects of climate change.",
                "The assignments were graded very harshly.",
                "Great teaching and engaging professors, but sometimes challenging assignments.",
                "Strengths were Mary Louise she was a great and patient instructor and honestly all the slides for the entire semester were really easy to follow and very beautiful which honestly is not common in stem classes I've taken so far. Weaknesses are the homework assignments which feel like busy work and don't really seem to give much insight into what would end up on exams. It was also fairly difficult to meet people int he class or get prompt help if you had questions about the homework.",
                "Strengths: breadth of information, live experiments, very different homework assignments, authentic professors\r\nWeaknesses: organization, not very resourceful (considering that the majority of class learning is in lecture, they often forget to release the slides. they also don't do study guides or potential test questions.)"

I have a much greater understanding of how both weather and climate work from taking this class, and I feel like I've gained knowledge that will be useful to me on a daily basis. (That's the best you can hope for when you're a non-STEM major taking a science class.) It's not a total gutthe exams are fair but not easybut it's not too difficult either. The workload is pretty low, and if you have a good science intuition you'll understand the content easily. (If you're like me and you don't, taking the class with a friend will help a lot!) Taking this class was definitely worthwhile.",

Both exams were not difficult whatsoever, as long as you attended lectures and studied. The course is especially manageable if you took APES in high school or equivalent, even if not, great course for an SC credit or someone who needs it for a major. It's also nice because the content of the course is actually relevant to life.",
                "I may recommend this course to a student who lacks all knowledge about climate change. However, I do not think much would be learned by a student who already has a basic understanding of the climate and keeps up to date on the news.",
                "If you need a science credit, this course is great even if you don't have a strong background in high-school science.

Regardless though, if you want to know more about climate change, this is a great place to start.",
