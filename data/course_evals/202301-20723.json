                "Yes, I would! I had a great time learning under Professor Burns. They were really understanding and encouraging, and really pushed us to think outside the box. This is a class that I didn't need for my major, but it gave me a new perspective on different materials and allowed me to think in a new way. I also really appreciated the feedback and encouragement given by our TA Younes!",
                "Would definitely recommend!! This is the first art class I have taken at Yale and it did not disappoint. Despite the different backgrounds and skillsets of students in the class everyone benefitted."
