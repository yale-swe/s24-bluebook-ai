    "Amazing professor and TA\r\nGood pace of learning",
    "This course could be improved by teaching more vocabulary. Because we have learned so much grammar, making the class more vocabulary-heavy would allow for more practice in Bahasa Indonesia.",
    "Strengths: fun and interesting class! I enjoy coming to class and the language is very well taught. I learn a lot and the review sessions before tests are very helpful. Amazing prof and TAs. \r\nWeaknesses: Grading is uncertain, some assignments left ungraded",
    "I think there are many strengths in that it goes at a good pace to allow students to learn a lot of information but not feel as if they are swamped by information.",
    "Strength: Instructors are enthusiastic and have a passion for teaching. They make learning this wonderful language enjoyable, fun, and interactive.\r\n\r\nWeakness: NONE",
    "Great interactive course that effectively facilitates learning",
    "good, not too much work given. weakness - to many tests at the end of the semester",
    "Strengths: great tempo of course, had fun while learning, great learning environment\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes did not know what exactly would he on tests",
    "The course was interactive and easy to follow along. It did not follow the format of a traditional language course, but I found that by the end of the semester I knew more Indonesian that I was expecting.",
    "Strengths are the welcoming and encouraging staff.\r\nWeaknesses may include the lack of structure when teaching grammar.",
    "The weaknesses are the lack of use of canvas. The strengths are that the course is super engaging.",
    "NO weaknesses"

    "Yes definitely",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. You will learn A LOT, and the faculty lineup is excellent.",
    "YES! Focuses on culture AND language, which is great bc most language classes at Yale are very difficult and language intensive. Focusing on both allows for a very comfortable pace and helps you learn more. Very fun class, which is necessary since you have to go to class everyday. Pak Indriyo is awesome. Low workload and you'll do well as long as you show up and study for tests.",
