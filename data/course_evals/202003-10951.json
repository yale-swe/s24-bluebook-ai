                "Strengths: office hours were really helpful, analyzed some interesting data sets. Grades were released very consistently\/class felt very organized overall. Found class exercises to be helpful with psets. Professor gave good, personal feedback on homework, which I appreciated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: live lectures didn't have slides, so sometimes it felt like I was just being talked at (professor would lecture with no slides) -- thus really easy to zone out. I wish the solutions to the class exercises would be released, so we could use those to help with the psets (just the grade sometimes didn't help). I also found the take-home midterm to be way too long (and the questions themselves repetitive) given the amount of time we were allotted. Additionally, the majority of the midterm was on content we hadn't finished a class exercise or pset on yet, so we had no idea (i.e. no grade) if what we were doing was right, since we didn't practice it beforehand. I also felt like some of the psets were unnecessarily long\/tedious.\r\n\r\nOverall, found this class interesting, but it felt more like an R class for linguistics students rather than a linguistics elective for people who already knew some R and were hoping to learn more about linguistic concepts.",
                "Strengths: Professor Sanker is easy to reach over email and in office hours, coursework was graded very quickly and fairly, feedback was thorough and helpful\r\nWeaknesses: The live virtual lectures were quite dry, I wish the course had spent more time on explaining exactly how R works instead of providing commands to copy and paste into the program.",
                "The final exam was absurdly long and repetitive. We had four datasets and, although each one had different properties and involved different linguistics topics, the analysis used was really similar and ended up being tedious and frustrating. It often felt like some of our assignments followed a similar pattern  longer than they needed to be, with ambiguous questions and the need to explain our results in terms of linguistics concepts we did not have a solid grasp on. I think a lot of students were quite stressed because we were made to do an in-class exercise during finals period, had a long assignment due that week Thursday, and then an extremely long final exam due five days later. It felt like there was too much going on during that time to focus on any one thing.\r\n\r\nHowever, some of the strengths of this class were that the professor pre-recorded our lectures in a very straightforward, organized format with slides to go with them. Her slides, R commands notes, and other cheat-sheets were always useful when working on assignments or in class. It also felt like the in-class exercises, despite being extra work on top of the recorded lectures, were helpful for practicing new concepts with the help of our TF and professor. \r\n\r\nA really great part of this class and professor was that we received detailed, careful feedback on every one of our assignments. Given how long many of these were, it was impressive that the professor\/TF was able to do this for us. Their feedback was specific and often quite helpful for later assignments. It definitely showed how much the professor cared about the material!",
                "Interesting readings! Lecture slides would be helpful during the live lectures.  More basic introduction to R itself, and not just statistics, would have helped me-- some knowledge of programming seemed to be presumed even though the syllabus said it wasn't.",
                "really no weaknesses. lectures could perhaps be slightly more engaging, but virtual format is likely at fault.",
                "Great course to gain additional exposure to linguistics concepts and pacing and material covered felt very conducive to learning many important foundational concepts in S&DS in an applied setting. Sometimes felt the recorded and live lectures heavily overlapped in content and that both were not necessary.  Workload is manageable but it is easy to lose points on the psets since the things asked in the questions are not everything necessary to receive full credit.",
                "The lectures were very dry and did not have any presentations to accompany them which made them even more difficult to follow.",
                "I definitely learned a lot, but this was because the homeworks and take-home exams were extremely tedious and essentially asked for the same statistical questions over and over again. The midterm mostly sucked as well, because we were expected to use a form of statistical analysis that we had never gotten explicit examples of interpretation nor gotten feedback on. However, grading in the class overall was very fair. The breakout rooms every week were also lowkey painful, although I think that's more attributed to online classes than the fault of the class.",
                "The online lectures were great! They were clear, concise, and helpful (especially the slides). The live virtual lectures were very hard to follow; it would help to have slides that clearly delineate the concept being explained. Or, it would also be helpful to turn the lecture time into another sort of Q&A session or office hours, so people could get more help.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Provides a solid introduction to data analysis\r\n- Lots of hands-on work with analyzing real experimental data from linguistics papers\r\n- Professor and TA were extremely helpful during class and gave great feedback on all assignments\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Course was more of a \"statistics for linguistics majors\" one than a \"linguistics for statistics majors\" one",
                "Strengths: smooth integration of linguistics topics with statistical methods, materials kept track of well, good feedback\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: poor\/ineffective use of materials (like textbooks\/papers), \"throw into the deep end\" feeling with R exercises and homeworks",
                "Overall, this is a good course. Problem sets and exams are fair and the material is interesting. One improvement I'd suggest is to also make announcements on Canvas instead of just on the not recorded lecture meetings. Sometimes it's easy to miss important announcements and due dates and it would be nice to not have to bother Professor Sanker or our TF for simple questions like 'when will the take-home midterm be released?'"

It was as if we were meeting just to say we had. \r\n\r\nBut the in-class exercises, especially as they were just graded for credit not accuracy, were helpful for practicing new concepts and getting live feedback from the TF or professor.
