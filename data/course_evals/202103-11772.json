                "Practice creative writing across a variety of genres and styles.",
                "This course offers so much. It's an introduction to writing fiction, poetry, and drama, but it's also just a great course about writing, revision, and reading. You read lots of short pieces so there is such a variety of writing to emulate and build from. The course includes plenty of workshops that help both the person being workshopped and everyone involved. I gained such a wealth of knowledge from both classmates and the professor.",
                "I came into this course with a pretty solid foundation in the English major but pretty much zilch in terms of creative writing experience. I think a lot of the learning in this class came from excellent feedback. I learned to be a better editor of my own writing, and to read for craft. Everything from developing voice in a story to how to break a line in a poem. I feel like I am coming out of the semester as a much stronger writer of fiction and poetry, and a more attentive reader as well. Another important skill was learning how to be a helpful and kind reader of classmates' work.",
                "I read a lot of amazing pieces of creative writing, and refined my own writing and editing skills.",
                "I loved the discussions we had about strategies and they offered great insight to the aspects that we should work on or experiment with. We hit so many areas of creative writing within the three main units of fiction, poetry, and drama, and this unit-based system allowed me to pull from strategies of the previous units to enhance my subsequent work and revise effectively too. Also we learned how to workshop peers' work in a super constructive way.",
                "how to craft a compelling story, poem, and dramatic scene. learned how to cut unnecessary figurative language, how to relax from strict guidelines that seem necessary in a poem but aren't, and how to have fun with different topics.",
                "I learned how to analyze short stories, poems, and dramatic scenes, as well as write freely and creatively. I learned how to build a structure for my writing, and develop characters through writing as well.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Skillings! Welcoming environment to be creative. A totally manageable workload. So much fun! \r\nWeaknesses: We did quite a few collaborative activities in class but I wish we'd done more",
                "Strengths Professor Skillings is an incredibly kind and passionate professor. The course readings and mini-assignments definitely help reinforce the techniques we talk about in class. The workshops are also incredibly helpful in revising the pieces you write in the class.\r\nWeaknesses I think that we do not get to spend very much time on each individual unit, but that is a trade off for the breadth of the course.",
                "Great feedback",
                "Strengths: the assignments provided many opportunities to write. Discussions were interesting and productive. Workshop was low-pressure. Guest lectures were interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Would have appreciated more critical feedback. Of course, it's an introductory class, but there were times when I craved more honest, constructive negative feedback.",
                "I honestly can only think of strengths. Professor Skillings was incredibly thoughtful in her feedback and the way she ran discussions in class. There was a wide range of majors and backgrounds represented among the students in a way that made workshop and discussions interesting and varied. The readings never felt like too much work and were usual the highlight of my work week. The writing prompts pushed us to try new things. I ended up enjoying writing poetry, the one unit I was dreading when I signed up for the class.",
                "I thought the course got off to a very strong start in the fiction section. The assigned readings were very short and manageable, and while we didn't always have time to discuss all of them, they were very diverse in style and therefore gave us a lot to think about when we did our own writing. The discussions felt pretty casual, which made conversations about the readings flow easily. I thought the poetry unit was excellent, but too short. We read a great selection of poems. Poetry can seem really intimidating, and Professor Skillings did a great job of demystifying poetry writing for us. I do think the class lost a bit of steam in the drama unit, but that could just be because I was less interested in it. It felt rushed, and the workshops felt a bit flatter. Overall, though, workshops were very well-structured and an amazing opportunity to get invaluable feedback.",
                "This courses strength was workshops, as well as professor feedback. I felt as if all the work I submitted benefited from self-revision, peer revision, and instructor revisions. I think that there could be more of a balance between discussions and writings. In Fiction, it felt like we mostly had reading discussions but in Poetry and Drama we pretty much only had time for workshops.",
                "Id just like to thank everyone involved in making the course happen: the department, the professors, the other students/my classmates, and more. I personally had a fantastic time in this class and developing my final portfolio of work. \r\nProf. Skillings is a killer professor. She made the class so welcoming and fun and was always available to assist us. The diversity of the material covered made it that much better, allowing me to try out a ton of new things. The community of our section was great (as fostered by the prof.) \r\n\r\nGiven the limits of the fast pace of the course through the three units, I think the class gets the job done well and I can't think of any ways to improve it",
                "Wish we had more time with each unit! unclear how to do that.",
                "My strengths included writing a lot of sensory details and experiences and incorporating them into my writing, as well as developing characters, especially through dialogue. My weaknesses included a lot of telling, not showing, and I can work on trusting the reader a little more in what they can take away from my writing.",
                "You have a lot of freedom in terms of what you can write about, and Professor Skillings really allows you to take risks by simply giving feedback and not grading your smaller assignments. And I would say Professor skillings is definitely a strength of this course and why I enjoyed it so much!!",
                "The course is incredibly engaging and it offers a wonderful opportunity to share ones writing with peers and provide valuable feedback. Moreover, it is very inspiring, especially reading others writing in different styles and really helps find one their voice. I only wish we had more time to go through each genre thats being tackled but that is more of an issue of the course being just one semester long instead of time management itself. Maybe it would be better if the course met three times a week instead of two.\r\nMore importantly, I wish this course had one additional section as there was just too many spots being taken over by upper years in advance that made me, a freshman, be automatically sent to the waitlist.",
                "It was nicely structured. It was flexible. The grading structure was good. We got to write about what we wanted with smaller criteria to guide us but the criteria were pretty flexible and I'm sure if you're passionate about something, they'd let you break from the criteria as long as the larger assignment is fulfilled."

If you have any interest in writing, this course offers such a great introduction in an environment that always felt supportive, never overwhelming. Emily Skillings is so kind and wise and offered great feedback. The discussions felt so lively and class passed quickly. Overall, just a great way to try different types of creative writing, understand the connection between reading and writing, and explore different parts of yourself and the world.",
                "Yes, definitely! Just make sure you are up for all the writing. We practically always had a writing assignment on our plate. Know that this isn't going to be a super challenging literature course where you spend a lot of time on individual texts. We moved through the readings pretty quickly. But this is the best class at Yale to try out creative writing in a low-stakes way, and definitely a great stepping-stone to the more advanced CW courses in the English department.",
                "Anyone who is interested in creative writing should take this intro course if they can. My classmates made the experience great, but my opinion is that its a pretty self-selecting group. No one was disinterested in writing.",
                "yeesssssssssssssssssss",
                "It was hard for me to take a leap of faith in this way since I expected a Yale creative writing class to be overly difficult and discouraging to risk-taking, making it just not enjoyable to me. However, that expectation was completely violated in the best of ways possible. This class is perfect for everyone, especially those wanting to try something new. I am by no means a literary person but this challenged me to be creative in new ways which I value deeply. The community is great and the group lectures are with fantastic speakers. No complaints!!",
                "Yes! lovely introduction to three different areas of creative writing and assignments were engaging and fun-- not busy work.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, not only was the engagement of this course very high, everyone was very respectful of each other's opinions, and helped each other greater with giving feedback on their writing.",
                "Yes, especially with Professor Skillings! Super fun, chill course.",
                "I would recommend this course to all of my friends. It is incredibly engaging to both writers and non writers and is something excellent and should be encouraged for everyone to try. Not only do I feel like Ive found myself in fiction writing through this course, but I feel like everyone could discover a new passion by taking it, while also being more well read and knowledgable about different styles and whether writing is for them to pursue.",
