Not a class for people with no background in stats. I feel like I did not learn as much as I wanted from this class because of the amount of information that was thrown at us every week. I simply could not process it fast enough to understand everything 100%",
                "strengths are that it is very well organized and accessible for OH for supplemental learning",
                "The slides and section notes were particularly helpful in understanding the material. The quizzes felt unreasonably more difficult than the exams (perhaps because the material hadn't had enough time to sink in yet).",
                "The course started off slow and repetitive before slowly and suddenly escalating in difficulty. I think it could be improved by removing many unnecessary introductory material and unneeded arithmetic/calculation. This time could then be better allocated in discussing many of the more complex ideas in more depth and allowing for more examples and explanation.",
                "Strengths: Lots of support",
                "I liked how we had problem sets due every other week as opposed to every week. I wish there could have been more office hours sessions available.",

                "Guillermo was a huge strength for this course. He made lectures engaging and material easy to understand. I don't know if I would have liked this class if it weren't for him\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is that a lot of teaching was left to be done in sections. That is great, but oftentimes the TFs would not teach it super well so it would be very confusing. Also, the course shoved way too much material into the second half. I believe the first half went too slowly, and as a result the second half went way too fast.",
                "The strengths of this course are the knowledge set itself which is very important. I do think the class is a bit boring and people skip lecture or fall asleep there because of that. I think if there was a way to make the lectures more engaging I would be encouraged to attend every time. The problem sets were really good for solidifying the knowledge gained from lecture and section. I also think Piazza was a really useful tool to make the instructors accessible when students have questions.",

                "Strength is that the course is relatively organized. Certain discussion sections are good too\r\n\r\nWeakness is that lecture can be a bit boring at times, as well as inconsistent discussion sections. First half of course seemed rushed too",

                "It was a little confusing going back and forth from statistics to programming. I wish we separated them more. I appreciated how it was separated in the PSETs and that these were an opportunity to practice the concepts further. I thought the PSETs were also very helpful in understanding the concepts.",
                "Strengths: very insightful PSETS that teach you a lot, lecture slides are detailed, lectures are recorded\r\nWeaknesses: not a great introduction to R for beginners, but that may have been worsened by the fact that the first two weeks of classes were online; quizzes are very tricky and theyre hard to prepare for; practice exams get posted kind of later than ideal if youre juggling a lot of classes and trying to study before reading period.",

A weakness was there were often weeks with no work, while others had both a quiz and pset due within a few days of eachother. Spreading out the work more to encourage constant engagement rather than panicked one week and none the rest would make learning easier.",

                "Didn't feel like I learned that much R, but was still interesting to learn. PSets were fair and helped with the material. Material was interesting and relevant. Midterm was not fair at all in terms of pacing and material. Final was better.",
                "Strength: good real life examples of how the content is used to conducted analyses.\r\nWeakness: the course material was often difficult to understand prior to doing the homework or doing additional out of class reading.",

                "strengths: very clear instructions with examples and definnitons, good slideshows and recorded lectures\r\nweaknesses: very monotonous, little incentive to go to lecture, could be more participatory",
                "Strengths: Very well organized, and very important course for anyone interested in the social sciences and particularly economics. Lots of case studies and a great overview into the field. Weaknesses: Sometimes the case studies were a bit forced and detracted from some of the more practical skills being developed, but upon review they were very helpful additions. Also, one big weakness was the weakness of study materials, no comprehensive review sessions like other Econ classes. Also would have liked more R help, given that we used it more to support our work and not necessarily as a key focus.",
                "In my opinion, this is not a beginner course. It seemed geared towards those who have previously taken a statistics course and have worked with R studio. Not enough time was spent breaking down the basics in my opinion.",
                "Strengths: the course used interesting data sets in class and on the psets, making the dry material a little more interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The concepts were hard to follow; sometimes there was too much information on each slide making it confusing;",

                "Not too much workload, but instructor could be better at explaining complicated concepts. TF was amazing and helped a lot",
                "Strengths: very well-organized course with exciting material, responsive TFs/professor. Weaknesses: sometimes, the difficulty of the problem sets (e.g., very abstract, theoretical questions) was not reflected in the rigor presented in lectures; it could be difficult to stay engaged with the course, as the lectures mostly consisted of reading from the slides.",
                "n/a",
                "The course is a great introduction. I would have liked more guidance on R tricks and how to effectively code. I was never sure how to learn to do things, and whether or not to use shortcuts.",
                "The class is extremely poorly designed and is not at all designed to facilitate student learning. Example problems in lecture are simply projected as a slide instead of being worked out with us, and they are only on the slide for a few seconds, leaving students no time to comprehend the question. Furthermore, the slides are arranged strangely with related content separated, and content jumps around jaggedly. Additionally, there was virtually no guidance or support on how to use R. I think this course would have been much better if a) the professor worked out problems on the board with us instead of just projecting the problem and then the solution and b) if the class was split into two classes: one based on theory and another based on applying that theory in R. This class was overly ambitious in what it attempted to teach, and it failed miserably at it. R code was provided and we were just expected to know it because it was not gone over in class.",
                "nothing really",
                "Taught very confusingly. Sporadic lecture breaks that switch between content. Would prefer if the professor wrote on the board more instead of speeding through R.",
                "Strenghts: instructor very willing to explain things\r\nWEaknesses: not enough problem solving in lectures so often the Pset would be the first place we saw how to apply a concept",
                "Mediocre lectures. So standardized. They also lost sight of the broader picture too often, making it difficult to understand the course as a whole. \r\nGreat sections.",
                "I thought that in the beginning the R sections could have been much more well supported, especially for students with no R experience. The due dates of assignments were sometimes right after the weekend when there were no office hours - that was especially challenging for student athletes who do a lot of their work on the weekends and usually can't make normal office hours times.",
                "Loved professor",
                "time in exams is a problem",
                "1) the course should really switch to edstem from piazza - it is one of the only courses I have taken that hasn't already made the switch\r\n2) the course material seemed to be pretty inconsistent between Z tests and T tests, I always thought this was a pretty important distinction in statistics but the course made no mention of it and used both interchangeably."

I also think the way problem sets and class is structured helps facilitate that. It just feels though that lecture is really boring and slow.

                "I loved this course. Throroughly recommend if you're interested in econ, stats, or data science.",
                "Not unless you need it for your major. I stopped showing up after the midterm ...",
                "No, only take if you have to or love coding and a challenge",
                "If you have to take it, take it. But there are several other stats classes that are less intense and more engaging.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to take an econ class without actually having had any prior experience with econ.",
                "I would recommend it, but probably don't take it if it is not required. It's not too bad but not worth the stress.",
                "I would recommend it only for people with specific interest in econometrics. It also serves as a decent general introductory statistics course although it can feel fast paced at times.",
                "If you don't have to do it for a major requirementno.",
                "Yes, this class changed the way I evaluate things and think about the world. It has a reputation for being difficult but going to peer tutoring/office hours was super helpful whenever I needed extra help on problem sets. So far, this is my favorite class at Yale.",
                "Definitely recommend this course. Take it so you know about different studies going on in the world, our conceptions of data, and how people go about making econometric analyses.",
                "Yes! Professor Noguera was great, and Ive learned a lot of useful tools.",
                "I would recommend this course if you have already had some sort of previous (high school/basic intro) coursework in statistics.",
                "Yes only for major",
                "This is a requirement for Econ majors, but I think its a worthwhile course that really helps you understand research and some contemporary issues.",
                "If you have to for econ",
                "Yes  it is a major requirement.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course!! I learned so much about statistics and data analysis through real-world and relevant applications. The workload is manageable if you start assignments right when theyre assigned and office hours were always helpful.",
                "Eh",
                "I would I think the professor is great but the material is just way too heavy.",
                "Yes, it is a very basic but important introduction to econometrics! Not only does it give you skills necessary to work with data, but it allows you to understand how other people use data so that you can read studies and papers more critically.",
                "n",
                "Yeah, gets you into R and thinking about statistics in ECON.",
                "Its fairly easy if you have already seen stats, overall a good time either way. Not the hardest class or the easiest pretty mid in all fronts",
                "Take a different class if you want to learn R, but do this if for Econ only",
                "Yes. This is a good introductory course in econometrics for anyone interested.",
                "Yes if you are planning on pursuing a quantitative analysis career in the near future or are simply interested in becoming more familiar with R coding.",
                "yeah - it was really not that bad for a required econ class and it was fair (i think so far) in term of grading",
                "Yes! Definitely some other courses out there better suited to someone trying to learn Stats, but for anyone interested particularly in econometrics this was a great overview and definitely worth taking.",
                "I wouldn't personally. This class seemed more so intermediate-level, and as a student who has no background in stats or R studio, I struggled a lot.",
                "Dont take it unless youre an economics major",
                "No, this class made me less interested in economics and less likely to write an economics thesis because I dont want to take another semester of econometrics. I think this class needs to be reorganized. If students leave feeling uninspired and less interested in the subject, then something is wrong.",
                "Yes for the major. Long psets, difficult curve.",
                "Take it if you need it, I wouldnt recommend it as a fun, fifth or gut class.",
                "Yes! This is a course that covers a broad range of exciting material and is well-structured for all students. Even if you're not in the major, it could be a way to gain exposure to tools in statistics and data analysis through the lens of economics.",
                "not unless you need it for the major",
                "I would recommend it if you want to learn what is on the syllabus. It is very straightforward. I found it very helpful to better understand the methods parts of studies in social science.",
                "Absolutely not. I had to teach myself all the content, and the class is extremely poorly designed and is not at all designed to facilitate student learning. Example problems in lecture are simply projected as a slide instead of being worked out with us, and they are only on the slide for a few seconds, leaving students no time to comprehend the question. Furthermore, the slides are arranged strangely with related content separated, and content jumps around jaggedly. Additionally, there was virtually no guidance or support on how to use R. I think this course would have been much better if a) the professor worked out problems on the board with us instead of just projecting the problem and then the solution and b) if the class was split into two classes: one based on theory and another based on applying that theory in R. This class was overly ambitious in what it attempted to teach, and it failed miserably at it.",
                "if youre on econ you have to take it",
                "Not unless you have to take it for the econ major.",
                "Yes! Especially with Guillermo. He's AMAZING",
                "Yes but with caveat of needing to go to a lot of office hours to supplement class.",
                "Yes. Although lack of feedback made it really problematic to know how well you are doing in the course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course purely for the content. I learned an enormous amount of valuable information, even if it was a real struggle to grasp onto.",
                "Yes! Learned super important skills",
                "If you are not an Econ major, I would opt out",
                "Yes - though a lot of the material is covered in more depth in statistics classes (e.g. S&DS 230) the economics-specific examples are interesting and the experiment stuff in the second half of the class is interestinng."
