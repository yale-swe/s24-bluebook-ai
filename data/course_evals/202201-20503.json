There were often moments of silence where the students wouldn't speak. I think that one way to improve this is to assign more readings and have a more structured class style, for instance asking for discussion posts on Canvas and being more strict about class participation.",
                "I thought that the main strength of this course was its open-ness. Students were encouraged to bring their genuine thoughts and questions to each section. As for weaknesses, I don't really have much to say. Perhaps to add in some variety, we could have tried out some of the exercises that were used in the acting groups we studied."

I wish we had gotten department funding to see The Mother in New York City, that would really improve the course. I also wish that the discussions of Polish history had been less superficial.",
