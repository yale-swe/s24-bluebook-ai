I will never look at rocks the same way now, I have the ability to look at rocks and the patterns in them and know something about their history and the geological history of the region. I will take that with me in the future, and though I do not plan to go into a geological field, I will carry that interest and fascination forward."

                "Strengths: the workload was very manageable and not difficult, until the final paper which was a time commitment.  Mark is a funny, kind, and engaging professor. The grading was fair and I like how he structured the grading system. The field trip seemed like a major strength although I could not go on it.\r\nWeaknesses: trouble in timing to get through all the content.  In class, we went on a lot of tangents so we couldn't cover everything by the end of the semester. A lot of the content was just throwing us in the deep end (in terms of geophysical concepts, data, and techniques), and I'm not sure how much I got out of this method.",
                "The course was well organized and I received helpful feedback on assignments. Hybrid was available which was helpful for not missing class if I was under the weather and the slides were always available before class.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. A weakness was that the syllabus was not very reliable it was sometimes hard to tell when things were due or what the weekly summaries were supposed to cover, as well as how much things were worth in the end, but Professor Brandon always announced the content and due date of the summaries on Canvas, so that is only a very minor complaint."

            "comments": [
                "Tentatively.  If you're an EPS major, I would recommend because the final research paper really helped me develop scientific skills-- reading lots of papers that I didn't understand, but finding a way to piece together the relevant information into a coherent argument.  The fully funded field trip is a huge plus, so take the class even just for that!  If you are not an EPS major, I would recommend Credit/Ding the course just because the final paper requires an ability to read, understand, and synthesize a good chunk of scientific literature.",
                "Yes! Professor Brandon is a great professor. Its also very generous of him to organize and take us all on a field trip- this year to Death Valley California- which was a real highlight of the class. Classes are always well organized and he is great at breaking down complicated concepts for non-science majors.",
                "Absolutely, especially if you can take it with friends! I cannot overstate how much the field trip to Death Valley was one of the highlights of my time at Yale, and we weren't even able to do an international trip like the class did pre-covid. Mark's teaching style honestly wasn't the best fit for my personal learning style (his lines of thought were often difficult for me to follow), but it's clear that he really does care about his students learning. The workload is fairly low, although the final paper and presentation are a good bit of work. Overall, I think you'll get out what you put it. Don't miss the chance to go on an amazing trip with knowledgeable geologists on Yale's dime!",
                "Yes, if you have the chance to take this class you should. It is a great introduction to the geology department.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. As a non-STEM major, I was a little nervous about taking a somewhat advanced geology course, however, in the end this course was very manageable while also teaching a great deal. Though having little prior experience with the content, I found it quite fascinating. Similarly, I like to travel and hike often, and our trip to Death Valley showed me how I can deepen those experiences by learning about the geological history of the region. I think the hands-on element made the content really sink in. I loved it. I would unreservedly recommend this course."
