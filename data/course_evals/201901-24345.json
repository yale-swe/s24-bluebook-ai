    "I gained a lot more vocabulary and grammar knowledge.",
    "You're gonna learn a ton of spanish really fast. It's worth it, but hard",
    "More conjugations of verbs (preterite, imperfect, future), the subjunctive tense, broad range of vocabulary, as well as many other grammar concepts. Improved my Spanish writing and reading skills.",
    "I improved my Spanish speaking, reading, and writing capabilities.",
    "This course helped me develop greater Spanish skills, building on the progress I made in L1 and preparing me for L3.",
    "I learned the differences between the preterite and imperfect, numerous uses of the subjunctive, the simple future tense, and more vocabulary.",
    "Learned many intermediate Spanish skills!",
    "I developed further insight to the spanish language. I improved my reading speaking and writing skills in the duration of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "I think I had a great professor who was flexible if we really understood concepts to spend less time on those and more on the ones we didn't understand in order to better our learning rather than following the course syllabus unequivocally. \r\nI didn't enjoy some of the group work because I felt that it all fell to one person and that was not fair.",
    "A lot of variety in different activities compared to L1. Not much room for improvement",
    "Strengths: Similar structure to SPAN 110 which makes transitioning easier\r\nWeaknesses: Exams and quizzes seemed unnecessarily difficult. A large step up in difficulty from SPAN 110",
    "It is clearly strong and well formulated.",
    "The strength of this course was definitely Professor Lestayo. He was fun, enthusiastic, and encouraging, and definitely made the Spanish course a welcoming environment. The course could be improved by including more variety in the daily activities. A lot of the course consists of going over homework exercises each day, and I think it would be more productive if there was a greater variety of ways to learn Spanish in class.",
    "Strengths: Very immersive, encourages active participation.\r\nWeaknesses: Very rigid structure, could do with slightly more flexibility for homework.",
    "The various skits and verbal activities scattered throughout the course were valuable opportunities to practice improvisation skills, and they were very fun overall. The course could be improved by assigning a more engaging movie to watch.",
    "Overall, the course was a good follow-up to the material taught in L1 Spanish. The amount of grammar covered in this course was far greater than the amount in L1, but it was taught at a steady pace and was fitting for the course. There was a movie shown near the end of the semester that felt somewhat unnecessary (especially since it could be viewed with English subtitles), but other than that I thought the course was strong.",
    "The course itself was a little too packed to be helpful. Some extra assignments seemed counterproductive at times."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah I would. It is very helpful to leave Spanish and I really enjoyed it.",
    "Yep, spanish is hard but rewarding",
    "Yes, but be sure to expect a heavier load than SPAN 110. The course is much more enjoyable if you can stay on top of your work. I made the mistake of waiting until the last minute to study (as I did in 110) and it resulted in a lot of unneeded stress",
    "Yes, it's a great way to improve and learn more Spanish.",
    "I totally recommend taking the class with Jose, he's such a kind instructor and is a very very cool person! He doesn't check daily homework as much as other teachers and shows understanding when you can't show up because you were sick that day, you're tired or you woke up late. It's kind of bizarre how our class had the highest average out of all the sections, considering that he was very relaxed in terms of his teaching style. Absolutely 10\/10 recommend, sad that he's not going to be on campus next year.",
    "Yes, if you took L1 and are on the Intro Spanish track, this is a good course to take.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes! The Spanish department is well organized and put together."
