                "This course gave a great in-depth look at the Maghreb from the early to mid 20th century to the present day. The readings and discussion also addressed valuable frameworks and theory to consider in the context of post colonial states. The readings and discussions were especially valuable and productive for their focus on ethnographic history rather than macro\/big man history. I thoroughly enjoyed the depth of our discussions that often focused on the affects of historical phenomenon on the individual.",
                "Great exposure to theoretical frameworks in anthropology and ethnography. Comfortability with higher-level academic scholarship. Very good feedback on how to write more concise, professional op-ed, political science, and anthropological style papers. Relatively in-depth understanding of the North African countries and their histories and modern politics.",
                "I learned about the history of the Maghreb, about \"moderate islam\", political systems, women's rights, immigrant rights, race, language, the field of ethnography, and how to seek multiple perspectives on a single time and place.",
                "Prof. Sakthivel offers a broad survey of Maghrebi history before delving into particular political, linguistic and cultural aspect of each country. The course has deepen my knowledge and understanding of the region on many different levels."

                "The strengths were undoubtedly the professor and the readings. Dr. Sakthivel's choices in course material and focus during seminars made for fantastic discussions that were challenging and insightful. I genuinely cannot think of any weaknesses. There was a great balance of short lecture in class and student discussion.",
                "Professor Sakthivel is amazing. The syllabus was well organized and the reading were interesting. Guest lecturers were fun to spice things up and give us real-world insight. I like that class was once a week given the reading load. Reading load was too much at the beginning but Professor Sakthivel was responsive to feedback and things got better. The midterm and final papers are really fun and grounded in real-world, useful skills.",
                "Professor Sakthivel is very much dedicated to this subject area and you can see it in the course. I enjoyed engaging with the different mediums of the course materials and in hearing from the various guest lecturers which included filmmakers, diplomats, political activists, and academics. The course material is incredibly interesting and unique. This is the first course I have seen on North Africa rather than including North Africa as a side note to the Middle East.",
                "The seminar was incredibly engaging for the entirety of the semester, providing fascinating materials while allowig for a horizontal dialogue between teacher and students."

Given the complexities of North African history, it might have been nice to have some powerpoints to go along with the lectures. Professor Sakthivel was very supportive and adaptive to the weird remote-learning environment.",

The virtual course format allowed us to have guest lecturers we would not have had otherwise. Professor Sakthivel also make sure to give us breaks within the class in order to counter zoom fatigue."

I think the approach to studying the region was also better than many other history courses I've taken.",
