                "This course really helped expand my historical knowledge of architecture and its relevance within the Renaissance period as it relates to the rest of history. I plan on majoring in architecture, so I am grateful that this was able to cement my confidence in this being a subject I am interested in and passionate about.",
                "Gothic v Renaissance styles, 1500s history",
                "Learned about the aspects of architecture as a whole and specific to the Renaissance period, expanding my knowledge in the subject and allowing me to have more consideration of the buildings and structures in the world around me.",
                "I became a more culturally enriched and much more curious person. No longer I pass by impressive porticos and carry on to my day as if it is something casual. Although the class strictly covered the architecture works of the Renaissance period, it developed a profound interest in me towards later periods such as Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical period. To be perfectly fair, I developed an interest in this elective after taking Milette Gaifman's Greek Antiquity class, in which we briefly learned about classical orders of columns. That little piece of information led my curiosity to Morgan's class which had a lot of global history aspect on top of traditional architecture studies which I really loved. The class taught me to develop a critical analysis of an architecture piece - how it can be a bearer of meaning, how it can resemble a technological prowess or how it shapes very social interactions we are part of on daily basis. I started to give more importance to the choice of materials, shapes and colors in architecture, which makes you significantly reevaluate your surroundings :)",
                "How to identify Renaissance architecture in my daily life",
                "This class has offered me fascinating insights into different types of Renaissance architecture, including religious, imperial, colonial, and commercial buildings. It investigates how architecture in this period was closely intertwined with geopolitical connections, warfare, classical treatises, and the newly risen print technology. I found it particularly intriguing to analyze the similarity and differences between buildings constructed for the Protestant Reformation and for the Counter-Reformation by Catholic churches.",
                "I developed a clearer understanding of building typology, the history of architectural theory, and of key works and architects and the concepts they illustrate.",

            "comments": [
                "A major strength of the course is how rich it is with carefully curated information pertaining to Renaissance architecture. It is extremely insightful and I feel like I'm going to take away a lot of knowledge that will support me in future academic endeavors (particularly in the field of architecture). One weakness is because it is so densely packed with information, the expectation for us to memorize certain dates and architect names seemed a little unreasonable and doesn't match the Yale standard for learning to understand knowledge rather than learning to regurgitate information.",
                "Content is fun; lectures can be boring at times; second quiz was far more intense than the first one",
                "I think it was a very well structured course. I very much enjoyed the group outings to various campus buildings to investigate the architecture and have the buildings around us contribute to our discussions. I don't think there were very many weaknesses and none worth noting.",
                "One thing I vividly remember about the class is that sometimes I would legitimately zone out - I am not sure if my attention span has decreased over the years or it is Gen Z effect I amassed as I took many Yale College classes, but sometimes Morgan would drop a laundry list of architecture pieces in one class - without immersing into one piece fully, we would switch to another. Granted, I saw many students still keeping up with the pace and taking many notes simultaneously. I personally don't have very good note taking skills, and it is much easier for me to register information visually or by listening. So some pauses or changes of paces during the lecture would serve as a good checkpoint to ask if anyone has questions or if anyone has missed some piece of information. Of course, course recordings were fairly useful if one needed to re-retrieve specific piece of information. What I really liked about the assignments and exams is that Morgan left plenty of space for optionality. At no point in time, I felt I am confined or limited in some way to show my true knowledge and passion. A podcast instead of a 2000 paper was one of my best homework experiences during my time at Yale, which I really recommended everyone else to try. This coincided with the time when I was trying to launch my own podcast, so it was additional motivation and practice - not sure if it was easy to grade though :) Overall, the course seemed very frontloaded and we covered much more ground before spring break rather than after - I think a balance approach would be more sustainable.",
                "Strength - Having classes in Beinecke, outside, etc. to be able to actually see the architecture and works we were learning about; papers where we had to apply our knowledge abt the course to new works",
                "The course has rich content ranging from basic terminologies of architecture to political ideologies of monarchies. Sometimes the content was too much, so we did not have enough time to analyze each building in depth. It would be better to focus on some key buildings and dive into more details. I would also suggest discussing the assigned readings during lectures, as some readings are a bit difficult to understand.",
                "This class was taught incredibly well! It pulled from a rich range of sources, had engaging activities such as campus tours, had unique class discussions such as critiquing an AI generated text to test our understanding of the material, and was overall incredibly interesting!",
                "This course was good, but the first paper was slightly unfair. I thought that there was little instruction on how to write it given no architectural background is required. I would do two research papers as I believe you learn more.",
                "Strengths: I feel like it covers just the right amount of material, not too much and certainly not too little, as a result, it was very engaging. I feel like this is one of the Yale courses that I've learned the most in. The assignments were interesting and really helped me develop skills in building analysis, and moreover I felt like they were engaging because they were unique to the course. The prof provided an abundance of information that you could pay attention to if you wanted to know more, which I enjoyed. We also went on field trips to Sterling, the Beineke, and the British Art Museum, which were fun and interesting outings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The difficulty level of certain summative assignments was hard to determine. There was one quiz that everyone did poorly on because the prof's expectations weren't communicated. I think, as a way of compensating for this bad quiz, the prof ended up making the exams too straightforward.",
                "The strength of this course lies in the way that Professor Ng contextualises the architectural works studied. Not only does Professor Ng discuss history and patronage, but he also pays close attention to the intersectionality between different types of media - he emphasises the importance of prints and treatises in the creation of architectural works. I also deeply enjoyed the trips to the Yale University Art Gallery and the Bieneke archives. One of my favourite classes was the discussion of fortress design at the YCBA. As an improvement, I would recommend having a few more discursive classes as they were so enjoyable."

First instinct would be like how this would be even remotely in my future job or major but trust me it is exactly this type of random and specific pieces of information that make one a very interesting person to talk to/hang out with/work with. History carries so many elements that impossible to capture in one stable state, but architecture is exactly one stable structure that will only harness and carry more historical value as it perseveres. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to take a class and then make life-long travel itinerary with must-see spots  around the worlds :)",
