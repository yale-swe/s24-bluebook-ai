    "So much actually information about sound that I didnt know before! Do you know what a soundscape is? You should. It will challenge your understanding of the world! Honestly, it will! This is an incredibly diverse class.",
    "This course introduced me to basic concepts within sound studies and their applicability to a wide variety of texts and other media. I learned how to read poems and other print media for their sound and to draw out the social and political implications of their sound.",
    "So much! I had no idea what \"literary sound studies\" event meant when I decided to take this course. Professor Glaser has opened up a whole new field and sonic world for me! Approaching literature with an attention to sound, in all its forms (voice, silence, etc.), turns out to be an amazing way to read anew; by approaching poetry, plays, novels with the intention of conducting sound studies, you develop a different and valuable lens (which is not quite the right term because it's a visual one--this class has made me aware of how much we privilege sight in any discussion of the senses) through which to read literature. I am so grateful to this course and to Professor Glaser for expanding my approach to literature in such a rich, meaningful way.",
    "About sound",
    "A general overview of debates in sound studies with special attention paid to race, listening modes, and poetry.",
    "I found the topic of this course to be quite niche and very fulfilling. Its an enticing mix of the auditory and writing mediums and I learned a lot about how to directly write and write about sound.",
    "Examining literature from a sound studies perspective."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is extremely well organized and I was always able to find the readings and know what we were meant to be doing in class. Though its a long class, it never seemed to drag and this was because the topic of sound is so general that everyone can have something to say! Fortunately, each week the discussion was given a good direction by the texts we read, and I feel like I know so much more than I did at the beginning of the class.",
    "The strengths of this course include the variety of texts and media on the syllabus. I appreciated that we did not confine our sound analyses to just poetry or prose, but also looked at hip hop, the blues, and other non-print cultural artifacts. I also appreciated the setup for the midterm and final papers, which allowed us to explore in depth topics of our own choice.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion for improving the course might be to increase the number and range of theoretical readings on sound. At times I wished that we had more theoretical apparatuses through which to analyze poetry or sounds, especially because some of the theoretical readings, like Schaffer's \"Sound Studies Introduction\" did not seem too relevant.",
    "This course is very engaging and easy to connect with, but the readings are incredibly long and oftentimes are not even fully discussed. I think the readings could be cut down for a deeper focus on what is most important, or the discussions could be more focused.",
    "This course is an overview of current discussions in sound studies. Would have loved to go more in-depth into some of the topics. I also would have appreciated being assigned more snippets from The Sound Studies Reader or The Soundscape, because there were so many concepts that could have informed our discussions throughout the semester."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This class is amazing. If you have any interest in anything related to basically anything....... sound is fascinating and has so many iterations that you will one hundred percent find something to invest your whole mind in. Professor Glaser is fabulous too, direct and thoughtful and extremely helpful with thoughts about papers.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I feel that I gained an introduction to key topics within sound studies while having the ability to pursue an independent project that incorporated some of these topics. I also appreciate how the syllabus constantly shifted perspectives so that we were never discussing sound from just one angle.",
    "Yes! Absolutely. One of the best seminars--and classes--I've ever taken.",
    "Yes, it leads you to think about sound in unique ways",
    "If a student has a prior interest in sound in poetry, music, and literature, this class would hold much interest for them.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in expanding their knowledge of the English languages in ways that are not strictly written works. The reading list is fantastic and overall it is a very rich class, i came away from each meeting feeling like I learned something new.",
    "Absolutely! It's on a very interesting topic that I had not encountered in any of my previous English courses. This class made me a more nuanced listener of soundscapes in literature."
