                "I learned how to develop a term-long project and print photographs and also gained exposure to other artists.",

                "The strengths and the weaknesses of the this course are that there is not much structure in the class and it is not the most orderly. However, this is also a plus because it is what you make of it. Ted is super helpful in answering\/helping you during class.",
                "Strengths: collaborative environment where all students learned form each other, YUAG visits, and quite a bit of freedom to work independently during class hours\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: though I enjoyed every visiting artist lecture, I might have preferred the option to choose whether to shoot or print instead of attending every lecture that we went to.",
                "Strengths: a lot of freedom to explore topic areas that you are interested in, as well as tailored support and feedback from the instructor and TA. Weaknesses: not many technical demos, so for those unfamiliar with printing and editing, there's less formal instruction and more personal experimentation",
                "The instruction is very flexible and accommodating and I was able to constantly receive quality feedback on my work at a very personal level, owning to a small class size and the wonderful professor&TA. I see no weakness in this class."

                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I think that it is a great way to find your identity as a photographer and really voice your ideas. I think it is a bit rough because I think that Ted wants to see things done in a certain way and if you don't then he might be harsh during crits.",
                "Absolutely. Ted, Ian (the TF), and the other students all pushed me into a space that was artistically and emotionally difficult to move into, but that undoubtedly deepened the meaning of my art.",
                "It's a very self-directed course. If you like taking photographs and are invested in your project topic, you can create really interesting work.",
                "Yes if you are serious about photography."
