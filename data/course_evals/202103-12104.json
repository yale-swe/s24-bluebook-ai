                "Strengths: collaborative environment where all students learned form each other, YUAG visits, and quite a bit of freedom to work independently during class hours\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: though I enjoyed every visiting artist lecture, I might have preferred the option to choose whether to shoot or print instead of attending every lecture that we went to.",
                "Strengths: a lot of freedom to explore topic areas that you are interested in, as well as tailored support and feedback from the instructor and TA. Weaknesses: not many technical demos, so for those unfamiliar with printing and editing, there's less formal instruction and more personal experimentation",
                "The instruction is very flexible and accommodating and I was able to constantly receive quality feedback on my work at a very personal level, owning to a small class size and the wonderful professor&TA. I see no weakness in this class."

I think it is a bit rough because I think that Ted wants to see things done in a certain way and if you don't then he might be harsh during crits.",
                "Absolutely. Ted, Ian (the TF), and the other students all pushed me into a space that was artistically and emotionally difficult to move into, but that undoubtedly deepened the meaning of my art.",
                "It's a very self-directed course. If you like taking photographs and are invested in your project topic, you can create really interesting work.",
