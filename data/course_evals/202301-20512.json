Furthermore, the usage of the new grammar patterns allowed students to see how they were supposed to be used. However, the weakness was that there wasn't much exposure to multiple fluent speakers of Chinese, but rather only a single teacher, which meant that students would only get to see one person's style of communication.",

His stories are very engaging and provide a rich way to include and expand on new vocabulary that we learn. The structure of the course (weekly quizzes) is also excellent in helping students memorize the content better. I truly think Yale has one of the best departments for learning Chinese!",

                "Yes!!!",
                "Yes! I think Yale's Chinese department is one of its best departments. The faculty are excellent and the curriculum is designed in a way that is both interesting and relevant to current affairs. A great way to learn about Chinese culture and also expand your vocabulary. Also driven heavily by student engagement, and so you can get as much out of the course as you put into it! Lots of opportunities to speak, and even more opportunities to write vocabulary!",
                "Yes, Chinese at Yale is one of the best. Integrates conversation as well as written assignments, and the teachers always organize cultural opportunities outside of class too (i.e caligraphy club, lunar new year celebrations)"
