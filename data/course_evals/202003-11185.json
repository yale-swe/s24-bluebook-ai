However, the course work is very taxing, with class section every day and expected work to be almost an hour. At times, the work is very repetitive. At times, the calendar dates are hard to navigate and a better system would make things easier.",
                "Liu laoshi is amazing! Very kind and patient and truly cares about the learning and success of each student. Most people in this level have some experience with pinyin and writing characters since they oftentimes have attended Chinese school, so the basics of pinyin and character writing are not taught; however, if you need extra help, there are a LOT of resources available.",
                "The course is very thorough and helped improve my Chinese greatly. It's at a steady pace so I never felt too overwhelmed but I was also learning a lot.",
                "The course was a bit hard in the beginning as I didn't know how to read or write Chinese at the beginning. However, I felt I was eventually able to catch up and it became easier over time.",
                "I like how it was taught. The beginning was like being thrown in the deep end to be taught how to swim, but after the first midterm it was better."

While it moves relatively fast, Professor Liu is excellent at communicating with her students, and also creates an environment with lots of participation.",
                "Yes, all the Chinese teachers at Yale are very kind and love to teach, and they make the class very enjoyable.",

I came into this class knowing no pinyin nor characters, but did have a solid speaking\/listening\/comprehension background, so the first few weeks as well as the first test were pretty rough. However, once I learned the basics, everything clicked into place. Liu laoshi is extremely accommodating and wants you to succeed. The tutorial sessions were also really helpful in reviewing chapter exercises and could be customized to fit your needs.",
