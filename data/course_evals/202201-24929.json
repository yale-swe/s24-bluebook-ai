                "This course offered an engaging introduction to the application of the methodologies of ethnographies in studies of politics, power, and resistance. I learned about what ethnography is and how it can be useful as the basis for qualitative research. Each week's readings introduced us to different ethnographers doing work on a wide variety of topics in politics, many of which were really fascinating.",
                "Learned how to think critically about works of ethnography and political theory.",
                "I learned more about political ethnography as a discipline and its position within the broader field of political science. This course surveys a series of journal articles/books across different topics and regions, so it's less about the specific topics than it is about some of the theories and methods that are used by political ethnographers. The readings were very effectively organized, with one reader that's more 'recent' and another that is more theoretical or 'classical'. I hadn't been exposed to more qualitative ways of conducting political science before and I enjoyed learning about this through specific case studies/topics in the discipline. I also learned a lot about how to identify the structure of a paper and to figure out how the individual components of the argument work together.",
                "I learned a lot about the field of political ethnography and how it relates to different political theory.",
                "Before taking this course, I had a very limited understanding of what political ethnography was, and I feel very comfortable with the concept having taken the course. I learned to read and evaluate political ethnography, as well as relate it to well-established political theory. I also developed the skill of discussing political ethnography in class.",
                "By taking this course, I learned how to investigate the theoretical basis and assumptions behind a research piece, to investigate a scholars academic background and prior work in order to better understand their intellectual perspective, to question what can be considered political and why, to think with an ethnographic sensibility, to pay attention to methodology and consider how that may impact the results of a research piece, and to draw connections between works that use similar threads of theory or borrow theoretically from each other. I developed a better understanding of ethnography as a field, specifically political ethnography. I learned about how ethnographic research methods can be used to investigate phenomena that have political implications or are political in nature, and how researchers can use ethnographic methods in problematizing the political. I developed an understanding of how political theory can be used in combination with ethnographic methods to understand phenomena in the real world that are not obviously political (for example, like the space and dynamics of a meatpacking factory). I learned to investigate and question things more deeply, and to see political implications and dynamics that I previously would have overlooked.",

                "I learned about qualitative political science, ethnographic methods, and many different sociological concepts and theories",

                "The instructor was inspiring and good at teaching. She was well-organized, gave clear instructions, asked thought-provoking questions, challenged students' presumptions, and led the discussions well.",
                "I liked how the course was structured in terms of the two readings for each class, one by an ethnographer and one by a past thinker who inspired their work in some way. I appreciated having discussion leads introduce each author in depth at the start of class. I also thought the assignments were interesting. Class discussions seemed to go best when the professor brought slides to facilitate the seminar. In the future, I would recommend incorporating small-group activities to break up class time and get more people involved.",
                "The syllabus was extremely strong and I enjoyed completing both assignments. Professor Mustafina was super kind and understanding, and extremely knowledgable. Only weakness was sometimes group discussions would stall or repeat themselves frequently. If discussion posts are used again, an expected word count range would be helpful.",
                "Overall, I thought this was an incredible class with extremely engaging readings and strong teaching. I really liked that the course was organized around the readings; every class revolved around analyzing and breaking down the methods and arguments made in the papers that were assigned for the week. I thought it made the work done outside of class feel productive and meaningful. I also thought that the readings were very well-selected; even though I didn't know much about political ethnography, most of the readings (especially the more contemporary ones) were very accessible and very enjoyable to read as well. The biggest strength of all was the teaching. Prof Mustafina was very intentional about the flow and structure of the discussion, as well as about the takeaways from each reading, which I personally enjoyed, especially because it meant the readings always built on each other, and that we were being pushed to think about the readings more carefully than we would otherwise have been. (The discussions also felt welcoming and low-stakes, so that it wasn't too stressful during discussions.) She is also clearly invested in the discipline herself, and it was really fascinating to hear her insights on doing research. Overall, the class gives you an inlet both into the theoretical foundations and into political science as a profession. Definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "A major strength of this class was the arrangement of the syllabus by theme... this allowed for the themes for each week to feel interconnected but also for a clear distinction of different kinds of ethnography/theory.",
                "This is a fantastic course. Its strengths include the setup of having a student present on one of the scholars each week followed by a class discussion, which makes the class feel very collaborative; the combination of readings on the syllabus, specifically the mixture of political science/theory-based and ethnographic works that borrow from each other and share common threads; the focus on discussion of the readings, allowing students to dive deeply into each reading in class; and Professor Mustafina, who is an absolutely fantastic professor who makes the course extremely engaging and intellectually rewarding for students. There are no weaknesses.",
                "Very great and encouraging teaching\r\nHighly engaging class",
                "This class was fairly high level for having no prerequisites, but Professor Mustafina guided discussion well and helped synthesize the readings during class.",
                "The course was splendid. The readings exposed us to a variety of ethnographers, social theorists, and methods. The syllabus combined social theory and ethnography in a wonderful way.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Excellent Choice of Readings\r\n- Topics were very interesting\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Course structure changed often (but this was the first year its being offered so not sure if this applies for the future)"

The course can be both intellectually inspiring and challenging (which is a good thing from my perspective), and I think even students without a former background in political philosophy/ethnography can engage in the class pretty well since the instructor was very patient and supportive.",

                "Absolutely! I really, really loved this class, and it definitely helped me to figure out my own interests/affiliations within political science. It also gives you an introduction into a smaller/less mainstream side of political science which isn't covered as much at Yale  I remember being completely awestruck during the first few classes, when the professor crystallized a lot of thoughts and reservations I didn't even know that I had with quantitative and data-based ways of studying political science. By virtue of political ethnography being a more fringe area of political science, we talked a lot about the definition of what is political, and the distinction between positivist and constructivist ways of conducting research, which I hadn't really had the opportunity to think about before. I can't recommend the class enough  it was always an engaging and interesting time and I always found myself looking forward to it + actively wanting to do the readings.",
                "If you're interested in politics and ethnography, absolutely! This class was really very interesting, and I was exposed to political concepts I hadn't ever heard of.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was one of my favorite courses that I took in college. This class taught me to think in new ways, and I looked forward to coming to seminar each week. I could not recommend it more highly.",
                "Yes, Prof. Mustafina is amazing.",
