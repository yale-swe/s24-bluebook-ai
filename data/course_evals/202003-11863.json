                "As usual I enjoyed my time in the lab but we received no feedback on the proposals we submitted for the course itself. Once again this major continues to have us guess as to what the exact expectations are and how were meant to write about science I was hoping to get feedback or further guidance that could be helpful for grad school in a couple years. Hopefully we'll get feedback in the spring version of this course.",
                "I appreciate the freedom that the MCDB department gives us to conduct research, but there is very little guidance on the part of the MCDB 485 instructors, meaning your experience doing research will mostly depend on the lab youre in and the mentor\/PI you have. Perhaps check-ins, or other strategies to see if the students are managing alright would be nice.",
                "Strengths: students had instructor support if they needed it. Very self-driven, \"pick-your-own-pace\" type of course.\r\nWeaknesses: no feedback, sometimes was hard to tell if I was doing what I needed to do",

                "This semester was relatively busy in lab with work as well as writing a review, so a strength was that I gained a lot of knowledge in a short amount of time just by reading so many papers alone. In addition, I learned more about the Drosophila as a model organism when I used to focus on mice. I hope that next semester I can learn how to quantify the data we got and will continue to get through the rest of the school year.",

I had an incredible experience, but this was because my lab mentors found a very good project (adapted to remote learning) and were very supportive. I've heard of other students having more mixed experiences, so it really depends on the mentor you find for yourself. Overall, I greatly enjoyed performing research for credit as it is totally different than a normal class and it was nice to have more open-ended work. In my lab, my workload was not too challenging. However, other labs' projects may be more demanding. The requirements for the fall semester include a 2 page proposal after the first week, an informal presentation during your lab's weekly meetings, and a 5 page proposal at the end of the semester. There assignments helped me learn and were not too hard to do but there was no specific feedback from the course instructors, which would have been nice.",
