    "Learned how to be a much better writer and appreciate writing.",
    "I learned to write with more flow and structure at the same time, which translates well into the real world.",
    "I learned how to write with clarity and consider the larger public point of my writing. Additionally, I learned how to vary short and long sentences to develop different paces at different points during my essay. I also learned how to exercise the idea that form follows function, and use my words and punctuation to emphasise the impact of my point.",

    "writing well under time constraints \r\nweaving writing together to form a central point \r\nlearning how to critique my own + other's pieces",

   "comments": [
    "The strengths are that the readings are incredibly well chosen and students are really involved in contributing to the readings of next semester as well as to other students essays for feedback.",
    "Strengths: Really fun class, interesting\/entertaining readings fun to complete, small seminar lets you engage with and get to know your classmates, felt like a community, I enjoyed the writing assignments",
    "honestly, felt less and less motivation to do all of the readings because they amounted to too much since we had a 1000+ word draft due almost every week without fail. They didn't really matter too much anyway. So long as you closely read one of the readings, you could contribute 1-2 times in class + do fine. The only things that really mattered in the class were the essays.",
    "The class was overall well-taught and allowed everyone of us to share their own stories throughout the different units that were taught in the class.\r\nI think, one thing that could be improved is having more essays from international authors and not just American. I think it is good for a university such as Yale to continue its efforts to become more global and one way to do is to look through the lenses of people from different countries and other perspectives.",
    "I loved workshopping essays\/having my essays workshopped. It was super helpful to grow as a writer. I didn't love every essay we read, but Professor Stuart gave us an opportunity to give feedback on the syllabus, which was great."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I absolutely would. Not only is the class great as it is more creative writing, but Dr. Stuart made someone who hates writing (me, a STEM major) appreciate and kind of like the process of developing an essay.",
    "Yes. It is one of those must take courses that will translate well beyond graduation.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. No matter what you study, this course helps you develop essential skills to write and revise your writing. It also makes you think about your writing as an overall cohesive work, and how each sentence contributes to one central public point. Also, the reading is incredibly interesting, moving, and informative.",
    "Yes! The readings were actually fun to do, and I really enjoyed writing the essays. Felt like fun work and I got something out of it",
    "Good to write about yourself because you learn about yourself. If you're unsure at all about who you are, I recommend taking this class.",
    "Yeees, my writing definitely improved but I was also able to read really good pieces and I became a better reader in the process.",
    "Yes! It will help your writing tremendously."
