    "I learned the general skills needed for a scientific lab. I developed my skills at dissection and observation using microscopes. I also learned about the handling of live animals in a lab setting.",
    "I learned about and got to observe a lot of different animals that I did not know even existed prior to the class. It was helpful to take the lab with the lecture course because it helped me to solidify what we covered in lecture.",
    "How to identify a wide range of invertebrates using a microscope, museum specimens and live organisms.",
    "This class gave me an appreciation for the beauty of invertebrates, and taught me a lot about their internal anatomy.",
    "How to handle invertebrate samples and their structures and so on."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The quizzes were very specific and difficult to study for. Working with live specimens was very cool but there was sometimes not enough time to look at all the slides and preserved specimens. It was also difficult to study for the final practical without being able to look back at the preserved specimens.",
    "I loved sketching the animals and thought the lab manual was very well prepared.",
    "I found it extremely difficult to study for this class. The quiz questions, while fair, were an extremely narrow subset of the areas that we had covered, and I found memorizing anatomy difficult. If you struggle with drawing, this class is probably not for you.",
    "I am actually looking forward to a clearer guidelines and lab manuals. When we were not strictly following the lab manuals, I kind of got lost in the middle of the lab and had no idea what to look at."

   "question_id": "YC409",
   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. The whole lab is spent observing various groups of invertebrates. The quizzes are fairly detail-oriented, so they can be difficult. I think it ultimately comes down to how interested you are in invertebrate zoology. If you think animals are really cool and like carefully observing them, then you'll really like it.",
    "If you are actually interested in invertebrates (mostly marine) and are taking the lecture course, I would recommend it because it is pretty low workload but gives a better background to the animals discussed in class. Professor Dunn is fun to talk to and the lab gives you that opportunity when the lecture does not. Don't take it if you have a lot of trouble remembering scientific names or specific anatomical details.",
    "Yes it is very helpful to take the lab concurrently with the class as it enables you to visualize the material better. Its also really cool to see the organisms in real life and sketching them is very relaxing.",
    "Take it Credit\/D. The animals are really cool - especially the live ones- and Professor Dunn and the TAs were very engaged. It's not very much work but is difficult to do well in. I think I would have really enjoyed it if I was not stressed about grades.",
    "Yes if you are taking the invertebrates lecture at the same time."
