                "I think that a strength of this course was the asynchronous workday on Friday. I think that this allowed for more immersive and fun assignments that could not be completed in class or as a daily homework assignment (such as movies or discussion board posts) and it was nice to be able to complete them at a time that was comfortable for me.",

I really loved the diversity of materials we encountered, such as movies, music, longer written texts, and also the asynchronous days. I felt highly engaged with the content, especially Deborah created such a welcoming classroom environment!"
