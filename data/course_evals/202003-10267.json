                "I enjoyed the mix of recorded lecture and virtual live discussions to both learn at my own pace but also check in with my professor and peers.",
                "Prof. Smith is a funny, intelligent, and engaging class leader, and the texts he selected for the syllabus made for interesting reads. The class was relatively low-stress, and the format worked well for virtual learning. I will say though that I got a bit of conflicting feedback from my TF and the professor on some of the coursework, so that did introduce a little confusion in completing assignments.",
                "This course was very helpful in that it gave a lot of time for student lead discussions. This enabled me to have stronger ideas for my essays. I was also able to ask about topics that I did not understand which in turn gave me a better understanding of the stories as a whole and about specific themes.",
                "Professor Smith's lectures are actually so good!!",
                "One strength of this course was the sheer amount of material that we read, much of which I never would have read in my own time. However, this was also a weakness -- we read so much that there were many works that we barely discussed that I would have liked to discuss more. Also, there were many themes\/symbols that were brought up once or twice that I would have liked to focus more on.",
                "The readings were pretty lopsided, meaning some weeks had MUCH more than others, which made it difficult to carve out a consistent space in my week for the work in this class. But the lectures are riveting and the selected works wonderful, and the assignment structure was not overwhelming at all.",
                "The reading list is great. In this particular semester, though, I felt that the discussion posts were just too much and didn't really contribute to learning in any significant way (at least not enough to be worth the added time\/effort\/stress of posting each week)."

                "I liked that there was only one class-wide lecture per week and two shorter recorded lectures, rather than having two class-wide meetings per week. I think that the weekly class meetings could be more structured because there were a few times (especially in the beginning) where there was silence for a prolonged period of time.",
                "I found that the full-class discussions were either unnecessary or redundant (i.e. of either the recorded lecture or of section). I also selected a section later in the week so I could do the reading later in the week because my schedule was lopsided, but the full-class meetings on Wednesdays made this impossible (or made me feel unprepared when I didnt manage to finish the reading).",
                "I really liked the recorded lectures! Being able to pause\/slow down\/etc. allowed me to take more thorough notes and made exam prep easier. The discussion posts were not very helpful, though; it just felt like busy work that added unnecessary stress\/time\/effort when discussion sections already serve the same purpose, especially in a semester where most everyone was just trying to get through as best they could."

Its one of the few Yale courses that really studies the South, and does so through the lens of Southern cultural studies (rather than merely American history or close reading).
