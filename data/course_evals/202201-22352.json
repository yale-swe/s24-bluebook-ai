                "Strengths: the class was very open and constructive criticism was welcomed. I wish that there was more randomized student groups so that I could have gotten to know more people in my course.",
                "Strengths: Learning more tenses was really useful. The supersite assignments were honestly really useful. Prof Reymundi was also really good, she almost never used English (maybe 50 words in English the entire semester combined), which was good mostly. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Speed. Class moves way too fast, not nearly enough practice with lessons before exams. For example, we literally learned future tense and then had an exam the next class day on four tenses. Not nearly enough conversation in Spanish, and not a lot of the colloquial language. \"Eso es yo\" (That is me, directly translated) needs to be said as as soy yo (like this am I, directly translated) to say That is me. We don't have the ability to converse in everyday language, which really is problematic. The LinguaMeetings are the only time when we are forced to produce language immediately, but it's 15 minute session that ultimately isn't that productive either. The course itself is also set up really confusingly. The final project really just appeared out of nowhere, for example, and it was hard to follow which assignments were due when. And then the daily thing is really difficult.",
                "The professor was amazing, always supportive, and kept the class interesting. The canvas page could be a but more organized to keep track of everything.",
                "Sometimes there is a lack of instruction and communication about assignments/projects.",
                "I cannot think of a weakness other than it felt like the professor was being forced to teach according to the departments assignment plan. I think it would have been more culturally and academically enriching if this was relaxed. \r\nOtherwise the course was amazing.",
                "The teaching was excellent and the students were great people. However, we were in a basement with almost zero windows which did not inspire the class at 9am.",
                "Asynchronous activities lack direction",
                "More organization is needed with the assignments. I felt that the end of year project was not talked about at all until the due date."
