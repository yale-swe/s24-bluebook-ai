                "Kalla's great. really smart and nice. workload is never too much and exams are fair. would maybe like if lectures had a little bit more coding stuff included.",
                "Strengths - Accessible prof and TAs during office hours, labs/problem sets were approachable, interesting applications of coding and data science to electoral campaigns",
                "Weakness: quite a few assignments piled up with 2 midterms, a final paper, and a midterm essay in addition to the weekly psets",
                "I think the once a week format was a large strength of the course. It made me very excited to attend each week, and I think it allowed for true engagement with the material. I also thought the problem sets were fair but also stretched our knowledge, which I think is really important. I loved this class. The only weakness was that the essays/projects were not outlined very well (they were very vague), so I think it could be helpful to add more information about these assignments.",
                "Strengths: real-world application to the course. Prof Kalla, on the first day, said that this course would help us obtain an internship in political data analysis\r\nWeaknesses: labs would get very long. but doable. A better system for allowing people into the course must be implemented; there were way too many people advanced in Python to be enrolled in an introductory course. Assignments overlapped to the point where we had an essay, pset, and midterm due the same day.",
                "Very well planned out course, but not much material was covered",
                "Strengths: lectures were thorough and providing Lab Time allowed us to get extra help when needed, labs were spaced evenly and helpful in learning difficult concepts\r\n\r\nWeakness: The Second midterm was on an experiment with 2 treatments, something we never learned how to do in class. Given it was open-note and open-internet, I searched how to do the answer online, and they said it wasn't the way they wanted us to do it and took off a lot of points. They never taught us how to conduct the average treatment effects for these kinds of experiments, so I don't know why they expected us to calculate it in their standards.",
                "This class was extremely interesting in learning about how the political campaigns that surround us 24/7. I also enjoyed working with real world data (e.g., analyzing the results of Pittsburgh's unique election this past year).",
                "I think the major strength of this course comes from the fact that it's a highly marketable skill. Learning how to use python and its libraries, starts you at an advantage, should you decide to enter a data driven career/position.",
                "Some of the strengths of this course is Professor Kalla's lectures and office hours, which make it easy to complete the weekly problem sets.\r\n\r\nThere are no weaknesses to this course.",
                "Not well enough geared towards someone whos never coded before. Flies through the basics too fast.",
                "The strengths of this course were learning how to code and implementing this in my usage of future career aspirations involved in understanding political campaigns and their shifts. However, the weaknesses of this course are also prominent with little teaching of code in class and limited help from the professor in understanding the code.",
                "I think office hours could be more effective with one on one meetings.",
                "The course was quite enriching for one with no assumed prior knowledge or material to the content. However, at times the work overlapped (i.e. a five page paper was due at the same time as a problem set which was right before a midterm.) Though this overlap created a good review prior to the exam, this felt overwhelming at times since the class' midterm periods occurred around the midterm periods of campus at large. The course also featured in-class time to work on the problem sets which allowed you to ask for help from the teaching team in real time which was invaluable as it was sort of built-in office hours.",
                "I really enjoyed the psets and thought the midterms were helpful. However I wish we had more guidance for the final project.",
                "This should be a course whose focus is python. Python appeared in the homework but was never taught in class. If I were in control, I would teach Python in class and then leave the readings for homework. Maybe next semester, you could do python in class and then add reading discussions to the labs.",
                "It often felt like there was a disconnect between what we learned in class and the problem sets. I would have appreciated a little more harmony between the two -- maybe a bit of coding in class, or using the labs to dive more explicitly into a lecture topic.",
                "This course was great! I appreciated how Professor Kalla lectured. The course was not just a data science course, but rather, incorporated the inner-workings of campaigns. It could be improved by adding a bit more data science instruction to lectures to prepare for problem sets.",
                "Strengths: a very interesting subject. Also, Professor Kalla's research is super cool, and so it's very interesting to hear him present it.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n(1) the readings did not correspond with the lectures, which did not correspond with the tests, which did not correspond with the homeworks, which did not correspond with the labs. Felt confused about the big picture of the class until Thanksgiving time\r\n(2) The labs would have felt very hard for someone with no coding experience, and there wasn't a ton of help. Granted, I didn't go to office hours myself, but I don't think there was a lot of office hours opportunities.\r\n(3) This class was taught like a seminar... but with 90 people. It was great that the class was made to be interactive, but at times, it felt a bit forced. I don't think this question/answer style of lecture works very well when we have as many people as we did.",

                "Only if you are ready to put in the work. I think if you have never taken a single coding class, this class will teach you a lot but you have to be willing to put in the work. I think I spent more time doing labs for this class than I did on assignments for all my other classes COMBINED. The midterms were also very challenging, especially coding without your notes on the first midterm.",

Otherwise, you might find the other introduction to Python course or some other approaches such as CS50 more relevant to what you plan on doing in the future (at least in terms of building foundations).",
