I now have a better understanding of Deaf culture and the forms of stigma that the hearing community perpetuates."

I feel like they changed quite a few times through out the course of the semester (in terms of how many hours we would need in total\/breakdown of each component).\r\n\r\nReally kind instructors who are willing to help outside of class. I like that they center engaging with deaf culture through the community service hours.",

I have absolutely loved taking ASL; it's a great tool for communication, pushes you to think about how to express ideas in a unique way, and teaches you a lot about deaf culture. This course gave me a great foundation in the language and has made me really excited to continue taking ASL at Yale. Yale's ASL community is also really great in helping you learn the language, from official ASL events to just practicing with peers.",
