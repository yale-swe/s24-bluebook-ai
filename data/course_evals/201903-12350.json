   "comments": [
    "I gained a greater understanding of what are the fundamental texts, values, ideas, and people that helped form the Catholic intellectual tradition. I have a better perspective on the variability in Catholicism and the change it has gone through over time.",
    "I learned about the foundational texts of Catholicism as well as major players and events of the history of the faith. As a lifelong Catholic it was super interesting to learn more about why things are the way they are.",
    "This class is great for developing writing skills and learning to close-read primary historical documents. I feel that the insights I gained from this course extend far beyond what I expected. We truly covered the gamut of the history of the Catholic Church, reading and discussing everything from biblical texts and works by third century Church thinkers all the way through modern narratives, papal encyclicals, etc. It's a great course for learning how the Catholic Church has developed over time and how it has interacted with the wider non-Catholic world.",
    "A general overview of the development of philosophy within the Catholic Church. Not really a whole lot of history involved in this class, which was disappointing.",
    "I learned a lot about the Tradition and its importance in Western History. I read the great Catholic thinkers! It was amazing!",
    "An understanding of the all encompassing nature of the Catholic intellectual tradition and its vast impact on thought through the ages.",
    "I learned about how the Catholic Church has developed its doctrine.",
    "I learned about the history of Catholic thought over the course of the last 2000 years.  It's kind of like a best hits overview of Catholic philosophy, literature, and scholastic thought.",
    "Appreciation of the broad arc of Catholic history, understanding of the contributions of important Catholic thinkers.",
    "A greater understanding of the ways in which Catholic thought has developed over the centuries, and its place in the context of European society in general."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength was that we discussed great ideas, but a weakness was that too much reading was assigned at times and it was difficult to cover it with enough depth to touch back on the themes of the course.",
    "This is an excellent course overall. Lectures were fascinating, the readings were good and worthwhile, and section was engaging. The only thing I would change is perhaps having a few less guest lectures. The three professors of the course are simply incredible, and sometimes the guest lectures didn't seem worth it (although many of them were).",
    "I really enjoyed the use of guest lectures as this allowed us to hear from experts in very specific areas within history and religious studies. I found the structure of section in relation to the readings slightly odd because we were one week behind; however, I understand that this may be necessary since some sections will not have heard all the appropriate lectures before section.",
    "This course desperately needs structure and more historical background. The amorphousness of the lectures is only made worse by the revolving door of guest lecturers, who vary widely in quality. Providing a coherent set of lecture slides for each lecture would be the first step. Otherwise, we're just left reading wikipedia to try to get historical background on seemingly endless mounds of philosophy.",
    "Strengths - does a good job of covering an extremely long time period! Professor Eire is lovely and my TF was super engaged. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I wish we had talked more about specific readings during lecture and how they reflect the historical moment. Sometimes it felt like the lecture context was sort of irrelevant to what we would be talking about on the exams\/papers.",
    "Strengths-AMAZING readings\r\n\r\nWeakness-I wish Carlos Eire lectured more",
    "One of the greatest strengths of this course was section. In section the course really seemed to come together connecting the readings to the greater themes and trajectory of the course material. I also really enjoyed hearing from all of the guest lecturers, but one of the weaknesses of this course was the lectures. While always interesting, they did not always seem to fit into the wider course or connect to the readings for that week. The quality also varied greatly from class to class.",
    "Strengths: variety of guest lectures, interesting reading selections\r\n\r\nNo real weaknesses",
    "I thought this course did a good job of giving an overview of the history of Catholic thought for people, Catholic or not, with a limited background in the tradition.  Even as a practicing Catholic, I learned a great deal.  On the other hand, because there is so much content, we really had to fly through crucial authors and time periods.",
    "Strengths: The teaching staff was extremely enthusiastic, knowledgeable and engaged, which inspired interest and attention from the students. The use of guest lectures definitely keeps the course fresh and exciting. Readings were well chosen; essay prompts were interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's ambitious to cover as much material as we did and I like that the course brought us from the gospels to the present day. I think the 20th Century material got a little bit shortchanged -- e.g. in my section we didn't really have time to talk about Merton on Day at all. Flannery O'Connor never even made it to lecture :( I would think about trimming a bit (maybe from the Enlightenment?) to make it possible to go deeper into one or more of the moderns. Some of the guest lectures were more enthusiastic than informative  when you're only hearing about someone once there has to be a really clear story that comes through the lecture or else it just gets lost. The guest lecture on monasticism was my favorite; the one on Chardin was my least favorite.",
    "Strengths: Carlos and the guest lecturers were great. The sections and TAs really helped understand the readings and break down the relevant parts, which was very useful when we had weeks with 4+ readings in the hundreds of pages. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were a couple of lectures that were confusing and frankly not engaging, and this made it hard to see what that week's readings relevance was.",
    "Course material (readings) and small section discussions were very thought-provoking. Lectures were not uniform in type of content or quality, since there were three professors and many guest lecturers teaching the course."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the subject matter.",
    "Absolutely. If you have been Catholic your whole life, don't practice, or are not even Catholic or religious, this class is worth it. It is phenomenally taught and you really learn a ton without it ever being overwhelming.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in religious history. This is a comprehensive overview of the role of the Catholic Church and Christianity in general over the past 2000 years. I left with a much greater understanding of the structure of the Catholic Church as well as the development of both Catholic and Protestant doctrine.",
    "Don't take this course unless you love reading a ton of very dense philosophy texts. The ideas are somewhat interesting, but having minimal background on what most of the texts were actually written in response to removes most of the merit of reading these texts. Expect to spend about 6 hours reading the texts per week, provided you actually read the whole thing.",
    "Yes, but only if you have a strong interest in the subject to begin with. This is not the most accessible introduction to Catholicism or intellectual history as a project. And be prepared to do a lot of difficult reading!",
    "Absolutely, especially if this person is a Catholic",
    "Yes! It was so interesting, engaging, and it was a very fair course.",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely. This has been my favorite class Ive taken at Yale so far. Even if you are not Catholic, the material is interesting and Professor Eire is great.",
    "This is a great class if you're at all interested in learning more about Catholicism.  It's not too difficult with two 5 page essays and a midterm\/final that's basically just a check on whether you've been doing the readings.",
    "I would recommend it! Definitely a class where I looked forward to lecture. I would want to make clear to my friend that this is a survey course, and as such it doesn't go that deeply into any one thinker or theme. Therefore it might be best for people who don't know a lot about the material beforehand. I think you get a lot out of this course given how much effort you have to put in, but if you're looking for an intensive academic experience other classes might be better.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is curious and wants to learn about how thought has involved in the Catholic Church. It provides a lot of insight into how Catholic thought has influenced Western thought and vice-versa. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind, though, there were a lot more readings and were much longer than I anticipated. The workload itself is not high, but these weekly readings definitely need a decent amount of time to get done.",
    "Awesome class, especially as someone who isn't a Catholic. Learned a lot about a vibrant intellectual history and was able to weave interesting connections between different thinkers and doctrines.",
    "Definitely  great class.",
    "Yes! A great class to take even if you are not Catholic- the Christian authors we study have had a huge effect on the development western thought as a whole and it is necessary to study them to understand the ideas through which historical figures viewed the world.",
    "If you are interested in Catholic thought, almost every reading in the course (almost exclusively primary texts) is considered a famous text in the canon, so this is a great introduction. The lectures add fantastic context, alternating between more historical analysis and sometimes more intellectual discussion of the ideas.",
    "Yes, for the discussion sections. While some lectures were certainly interesting and well-delivered, however, others were not, and the overall effect of having so many different lecturers was confusing. Of course, it is valuable to hear the thoughts of many different people on a subject, but one of the things I enjoy most about lecture courses is hearing a single scholar develop his or her view on a topic over the course of many lectures - I find this generally allows for more depth and thorough explanation of ideas."
