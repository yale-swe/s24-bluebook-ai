    "This course will make you a better writer and will encourage you to explore Yale's vast collections and exhibits.",
    "I learned a lot about ancient civilizations and also about how archaeologists analyze artifacts to garner information about ancient cultures.",
    "As someone with no prior experience in archeology, I learned a lot about how make inferences based on the objects people left behind",
    "I learned how to analyze historical artifacts and learned a lot about the different ancient civilizations.",
    "I learned a bit about various ancient civilizations and cultures, as well as how to analyze archaeological artifacts.",
    "I learned all about ancient civilizations and the practice of archaeology. You will come out of this course thinking differently about world history and with a greater interest in the past.",
    "GOOD course",
    "I learned about how archaeology and anthropology can be used together to make great discoveries into past communities.  I also got a general overview of many of the world's great ancient civilizations.",
    "I learned a broad understanding of archaeology and important prehistorical trajectories from various regions around the world. I also learned how to analyze artifacts.",
    "Youll learn a general overview of ancient civilizations from Africa to South America.",
    "I learned about the process of uncovering archaeological sites, what steps need to be taken when digging on sites, and how to think like an archaeologist.",
    "Research and essay writing improved",
    "I learned about ancient civilizations and evaluating artifacts.",
    "I learned more about ancient civilizations and how they formed and lived.",
    "I not only learned about the history of many different ancient civilizations, but also how archaeologists analyze and look at artifacts to paint a better picture of what that past society was like.",
    "I learned a lot about the ancient civilizations of the pre and post pottery neolithic",

   "comments": [
    "This course is fantastic - the material is interesting and the lectures are engaging.",
    "There is a clear gap between graded material and the lectures, where the things you learn in class have little to do with the labs and the midterm and final paper.",
    "The labs are really interesting.",
    "The course is pretty boring. The lectures ramble on without saying much about each of the cultures. If the course needs to cover each civilization in one or two class periods, it should focus in on one aspect of the culture instead of trying to give a brief overview of everything we know about it. Use each culture as a case study on a specific topic instead of just summarizing them. \r\nI really enjoyed the labs, although I think more class time should be spent on learning the techniques necessary to complete them. For example, some background on bones (more than the short video of an expert classifying animals assigned) would have been helpful when completing the bone lab, which I felt vastly underprepared for.",
    "The courses were interesting but at times could have been more engaging. The information as a whole is pretty interesting anyways, though. Jargal is a great professor, and Kefs (the TA) was also helpful.",
    "Great professor, no improvements",
    "I thought one strength of this course was the labs done in conjunction with the Peabody Museum.  It really helped to be able to see artifacts up close and personal, and it was very nice to work with them.  No major weaknesses of this course in my opinion!",
    "Easy class with interesting info.",
    "The course was fairly engaging, but the lecture slides can be sometimes confusing. The readings are informative but can be a little dense. Class needs a better way of enforcing attendance or at least grading attendance.",
    "This class was pretty engaging and pretty interesting subject matter. Its a very low workload, so its a great fifth class. Interesting, not stressful, and the Professor is very empassioned about what he does, which makes it more exciting for students. The labs are also pretty cool because you get to handle real artifacts. Everyone should keep in mind though that its an overview of thousands of years worth of history so you dont go very much in depth.",
    "The labs were very helpful for making me think like an archaeologist.",
    "The strengths of this course were that the lecture notes were posted online and the lab times were convenient.",
    "Overall, this course was taught very well. I just think that this class could be improved by integrating in more lab activities because these activities taught me the most in the class.",
    "Strengths: Professor B was teriffic, and the material was interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: The Labs were somewhat irritating, as it was never super clear what was expected.",
    "strengths: well organized\r\nweaknesses: grading standards not clear"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes - even if you are not ANTH, take it.",
    "Yes. Jargalan Burentogtokh is a very interesting man who is great to know, and the labs and papers are easy if you get on top of them.",
    "Pretty interesting and gutty. Very engaging prof who cares a lot about students' learning",
    "Yes, because you can enjoy learning the material without worrying about grades.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. It covers too vast a topic to learn much that I couldn't have learned from a textbook. The labs are a good idea, but need to be integrated with the course better. Most of the students were not engaged at all, making class time boring. The readings were basically the same as the lectures, so there was no need to both read and go to class.",
    "I would recommend this as a fifth or sixth class if a student has any interest in the subject. It is low-stress and low-workload. Students get a hands-on learning experience.",
    "YES",
    "Absolutely! If you have an interest in ancient cultures, this is the class for you!",
    "It depends. For someone who is interested in anthropology or archaeology, I would not recommend this course because, while interesting, it does not develop skills or knowledge necessary for these majors. If you are not considering these majors but are interested in the subject matter, it is great.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in human history. Class meetings are early in the morning but its worth the walk.",
    "As a fifth class, definitely. I had a great experience in this class and have no complaints.",
    "Yes. Good class, not a lot of work. Lecture doesn't really correlate to the lab assignments or the paper. Still interesting material, but you're not tested on lecture stuff so there really isn't that much of an incentive to go to class.",
    "Yes. This course was very interesting and the labs were fun, while also being informative.",
    "Absolutely 100%... great professor, great course",
    "Yes, it is a good course to boost your self-esteem after failing your other classes.",
    "Yes it is interesting and you don't need to do very much work for it.",
    "Yeah. I'd recommend this class to anyone interested in pursuing archaeology because this course provides a good set of introductory skills and knowledge for the major.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "This is a great survey of ancient civilizations and cultures across the globe. Professor B is wonderful and it is worth taking this class to have him. I'll warn you that the labs get a little irritating because it is not always clear what is expected, but other than that this was a wonderful class.",
    "YES",
    "Yes"
