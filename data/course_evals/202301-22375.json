                "I learned to listen to music in a different way. I now know what to listen for, how to interpret what the artists were hoping to create, and why different choices were created throughout the songs. The course also opened my eyes to new and exciting types of music, such as free jazz. I now listen to jazz on normal days--something I did not do before.",
                "Excellent class, learned a lot of musical theory and musical analytical tools.",
                "I learned a lot about jazz history from post-WWII to today, as well as its positioning in important sociocultural and political context in African American history",
                "Learned about the influential musicians of the jazz genre from 1960-2000.  There is a bit more focus towards the 1960-80s but not as much near the 2000s.",
                "I learned about influential artists and the development of the jazz genre from 1960-the present.",
                "I gained knowlege about jazz musicians, trends, sub-genres and the social underpinnings of these evolutions from the 1960s to now. We talked about Hard Bop, Cool Jazz, Third Stream, Modal Jazz, Free Jazz, Smooth Jazz, World Jazz and some of the key musicians in each genre, while trying to describe what made each song\/artist jazz, or not.",
                "Greater knowledge and appreciation for \"modern\" jazz history and the canon that developed out of bebop and its derivatives during the oft forgotten decades of post-Charlie Parker jazz. Improved at identifying and articulating the sociocultural \/ political significance of different jazz pieces and expanded my ears beyond what one normally thinks of as traditional jazz.",
                "learned so much about how to think about jazz more critically through musical\/economic\/political\/cultural lenses. i just learned so much about how to appreciate the music",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths were mainly the professor, the TAs, and the content. It was always great to go to class and listen to different artists and analyze how they redefined jazz for the world.\r\nWeaknesses were the monotony in class style. On the last class we broke this up by having small student panels. I would encourage the professor to use this and other similar tools to change up the class format and energy.",
                "The Professor is extremely knowledgeable with the topic and engaging, TAs are good and material is well thought of. Would have a recap of musical theory tools for analysis at the beginning or in a section, especially for non-musicians. Would also make sure to keep in Nina Simone who was sadly skipped this semester because of time.",
                "The course had a great balance and interactions between active music-theoretical analysis\/listening and historical perspectives\/context.",
                "Prof Veal's lectures were very wordy and we spent a lot of time talking about names and dates. I wish that we could have explored the political\/social context of the jazz artists who we studied a little more to see how this influenced their music and the jazz genre.",
                "The course was off to a bit of a slow start, but overall I enjoyed the class. Professor Veal teaches with such zeal that it'd be difficult to not also be excited about what he's saying. Though not the focus of the class, necessarily, I think more clear examples of how jazz directly related to the social changes of their time could be more strongly argued near the beginning, as this is where I feel like I was the most lost\/confused.",
                "Each class had the perfect balance of historical backdrop and listening to the music itself. Because the course wasn't structured exactly in chronological order, at times it was challenging to connect the dots between lectures that covered vastly different corners of jazz history, but the big picture cultural movements and musical aesthetics were always graspable.",
                "This course will provide you with the foundational information about modern jazz genres such as beebop, hard jazz, modal jazz, and free jazz. You will be exposed to music that you've never heard before and learn about essential artists of the craft that don't often receive as much recognition as popular jazz artists. The only thing that could be improved upon in this course is the format; it is a lecture, but students could be encouraged to engage more with each other in lecture, since attendance is required.",
                "This course exposes you to so much interesting music in so little time! The only improvement I'd really wish for is that is was a semester longer. As it is, though, the course truly does cover jazz from 1960 to present in impressive breadth and depth.",
                "Strengths \r\n- well dictated \r\n- engaging\r\n- loved the discussions",
                "Strength is the professor and TAs"

                "Definitely, it's a great way to learn about applying a music analytical lens to history and vice versa",
                "I took this as the second part of the jazz courses for the music major. I think it connected well with the first course, and the instructor is good at cultivating your own sense of music analysis.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend to anyone interested in jazz, no matter their background! I learned a lot about jazz subgenres I'd never heard of before (and also why many people may not have heard of them), plus I got to understand how conduct better musical analysis.",
                "I would recommend the course to any music aficionado who is looking to expand their horizons and gain a greater appreciation for oft forgotten jazz artists and their many musical experiments that drove the life of the genre throughout the late 20th century.",
                "one of the best classes ive taken at yale i highly recommend",
                "Yes! Definitely, if you'd like to gain a comprehensive understanding of modern American jazz, take this course!",
                "Make sure you're willing to stretch your ears and practice your historical\/musical writing skills, but absolutely take this. It will undoubtedly challenge some preconceptions you probably have about free jazz, jazz-rock fusion, and other jazz from the late 20th century, and you'll come out of it a better historian, a better listener, and you'll really enjoy listening to jazz on a new level. The course really does require good reading and listening outside of class to keep up, but the lectures totally hold up if you miss the chance to fully read on a given week. That said, you do need to be accountable and it's worth it.",
                "I would totally recommend to take this class to any SOM student. Professor Veal was an expert in any topic we discussed and Jade and Nate too.",
