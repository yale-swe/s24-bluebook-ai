We also talked about other related topics like analyzing region building in Asia using sports, popular culture, etc. Finally, I learned how to critically examine articles with the article review midterm paper and write a research proposal (similar to that of a senior project) for the final paper."

                "Strengths - Professor Siu is so, so sweet and passionate about her work! She is an expert in her field and really cares about her students. With the small class size, she's even able to meet individually with all of them and talk about their final projects 1:1. Another strengths are the readings, particularly in the second half of the course, which are really fascinating. Never would I have thought of popular culture, or sports, as a means of building the Asian region before. We even got to watch a movie for one of the week's readings that talked a lot about the Hong Kong\/China situation. A final strength is Prof Siu's analysis and way of breaking down the readings. Upon reading them it's hard to see how they connect sometimes, but Professor Siu does a great job of segueing between them and showing them how they connect. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - This isn't really a big weakness, but we had some technical difficulties in the beginning of the course with Zoom that we eventually sorted out. A bigger weakness, though, is interactivity. Even though this course was marketed as a seminar, the seminars really were mainly lectures by Prof. Siu, and I would have loved to have seen more opportunities to speak about the readings and our takeaways. Granted, part of the students were undergraduates that were really shy being in the presence of graduate students, but still, additional encouragement to speak up would have been nice. In addition, one way to improve the course is making the lecture content less repetitive. While themes are a big part of this course, there were times when I felt like the same idea was being repeated multiple times within the same thread even already having gotten the point. Finally, I would have appreciated some more guidance on the midterm paper and final paper. For undergraduates who have never written an article review or research proposal before, I think providing some sample papers would be very helpful, especially because this type of work is more familiar to the graduate students taking the class. Prof Siu went through the structure of the paper which was useful, but some more guidance on this front would have been nice."

                "I feel like because the majority of this course was really a lecture despite it being a seminar, I would have loved if Prof. Siu could have recorded her lectures on the readings asynchronously and uploaded them in advance, and then we could have met every week in \"section format.\" That is, rather than have students listen to her lecture live, a really effective way of teaching this class and increasing opportunities for speaking up would be having asynchronously recorded lectures, with synchronous sections during our normal meeting times, perhaps condensed to 1 hr, to just discuss the readings and lectures and be truly interactive."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course, but with a couple of caveats. Overall, Prof Siu is super sweet and passionate about her field, the workload (weekly readings) are not that bad at all (*with the exception of the final paper, more on that below), and the content itself really challenges your conceptions and notions of Asia. If you're looking for an interesting class to take, I would recommend it! There are some weaknesses which should be addressed as mentioned above, but overall it's a solid class.\r\n\r\n*workload wise, know that the final paper is insanely long (25 pages double spaced!) for an undergraduate class. it can get deceptive early on with the midterm review paper only being 5 pages double spaced and the readings being rather short, so I would recommend that anyone thinking of taking this class either 1) gets started on the final paper asap after the midterm or 2) credit\/d's the class to take some of the academic pressure off. (40% of your grade depends on the final paper!) That being said, Prof Siu is really accommodating to the undergraduates and understanding, so don't be afraid of it since she'll help you through it and be completely willing to meet with you."
