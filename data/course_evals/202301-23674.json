                "Everything was great. The class was really engaged and we all learned a lot, all of the activities were really useful.",
                "The class meets four times a week which means that you can get a lot of practice with Italian if you choose to participate. The teachers are also amazing and Deborah is incredible and very understanding. A weakness of the course is that we don't really studying Italian culture, until maybe the last few days of class. I wish there was more of a focus on culture.",
                "Pros: The course is well organized, the instructors are good, the in class exercises are fun. Cons: Way too much material is crammed into this course and some of the reading assignments are incomprehensible. \r\n\r\nI think this course could be improved by pushing congiuntivo and periodo ipotetico to L3. The remaining time could be used to practice and reinforce material. I felt like a lot of the stuff I learned was forgotten immediately because I didn't have enough time with it before moving on to the next topic.",
                "Strengths: \r\nGreat teaching and emphasis on grammar. Attending class everyday allows you to understand spoken Italian better too.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nNot a lot of room to make mistakes when writing essays. Not a lot of emphasis on speaking and conversation."
