                "Strengths: Professor Kumbhar and his clear care for students and making the classroom environment a safe space where everyone feels welcome to participate. The assignments and readings reflected a great deal of thought in the goals of what we should take away from the class, and I learned so much from my peers and the small group environment. Weaknesses: none.",
                "Strengths: very interesting material, cool readings, great professor. I liked the midterm assignment\r\nWeaknesses: it often felt like we were talking about the same themes every week (modernity and tradition). I would have loved more focus on other themes as well that may be related to the main theme of the course -- our readings touched on a lot of other ideas that I would have loved to discuss more in depth.",
                "The strengths were that Professor Kumbhar was very amicable and always available for extra help and questions.\r\nNo major weaknesses, maybe providing a clearer rubric for the midterm essay and review essay. Additionally, it would have been helpful if we were given a short lecture on the context/history of the time period we were reading, just so we had a solid foundation for discussion. The discussion sometimes fell flat, therefore discussion questions before hand would be great to start the conversation flowing.",
                "Readings were fantastic! I would have never come across them without this class, and it really opened a new world of thinking about non-Western history of medicine. Kiran Kumbhar is also such a knowledgeable professor and gem of a human being. Sometimes the material was a little dense and could be repetitive, but it was overall a fantastic course.",
                "This course was very well structured, it had great readings and I really appreciate Professor Kumbhar for including other forms of media like music videos, documentaries, social medial posts, and lay journalism. The use of powerpoints and opening activities to set the tone for class was great. The writing assignments were both academically relevant and personally fulfilling. The final assignment was good for building analysis skills that can be used in future classes and daily life.",
                "This was a great class! The professor made the environment very engaging, and the material was very interesting",
                "The course is very good at teaching you a broad and general understanding of various aspects of tradition and modernity.",
                "The readings in this course were incredible, but I think the in class discussions could sometimes feel a little unstructured",

It is super insightful and helps you become a more critical thinker. While most of the focus is on South Asia, some aspects of the course allow you to learn about other regions in the Global South (like the midterm paper and final paper).",

                "Definitely recommend this course to get a deeper understanding of the binary between traditional and modern medicine in South Asia.",
                "Yes! It was great! It's pretty rare in the HSHM department that you get to take courses that focus on the non-Western history of science. This was a great course to delve right into that material. The material is cool history of medicine and traditional medical forms that you can really not study anywhere else. Also, Kiran Kumbhar is fantastic!",
