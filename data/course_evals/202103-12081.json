                "Strengths: interesting class, good balance of work for other classes, lifelong skills, variety of lectures from Lisa and guest lectures from the graduate school; I learned quite a bit about different photographer's perspectives and what makes a meaningful photograph, which has continued to influence how and what I shoot. I found getting that kind of exposure to other artists incredibly valuable! I think the course would have been even better if there were more group discussion after these lectures. The beginning of the course was more lecture heavy from Lisa, which was more conducive to discussions because we were all in the classroom. Those were valuable for me. Towards the end, it seemed like there was more of an emphasis on listening (but not fully processing these guest artists) and getting into the darkroom to make photographs, which is important, but many of us were doing that outside of class time. I think the class may have benefited from more group discussions about the guest artists and students' own work before critiques, so maybe one or two more classes devoted to discussion or lecture rather than the darkroom?",
                "the course provides a solid technical introduction to photographyi am now able to shoot, develop, and print on my own, and understand the basics of the craft. i also have basic knowledge of the history of black and white photography. \r\n\r\nbecause the course assignments heavily center street photography, i think a conversation about the ethics and practice of street photography should happen much earlier in the semester to ensure that students navigate new haven with respect and thoughtfulness.",
                "This is is a great class and Lisa is a fantastic professor. Its hard to balance hands on time with theoretical discussions, and we tended to do more of the former which I was glad for.",
                "Wonderfully taught. Could use more discussion of formal technique.",
                "Lisa is such a gem. She is extremely kind and approachable, not to mention super supportive and helpful to all of her students. Our class got along well, and I had a lot of fun getting to know everyone in the darkroom. The class is well organized and structured, and Lisa is great at communicating with her students about what the weekly assignments were. There really was no weakness. If I could change one thing, it would be to add more time between the pre-Thanksgiving critique and the final critique. I felt like there wasn't enough time after Thanksgiving break to print out my pictures for the final.",
                "The class was structured well in that we were given weekly assignments, though whether we had to actually comply in printing these particular photos for critique was up to us. It would have been nice to start developing and printing earlier in the semester and learning fundamental techniques like dodging and burning earlier, though some difficulties with the darkroom slowed us down at the beginning."

The type of work (shooting, developing, printing), and getting exposure to such an inspirational range of guest (and student) photographers was a truly unique experience, and something that will inform my artistic perspective for the rest of my life. There is an impressive arts community at Yale and this intro class gave me a glimpse into what is happening in it.",

                "Absolutely! This class will make you think and learn in ways that most other classes will not. You'll be working with your hands and physically exerting yourself, but in my opinion it allows you to access a place of catharsis in the darkroom.",
