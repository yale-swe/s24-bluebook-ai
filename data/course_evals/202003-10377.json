                "A comprehensive, nuanced overview of Jewish history from the antiquity to the pre-Renaissance. The course constantly challenged my preconceived notions about Jewish history, capturing a diverse range of rich Jewish perspectives from large swaths of the Jewish community that provided a more holistic picture of Jewish history and its implications for Judaism today. In addition, I found the research paper assignment quite helpful because it enabled me to draw interesting parallels between two seemingly unrelated sources and to think about these sources almost as a scholar would in this field. I definitely honed my analytical thinking and writing skills through this assignment.",

Maybe there could be an optional weekly or biweekly discussion section, in which students could engage with the material together and raise stimulating questions to further students' understanding. This would complement the regular course, which is taught almost exclusively in a lecture format.",

                "Professor Marcus is knowledgeable and the sources he curates are interesting. The biggest weakness of this class is that Professor Marcus lectures with no space for questions, and there is no discussion section, so students are mostly on their own when it comes to following along and making sure they are absorbing all of the material. I think the class would benefit from a discussion section, or at least more engagement with the professor.",
                "the course could be more engaging. yet I have to admit the lectures were fascinating",
                "The material was incredibly interesting and put together in a thoughtful manner. I would have enjoyed more class discussions.",
