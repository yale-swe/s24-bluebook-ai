It taught me multitudes on public health in the Arab world, from the inner workings of health systems to the intersections of politics and human rights to environmental threats and so much more. It was very much needed, as the subject is already so vague and requires many more academics to enrich it; but it was rewarding in that the big field names were the same individuals who spoke with us during our sessions. Super super insightful."

Maybe the writing assignments could have been a bit more clearly articulated in terms of what was required, but still, I felt like it was all very straightforward and we knew what we were going to be doing at almost every session."

If you are interested in public health, the Arab World, human rights/education, accessibility, business/management, anything at all, I feel like theres something for you In this class. Always so engaging and so interesting. Dr. Nuwayhid is a gem of a professor, and Yale would be lucky to have him teach this course again."
