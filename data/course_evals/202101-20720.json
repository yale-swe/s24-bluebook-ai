                "No weaknesses come to mind with this course. The instructor was exceptionally kind and generous in leading our reading and prodding us towards accurate translations, and the comradery of my classmates was admirable. The readings were engaging and managed to give us a nuanced background in salient issues of Roman history (especially sexuality/gender, class dynamics, enslavement) while also challenging us grammatically. Language learning can often feel like a form of academic hazing, but this class was by contrast extremely warm, welcoming and rigorous; I felt that each student was being met where they were as a learner and their needs accommodated for. All feedback was kind and constructive.",
                "This course's pacing was very fast in the beginning, after mid term, things slowed down significantly. That is not to say that the class was easier, just that the pacing was much more relaxed after the Learn to Read Latin Book was completed. I felt that the pacing could have been slowed down to only leave about 4 weeks of translating passages so that the initial pacing of LATN 110 and 120 were not as extreme perspectively.",
                "This course was excellent! CJ adapted the course very well to the exigencies of covid. He is a talented and skilled teacher, and I learned a great deal.",
                "Overall good course, especially with Covid!",
                "This class was well taught and concepts were covered thoroughly. The downside to this class is that it moves extremely fast."

They are an excellent example of inclusive, rigorous language pedagogy from someone with a clear passion for teaching and the classics.",
