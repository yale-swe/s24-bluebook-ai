As much time as possible is spent painting, instructors walk around during these long painting sessions to provide advice and to converse about the direction of each student's work. Long stretches of working on pieces are broken up with critiques which are good for taking a step back and trying to figure out how one can improve their work. \r\n\r\nThat being said, my main complaint with this course is that people are scared to give negative feedback with critiques. Classmates often feel uncomfortable genuinely \"critiquing\" other's work and instead resort to a stream of compliments that do not prove to be entirely useful for understanding how you can improve. While the instructors often balanced this out with thoughtful criticism, I would have appreciated if the instructors emphasized and described at the beginning of the course how students can respectfully and effectively give constructive criticisms. I think my work and the work of my classmates would have benefited from this.",
                "Maybe a few more demos would be helpful, but overall a great course",
