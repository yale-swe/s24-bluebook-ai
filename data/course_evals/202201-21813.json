                "There was way too much reading - it was challenging to manage and we rarely discussed most of it. The class would be better if shorter, more specific excerpts were selected for discussion. The content was fascinating and Manon is brilliant. However, I don't think that a seminar format was the best possible format for this class. Since all of us were relatively unfamiliar with Beauvoir's work and with continental philosophy more broadly, it was rare that we contributed something particularly valuable to class discussions. I think it would be better as a lecture - Manon is incredibly engaging and knows so much about Beauvoir. We also got very little feedback on our work."
