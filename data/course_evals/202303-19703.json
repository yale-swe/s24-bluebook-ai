                "Strengths: The class really emphasizes speaking. We constantly had conversation practice in class time, discussing our readings or using new grammar points. We also had a lot of presentations, which were nerve-wracking but very helpful. The topics we discussed were very relevant and engaging. We learned much about Japanese culture, which is really helpful for people who plan to study abroad or work in Japan. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we learned more grammar. We learned only about four new grammar points each lesson. The textbook has much more than that, but the explanation and example sentences were often not comprehensive enough, so I wish we went over them in class as well."
