    "In this class, I learned about philosophers, their theories, sociological concepts and how these theories tested these concepts. It was interesting to be able to see the discrepancies between each of the theories and in turn, formulate my personal opinions of these complex sociological concepts.",
    "You do learn quite a bit about a series of different thinkers. Studying for midterms and writing papers does lead to you eventually realizing that you know more, despite not enjoying the class throughout the semester",
    "I learned so much about Sociology and Philosophy and actually learned way more than I thought I would.",
    "How to think about famous sociologists and philosophers' theories. Mostly just learned a basic overview of each.",
    "Important Sociological theorists.",
    "a narrow overview of how some key thinkers present their ideas and fit together.",
    "This course provided an incredible foundation in a series of philosophers and social scientists discussing social theory. This philosophical approach to social bodies was quite interesting and made a subject that can sometimes be boring very interesting and relevant.",
    "I gained a survey of many of the world's greatest theorists and their beliefs on the conception of time, relationship between others, and many other relationships.",
    "You read works from some famous sociologists & philosophers, like Nietzsche, Foucault, Kant, WEB DuBois, Rousseau, Simone de Beauvoir, Judith Butler, etc. It was a mix of political philosophy and social theory. You gain some insight on the questions they addressed and the contexts these authors wrote in.",
    "An introduction to many major Western philosophers. The focus was not on digging deep into a few authors, but rather a survey of the field and the themes that prevail. I learned how to parse some really challenging but foundational texts  in transcendentalism, existentialism, and pragmatism.",
    "Learned about various political\/social theorists.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of the thinkers in modern social theory that opened my worldview considerably and undermining assumptions about capitalism, race, and gender.",
    "This is a breadth course on social theory through the staple European and American theorists. We read and discuss integral human topics like space, time, social forms, economics (capitalism, division of labor, bureaucracy), morality, sympathy, punishment, totalitarianism, racism, sexism, etc.",
    "I learned about a number of important modern social theorists and read their most important work.",
    "This course helped me learn about the basics behind political philosophy. and gave a detailed overview of western philosophers from the past couple centuries.",
    "Great survey course to help me gain a broad understanding of the key thinkers in political philosophy and political sociology!",
    "We gained a survey\/general knowledge of the most foundational theorists in the initial history of sociology.",
    "I learned about famous philosophers and sociologists and their theories of social life.",
    "A little bit of information about some of the social theorists that are important, though I can't really tell you what social theory is.",
    "I learned a lot about social theory and now I, truly, have foundations for further social theory and sociology. This class has also allowed me to develop some reading skills. such as reading management, as a first-year.",
    "A good intro to political philosophy!",
    "I'm glad the lectures explained a lot of the core concepts because the readings alone can be very confusing",
    "An understanding of sociology that was both deeply rooted in classical and defining texts while still being incredibly applicable outside of the field of sociology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of the strengths of this course is that the professor had a deep comprehension of the concepts that she was teaching so students were able to go to her if they did not understand some of the material. Some of the weaknesses were that all students weren't particularly engaged in the material or lectures at all times.",
    "Strengths: I think this class is set up in a fashion that makes it easy to do well if you take the time to understand the gist of the thinkers' arguments. They have support structures through section (which may or may not be helpful) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Is this is often very unengaging. I didn't a need to keep up with the class until exams.",
    "The slides could be SO MUCH better. If you miss one lecture, you're kinda screwed. Otherwise, the professor is extremely smart and engaging.",
    "Should not be taught in lecture format. Engagement was horribly low, people did not have time to read such dense and complicated readings for each meeting. Would much prefer less reading per week, but more smaller group discussion",
    "I loved this class. The professor was great as was the material",
    "it provides a decent overview of some key thinkers but it is very superficial and not too much more than what can be gleaned from reading the texts. It would be good to have more comprehensive critique.",
    "This class is a great at providing a quick understanding of theorists and how their theories are relevant today.",
    "Strengths: you get exposed a lot of intellectuals. You get the midterm prompts a week before the exam, so you can prepare your essays without having to memorize all the philosophers. You get the final paper prompts about 2 weeks before the paper is due.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were kinda dry and readings were EXTREMELY long. I also didn't learn much about the disciplines of philosophy or social theory. You don't learn how to ask philosophical questions or even learn much about how to read philosophy. This class felt more suited for people who liked theory and philosophy already and didn't really make the field more digestible for people who are new to it. \r\nAlso, SLIDES WERE EXTREMELY UNHELPFUL--there were maybe two words per slide, most of the pictures didn't have captions. It was extremely frustrating if you missed a lecture or were trying to review before an exam. And Professor Erikson didn't even post all the lecture slides to Canvas.",
    "Professor Erikson is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale! The content was extremely well organized, and although the class moved quickly, it was easy see the relation from one lecture to the next. It can be frustrating moving on from a philosopher you're still trying figure out, but the TAs and the professor are super understanding and only stress major themes. The environment in the classroom facilitated productive learning.",
    "I loved learning about most of the theorists, but I wish we stayed longer with each of them, and the latter 1\/3 of the semester was too rushed. The readings were very interesting, although there were a lot of them every once in a while. I honestly think the course would be better off with no exams and three papers instead of two exams and one paper because there is only so much you can write about a theorist in 50 mins.",
    "I wish a thread could have been more overtly tied between all the lectures to demonstrate a progression. There obviously was one but I only became aware of it towards the end. It would have been helpful to compare idealists like Kant and Hegel with Marx and the Existentialists (material lived experience). Why was this change so momentous? \r\n\r\nAlso, I didnt have a clear idea of what the competing conceptions of modern social theory were. Were they just the systems of the various thinkers? It would have been helpful to group them into modernists, postmodernists, structuralists, poststructuralists, essentialists, nonessentialists and really define these terms.",
    "Lecture was great. It was well-facilitated for student learning. Professor Erikson was able to concisely organize important messages from the mass amounts of dense readings. Feedback from the midterms was non-existent, however. The guidelines for the final paper were also not clearly written.",
    "I thought it was well balanced and well structured. I would have liked more feedback on my assignments and a better understanding of expectations.",
    "The lecture and section were both enormously helpful to understanding the assigned readings, making it easier to navigate through the difficult passages.\r\nThe slides however, do not contain much information, so it is important to show up to class.",
    "The readings were interesting and lectures tied in really well with them. A little more synthesis across texts might have aided my global understanding of the material, and midterm prompts could have been written to provoke more individual thought on the part of the student, rather than just asking for a regurgitation of the material.",
    "The course lacks any sort of accountability for students, and the grade distribution seems unfair. It is structured so that there are only two midterms and a final paper. After the second midterm, attendance decreased notably, since there was absolutely no rational incentive for students to show up. It was incredibly easy to get away with not doing any of the readings, since they made no impact on the grade or discussion. It's true that Yale students have a degree of intrinsic motivation, but the reality is that we're busy, and if there is something that we're expected to do that has no impact on our grade or experience in the course, it will logically sink to the bottom of our priority list.",
    "Strengths for this course are Professor Eriksons lectures, which were well-structured for students, and the subject matter itself. Weaknesses, though, are section, as it is not really helpful or productive, and the exams did not facilitate learning. I wouldve liked a paper assignment or two in place of the exams. Section was poor as we never held true discussions or debates in class. As a result, I dont feel Ive become a better thinker through this class as Id hoped.",
    "strengths- ability to simply explain complex topics\r\nweaknesses- lack of attention given to more confusing topics",
    "More time spent actually explaining the content. Less time for \"questions\", more structured lectures.",
    "Strengths: thorough lessons; engaging topics \r\nImprovements: more work by people of color; less reading or more time for reading",
    "I would have appreciated delving into the various thinkers' work more deeply both in readings and in class.",
    "There is a huge amount of reading and I really could not read everything",
    "This was a fabulous course. I have no complaints about the syllabus, how it was taught or how it was tested. This course made me aggressively wish that I had taken it earlier in my Yale career so that I could have been a sociology major. I loved this class."

    "If you enjoy learning about the structures of society and about important figures and philosophers that have shaped the way in which we view our contemporary society, this class is for you.",
    "Only if you have to take it for Socy. Otherwise just read it yourself or take a better one.",
    "Kinda only if its required, I learned a lot, but it was hella reading. Kinda easy grading (I think)",
    "No. Didn't learn very much, though that could also be because I was not incredibly interested to begin with (this is a required class for the Sociology major). I bet if you were really interested and did all the readings, the class could be interesting.",
    "Yes. I feel as if I have a good understanding of the works of major theorists.",
    "Yes. Surprisingly really interesting and not too hard.",
    "I would recommend it for those who do not have a background in philosophy or social theory especially.",
    "No, unless you are majoring in sociology since it's mandatory, or if you already really like philosophy. Otherwise, it's not a great intro course into the subject, and there are other intro courses where you can read these writers.",
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely - this was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a survey course on political\/social theory.",
    "I would recommend this course to the student willing to go beyond the mere readings and lectures and spend the time thinking about the concepts and theories. I think this is necessary to get out of the class what it is designed for. Otherwise you are reading very difficult texts and might just get confused or frustrated. This is definitely a more philosophical course than I think most Poli Sci people would be ready for.",
    "Yes. You gain a good base of knowledge of important philosophy and theory that will be useful for the rest of your academic career and life.",
    "Decent class, good review of important social theory and philosophy. Lecture is engaging and the professor is great.",
    "Absolutely! I loved the concepts explored and the sociological lens that was applied.",
    "A great class for intro to social theory. The readings are a bit dense but Prof. Erikson explains all of the important parts during lecture. Two midterms and a final paper so the work load is rather light, just make sure to try and keep up with the readings.",
    "I would not recommend it to someone who is not a sociology major. There are more engaging courses that probably go over the same theories in a way that is more applicable to current society.",
    "Yes, but only if section is changed and more papers (or chances to learn) exist.",
    "only if they have an interest in philosophy",
    "No, unless required. Not fun for just an SO credit",
    "I would recommend this course. It's an intellectual challenge to capture the theorists' ideas and allows you to engage in your own way while building your perspective.",
    "Sure, but only if they want a survey course.",
    "Yes if they ar prepared to read a lot",
    "Absolutely take this course. It will reward you if you take the time to go into the texts and will set you on the path to find follow-up writings to help expand your knowledge, and if you find the readings too demanding to keep up with, it is still taught in such a way that you are given the essential aspects of each reading that you need in order to utilize them as a springboard for understanding the world."
