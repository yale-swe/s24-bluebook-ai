                "Professor Conlin is absolutely a strength of the course! I'd love to see more field trips around campus or in the museums, those were super fun. We didn't really have time for the poetry module this semester so I'd love to see some more of that, and some more time dedicated to the slang, puns, idioms, etc. Oh! and some more opportunities to do narratives. \r\n\r\nThe journals and readings absolutely stepped up a level this semester and took some more time, but all of the readings were interesting.",
                "Strengths: extremely interactive and engaging, each class was fun and required us to interact with our classmates and learn more about them\r\n\r\nWeakness: a lot of time required outside of class for service hours-- a lot of the time conflicted with student practices or other academic/club events; would love if they added more virtual service options or ways to receive hours that are not in person to account for this",
