    "Professor Bakker is a genius. You must read with him before you leave Yale. He is a complete master of the Homeric poems, so studying with him is unlike studying with anyone elsesort of like studying with Harold Bloom or David Bromwich, in that everything is in his memory and every comment he makes, however small, is motivated by deep knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course was primarily the room. Future courses *must* sit around a seminar table. The result was that this course did not feel like a seminar. Because there were smart people in the room, I wish I had heard more from my fellow students."

    "100%. If you study Greek, you need to dive deep with Homer, and Bakker is the one to do it with. You'll be thinking about questions that don't normally cross your mind (less literary criticism, more linguistics or philology), but it's all good stuff.",
