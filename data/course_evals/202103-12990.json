                "A deeper understanding of the nuts and bolts of the causes and mechanisms of climate change, as well as the challenges. and solutions. This class also helped me see a way forward with the daunting task of addressing climate change through mitigation and adaptation strategies.",
                "I gained a more thorough understanding of the science and politics behind climate change.",
                "This is the best course I have ever taken at Yale and by far the best professor I have ever had. Scott led us through climate change from the very beginning--no prior knowledge was required nor needed. I have not taken physics since middle school and everything was taught superbly. This has been such a useful course.",
                "This course was phenomenal. It truly changed and developed my perspective on how to think about climate change, as well as on how to engage in conversation surrounding climate change. I really enjoyed learning about both the science and policy behind the crisis that we are currently facing.",
                "I have a much better understanding of the science behind climate change and what strategies are available to combat the issue, as well as what limitations stand in the way.",
                "I learned SO MUCH about climate change: what it is, how it impacts our world, and what to do about it. Professor Scott dives deep into each of these topics so that you have a full understanding of climate change. You get a well-rounded understanding of climate change, viewing it from the perspective of multiple subjects: science, technology, history, economy, political science, and sociology. You learn how to understand climate change models, climate change policy, and the long-term effects of climate change. Professor Scott also debunks some \"common knowledge\" about climate change, which I found fascinating. This class really makes you think about how what climate change is and how we approach the topic and solutions for it.",
                "I learned so much from this course. I learned about the physical science behind climate change, the various problems that would ensue as a result of climate change, the economics behind climate change, international efforts to mitigate climate change and what feasible solutions would be. It's a perfect crash-course to climate change.",
                "This course is structured to teach the science behind the greenhouse gas effect, consequences of climate change, and then potential solutions/ considerations to prevent the worst case scenarios by reducing and eliminating future emissions. This includes the exploration of concepts like black body radiation, climate feedback that influences the severity of greenhouse gas effect, climate and weather models, and the Kaya identity. The assignments go through a variety of models to help the understanding of how many climate predictions are made.",
                "A whistlestop tour of climate change and its solutions from the fundamental physics to the economics and social cost of the challenge. It was an incredible course that left very few questions unanswered except for the ones professors and researchers like Scott are still trying to answer."

                "I honestly do not have any weaknesses. I know during the mid-semester feedback some people complained that we went off topic too much, but honestly that was the fault of the students since we would ask questions (sometimes not directly related to the material) and then Scott would answer. This has been an incredible course. Scott cares so much about his students and is passionate about the course. I wish he would teach at Yale full time because I would take every one of his courses. I have learned more than in any other course and felt supported and encouraged throughout.",
                "This course was extremely well designed. The unit division was really well put together, with each unit building off the prior one. It was very satisfying to have the content being learned fit together like puzzle pieces. I think it helped increase understanding. The assigned problem sets were also always great ways to engage with the course content. The whole course was super accessible.",
                "Strengths: well organized content, clear syllabus, professor denning is an amazing lecturer, the Tfs are very helpful and they want you to do well \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class could get off topic pretty fast sometimes",
                "Strengths: Professor Scott is an amazing lecturer! The class is well organized and broken down into 13 modules, which each fit into one of 3 categories. I really appreciated how this class had supplemental material that you could watch/read online if you didn't understand parts of the lecture, or if you missed it. Class was fun and really engaging.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes we would go off on too many tangents- which were interesting- but I thought were probably more appropriate in office hours. I just thought the material was really cool, so I liked staying on topic for the most part.",
                "I thought that the course was designed perfectly and I learned so much. Professor Scott is amazing and has put a lot of work over the years into designing this course, so it perfectly delves into each area of interest when studying climate change. By the end, it comes together to give you the big picture. I don't think anything needs to be improved.",
                "The class is very well organized. In a sense it almost felt like a flipped class because all of the lecture slides and recordings of the lecture topics were online, therefore a lot of time was taken to answer questions or discuss confusion since there was less concern about getting to everything. However the lectures did not assume any prior preparation and were therefore all the more engaging. The structure of the courses was perfect to prime students with the scientific background to understand the details of the cause of climate change, explore the impacts, but the. End on a not of positivity that inspires future learning and action.",
                "Before I begin: Incredibly class, amazing professor, I was highly engaged all semester and am so happy I got the chance to take this class. \r\n\r\nThe TA sections/office hours were non-helpful entirely. The students that went frequently took up most of the time asking questions about high school chem (a pre-req for the class, and very easily google-able questions), or asking questions like but, why?."

Professor Denning was able to teach us so much in one semester and made an extremely complex topic feel easier to learn. He is an incredibly gifted lecturer!",
                "If this course is offered again, YOU NEED TO TAKE IT! This should be required for every single Yale student to take, no matter of major. It perfectly melds the science of climate change with economics, ethics, policy and human rights. I have such a deeper understanding of our world, our society, and the challenges we are facing for our future.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was a course that I felt really emphasized student learning and the content was super interesting and well thought out. This course can easily be added to a schedule without worries of stress or bore.",
                "Yes this was one of my favorite classes at Yale by far.",
                "YES! Not only because of what you learn, but because Professor Scott cares more about you LEARNING than anything else. He makes this material ACCESSABLE to everyone- environmental studies major or not! If he comes back to teach this class, TAKE IT!",
                "Cannot recommend this course enough, I think it's the best course I've taken at Yale yet. It's one of those classes you come to Yale to take. I learned so much and I now I am so inspired to fight climate change that I want to dedicate my life to it. It's such a well designed class and the workload is not too heavy considering how much you learn. Professor Scott is extremely helpful, passionate and fun. It's really the ideal class and everyone regardless of major should take it.",
                "Absolutely! This is definitely one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. Because of the clear structure of the lectures, there is little background knowledge needed to take the class and the subject is clearly very important! Unfortunately Professor Denning is a visiting professor from Colorado but should Yale ever have him back to teach again I highly recommend taking any of his classes. He clearly puts I. The time and effort to plan the classes well, and",
                "100% YES YES YES. \r\nScott was an incredible teacher, its a shame that hes not a full-time tenured professor at Yale. Scotts teaching was complemented by 2 incredible TFs Gracie and Arunima.  \r\nThe subject matter was always fascinating and was incredibly good at explaining in a watertight fashion the ins and outs of climate change and the solutions.",
                "Absolutely! Im sure the other comments will be raving too, and if Scott has the chance to teach here again you should take his class no matter the content!"
