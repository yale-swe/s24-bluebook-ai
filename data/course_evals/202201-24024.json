                "I learned about the horrors of the criminal justice system, especially how prisons operate like storage units. It was incredible to hear about Professor Bolus's personal experiences in prison and how inmates are mentally and physically beaten down within prisons. I also learned about how traditional, harmful forms of masculinity are empowered within prisons.",
                "I learned about the inner and corrupt system of the criminal justice system along with the culture within prisons.",
                "Learned so much about the reality of whats going on in our prisons, police stations and court rooms because of the expertly chosen readings.",
                "Learned about the criminal justice system, prison culture, and how to fix problems within our prison systems.",
                "This was the most insightful course I have taken at yale, taught by the most real and knowledgeable professor Ive had. Important class about prison culture, law enforcement, the Constitution, etc.",
                "A better understanding of the culture and corruption within police departments (especially in cities), details on prison life and the training\/work of prison guards, a comprehensive look at the non-traditional approach and conditions that cause crime, and many insightful stories from Professor Bolus!",
                "I learned a lot about the corruption of the justice system, from the courtroom to police to COs in prison and beyond. Roy Bolus is an incredible person who used his experience to enlighten his students."

            "comments": [
                "This class is a great way to learn about the prison system from different perspectives. Through this course, you will learn about how the system was constructed to prey upon and exploit Black Americans, how prison guards are taught to treat inmates like animals, and the immense corruption within police precincts across the country, especially in NY in the 77th precinct. One weakness may be that the class is not very intersectional and does not highlight the experiences of female, queer, and trans inmates. However, the class is a great way to learn more about the extensive prison industrial complex and further educate students passionate about prison abolition.",
                "The strength is the classes rely on interesting readings and discussions rather than textbooks and writing. A weakness is at time it felt like the schedule\/syllabus did not match up, it could get confusing.",
                "The strength is really that everyone involved is so passionate, but the course is not so intense, so its easy to get a lot out of it and be super engaged. It really feels like a no-BS course that is just telling you how it is in reality. A weakness is that you dont get a lot of clear feedback throughout, so you dont really know how to improve or whats being looked for sometimes.",
                "Great variety of reading, Prof Bolus is amazing and really cares. He expects a lot in regards to reading comprehension but it helps you learn better",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Professor Bolus!!! He always kept us on our toes in class and made sure that everyone had space to share their opinions\r\n- engaging readings that contained a lot of helpful information for a career in law or within the realm of justice\r\n- meaningful assignments (I learned a lot from writing my midterm and final research papers!)\r\n- incredibly helpful insight from Professor Bolus on his experiences and how they relate to bigger systems and concepts within the law",
                "Strengths are the reading materials, guest speakers, workload, and professor. Some improvements could be giving more specific instructions regarding essay assignments and posting grades on Canvas throughout the semester."

                "Absolutely, I think everyone who has the opportunity should take this course, regardless of prior exposure to the subject.",
                "Definitely  learning from Prof Bolus has been a highlight of my yale experience and even though I dont plan on going into law, I feel that the knowledge Ive gained in this class has inspired me to be more involved in solving issues within our criminal justice system and making an impact on our prisons in ways that I can even if that isnt as a public defender or lawyer.",
                "100% you will never get such real knowledge from such a real Professor",
                "yes",
                "YES YES YES! This is one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale, and I am so grateful to have met Professor Bolus. The course material is especially helpful if you are interested in criminal law or restorative justice, but even if you aren't interested in law, this course will change your perspective and energize you to work against injustice. Be warned, there will be cold-calling (and maybe even a pop quiz), but you will learn to love it, because it forces you to do the readings and retain the information. Also, Professor Bolus is so kind and supportive that you will love this class!",
                "Yes! It was a once in a life time opportunity to learn about the justice system from someone who has actually been through it. I really enjoyed the class through and through."
