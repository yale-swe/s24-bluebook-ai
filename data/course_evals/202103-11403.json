                "Pacing could have been slower, I feel like I wouldve retained information better that way. We would also often have small projects  right before tests but I think I couldve benefited from more practice.",
                "Some strengths include the high volume of speaking and interaction we had to have while in class. This forced me to be attentive and try to understand the material in order to speak in class. A weakness is that we had nothing to use to prepare for the exams. I was told just to review the chapter, which I did, and I feel like I could have performed better on the tests if there was somewhat of a guide. There was also a lot of homework on asynchronous Wednesdays that took up to two hours to do sometimes when class is only 50 minutes or so. Also, there were times in class when it would have been helpful to go over the topic in English instead of German because I would find myself sitting there very lost even after an explanation (in german).",
                "Strengths: i think the daily meetings, though onerous, really facilitated quick learning and acquisition of the language.\r\nWeakness: the workload was intense. It occasionally felt as though we were swimming in work that felt of a much higher difficulty than what we were actually prepared for (ie lots and lots of translating in order to finish assignments)",
                "This course is very engaging and places a large amount of emphasis on classroom immersion. However, I think the course would benefit by teaching more grammar earlier in the course. (Dative, accusative, prepositions, etc.)",
                "The course was well-organized, with a good mixture of individual and collaborative assignments. The workload was fair, though I found the asynchronous assignments to be increasingly time-consuming as the semester progressed.",
                "strenghts are the fact that it meets every day. weaknesses is that the homework is mainly based on the online platform connect, which did not really help me learn, but rather just made me try a question until i got it without really understaniding why it was correct.",
                "This class provided many opportunities to practice speaking in German. I believe the course could focus more on using German vocabulary."

                "To be frank, Im partial to the german language. However, I highly recommend making use of Yale language courses and challenging yourself to learn languages that are even just tangentially relevant to your studies. The professors are so incredibly kind and patient. I cant imagine having this type of learning environment again after yale.",
                "Yes, it is an engaging course and I feel like I have learned a relatively large amount of german in a short time. It is a lot of work, but most L1 languages are and the course is also worth 1.5 credits, so the workload is intense, but appropriate.",
                "Yes, this is a great course for anyone interested in learning German!",
                "yes, i think it was  agood intro course to german. i think it really depends what teacher you get, but if you are passionate baout learning the languge, you should definately take it. if you don't want to learn the languega dn are just doing it for the language requrement, don't take it.",
