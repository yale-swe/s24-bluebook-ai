This course also emphasized collaboration, so there was a strong learning curve on how to work with my peers on p sets and in study groups to maximize our efforts in the class. The overall content was similar to AP Calculus BC with a stronger emphasis on conceptual knowledge.",

                "The strengths are that several resources were provided for me to learn the material further and my instructor was thorough in his explanations. Some weaknesses are that sometimes I felt uncomfortable to ask a question in class and some of the homework assignments did not align with the examinations.",
                "I dont know that I found the explorations incredibly helpful- they helped to provide some sense of what I was going to be covering in class, but they didnt do the most in solidifying or furthering my understanding.",
                "I didnt feel like concepts were explained with any sort of reasoning, rather they were simply given to  us and we were told this works. So none of us knew why something worked.",
                "Strengths of the course include how the course is well organized, there is a very strong support system, the rate that content is introduced is very manageable, and how the problems selected for problem sets are well chosen and non-repetitive. Weaknesses include how there is a bit of variation between the quality of instructors in the courses in terms of teaching style and the information given and how the final exam is weighed very highly in the final grade."

                "No, because I felt like I struggled with the confusing explanations given in class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it intuitively builds on top of Calculus I concepts, without requiring you to remember absolutely everything. The exam problems' difficulty is very fair compared to the difficulty of the problem sets and the content covered in class. The explorations let you intuitively understand the concepts."
