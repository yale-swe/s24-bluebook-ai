                "I learned how the ways in which anthropologists connect to sources and subjects for their research. I learned how to effectively look at sources in order to get the most out of them and how to compile these sources to write a research essay. I also learned about a variety of different research methods used in social and political research.",
                "I learned about ethnographic research, how it's practiced, and the reasoning behind its development. I also learned a lot about how our experiences and identities influence our ability to observe, perceive, and study the world; and, the importance of recognizing those biases and the value of how our lived experience influences our research. I learned how to write compelling arguments that combine both external research and personal narrative, and the value of putting the two together.",
                "I learned more about the different disciplines and mediums involving observation, as well as the ethics and power dynamics behind them.",
                "A broad understanding of certain anthropological\/ethnographical topics, how to write for the social sciences",
                "Honestly unsure. Maybe I learned more about anthropology but I feel like I still don't quite understand anthropologic writing and what we were supposed to learn in this class. It was interesting to discuss biases in anthropology and understand the role of power dynamics in the field, but I feel like the insights I gained were not that revolutionary."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: writing notebooks, informal practice at observation. Good balance of mediums. Prof. Lynch is nice. Weaknesses: discussion is led with clarity, lot of times people are just thinking out loud without a coherent theme \/ topic on the table, also not a lot of ppl engaging in others comments; feedback on essays are vague, professor not giving all the comments; lack of practice \/ case studies that can put the concepts into perspective; instruction on writing too theoretical, no peer editing. Improvement suggestions: the class is visibly more excited when talking about concrete cases or their own experiments, such as the walking around the block assignment, the documentary, and the ethnography by De Leon; some of the other readings are nebulous and vague, they could be exchanged with more engaging materials.",
                "This course was very strong because the themes taught are applicable in all classes and in social life. It could be improved by maybe one more visit to the art gallery or some other outside source.",
                "This class was really good!! Our class discussions were rich and Professor Lynch guided them really well. The texts were diverse and very engaging and the workload wasn't super intense which was great, as the work we did felt meaningful. It's a very interdisciplinary course, and the way observation is framed through different texts (through looking at both theoretical texts and social posts, for example) made the class super interesting. I found a lot of cross over between this class and my other courses as well.",
                "While the topics that the class covered were interesting, I didn't feel it was structured very well. The writing prompts and discussions were often too vague and scattered, and most of the time it felt like we were circling around the same ideas over and over without ever really getting anything out of it. While I understand that the nature of anthropology and the concepts we were dealing with are that there is no \"right answer,\" there could have been more guidance to ensure that the assignments and discussions were more productive. \r\nThe most interesting discussions\/assignments were often the ones when we were analyzing a specific work instead of talking about broader, abstract concepts. The art gallery visits were also interesting. I felt the course could benefit from more specificity overall, especially in the discussion structure with clearer leading questions (and less unnecessary lingering on certain topics). At times, I also felt the discussions may have flowed better and been more productive if they were only students discussing with each other and not Professor Lynch responding to every individual comment.",
                "Strengths: range of ethnographic research covered (film, articles, photography etc.), interesting paper topics, really thorough observation\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I personally didn't really like the writing notebooks and didn't find them helpful for engaging with the materialI think that if we just were asked to take notes on whatever we were doing for homework, that would be more productive. Would be nice to have more group activities",
                "Strengths--small class, interesting readings (for the most part), discussion based, few lectures\r\nWeaknesses--The class felt incohesive and I never knew what I was supposed to be focused on for the readings. I also never know what I was supposed to be getting from them or the discussions, and when it came to the essays I was really confused on what to write and how to approach it. I think the course is more meta and abstract than I expected and it didn't really live up to its description. I thought I would learn what \"poetics and politics\" meant but I didn't and I had to research about it on my own. Having few lectures may have made the class more engaging, but it also made it more confusing as I never concretely learned important elements of the course. The discussions for dragged on too long for my taste and students would make random things up for participation. I think that's true for most seminars but it felt like we were really pushing it with some of the things we came up with.  \r\n\r\nI also think the professor didn't really teach the writing aspect of the course very well. She provided resources that we could have gotten ourselves from the writing center, and we didn't read many model papers. I wasn't sure what was expected of me for the essays and in what way to approach it (ie research paper, creative, or something else?)."

                "Not really. If you are looking for a class that teaches you how to observe the world, this certainly doesnt. Instead, you critique different ways of doing it in a seminar for a semester. If you are looking for an intro anthropology course, this is a meta commentary on the field and doesnt really teach you the core concepts in cultural Anth. In terms of writing, there are some quirky essays and critical tools you will do (which might be rly fun or rly torturing) which are not super applicable to other courses but you dont improve a ton on actual writing skills. I do recommend to take another, potentially higher level class with Prof. Lynch, who is very knowledgeable on the subject. But for this class, there are better alternatives for most purposes youre probably looking for.",
                "Absolutely! This course helped me learn how to engage in sources which is very useful for all students, STEM and Humanities majors alike. My writing greatly improved throughout the course and the subject matter deeply informed conversations I had outside the classroom with different peers and friends.",
                "Yes!!! Learning how to be an inquisitive, open, and thoughtful observer of both yourself\/your perceptions and in academic\/broader socio-political discussions has been such a fun and valuable experience. The work we do feels meaningful, and Professor Lynch made the course very impactful.",
                "As of how it is structured right now, not to most people. The topics themselves are very interesting, but I often left class feeling like I had simply spent 90 minutes in a very vague and unproductive discussion, especially because the ideas were often ones I had already thought about through my previous interest in anthropology. However, I would recommend the course to people, maybe STEM majors, who haven't previously thought much about anthropology or observation before but are interested in the topic.",
                "I would definitely recommend it! I think that it's a nice intro to anthropology and Jane is a great professor.",
                "I think Prof. Lynch is better suited to teach those with more experience in anthropology. I don't recommend this course as an introductory course as it's currently marketed, and I think that there are better first year seminars out there. Better yet, don't take one at all---I've met very few people who actually enjoy their first year seminar. \r\n\r\nIf you do take this course, be prepared to spend a lot of time in office hours (which is a trek by the way) and be faced with a lot of confusing academic jargon. Also be prepared to parse through the course on your own to figure out what you're supposed to be learning."
