In a similar vein, I came from an S&DS background so I was more familiar with the coding, but for many of my classmates this was their first exposure to coding and R, so it was harder for them to succeed in the course.",
                "The course is very good at introducing the basics of R, and framing it in linguistic contexts. It doesn't go into too much detail on either, but that's fine.",
                "The course did teach \"R\" programming in an approachable way to inexperienced students, and learning it and statistics more generally using real-world applications was particularly useful and helped me understand a lot better. However, the course is advertised as open to anyone regardless of linguistics knowledge, and it was my experience that it is best suited to those with some basic knowledge of linguistics and terms. To best succeed in the class, you need either robust knowledge of statistics or linguistics, as it is unfeasible to try to learn both in order to understand the class. It is also very fast-paced and cumulative.",

                "Yes, if you have the background. You'll learn some really useful applications of data analysis tools, but the content can be overwhelming at times and there aren't many extra resources given for students who need them.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Not a heavy lift in terms of both concepts and workload. Less linguistics than I had hoped. As someone without a background in statistics, I didnt feel like I got an in-depth understanding of any particular statistical method, instead it was more of a crash course on implementing statistical methods in R. Slides are somewhat uninformative, I think to encourage class attendance, but it made revisiting material somewhat frustrating. Psets are fair, and would probably be very easy to anyone with a stats/R background. Both Prof Ko and the TF Sammy were very approachable and helpful.",
                "Yes! This is a great and relatively chill course for getting used to R and statistics if you're interested in linguistics. It's not an in-depth linguistics course though, so bear that in mind.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone interested in linguistics and data analysis. While the course content is taught almost exclusively in R, someone will enjoy the class significantly more if they have an interest in linguistics and its applications in research.",
