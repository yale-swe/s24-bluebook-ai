The trouble with reading so much Proust is that sometimes I feel myself getting lost in the weeds, forgetting events, place names, characters, etc., so close passage readings were always the most illuminating for me. I would recommend more of those!",

It will offer you a lifetime of ideas. \r\nThat being said, reading Proust can also be frustrating, confusing, boring, alienating. (But then a sentence of Proust will stop you in your tracks...) \r\nTake it if you've read a little of Proust and know you want to read a lot more.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in French, literature, modernism, or just encountering new ways of thinking in general. I would caution, however, that it involves a lot of reading. The written assignments are not too heavy.",

                "Absolutely. Reading Proust is (in my own limited experience--but also that of many others with much greater amounts of experience) one of the best ways to spend the time of one's life. And it's probably best to start with others, and in a classroom environment--this one in particular."
