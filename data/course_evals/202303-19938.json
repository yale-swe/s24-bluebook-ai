Our hieratic lesson was very interesting, and I would love to see that become its own course.",

The best way to improve this class is really to teach ST in L1 and L2. The syllabus was largely changed as the class went on as Professor Darnell got a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the class, which made sense, but highly schedule-oriented people may have found that confusing."

If you're just trying to fulfill your language requirement, there are other languages with more real-world advantages that may keep you more engaged. Learning an ancient language that is very different from English has its own advantages though, and really stretches your mind in a way that, say, French, wouldn't."
