I think Prof. Wells is really the star of the show here as she is so amiable and kind, but also so knowledge and intelligent in her field.",

She is very passionate about the material and each lab. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are the lab reports and quizzes. Sometimes the lab reports are extremely tedious and take 6+ hours a week. They are not hard, but they are time consuming and annoying."
