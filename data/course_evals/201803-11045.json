   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: pacing of work, cohort structure, small advisor group structure\r\nWeaknesses: the structure of the course feels a little... loose. A lot of the work is independently organized, and seems to rely a lot on the structure provided by the primary advisor (which, since I have a primary advisor which gives us a lot of structure, happens to work for me). Especially taking another intensive senior project class through Ed Studies which does provide a lot of structure, I think this class could stand to benefit from regular meetings and involved discussions about what exactly a senior essay should do, how to go about conducting research, etc. I came into this semester with no idea what a senior essay should look like, and the examples given to us weren't really all that relevant to the piece that I'm writing (we read almost all quantitative research pieces, even though I'm writing an environmental history). It felt fairly easy to just meet the week-to-week requirements of the essay without necessarily developing any forward momentum on the actual writing of the paper.",
    "The teaching mentors are great, and the checkpoints are well-facilitated to completing the thesis on time.",
    "I thought it was great. The strengths were the professors. I also really liked the dinner meetings.",
    "More frequent and earlier reminders when materials are due",
    "I found the colloquium to be extremely disorganized. One, it was difficult to set up meetings with our colloquium advisor. They tried to use Canvas but that didn't work. Two, the instructors didn't know how to use Canvas. Materials were uploaded late. Messages that should've been sent to one group would be sent to everyone. I wasn't sure if how to sign up for presentations (on Canvas or email), because there the instructions were unclear. Instructors should decide on a primary mode of communication (Canvas or email) and be consistent throughout the semester. Three, presentations felt very rushed. Half of the presentations were done in November and were untimed. Then we had to push the rest of the presentations to December. \r\nI think there is a lot of room for improvement for the colloquium, and I look forward to seeing students' feedback incorporated in the colloquium's structure in the spring semester.",
    "I appreciated the small group format of the course. I also appreciate the flexibility\/independence we were able to have, while also having structures of support available when we needed it. Professor Fotos, who I was assigned to, was great. He listened extremely well and gave thoughtful feedback; he made helpful recommendations\/introductions for me in terms of resources and people to reach out to; and he always made himself available and was warm despite being very busy and in high demand as DUS. It was also nice to meet occasionally with the other students and get to hear about each other's progress and projects.\r\nMy main critique is that I felt that requirements and expectations were often sprung on us without adequate pre-planning and explanation. It would have been extremely helpful if more support\/strong advice had been provided to us as juniors so we could have planned much further ahead and more deeply for our projects.",
    "This course is not like other Yale courses because it doesn't really meet in person -- that said, the course has been challenging because the EVST colloquium leaders are from very different departments\/disciplinary backgrounds, and thus each instructor is not able to give students equal support. I am a social scientist who was placed in a small group with data & energy scientists and it has felt a little weird because I'm not able to get or give good feedback from the other members of my group because we don't really understand the types of research each other is doing. It doesn't make sense that social scientists\/humanities students would get placed in groups with hard scientists, to be mentored by hard scientists, because we have different relationships to research and data interpretation. It seems like it would make better sense to place students from similar disciplines or working on similar projects in groups together.",
    "Class could definitely be improved with a \"before\" section, like how to plan a thesis\/where to start research. Having to jump right in was stressful, forced, and very rushed in my opinion, I wish there had been a better way to develop a research plan.",
    "Faculty held you accountable for your learning and encouraged a collaborative working environment."
