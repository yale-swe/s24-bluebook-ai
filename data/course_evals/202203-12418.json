                "The problem sets were relatively straightforward and the TAs were pretty helpful. Professor Newburgh is also a good teacher.",
                "Strengths: great and engaging lectures. Professor Newburgh and TA's were always accessible to help.\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: the professor was friendly, organized class schedule and notes, small class size\r\nWeaknesses: lack of review material and sessions for the final (although professor was sick), office hours were only an hour and at inconvenient hours",
                "I think Professor Newburgh's lectures were quite well-prepared in general, but at points, there would be notational inconsistencies or typos that made the class harder to follow. The homework sets were fair, although some of the problems were also a little difficult to understand. Grading was a bit slow, though, and I received virtually no feedback on my work.",
                "Strengths: Laura is nice, you get the sense that she wants the best for her students, wants them to do well, tries to explain concepts more clearly when students are confused, the examples that illustrate how to apply the theory are much appreciated, Laura gives opportunities in class for us to try a problem ourselves first before she explains it\r\nWeaknesses: never understand what is happening in class, don't like textbook choice (would've liked Morin more), Laura relies heavily on her notes and any attempt to deviate from it tends to go poorly (even when deviation is needed such as in the case of a mistake), Laura doesn't know how to answer some questions (which is totally fair) but then we often don't get answers/clarity though she said she'd take a look at it after class, sometimes doesn't see that students are raising hand for questions",
                "Strengths: tough but fair PSETs and exams, steady level of work, clear expectations of students, professor very aware of time required for the class and kind with keeping the workload manageable (i.e., gave an extra week on the PSET after Thanksgiving Break to make sure we were able to enjoy the break).\r\nWeaknesses: professor not super engaged w the class/was not prepared",
                "Since this course approaches physics in a different manner than Newtonian mechanics which has been used in introductory courses, I wish there was more explanation of these concepts because they are completely new. I often felt lost and like the material was presented in a manner that assumed I knew a lot more than I did. I also wish that there were more clear expectations for math level for this class. The syllabus states that multivariable calculus is needed, but much of the first unit used linear algebra and differential equations which I had never seen before. This made it even harder as I had to try and teach myself new physics concepts as well as new math concepts. On top of this, for this semester, the professor used python coding on homework assignments which I had never used before. I wish that the was a stated prerequisite or that the professor provided teaching resources for python. I spent a lot of time trying to teach myself and was often frustrated because of all of the self-teaching during this class. I also feel like the concepts from unit to unit differed greatly i.e. special relativity and thermodynamics. I'm not sure if they could have been organized in a more cohesive way.",
                "Lectures were well organized for student learning. Homework assignments built upon the material and prepared us for exams. Exams were fair extensions of the work we had been doing. Office hours were widely available for questions. I feel like I gained a solid understanding of the physics concepts covered.",
                "course was too very broad and example based which made it more difficult to conceptualize.",
                "Strengths: Professor Newburgh was a good lecturer and patient in class when we had questions/did not understand topics. Weaknesses: Not many office hours, disorganization of the final exam"

If a student has studied math up to differential equations and linear algebra, the concepts will be easier to grasp, but this course is not very engaging. So if the student is a physics major, I would recommend that they take the intensive series.",
