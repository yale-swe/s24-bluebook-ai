We discussed what it was and the key molecular players involved in the FBR. Moreover, we also touched upon various biomaterial technologies, such as glucose sensors and brain implants, and I learned about how the FBR affects each scenario. I became familiarized with many experimental techniques that were used to better understand the FBR, including mice techniques, various staining, and blots.",
                "I learned about experimental design a bit and about the biomaterial world.",
                "I learned more about the medical applications of bioengineering and how properties of materials can be tuned to help us reach certain goals.",
                "We learned about biomaterials and their applications.",
                "I learned a lot about the processes that need to be considered when implanting a biomaterial into the body.",

I developed insights into key considerations about material and tissue interactions that before I did not pay much attention to.",

Learning the immunology and tissue response to implants has helped me identify practical challenges to having successful glucose sensors, hernia meshes, etc. Professor Kyriakides's class has been one of my favorite at Yale, and it really demonstrates how difficult it can be to have successful biotechnology within the body.",

                "Very well taught. I like that the format is going through the slides and going through as much as possible and starting where we left off (so there isn't any stress around trying to learn info we weren't taught).",
                "The powerpoint slides were not always well labeled or just included abstracts cut and pasted on slides, which was a lot of text at once. I think bullet points, summaries, or take aways from papers would be helpful as well as more discussion about designing experiments.",
                "I liked the format of open book because memorizing everything would have been impossible and completely unrealistic.",
                "Prof Kyriakides basically just lectures the whole class session every meeting. He picks up on the slide he left off on, but there's not structure to the course and you never really know if there are units, sections etc. \r\nAlso he presents a lot of scientific literature and we study it in great depth for him then to list the reasons why the experiments and data are wrong or misleading.",
                "Strengths: The content of the course is very interesting, and I appreciated how I was able to see concepts I learned in other biology classes translated to various technologies or real-world applications that I had never been aware of. The deep explanations of the experimental techniques involved was helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: The content was very dense, so sometimes the incredibly detailed discussion in class was hard to follow. I think that this can be improved by putting key points on slides because otherwise, a lot of the slides are figures of papers that are hard to understand and put within the larger context of the material. The questions on our open-book exams can be better worded.",
                "I wish there were more opportunity to get graded on what you learn in the class. The writing assignments can have nothing to do with the material of the class, but are the only other grades received in the class apart from the exams.",
                "The lectures were not recorded, which was difficult during sick days because a lot of content was covered in each class. However, the professor made the course engaging and interesting with stories/anecdotes.",
                "Themis is wonderful!",
                "Engagement in class could be improved.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kyriakides took the time to go over any questions that people had from previous classes.\r\nWeaknesses: The writing assignments felt a bit disjointed from the rest of the class.",
                "The strength of this class was its format where we learned from the professor and the papers he assigned or the figures he showed us in class. Although he did not zoom his class unless someone was sick, I felt that it was good because it forced us to be there in class on time.",
                "Hard to pay attention during class not super engaging and prof went on tangents on information that wasnt on the exam.",
                "The course was very well organized.  The online resources such as the slides and reviews were also helpful. The one comment I would have would be that the assigned readings were sometimes hard to find in the slides so it was difficult to figure out what I was supposed to have read.",
                "Really good set up, especially with the noncumulative exams.",
                "It was way too early in the morning",
                "strengths: interesting experiments, low workload, fair tests\r\nweaknesses: lots of material without knowing what to focus on, lectures can get dull",
                "A huge strength is the professor's teaching style which was highly engaging. Moreover, the assigned readings were a huge strength as it helps a student develop the skills needed to dive into academic research and digest the material.",
                "Strengths: exams are open-note, Themis is an excellent lecturer, exams were fair overall, content is based on real experimentation/practical challenges\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it felt like I had to write down absolutely everything Professor said in class, as sometimes exam questions were focused on things said in class that were not on slides",
                "Its a well structured class, but we have to take a lot of notes during the class, if professor can put some more information on the slides , it will be great. And the review session should be improved, its hard to read through every slide that provided  by professor,"

                "If you're interested in this type of material and have good background knowledge in biology then yes.",
                "I would recommend the course because you will learn a lot about different interactions within the body and biomaterial applications. The class was challenging to synthesize all the material, but the content is very interesting. The lectures sometimes felt like a deep analysis of various papers, and it was hard to catch everything given the open-note nature of our exams. The exams often required knowing some detailed information from the lectures and readings.",

Its a very cool class taught by an awesome professor, and the load is very manageable. You basically decide how well you want to do by how much attention you pay to the course",
                "Yes, it's pretty chill and I learned a lot",
                "No, it's honestly not worth the stress and chaos during class.",
                "No. Did not enjoy this course at all but that was largely a personal preference in the topics I am interested in. I could not in good faith recommend it though, for that reason.",
                "Yes. Even if you are not BME but you want to go into pharma or biotech you should take this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in how tissues interact/respond with biomaterials. This course is excellent and has been one of my favorite over my time at Yale. I now am able to understand the practical challenges with designing successful implants/biomaterials.",
                "Yes, its a interesting and charming class that introduces how biomaterial work together with our body and the potential danger of using it. Also, professor supplied  a lot of newly developed information like brain techniques. It will be fun to take this"
