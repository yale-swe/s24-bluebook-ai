Professor Habchi encouraged us to bring our own experiences with theory into the class, meaning we learned quite a bit not just from her, but from each other.",

                "Strengths: The class content and readings spark thoughtful and critical discussions about colonialism and urbanism. The midterm and final paper are the only large assignments and are graded kindly by Professor Habchi. Professor Habchi is also incredibly smart and provides insightful context about the weeks readings and thoughtful feedback on assignments and comments made in class.",
                "Strengths: class easily has the best reading list of any course that I've taken at Yale, all rooted in postcolonial theory and sharing such powerful and incredible narratives. Professor Habchi is also an incredibly kind and intelligent professor, and a great conversation facilitator. Weaknesses: our discussions sometimes were unstructured to the point where I was uncertain what to take away from the classes, and the lack of structure for the final assignments made me struggle to link what I was completing to our class conversations or objectives.",
                "strengths:\r\n- good books\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- discussion was very unstructured and often wandered very far from the text; it would have been nice if Professor Habchi could have brought us back on track\r\n- the selection of books felt somewhat random; I would have at least liked more critical scholarship sprinkled in",
                "Strengths - really great syllabus and reading list, all in a relaxed environment. Professor Habchi is really supportive and clearly knows her stuff.\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes people would check out of class discussion, and it was hard to move the conversation along for a full two hours. I think more class activities, like what we did in the first week or two, could help this!",
                "Strengths: AMAZING syllabus. Every book and every theory reading added significantly to my understandings of the courses overarching themes. Fadila is also an absolute GEM in the classroom. Her insights about these texts were beyond illuminating, and its all the more impressive that she managed to leave us so much space for discussion while still teaching us so much.\r\nWeaknesses: Very few! The class time length dragged at moments, but less than other classes of this length, mostly due to Fadilas excellent facilitation.",
                "Strengths: Professor Habchi! She's so sweet and passionate about the subject and her students. The literature was also very interesting, and discussions were always flowing and lively. Weaknesses: Adding variety to the literature would be appreciated. We really only focused on Algiers + European cities - adding in a discourse on other cities would have greatly increased the depth of the course (the discussion on LA in Parable was fantastic, for example)."

                "Absolutely! I learned so much from Prof Habchi and my peers about how (post and de)colonialism and urban studies intersect.",
                "Yes! Professor Habchi is incredibly intelligent and kind, and it was such a joy to take a class with her. If you're interested in postcolonial theory in any way, this class and its books were a very thorough introduction to it.",
                "No, I would not recommend this. As it stands, you gain little from the course. I would recommend you purchase the books and read them yourself as they are all quite good, but I did not really learn anything about \"Postcolonial Cities.\" Unless this course changes significantly in how discussion is facilitated by Prof. Habchi, I don't think it's worth taking.",
                "Yes! Cool chance to read fiction and learn about urbanism in a very low-pressure environment.",
                "YES! The books you read in this course are transformative texts that will expand your ideas of the postcolonial city and the way its inhabitants resist against structuralized colonial discipline. Fadila is an excellent teacher, and I would say that this has been my favorite course at Yale thus far. I will say that if you do not envision yourself being able to read a book every week, I wouldnt take this class, as so much of the reason I enjoyed it came from being able to dive into the texts every week in discussion.",
                "I would! It's an interesting course, the literature is fun to read, and its application to urban studies and postcolonial theory was actually helpful.",
                "Yes- this is a great discussion-based course with an excellent reading list!",
                "Yes! Super interesting material and great prof! Loved the discussions we had."
