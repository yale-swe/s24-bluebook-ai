                "I gained an understanding of many key moments in Congressional history, including many that I had never previously studied.",
                "The readings are all extremely interesting and not really topics covered by other classes. I had cursory knowledge on many of the subjects beforehand, such as the McCarthy hearings or Roosevelt's plan to pack the court, but the readings Mayhew provides are in depth and not the most common you will find on the subjects (\"deep cuts\" if you will), but that doesn't mean they aren't fantastic, plus they are usually extremely easy and interesting to read."

                "It's hard to keep yourself on track with the papers because you can write them whenever in the semester. It's both a strength and a weakness that you get out of this course what you put into it. The main strength is just getting to study under The David Mayhew.",
                "This is an incredible course, and Professor Mayhew is among the best and most brilliant professors I have ever had. He is not concerned with giving you busy work--only in engaging with your mind and encouraging you to think deeply.",
                "Strengths: a fantastic professor. So knowledgable, and such a genuinely kind person.\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "While I thoroughly enjoyed this course and appreciated being able to pick Professor Mayhew's brain on any topic relating to Congress, the class discussions were too unstructured at times. The conversation could veer on tangents away from the content of the reading, which were often worthwhile, but often it felt like members of the class without sufficient background were left out of those parts of the discussion.",
                "The biggest strength lies in the professor. Mayhew is a phenomenal professor whom endless positive things could be said about. No real weaknesses to the course come to mind. The essays are not too bad, and fairly low-stress, plus Mayhew gives great feedback. Only things is sometimes I struggled to come up with topics to write about, so it would be nice if there were more \"prompts\", but the whole point is Mayhew wants to see what your thoughts were when reading, so it is not big deal if you feel your thoughts aren't groundbreaking. Mayhew just wants to see what you thought. DOn't worry too much about them."

                "Yes! Professor Mayhew is a giant in the field, a walking encyclopedia, a kind and thoughtful human being, and a gifted professor. And the course material is fascinating!",
                "Yes! It has everything a student should want in a seminar  relevant and engaging readings + a knowledgeable professor open to facilitating conversation in and outside of class.",
                "If you love talking about Congress totally take it. If you're trying to learn about Congress for the first time you might not enjoy it since it doesn't teach you about historical events as much as helping you frame your existing knowledge in a new way.",
                "I absolutely would! If this class fits in your schedule, take it. If it doesn't fit in your schedule, change your schedule until it does. It was truly an honor to be able to learn from Professor Mayhew. He is clearly one of (probably the) most knowledgable scholars of Congress in the entire world. And he's such a genuinely good person. He takes interest in every student and what you have to say, even though he knows more than everyone combined. He's always willing to exchange emails with you on topics of interest or even get dinner in a dining hall. Truly a class I'll never forget.",
                "Definitely! Professor Mayhew is the expert on Congress. If you like history and are interested in American government, then this is a fantastic course. Just be aware that the discussion can get in the weeds on some more obscure historical topics at times.",
                "Yes! Mayhew is a phenomenal professor and any students should take the chance to take a course with him if they have the opportunity. It is clear to see why he is a Sterling Professor Emeritus. He has a wide breadth of knowledge on so many subjects within political science and history dating from the founding of the country to current topics. It was especially interesting taking his course in 2023 with all the interesting mainly house speaker centered controversies to hear all his thoughts on it. I don't think anyone else would have as much knowledge as he does to make an opinion on it."
