Completely new material that is p much unconnected from Gen Chem 1, so how you did in that is irrelevant to how you do in this course. A LOT of the material is about rate constants, acids + bases, and energy changes, and then there's a few really enjoyable chapters on radiation and batteries among others. I have PTSD from RICE tables. Overall, it is tricky stuff, but Prof Davis made it fun and accessible.",

            "comments": [
                "The course felt a little disorganized. We spent a lot of time on some topics but comparatively very little on others, and some topics didn't seem to relate to each other at all. \r\nA strength of this course is that its exams and grading scheme are extremely fair and generous, creating a lot of room for growth over the course of the semester.",
                "I think the course has a lot of potential and covers a good amount of content, but I dont think it was very well designed for students to learn as much as possible, as the lectures did not go much beyond what can be read on a slide.",
                "This was a reasonable intro course to gen chem. The midterms contained problems directly from previous course material, which I did not really like; it became more of a memorization than a problem-solving course. The professor posted old recordings the week before each exam to help us study, which was very helpful.",
                "Strengths are the many extra optional practice problems to develop skills and the consistency in the exam questions being similar to questions we had seen before. Weaknesses were the due dates on problem sets conflicting with exams and the daily quizzes seemed to me as unimportant.",
                "I like the fair grading policy and the setup for homeworks.",
                "A huge amount of content and the tests were extremely variable in difficulty, which made it hard to study well. I liked the teaching for the most part and I love the instructors enthusiasm, though I sometimes felt like she didnt break things down in the very simplest way",
                "I think this course was excellently formatted to allow for student learning  from the reading quizzes to the psets to the discussion sections to the exams where we could drop two of the questions answered. These teaching strategies made it easier to focus on learning content instead of worrying about a grade.",
                "If you struggle with Chemistry or haven't done it in ages or aren't a pre-med or just aren't someone who spends their entire life studying, this is relevant for you: Professor Davis may be one of the best STEM teachers I have ever had. She has basically harnessed the power of \"fact-learny\" teaching by successfully employing many different teaching methods to accommodate different styles of learning. The material is reviewed at the perfect pace by timing homework, lectures and reading quizzes a few days apart so you never just forget it all. She also just explains things really clearly, especially when the textbook uses quite convoluted explanations, so going to lecture is a must. She also paid very close attention to my personal progress throughout the course, checking up on me if my midterms didn't go so well and offering times to review material. Basically, you will not fall in love with chem by the end of the course if you haven't already, and she knows that, but the material will be broken down in a way that's really really easy to digest if you put some work in. That's why this was a fantastic course, even if it was challenging.\r\n\r\nMaybe the only weakness is that we had a really unclear and lowkey confusing TF. In section she would teach us ways of doing things we hadn't covered, or just skip over really tricky things with a brief explanation. Meant the course wasn't supported with good learning reinforcement beyond the core rotation of lectures and assignments. Thankfully that won't be the case for every iteration of the course.",
                "Strengths: provides a comprehensive background of chemical knowledge and prepares students for future chemistry classes. \r\nWeaknesses: caters to premed students in content (meaning the last units, biochem and orgo, are only applicable to those who will be taking those courses. My future chemistry classes for my major include inorganic chemistry and geochemistry so I was irritated that so much of my grade depended on how well I could memorize peptide structures, etc.).",
                "Strengths: psets were graded on completion, so not having to worry about the grade made it easier to learn; having section to review lectures was very helpful; structure of exams was not too complicated\r\nWeaknesses: being graded on reading quizzes for chapters we didn't read yet; review study guides weren't the best; midterms too fast-paced",
                "Good workload level that helps reinforce understanding but does not feel overwhelming.",
                "I think that the course material could improve by a more cohesive flow between ideas. As is, it sort of jumps around between ideas and concepts.",
                "At times it moves a little fast. It can be difficult to follow along without doing the readings ahead of time, but it is a lot of work to do readings before class three times a week every week. The strength is that I actually think the course was laid out to fit together nicely. For example, everything we did in the beginning with equilibrium constants came into play in different contexts with solubility, acids and bases, thermochemistry, etc. I do think some in-class review would have been helpful on concepts that might have been forgotten since gen chem 1 like acid-base and redox reactions. We did review and the book had directions on where to go to review, but I think something more structured in class or having easily accessible peer-tutors (the way math and biology do) to host reviews\/enrichment would have been helpful.\r\nOh! Another strength was the phet simulations. We could have done more of those. They were very helpful in understanding more difficult concepts and they were so much more helpful than in-class demonstrations. Exciting in-class demonstrations like elephant toothpaste also make the course more exciting, but the phet simulations make it easier to see the chemistry at different levels including microscopically (which obviously can't be done easily with an in-class demo). One time we brought our own laptops to class and each ran through an atomic bomb simulator (rather than just watching prof Davis do it), which I think was especially helpful for learning, so maybe encouraging us to do more of those hands-on simulations in class or in section or as graded homework.\r\nI also liked the poll everywhere questions that got us more involved in class. I prefered that over working in small groups.",

                "Yes, even if you hated gen chem 1 I wouldn't dread it as much as your other requirements. Davis is a fantastic professor and will turn the tedium of quizzes and assignments into a genuinely good time--she really helps you track and feel your progress in the semester. The personal attention given to each of her students is just insane, especially since this is a lecture. Content starts challenging then gets easier towards the second half of the semester, but it is still very interesting from start to finish.",
                "I was required to take this course for my major, so I wouldn't necessarily tell my friends \"hey you should take chem 165! it's so much fun!\" Professor Davis did do a very good job, so if any of my friends have to take this class, I would definitely recommend to them to try and get into her section.",
                "I would not recommend CHEM 165 unless you had to take it, but if you did, I highly recommend taking it with Professor Davis. The class was well organized and Prof. Davis was effective in teaching concepts that didn't make sense to me in readings. She also made the class more interesting than it would've been learning from the textbook, by adding lectures that taught us about things related to chemistry. The midterms were a little too fast-paced but not unnecessarily difficult. I was also impressed with how quickly grades for tests came back, especially compared to other STEM classes.",
                "Yes, I liked taking this course off cycle because it was nice to have a smaller group.",
                "I would! Professor Davis was an amazing instructor, and this course is foundational to any number of disciplines.",
                "As far as intro STEM courses...it is okay. Taking it off-sequence (2nd semester in Fall rather than spring) is definitely better: smaller class, more oppotunities  to get help directly from the professor (although perhaps if it were on-sequence there would be more TA's which could have been helpful). The grading was very fair and generous so I'm sure that is a plus for most people. The tests were 12 questions, but only 10 counted toward the grade so there was room for bonus points or for messing up, which was very generous and took a lot of pressure off. The problem sets and readings did a good job of facilitating learning, as did the timeline of the courrse and when work was due for the most part. Nonetheless, you will want to be prepared to put in the work to study the material outside of class and stay on top of starting problem sets early enough that they are beneficial....and then makiing sure to review them again as an exam approaches.",
