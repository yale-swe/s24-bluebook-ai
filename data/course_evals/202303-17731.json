                "When reflecting on this course, I feel pulled toward the strengths. The professors across the board are all amazing and passionate in what they do. Service projects as a mandatory part of the class is critical into deeper understanding within the ASL at Yale community. It always feels clear how the homework helps with understanding sign language, and the feedback we are provided in helpful in growing as individuals. My only critique on weakness is when our homework or quizzes include signs that we aren't familiar with, it feels frustrating, but, this doesn't happen too often so it's a small critique.",
                "all strengths - LOVE asl",
                "The setup of this course was very conducive to student learning. The homework, quizzes, and projects all strengthened different aspects of ASL, and the 4/1 schedule (M-Th synchronous, F asynchronous) worked very well, especially when it came to planning service projects or other events.",
                "Professor Fisher is amazing. He comes to every class excited to teach.  He gives feedback on all of our signing which helps a lot. The curriculum is well structured for learning. My only suggestion would be to have short exams on hard skills (finger spelling, sentence structure to avoid signed English).",
                "The strength is definitely the professor. Andrew is amazing and wants students to do well in the class. He is very understanding if you ask for help, and the class itself is structured for a lot of engagement",
                "The service projects really vary in terms of students' engagement and commitment. I personally had a great time with my project, but the variability of experiences was apparent throughout the class. The amount of conversation practice was really helpful this semester and I enjoyed getting to know my classmates through the discussion prompts over time.",
                "Strengths: Andrew *freaking* Fisher. He is a brilliant teacher and one of the kindest people you'll ever meet.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None (other than the fact that teaching has kept Professor Fisher from pursuing an acting career....you'll see :)."

If you are contemplating whether or not you should take sign language, talk to any student in the department; I guarantee they will rave about the community and friends they have found in class. You also learn the criticalness of better accessibility for everyone in the wider world. It's so much more than a language. It's genuinely learning about the culture.",
