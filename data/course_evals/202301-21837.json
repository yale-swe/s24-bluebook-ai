Interesting, mostly self-contained units.\r\nWeaknesses: Not necessarily a weakness, but it may be helpful to have taken at least a little bit of high school physics before this course. There was more math involved than the QR credit I took at the same time (which involved very little math)",

                "Yes! Know that it's split into 3 units that each take up a third of the class (articulation, acoustics, and perception), so if you're only interested in one of them you might be less engaged during 2\/3 of the semester. I really appreciated the leminar format where most classes were a lecture because it felt like concrete content was being taught. Jason is a really approachable professor and the workload is very reasonable, so if the topic sounds interesting to you, you will enjoy the class.",
                "Yes! Dr. Shaw is passionate about his subject, and you will walk away knowing a fair bit about each topic (speech articulation, acoustics, and speech perception).",
                "Yes, it is a fantastic phonetics II class! This was the first time it was ever taught and it went incredibly smoothly. You will learn a lot in articulation, acoustics, and perception. Perception particularly was a great unit because it was touched on the least in Phonetics I. Jason does not re-explain anything from phonetics 1 unless you ask (he is happy to though), so if you did not take phonetics 1 you might expect to spend some time looking up various terms like reminding yourself what a lateral alveolar approximant is for example."
