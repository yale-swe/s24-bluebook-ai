Interesting, mostly self-contained units.\r\nWeaknesses: Not necessarily a weakness, but it may be helpful to have taken at least a little bit of high school physics before this course. There was more math involved than the QR credit I took at the same time (which involved very little math)",

                "Yes! Know that it's split into 3 units that each take up a third of the class (articulation, acoustics, and perception), so if you're only interested in one of them you might be less engaged during 2/3 of the semester. I really appreciated the leminar format where most classes were a lecture because it felt like concrete content was being taught. Jason is a really approachable professor and the workload is very reasonable, so if the topic sounds interesting to you, you will enjoy the class.",

                "Yes, it is a fantastic phonetics II class! This was the first time it was ever taught and it went incredibly smoothly. You will learn a lot in articulation, acoustics, and perception. Perception particularly was a great unit because it was touched on the least in Phonetics I. Jason does not re-explain anything from phonetics 1 unless you ask (he is happy to though), so if you did not take phonetics 1 you might expect to spend some time looking up various terms like reminding yourself what a lateral alveolar approximant is for example."
