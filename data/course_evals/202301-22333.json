Learned a lot about human well-being, politics, and development in Sub-Saharan Africa. Weakness would be the coding session at the start - either too easy if you already know R, or too fast if you don't. Not sure what the instructor can do about this, though! Maybe make those sessions optional?",
                "Strengths: Prof was super great and knowledgeable, very willing to help, very understanding\r\nWeaknesses: too much reading and not enough digesting and applying the reading, too much workload is concentrated in the final project and not spread out through the year"

Placing into the context of African politics and economy is good, too, though that was not a focus of the class. You need to be pretty good at stats and R already, because the course moves quickly and there isn't time to go over basics."
