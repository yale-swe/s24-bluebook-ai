Actually practiced/received feedback on my pronunciation, which is something I was definitely missing in past French classes before Yale."

                "Weakness: it is a course with a high workload that demands a lot from the student\r\nStrength: learn a lot of French",
                "The course is terrible. The majority of the work expected to be done by the student involves listening to audio recordings from the 1980's and answering questions in a booklet. This could be drastically improved by leveraging technology from at least the early 2000's to facilitate learning outcomes for students. A specific example is the use of vocabulary exercises. The Vocabulary given in the course including in previous semesters varied wildly and often included obscure words. The issue this caused is it often made it difficult if not impossible to understand what other test questions ask due to lack of comprehension. Additionally the course is wildly disorganized with a conservative estimate of over 150 different printable worksheets, handouts or various supplementary material making it nearly impossible to stay organized. Furthermore it never seemed like the professors were on the same page as the course chair. There was no clear vision of student outcomes at the end of the course and each instructor worked to simply help students pass each evaluation. I would say that It seemed like I learned French to pass the course but not to speak it.",
                "The course forces you to learn French fair well because it demands an incredibly high level of engagement. this course was more demanding then any class i've ever taken. My french was greatly improved in the process, but my relationship with the language and the French department have been so damaged that i will not continue to study the language. I think the department should reconsider the insensitivity of their course offerings or at least offer more options that are less intensive.",
                "Strengths: consistent practice, well made tests, excellent instructors, good at encouraging engagement to practice speaking\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: near impossible workload (if you were to do everything exactly as assigned)"

                "Absolutely not. I would never recommend to any incoming freshmen to pursue French to meet their language requirement unless they have significant background in French language. I have served on multiple combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and I would literally rather be back in Afghanistan than go through French again. I am no stranger to long hours of arduous work, but in order to be successful in French it is necessary for a student to easily spend 4-6 hours per night studying the readings, learning vocabulary, or completing worksheets to be successful. If a student did not have many other courses or was seeking a French language degree then it may be worth pursing. That being said I genuinely believe that language success is not accessible to the vast majority of students. I am convinced that the pace the material is presented at, and the expectation set by the French department is completely unreasonable. For example in L3 French we started reading stories for children in maybe 2nd or 3rd grade. 3 weeks later we read \"The Stranger\" by Camus. The presentation of this material in this manner did not make sense when it seemed that most people could not conjugate most verbs or properly form interrogative sentences.  The bottom line is that the French department needs a major overhaul to restructure material presentation and redesign curriculum to achieve specific goal oriented student outcomes. Prior to attending Yale I had a strong desire to learn French for a variety of personal reasons, however after the ordeal that was L1-L3 I have no desire to continue studying the language or even speaking it with my own family members.",
                "I would never recommend this course to another student, or any beginner or intermediate French course. I resent the fact that this past semester i was required to spend nearly 20 hours a week in class, or studying, or in tutoring in order to simply pass this course to graduate, after being denied the option of the summer accelerator or a less intensive course offering.",
                "Yes, I certainly feel like my French has improved.",
                "Yes though would emphasize the heavy workload (but gets more manageable after the midterm). You will definitely learn French."
