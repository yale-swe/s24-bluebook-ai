    "The professor is very smart, too smart to be teaching undergrads I think. Because the material was presented so quickly and at such a high level, I really did not gain much understanding at all.\r\n\r\nThis course was a huge mismatch between prereqs and expectations: the prereqs were \"the math requirements for the econ major,\" which is just calc. But the material included differential equations, linear algebra, and some results from analysis. The professor claimed that you didn't need those courses to succeed, but without them, it was really difficult to make any meaning or gain any understanding of what was going on in the course. In reality, you probably need all of the requirements of the econ\/math major to have much of a shot at understanding this stuff. Though the workload wasn't nearly as intense, the material presented was far harder to understand than, say, ECON 351.\r\n\r\nI am glad that the problem sets were not too too lengthy (though they were pretty hard to make sense of, since we went through the material so quickly and the textbook was not clear at all). And it was nice not to have a final exam, though the final presentation was so stressful that it might have been as bad all things considered (more about that later).\r\n\r\nTo improve this course, the professor would need to drastically reduce his expectations for what his students already know and their capability for picking up the material. We aren't grad students at MIT--some of us were undergrads whose last math was calculus in freshman year. The first couple weeks of the course were interesting and fun--I thought the rest of it would be too, but then instead we had to start doing this crazy calculus that doesn't behave anything like how normal calculus does.\r\n\r\nA comparable course at other universities is taught at the grad level and has numerous prereqs--this one needs something like that too. \r\n\r\nIf this course is taught again, the prereqs need to be updated, the title should probably be changed, and I'd say that about half as much material should be covered at about half the speed--then people might learn something, at least.",
    "The course covered a lot of important material; however, the prerequisites did not at all match the required knowledge for entering the course.",
    "Very focused on techniques but did not talk about application a lot.",
    "I feel like it would be a good idea to adjust the level of this course to that of a regular undergraduate student, rather than a PhD-seeking one potentially using these techniques.",
    "A bit one-sided, not much student interaction in class",
    "Continuous time stochastic calculus is not covered in most economics courses, so this is good opportunity to learn something different and more advanced.",
    "Good introduction to financial theory. Group homework and presentations make freeloading an issue.",
    "The material is ambitious, and takes results from things such as complex analysis that many students are not familiar with. This is both a strength and a weakness, as it is good to make material challenging, but at the same time, moving more slowly through material may have been more appropriate. Presenting a paper on the material at the end of the class was a good exercise.",
    "Could be more interactive",
    "First 75% of course: lectures, a little bit dry because not many people were engaged (9:25am)\r\nLast 25% of course: student group presentations where the professor would stop and critique in the middle of presentation\r\n\r\nPsets were turned in in groups and graded for completion"

    "If you're a hard-core math financial engineering person looking to do a masters in that field at MIT or something, and you've already done the whole econ\/math major, then maybe. Otherwise, no. Also note that there's a huge jump in difficulty starting the third or fourth week.\r\n\r\nThe material was way too hard for undergrads, and certainly when the prereqs don't filter out any econ majors (since all of them have satisfied the math requirements for econ, which was the only prereq). As such, I learned next to nothing and spent a lot of time being really stressed out. \r\n\r\nThe professor was also quite condescending to people who were not as smart as him (i.e., everyone). The final presentations were so painful--110 minutes of him asking the presenters questions that they couldn't answer and then practically mocking them when they couldn't. We had to present this really difficult paper, and then the night before he told us to change something about the model that was being presented--so we, undergrads, had to present a model that had never been considered before! And we had like 12 hours to change it. Then when we screwed some of the changes up, we were told, in front of the class, that we had \"naively\" made mistakes in our changes. I don't think the professor was meaning to sound as condescending as he did, but the entire presentation was filled with him pointing out mistakes. It must've been frustrating for him that all of us knew nothing about the material, but the fact of the matter is that the material was so difficult that I don't think it was reasonable of him to expect us to learn it at the pace that it was taught. And even the smartest people in the class, people I've seen excel in other econ classes, had very little success.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they were an applied math major who had taken many applied math courses and felt comfortable with differential equations, linear algebra, stochastic calculus, etc. This class would be better labeled financial engineering.",
    "Yes if you are good at math.",
    "Only if you have taken some very advanced math, beyond linear algebra and multivariable calculus, and somehow would like to learn about option pricing without ever hearing the word option mentioned in class.",
    "Yes, relatively relaxed seminar course",
    "I would recommend this course if you have a strong math background and are willing to put in the time to understand very challenging concepts. The material is not easy.",
    "Depends on how interested they are in the material and how much time they are willing to put in to understand it. The course is very mathematical, so if you are not a fan of mathematical econ, then no. If yes, it is definitely an interesting way to look at concrete applications of economic theory.",
    "no",
    "No unless you're really really interested in it"
