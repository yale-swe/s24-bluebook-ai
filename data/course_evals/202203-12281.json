                "I read texts in Middle and Old English for the first time, and learned a lot about the time period and ideas of labor in general! Particular focus on material culture and objects, which was super awesome.",
                "I gained a solid overview of medieval literature, particularly the role of labor within it.",
                "I learned about the medieval age, which I truly knew nothing about before this course. We learned through art, literature and primary sources, which was a unique way to learn!",
                "I learned a *lot* about Medieval literature. Also how to compare Medieval texts, along with quite a bit of Medieval history.",
                "I learned about various features of labor in the Middle Ages, including its religious significance and the materials that went into performing such labor.",
                "I genuinely learned about labor and life during the Middle Ages. I also learned a lot about the process of creating a Middle Ages book and how to read old and Middle English!",
                "A great introduction to medieval literature through the lens of labor.",
                "I had never read a single piece of Medieval literature before this class. We went through so many different pieces of poetry to riddles to art work to scrolls to debates. It really helped create a good base knowledge of the Middle Ages. Also, this class, unlike any other I've taken, was super focused on one specific theme: labor. Every class discussion was about how what we were reading pertained to labor in some way--whether that be the labor to write, work, make art, live, die, speak, be a literal bird, and so on.",
                "Profs. Dwyer and Thornbury put together an interesting and insightful collection of texts centered on Medieval conceptions of labor."

                "This course could be improved by providing slightly more historical context for each of the texts that we read.",
                "Strengths: wonderful professors, great discussion, good balance of fun moments and serious moments. Really made medieval English interesting! Weaknesses: readings were a bit disorganized in that we often bounced around and returned to texts, and sometimes I wish we could've spent more time unpacking texts in detail, especially because Old English and even Middle English can be quite hard to read and understand on your own.",
                "While I enjoyed moments of the course, I think that it missed an initial foundation for medieval literature. It seemed that we were often reading texts but didnt always have the full context of each thing and how it operated within society itself at the time. Also the subject of laboring itself seemed a little narrow at times.",
                "This was a great course! The strengths are hands down Prof. Thornbury and Prof. Dwyer. I don't think I would have been interested in the course material if not for them! As we always looked closely at certain objects, I found that a little more context about the medieval age would have been helpful for analysis and essays.",
                "The strengths of this course are Professor Thornbury and Seamus Dwyer. They are warm and funny, and class discussions always felt welcoming. Another strength is that, since this is a new class, they asked us at the end of class what could be improved. I genuinely feel they will take our constructive criticism -- thus no complaints here!",
                "Strengths: Professor thornbury and Dwyer were by far the best part of this course. They made the readings funny and approachable and really knew how to connect with the class. I also loved the object presentations, those were great!\r\nWeaknesses: I think this course assumed a baseline of knowledge that I did not have. I had never studied the Middle Ages before or read Middle English so I was sometimes struggling to keep up. Then, for the essays, there was an expected understanding of works that we only focused on a couple passages for, and I felt a little overwhelmed by the difficulty of the material at times.",
                "The variety of texts, art, and physical objects we looked at was a great strength of this course.",
                "The strengths of this course are for sure the teaching staff. Probably the nicest and funniest professors I've ever had.",
                "Great course! You can tell that a lot of care was put into its construction. I do wish the room had been larger so everyone could have consistently sat around the table together."

                "Yes! If you're an English major trying to fulfill your Medieval requirement, this is probably the best course you'll find. Seamus and Emily make the class very fun, and they're both very dedicated and understanding professors.",
                "Yes! I think this might be the best way to get your medieval credit if you are an English major (I think the class was nearly all English majors). The professors care a lot and know a lot, and the focus of the class is narrower than the standard English period requirement class in that we talked about everything through the lens of labor, which was super cool and new.",
                "This class was a great learning environment, but was a little too focused to the point where it could become slightly dry.",
                "I absolutely would! I can't imagine a better way to fulfill the medieval requirement for English majors.",
                "This is absolutely the best Medieval credit on the market for English majors today. Even if you don't know anything about the Medieval period, you'll do just fine. And what's discussed in class is super interesting!",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course! It has much relevance to modern life, while also being historically grounded.",
                "yes! it was a really great and engaging course. i was scared to take a medieval course, but the readings were great and the class discussions were always so interesting!",
                "Yes! The professors are great but I really would recommend it to a student that has background in the Middle Ages. As someone who didnt, I felt I was at a disadvantage for a lot of the course and just doing the readings was not enough to keep up.",
                "Yes! This is such a great course (not just for the medieval English requirement). Professor Thornbury and Professor Dwyer are such wonderful and supportive instructors.",
                "100 percent. Honestly, I'd recommend this class to people who aren't even English majors. Like, I know you probably don't want to read medieval literature, but this class is a hoot. For English majors, since everyone has to take one of the two middle ages classes every offered, you're going to know at least 5 people in the class before stepping foot into it. I knew 9 people in this class before going into it, and that plus the wonderful teaching staff made class session feel like wonderful breaks from the occasional drudgery of Yale.",
                "YES. This is the best course to take to fill the English medieval requirement, especially if having to read in Middle English scares you. The readings switch per week so if you don't connect with one there is always something new. And we worked with a range of translations \/ versions of the texts so I was never completely lost. Plus, the question about what work is for and what work is worthwhile is easily applicable to today and an interesting question to explore. I would especially recommend this course if it is still being taught by Prof Thornbury and TF Dwyer  considering most of us came in with little to no medieval studies background, they made this class engaging and fun.",
                "Absolutely! I don't take many courses at Yale where people laugh in class. I think it's a testament to the quality of the course that people were able to have fun while sitting around the seminar table."
