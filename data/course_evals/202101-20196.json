                "This course is phenomenal. I had never revised a creative writing piece beyond a second draft, so seeing what the third draft did to my writing was incredibly cool. No weaknesses.",
                "Pros: The other people in this class are great, highly skilled writers who know how to workshop and are writing generally pretty interesting things. People make good comments during workshop and on paper comments, and you actually get to know people pretty well, which is great given that this was a Zoom semester. Michael also gives a lot of attention to your writing which is very nice, and we have very lively discussion. We also had guests: George Saunders and Karen Russell, which was very cool.\r\nCons:  Michael is good at giving feedback and obviously is a very good and talented writer, but sometimes his suggestions were off-the-wall or felt disjointed.",
                "Strengths: great classmates that I wish I could've interacted with in-person, get to study/learn/write under a Pultizer Prize-winning author and generally wonderful human being, get to read lots of really cool stories and see them evolve over time\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: if you get tired of your story, you're kinda screwed lol",
                "I would have maybe liked more structured discussions or more intense line editing, but overall it was a great experience.",

                "No real structured opportunities for virtual engagement. The groups that normally met in-person to discuss stories each workshop were just moved to Zoom for the semester. Typically, the class has a few events outside of class hours to bond but that wasn't really facilitated this year."

                "This course is a must take if you are interested in fiction writing. The required three drafts of the same story are a great way to really hone your craft, and it more closely resembles the process of writing outside of a classroom.",
                "I think it's difficult to say whether a specific workshop will work for everyone -- it really does depend on how well you vibe with the professor and classmates. Overall, I would recommend this course because the focus on revision was very helpful.",
                "Tentatively yes. I'm sure the class is a lot better in-person, and Michael always selects great groups of people for his classes, so I'm sure it'll be better in later years. Be warned that there are multiple versions of this class, though. For example, in Choi's class, they write two different short stories over the course of the semester. In this course, you only write one short story and revise it multiple times. You can change the story in the drafts to a degree, but it has to keep the same bones as the original story, so if you're not a fan of the panicked idea you came up with two weeks into the school year, you're kind of out of luck. Just something to think about. But otherwise, Michael's great, the people in the class are great, the stories are great (obviously), and it's a solid take. \r\n\r\nOh! Something else to note is that you will literally have no idea where you stand grade-wise in this class. As I write this now, I have no idea what the grading distribution looks like, what we're actually graded on (I assume improvements through the story drafts and maybe our line edits/notes on everyone's drafts?? participation too maybe??), or what I'm going to get in this class because we literally get 0 grades the entire semester.",
                "Yes! This class was a great community. I loved talking abt everyones writing and watching our stories evolve over the semester."
