It was really worth it to read the amount that we did, as nothing can help you understand a writer more than delving into their work.",
                "This class was a fascinating insight into the world of the Victorian novel. Comparing Dickens and Eliot taught me so much more about both authors. I appreciated the class discussions, which were so engaged and deeply analytical.",
                "A greater understanding of and appreciation for Charles Dickens and George Eliot. A broader vocabulary and theoretical toolkit for analyzing novels, particularly Victorian novels. The ability to write a more substantial English essay (>20pp.) with serious secondary source research. The deeper self-knowledge that necessarily comes with reading six amazing books in a row.",
                "This course changed the way I think about lit analysis. I became a better reader, not just of Victorian lit, but a better reader full stop. I gained new appreciation for two writers that had not previously been among my favs. I learned about the utmost importance of revising academic papers."

                "I think this is an excellent course. My pitfalls were not really weaknesses of the course per se--they were personal struggles and opinions. The reading load was significant and hard to manage, but that's not really something that can be changed without the course losing its integrity. Also, my personal opinion was that the middle unit wasn't good--a tale of two cities and romola were, imo, a snooze. However, that opinion is based on my personal reaction to the texts, and has nothing to do with the integrity of the syllabus. I totally understand the choice to pair those two novels, and Romola seemed to be the favorite of many of my classmates. I really appreciated the option to choose to write a shorter final paper for grad students\/non-majors.",
                "Prof. Markovits is an unbelievably thoughtful, generous discussion leader and giver of feedback. The texts are across the board incredible, and reading them alongside her is a gift.",
                "I don't really have many suggestions for improvements. The main problem I had with it -- the fact that we had to discuss each novel in tiny chunks and very rarely as a whole work -- is kind of inherent to the massive size of these books. I feel like there just isn't time in any Yale class to fully discuss all the complexities of 6 Victorian novels, but that doesn't mean I wish there was less reading. The discussions always left me feeling curious, wanting more, and it was totally okay that we didn't cover everything. As for strengths, what WASN'T a strength? The conversations were always focused and revelatory. Professor Markovits's writing advice was on point."

                "It's a fascinating course and Professor Markovits is a really gifted seminar leader. She helps connect student ideas and make sure people feel valued in class. This led to a diverse array of participation from almost every class member each class.",
                "Yes, but be prepared for 400 pages of reading a week. I have never in my life read so much as I did in this class. I was also taking another class which had around 200 pages of reading a week. I would particularly not recommend doing that. However, if you are looking for a deeper dive into Dickens and Eliot, this is a great course for you.",
                "Yes. Make sure you are prepared to do the reading (it is a lot of reading). If you are, don't think twice this class is wonderful.",
                "Absolutely. As long as they promise, cross their heart and hope to die, to do all the reading. It's so so worth it."
