The professor does not respond to email and did not submit grades past the second assignment (out of 4 + final). The class itself was mostly listening to him ramble about people and their ideas, which was admittedly interesting at some points. Overall the comments that other people have about only taking this class if you don't care about your grade seem to be true.",

This course was, to put it in words used by the professor, an \"ambush.\" Once we got our first assignment things became more difficult, suddenly there were stakes. It would be helpful to introduce the assignment earlier in the class."
