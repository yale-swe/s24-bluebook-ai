                "Strengths: the instructors were great. They were always willing to work with us and our schedules.\r\nWeakness: I think we could've had more speaking practice throughout the course and less English use.",
                "One of the best classes I have had at Yale. The Interactive and communicative nature of the class truly turned us into a community. The main strength of the class was definitely our instructor-duo! Teresa always went out of her way to support us in and out of the class however she could, and Antonio balanced out our craziness with his calm and formal nature.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness would be that there is no true separation between L1 and L2 and therefore it is the same grade for the 3 credits at the end of the cumulative final. I think separating L1 and L2 by putting a midterm (final for L1)  will be helpful."
