                "The daily quizzes were way too much and I do not believe help you learn the language.  I constantly felt embarrassed in this course and never felt like I was doing well enough and I was always stressed.  If there are any strengths with the class, its the professor as Professor Farina is one of the nicest people youll ever meet.  Hes truly nice.  I just wish this course was just less demanding with the quizzes.",
                "Strengths- daily quizzes so vocabulary and grammar is always fresh and being improved on.",
                "Practicing speaking more in class would be beneficial",
                "I thought it was super engaging. My teacher was really great and the daily quizzes were a good motivator to study. The exams were a good level of difficulty and all of the topics were covered pretty thoroughly and I felt like I had a really good grasp on all of the concepts.",
                "The low stress nature of each assessment in this class was something I appreciated a ton since I didn't do too well on some assessments. I would suggest a weakness of the class is the necessity of buying the textbook; paying 200 dollars out of pocket was not feasible for me until the end of the semester and that affected my grade in the class adversely.",
                "The course is rigorous, and there is a short quiz every day. However, this actually means you really do learn the vocab and grammar in time for exams, and means there tends to be a lot less cramming before the final. Farina is also a charismatic and wonderful Professor - this is the only course I have ever taken where I was consistently genuinely excited to go to class. There are no weaknesses - I really did love this course.",
                "Strengths: size of the class promotes learning, Michael is an incredible professor, and there is a variety in student engagement - presentations, a movie, Italian songs, etc. Never a dull moment. To do well - go to class and stay enaged!",
                "I think it is taught very well.",
                "This course moves very quickly, and I personally feel like it is difficult to keep up with even if you put a lot of time and effort in.",
                "I like how class time was dedicated to practicing the material and going over more difficult italian grammar. Michael is a fantastic professor. It could be made more clear when\/what assignments are due when.",
                "Its super educational but also very fast paced."

One of you just genuinely love Italian and are willing to go up for the challenge or you have extensive background in Latin languages as Italian is pretty similar.  I would not by any means call this class a gut.  Do not expect to take this class to get an easy A if you dont put in the work.",

                "Yes, take Italian! The department is amazing and super friendly. They care about you learning the language more than anything else and it shows in their graciousness with grades.",
                "If you have the remotest interest in Italian, take it! You will learn a lot and it will feel quick. Language courses are naturally more difficult than other courses at Yale, but this one really does go by quickly and before you know it you will be speaking Italian! Farina is a great Professor and will keep you engaged with his endless enthusiasm and electric personality.",
                "Yes! I took this class because I had heard such wonderful things about the department and Michael specifically. The department does not disappoint! Everyone is there for support, advice, and extra help.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Farina is a great teacher and really cares. Italian is a also a very fun language.",
                "If you are willing to put in a lot of time outside of class, yes of course. Class time was engaging and fun and the language itself is beautiful. You learn so much in just one semester.",
                "Yes, it was a challenging course but great."
