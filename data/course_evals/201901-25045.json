   "comments": [
    "Seminar never felt boring. Professor Guinnane knew how to keep us engaged and teach us beyond the readings, instead of just rehashing them. \r\n\r\nImprovements\r\n- minimum requirement of paper responses by a certain date\r\n- another pset maybe... thought doing that was extremely helpful \r\n- require attendance and make it part of the grade",
    "Small class size was great, some of the topics could use a little bit more structure \/ modeling",
    "Strengths: The focus on five graded response papers that were meant to be concise, but communicate the main points of the paper really increased my engagement in the course. The papers also allowed me to improve my writing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class might be improved if sessions were more focused on ideas being discussed students instead of the current Q&A structure.",
    "I thought this course was well taught. The seminars were very interactive and we covered a lot in each class. I thought it was really interesting.",
    "Professor G comes to class with the most prepared notes\/game plan of any econ professor I've had in 4 years. One suggestion would be, given that the syllabus attracts less quantitative majors, some sort of supplemental review material to accompany the more quantitative readings. Some of the papers with more serious models were tough to grasp.",
    "Making class participation a part of the grade would allow for more student insight."

    "Yes. Great senior seminar.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are looking for insight into demographic thinking and into how political discourse frames issues related to migration and fertility among other topics. Although I like most people were originally interested in the class for the light workload, I ended up learning a lot from it. Prof. Guinnane is an interesting instructor.",
    "Yes I would",
    "It is very interesting and different than other economics courses offered at Yale. I definitely recommend to anyone interested in exploring the impact of economics on people and population.",
    "Highly recommend, interesting and relevant material that you do not come across elsewhere",
    "Yes, if they are an econ major that is looking for a seminar that is less focused on quantitative skills.",
    "Yes Professor Guinnane is a great and smart teacher",
    "Good economics senior seminar but more workload week to week than others"
