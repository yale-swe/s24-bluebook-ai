    "From this course I gained a better understanding of the theoretical foundations of capitalism and racial ideology.",
    "Great intro to engaging thoughtfully with racial capitalism, and also offers some generative critiques of liberalism using concepts of political theory!",
    "I learned about race and capitalism and their current manifestations in society. I also learned that I do not particularly enjoy the deep study of Marxism.",
    "This course was very broad-reaching in its scope and reach, which is pretty much delineated by the title. We learned about subjects from the relationship between slavery and American capitalist development, to colonialism and race.",
    "This course was foundational for me in bolstering an anticapitalist perspective. The course developed my ability to think critically about ideology and different theorizations of economy and race. Texts from this syllabus have been immediately relevant to my coursework in ANTH and WGSS.",
    "This course changed the way I think about nearly every aspect of my life. Ive learned how to understand the ties between social structures, economic systems, and political institutions (well beyond the superficial connections between what most think of when they hear race and capitalism). The readings for the class were phenomenal, and ranged from popular reportage to marxist theory (we also watched several interesting documentaries and a film). Aaron provided generous feedback on all the assignments and gave us a lot of leeway with the topics of our papers, encouraging us to apply the content to our own specific interests.",
    "You learn about both the foundations of capitalism and how it relates to exploitation and race."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Carico, the syllabus\r\nWeaknesses: At times it seemed that students didn't complete the readings which made some discussions difficult.",
    "Discussion was at times a bit one sided, both in that the group of students was fairly quiet and the professor had a lot (of good things) to say. Would be great if reformed as a purposeful l-eminar!",
    "While the course is listed as a seminar, it was not really taught as one. It felt more like a 2-hour lecture with minimal student discussion. I wish the course had been organized to facilitate more conversation to engage better with the material.",
    "I think the course was incredibly interesting and touched on incredibly important topics. I think it could benefit somehow from some readings or discussion facilitation that grounded it and kept things from getting too abstract.",
    "The syllabus was incredible, but class discussions sometimes lost momentum. I would have preferred to hear even more from the professor.",
    "The only weakness was that class discussions were slow at times, as a result of the occasionally tough readings. However, investment was very high from all students and Aaron very effectively highlighted the key sections of the more difficult texts.",
    "Sometimes I felt lost with the very theoretical texts because they were so complicated."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students. The readings were excellent and though at times they were dense, Professor Carico did a great job at helping us digest the material so that we could walk away from the class with genuine understanding.",
    "Go ahead. Not overwhelming workload and the readings are interesting, but sometimes feel a little disconnected.",
    "If organized better and maybe with a different professor, this course does allow for a new, interesting lens on society.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in critically thinking about race as a social construct, and what capitalism really is, includes, and entails. I think our readings and discussions provided a good way to interrogate questions about how race and the formation of capitalism are intimately intertwined.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone regardless of their academic background. The texts build on one another without assuming a broad knowledge base within race scholarship prior to taking the course. We began with an introduction to Marxian thought which was extremely helpful for later class discussions in the semester.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course and any and every student. The material from this course is so important to learn, and Aaron teaches it in an extremely engaging\/exciting\/effective\/affective way.",
    "If you are willing to read some very confusing texts then yes."
