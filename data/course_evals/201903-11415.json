   "comments": [
    "Being able to read and write Arabic, knowing basic grammar and vocabulary",
    "Arabic language \r\nVocab\r\nCommunication",
    "Turn around unless you are truly committed to giving Arabic your all. This is a beautiful, useful, and rewarding language if you put in the time. You will learn to read and write in Arabic script, you will learn multiple textbooks' worth of vocabulary, and you will learn grammar concepts like verb conjugation and sentence structure. You are supposed to study a regional dialect on the side, but this is difficult to maintain alongside everything else.",
    "Professor Aziz has an amazing grasp of the grammar and syntax in Arabic. He is able to succinctly convey concepts in Arabic grammar, and because of his streamlined approach to the grammar, I was able to successfully learn a lot of grammar rules. I can probably not speak the language as fluently but I can definitely apply grammar rules with no difficulty at all.",
    "This course gave me a foundation in the Arabic alphabet as well as basic greetings and other vocab\/sentence constructions in formal and Levantine Arabic.  Although it's fast paced, if you start this course with zero Arabic experience (like I did) you definitely end up with a lot more understanding of the language than you expect.",
    "I learned the basics of the Arabic language.",
    "I was able to grasp the fundamentals of Arabic grammar, orthography, and conversation, such that now I can already have basic conversations.",
    "I was able to develop a clear understanding of the Arabic alphabet through oral and written practice. Additionally, I learned numerous Arabic words in Formal dialect. I began to develop an understanding of basic Arabic grammatical rules and skills.",
    "Basic Vocab, use of basic verbs. Alphabet, learning how to write.",
    "The amount of homework really taught me the importance of time management. Especially in the beginning, homework assignments could last up to 3 hours and it just took some planning to get everything done.",
    "I strengthened my basics in Arabic, as well as learning the fundamental basics of formal Arabic."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - textbook is awesome, I really learned quickly\r\nWeaknesses - Dr Aziz made class super confusing -- I basically had to teach myself all the concepts outside of class using the textbook",
    "Course runs a bit too fast at the start but then settles into good pace \r\nVery grammar heavy towards the end",
    "The class meetings seemed very unstructured. Almost all of my learning came from independent study and doing the homework (although I felt that many of the homework assignments weren't really helping with my learning). There was very little communication between the TA and professor so many TA sessions were pointless and not related to each other (continuous). There was very little speaking in class so my speaking has not improved much. The professor's handwriting is messy and hard to read especially as he goes over material (too) quickly. I like the book except for the vocabulary which prioritizes less useful words over words you would use every day. Also, the TAs and I think the arabic sequence in general expect that most students will go on an arabic summer trip which I am not able to do.",
    "This is a very difficult language to start from scratch. Arabic is rewarding once you make progress, but the introductory level should be taught differently. There are up to four hours of homework every day (according to the prof!) and very little instruction aside from review of the homework, because there's so much of it. The pace is rapid for the first month; we started our second textbook several weeks in and then slowed down. Instead, the material should be evenly distributed. Our TA was supposed to teach a weekly class on the Levantine dialect, but she hardly ever showed up, and did not have a lesson plan when she did. There is a bit of a divide between students who have prior experience in an Arabic dialect and students with no experience; I found the diversity of knowledge helpful, because I could make friends in the class who knew more than I did and were happy to answer questions.",
    "The strength as aforementioned is definitely grammar, and teaching the \"Arabic Rules\". The course is very well designed for learning Classical Arabic and enables the students to successfully learn a significant amount. However, its biggest weakness lies in teaching Al-Shaami\/ the Levantine Dialect. Technically, the dialect teaching should be 50% of the course, in reality, however, it comprises only 10-15%. Hence, even by the end a student is unable to converse in the Shaami dialect. For our section, in particular (that is the 9:25 section of Arabic L1) our TA was virtually absent throughout the length of the course. She provided us with minimal teaching, and usually substituted her classes for other instructors. I wish she was more active as that would've also helped offset the issue of Al-Shaami teaching lacking in depth and breadth.",
    "This course has a lot of great material and the class content as well as homework is all helpful. One thing to be aware of is that the course uses a digital textbook website that can be really frustrating, because it doesn't work most of the time. That being said, this isn't a huge obstacle to learning since a lot of the drills you can do in the book or with mp4 files. Another weakness of the course is that you may find yourself struggling comparatively, because people of many levels do this course, including people with a lot of prior Arabic experience. Don't be discouraged though, the professor is aware of this and is always happy to answer questions that you have after class.",
    "Could be improved by having more conversational aspects to help practice speaking.",
    "The course was able to encourage intense personal study from the onset so we have internalized a lot of what we need to speak, read, and write Arabic. \r\n\r\nDaily lessons were often very disorganized so it was often hard to understand what it was we were learning.\r\n\r\nThe teacher could do a better job of prefacing each lesson with a clear description of the grammar topic we are learning and its significance so we dont get lost and are better able to internalize it.\r\n\r\nThe teacher could also do better to keep us on task so we dont run out of time to learn each concept.\r\n\r\nAlso, we should have incorporated more speaking exercises in class because I found that most helpful in improving my fluency with the language.",
    "The due dates for this course and the homework assignments were often unclear. Additionally, I often felt lost the night before a test because it was not made clear which skills were necessary for testing. I did, however, strengthen my basic Arabic language skills.",
    "Prof. Aziz is a fun teacher, he pushes you to work in an enthusiastic way. The website was the main weakness of this class: It is new and has a bunch of bugs that make homework sometimes exasperating.",
    "Great that the course is taught in a dichotomypracticed in class with instruction in grammar and outside of class with the online course material.",
    "More reading and writing practice, as well as grammar application practice would help solidify our knowledge more.",
    "The course is INCREDIBLY overwhelming at first as somebody with zero background knowledge in Arabic, and the workload was insane the first month or so of the course. As the course went on, the work tapered off, and though by the end of the term it was really nice to have very little homework (though still tests to study for and a presentation to prepare for) at the end of the semester when other classes were increasing their workload, I wish the work had been a bit more evenly spread out.",
    "The strength of this course is that it takes its time to teach the basics of Arabic, specifically the letters and simple vocabulary and grammar. The weakness is that sometimes it puts too much stress on the student, since learning new words when the full alphabet isn't even completed yet is difficult."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I think learning Arabic is really valuable, so I would recommend taking it. But if you can, take it with someone other than Aziz -- he makes the concepts unnecessarily convoluted and is overall pretty disorganized.",
    "Be challenging but good",
    "I would recommend arabic as a language but I think this course with this professor is not very well put together.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you a) have prior experience with an Arabic dialect or a related language like Urdu, or b) are fully committed to spending significant time studying Arabic every day.",
    "Yes. Students interested in learning the Arabic language, would benefit greatly from having an instructor like Professor Aziz. His willingness to answer student's questions and his ability to teach grammar is unparalleled.",
    "I would recommend this class to people with no foundation in Arabic. As someone who was new to the language I found it really intimidating in class when people spouted long, complicated sentences, BUT if you ignore that and focus on the set homework and the grammar\/sentence structure in the textbooks, you will end up passing the class and learning a lot of Arabic along the way :) On the other hand, if you do have prior Arabic knowledge, this class is probably going to be too easy for you and I would suggest starting with L2 or talking to the Professor so you don't sit in class bored while we toil away learning the alphabet (we will probably end up asking you for help as well).",
    "If you want to learn Arabic then yes.",
    "I would recommend this course because it was effective in helping us to learn the fundamentals of Arabic but I would do so with reservations only because some students are not as flexible and able to deal with the type of disorganization that characterized this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student only if they aim to learn the basic skills of the Arabic language. Students will not come out of this course with proficiency in the language; rather, they will come out with a great vocabulary list and understanding of the Arabic alphabet.",
    "Yes! Learn the language, it is fun and extremely useful",
    "I do feel like I learned a solid foundation in Arabic, but a lot of that is self-driven -- there isn't much teaching in the class and a lot of it is self driven by the book. I'd say to any first year coming in wanting to take this class first semester, it was very overwhelming for me while I was trying to figure out other classes, make friends, and join clubs, because it truly took me 4-6 hours a day to do my homework for the first 3 weeks or so, and after that it still took 2-3 hours for a while, and it really made it hard to adjust to Yale. That being said, if you already know the alphabet, that wouldn't be nearly as bad. And if you're good at language learning (which I am just not), it will be easier to get through it. Also, while the material is difficult and the workload insane at the beginning (and really Thanksgiving is when it died down), the grading of the class is pretty generous.",
    "I would recommend this course. Arabic is a wonderful language to learn, and while difficult at first, proves very rewarding. Knowledge of Arabic will prove to be very useful in many scenarios spanning a broad range of career aspirations."
