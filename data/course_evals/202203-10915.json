                "Prof. Barron is very knowledgeable in this topic. The course covers lots of material and includes hands-on projects. The lectures tend to be boring, especially the first two units. The midterm and final are written, as opposed to being a practical project. It would have been much more informative if there was a final project instead. Also, we can learn the encyclopedic information outside class and do hands-on activities in class maybe?",
                "This class teaches you a lot of interesting stuff about security, but the assignments were very long and dry. My biggest issue was the detail oriented and tedious nature of the assignments which sometime make you miss the big picture."

                "Yes, especially if they are interested in writing actual exploit codes.",
                "I think everyone should take this class for the sheer fact that it forces you to consider the implications of improper web development and memory management in C which 323 does not get into. It will make you consider the security implications in your code making your code more robust and secure. However, I do think that the lectures, which are taught at a pretty high level, do not translate to the tedious assignments super well. I wish the lecture went into a bit more detail about how attacks are executed, if they are still relevant today, and modern alternative attacks. The class focused a lot on attacks that no longer have any effect, but I suppose this is in an effort to teach you about the defenses we have against attackers. I think Professor Barron is quite dry as well which makes class a drag. He grades participation, but doesn't really offer much opportunity to participate. Part of this participation grade are weekly quizzes which have questions that often feel like trick questions. These trick questions continue on exams which makes it really difficult to not second guess yourself when you put an answer down.",
                "Like in OOP, the first part of this class feels slow and surface level. When the real homeworks arrive, it gets more interesting, but also more difficult. These homeworks were a little unpredictable, both in terms of when they'd be released, as well as how hard they'd be. So don't leave them to the last two days. The final this semester wasn't as terribly hard as claimed by previous reviews, but still tricky. Overall, I'd recommend only if you like breaking\/hacking things or want to be better versed\/aware of security issues."
