                "Strengths: Marynel explains a lot of really complex mathematical concepts clearly and lectures well. There's also a lot of freedom with the final project so you can actually build something really cool that you are proud of! The grading is super clear and fair. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the content just goes so fast especially if you don't have a strong background in linear algebra. She would sometimes go through slides and slides of mathematical proofs and I just wouldn't understand half of it and just hope to screenshot the slides and understand later.",
                "The class was fun and challenging but if you don't have a high enough math background it makes the lectures less engaging and a bit confusing.",
                "The strengths of the course are that Dr. Vasquez is an exceptional instructor and the lectures are always beautifully put together. The content is fascinating, well-researched, and highly relevant to current industry tools. The speakers are great and so are the paper presentations / demos. An issue with the grading system that I am not really sure how to resolve is that members of the final group project may focus on their individual deliverables, enhancing their own grade while leaving more work for others to do in the group. The leaderboard extra-credit activity for assignment #2 is a particularly relevant example, especially since it was due in close proximity to the milestone.",

                "It is a really interesting class if you are interested in robotics or AI. I would say I learned I probably don't want to work in robotics, but that's also really helpful and important information. \r\nThe workload was not too terrible, but the psets are DIFFICULT. There aren't many which is why I say the workload is pretty comparable, but they were really difficult for me to wrap my head around. I would take like 3 hours to write just a few lines of code because I had to spend a lot of time understanding the math. Coming with no background in linear algebra definitely made it more difficult, but not impossible. I would also recommend taking it with friends because you can't do the homework all alone and the project would be more fun with people you know and like.",
