This is the one course I took this semester where I can actually say that I saw my improvement week by week and I am proud to be learning. I was also able to engage with literary works that were interesting and made me reflect upon my own life and how I see the world!!!\r\nWeaknesses: I would say the only weakness is that when we go over answers to homework it is very easy for the professor to lean on the individuals on the class who know all the answers. Then it doesn't really feel like I'm there to learn but there to hear the best person in the class prove how much French they know. It then feels like the professor only wants to get through learning and not seeing each of our individual improvement. It only happened so often but when it did it wasn't so great."
