                "Although I am not the fastest translator, from this class,  have gained the skills to be able to pick up most works in Attic Greek and be able to piece together a mostly correct translation.",
                "Thanks to Professor Robinson's excellent teaching, I have gained an incredible foundation of Ancient Greek that I will take with me in my perusal of the classics degree and higher academia. Not only did my greek improve, but my acquisition and understanding of all other languages as well. I also actually was not a huge fan of Plato before this course, but Professor Robinson taught the Apology so passionately that I became a huge fan of the Apology and now wish to explore more of Plato's writings in its original ancient greek.",
                "I learned a lot of Ancient Greek (reconstructed) Phonology, Morphology, and Syntax. I also learned the historical linguistics of the evolution of Ancient Greek from Proto-Indo-European, and how the forms of verbs and nouns came about through the sound changes into Ancient Greek. This was really useful as it made it much easier to memorize all the numerous verb and noun forms thinking about the historical reasons for why they are the way they are. I also learned about being a good textual critic, and how interpretation plays a big role in shaping our understanding of these ancient texts. I learned about the literature, philosophy, and history which pertain to Ancient Greek. All in all there is so much I learned in this course that it is impossible to sum it up here, but I really feel that I have grown as a person in this class.",

But thats what you signed up for.",
                "I think an intensive language course can be intimidating, especially one in Ancient Greek. The greatest strength of the course is definitely how caring and fun Professor Robinson is.",
                "Honestly, I only saw strengths to this course. However, Professor Robinson teaches it so well and his way of teaching grammatical instructions is so strong, that the course could even forego the textbook or maybe focus on it less; it would have been a treat to begin reading sooner and learn grammar along the way, as Professor Robinson always explained it much better than textbooks. Though, of course, I do see how jumping into reading too early could pose a problem, so I wouldn't call this a \"weakness\"!",
                "This class is extremely well organized and Professor Robinson is not only an expert in Greek and Classics, but he is also an amazing teacher and is able to create an environment which facilitates our growth and learning as a class. Everything about this class is fantastic and I have not found any weaknesses at all.",
                "The course goes fast, but the speed is certainly necessary and is handled well. The composition exercises were useful, but sometimes felt a little disconnected from the rest of the course."

The knowledge and reading abilities that you come into this course with (i.e, none) and where you are coming out of it is... well, remarkable. This class is such a great way to start learning Ancient Greek and Robinson is THE BEST!",
                "Yes but be prepared to fashion your entire course schedule around this class. It is of course a 2 credit class but somehow it still feels undercredited for the amount of time and energy you have to invest. But it is without question worth it if you have even a middling interest in Greek culture or history. By any metric, being able to read Plato in the original Greek within four months is a tremendous accomplishment and is exceptionally rewarding.",
                "If you want to learn Ancient Greek well, quickly, and have fun doing it, then absolutely.",
                "If they wish to be challenged and want to learn Ancient Greek, there is no better way than to be taught by Professor Robinson.",
                "This course is incredible and I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Ancient Greek, challenge their beliefs about language and culture, read central works of the Classical/Western canon, or even just to have a once in a lifetime learning experience. The class really is a lot of work, you should be dedicated to immersing yourself in it and need to really be open to appreciating the language, but the class is very manageable if you are just consistent about put ting the work in. There are 10 hours of class time a week and you should put in another 1-3 hours a day in order to really master the material. If you are considering taking it, I couldnt recommend it more; you will not regret it. If you are intimidated by the workload, its not as stressful as it seems. You will have a great time and learn so much; by the end you really will be able to read and understand the real Greek of Platos Apology! Professor Robinson is an inspiration to teaching and he knows the course like the back of his hand. He makes the class engaging and fun! If you do take the class it might be helpful to spend some time before the semester starts, getting familiar with the alphabet and trying to sound out words; doing the first couple of chapters of the textbook before hand would really make the transition to the course more smooth, but definitely is not necessary. Enjoy the class, this is the way to learn Ancient Greek!",
