                "This course is heavily based around the Griffiths textbook, so you really, really need the book for this class. Not only is the homework assigned taken from the book, but the lectures often cover examples given in the book and don't always provide the context, so actually doing the assigned reading will seriously deepen your understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciated the provided printed lecture notes and the lectures being recorded, I tended to find the lectures hard to engage with live since they were taught from slides rather than being worked through in real time.\r\n\r\nThe weekly study hall with the TA was EXTREMELY helpful and I wish there could have been two rather than just one!",

I had no knowledge of quantum mechanics prior to taking this class and left with a solid understanding of many concepts and topics, as well as a sparked interest in learning more! While you do cover a lot, I felt that I was able to understand the topics well and that they were accessible to me even though I had no prior experience.",

Even then it will be very hard!",
