                "I love the Portuguese department at Yale. The emphasis is on enjoying the language learning process and gaining appreciation for another culture, not perfecting your grammar. I really like this approach because it encourages me to speak up and participate a lot, but now that I am going into L5, I would have liked to have some class time in L4 dedicated to learning more advanced grammar rules. I have taken L1, L2, L3, and L4 at Yale and was barely taught how to conjugate verbs at all. Most of what I know is from what I have studied independently. With that being said, I always found the classes to be very engaging and customized to our individual interests.",
                "I would say the strengths of the course mainly had to do with it being relatively free-form in terms of pedagogy. I felt that having the freedom to form my own thoughts and sentences instead of sticking to a certain repertoire was simultaneously challenging yet more rewarding and stimulating. The class definitely would benefit from being a bit more organized; I feel that more small group discussions before exchanging the ideas as a class would have been great.",
                "I believe this course had many strengths, and very few weaknesses. We analyzed a variety of Brazilian art, including manifestos, films, YouTube videos, music, and poetry. The selections were all very different and interesting! \r\n\r\nI think the small class was also a strength of this course. I felt very comfortable talking in class, and the small groups we were always put into helped to facilitate lots of dialogue amongst students."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. In fact, I have convinced many of my friends to start Portuguese at Yale. The Portuguese department is very laid-back and welcoming.",
                "Yes, if you want to continue learning Portuguese after L3 then this is naturally something that you would want to do. I'd also recommend the class to anyone who wants a general introduction to Brazilian history and the arts.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning about Brazilian culture. I thought we learned so much about not only Brazil's present, but also history."
