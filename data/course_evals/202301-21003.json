The lectures presented not only facts about different organisms and physical processes but we really delved into how they all connected with a focus on how changing environments due to climate change impact the oceans.",

                "I learned a lot from this course and I think it is generally very well structured. Lectures were from scientific and social perspectives. I do wish expectations for assignments had been communicated a little more clearly from the beginning, and that we had received feedback (despite submitting several writing assignments, I have no idea about my standing in the class other than from the midterm).",
                "Excellent class! No need for improvement.",
                "I think overall the class was really interesting but some lectures were more engaging than others, probably due to personal interest. There were a decent amount of assignments to do which werent that bad however the communication about them was somewhat lacking at times. It was also slightly difficult to keep up with responding to reading summaries so I think an improvement would be to only require a certain number(maybe 75%). I loved the field trips and learned so much, it was a really special experience to learn from scientists in the field! I think faster feedback on the assignments would have been nice.",
                "The lectures were super interesting and easy to follow. I especially loved the homework assignments and thought they were well-tailored to improve my science writing, journal article comprehension, and general understanding of the course material. The field trips were also cool and I appreciated the chance to meet with some scientists who were doing innovative aquaculture work.\r\n\r\nI would have loved to have more field trips and I think some kind of field trip /field lab combination would have been cool. In general though I really liked this course and wouldn't change much.",
                "it was great! professor is excellent.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were well-structured with a good amount of text and images, I appreciated that lectures were recorded as I could use them to review, Professor Decker was very generous with her time in office hours, and the labs and field trips were super interesting!!",
                "Strengths: variety of assignments and material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the grading for the exams was a bit unfair. They looked for such specific things that it was less about how much you know and more about how well you take tests.",
                "I was expecting this course to have more discussion and class interaction, but the course was primarily lecture with discussion only on canvas. However I think the overall course was good."

                "Yes, absolutely! Professor Decker is the best and she obviously really knows her stuff. Each lecture is super well organized. If youre into the material I think there are really few to no drawbacks.",
                "Yes I would recommend this class to another student but only if they are really interested in the subject and have some background in either physical oceanography or ecology. The class covers a TON of content and we were expected to remember most of it in detail for the exams. They were fair exams but just very dense on material, so I think coming in with some prior knowledge would be helpful so you are not starting from 0 when it comes to studying.",
                "Yes! Mary Beth Decker is a great teacher and a very kind person. She knows a lot about the ocean and covers a ton of ground in class. I left feeling like I had a good grasp on all the major biological and physical properties of the world's oceans.",
                "yes to anyone who is interested in studying the big blue. It will be a great course for you!",
                "I would, as you learn so much interesting information about the ocean that I have not had the opportunity to learn in other classes. You also get to participate in super fun and interesting field trips! And Professor Decker is a kind and knowledgeable instructor.",
                "Yes, I think its a well organized class with lots of opportunities to learn.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is already interested in the material.",
                "I definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the ocean and climate change. The ocean plays a vital role in regulating our climate and marine biology, and I think everyone should be exposed to this knowledge."
