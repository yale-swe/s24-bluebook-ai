    "Analysis of major political texts and exposure to significant political ideas.",
    "I developed an ability to pick apart political theories and compare them.",
    "Whereas first semester was centered upon historical thought, this semester shifted its focus toward political thought. I learned a lot about different intellectuals' writings on government, civilization, liberty, and the role of the individual-- basically, ideas about why and how we should all live together."

    "The authors in this course are very cohesive and are definitely in dialogue with one another.",
    "I think the course would be improved if less texts were covered because it would allow students to engage more fully with the texts that are read.",
    "Great class all around",
    "The course is great at teaching major political thought since Hobbes. Perhaps there could be more use of secondary sources to help clarify ideas and show the relationship between authors.",
    "This course often felt disjointed in the structure of its syllabi. I would appreciate better dialogue between H\/P and Phil professors and coursework.",
    "The syllabus is strong, the instructor could have been more engaging.",
    "I liked the authors selected for the course and the seminar style. The one thing I would say was a weakness was that the amount of reading assigned often exceeded the amount we were able to discuss in class."

    "I would recommend to some, but definitely not all.  Directed Studies is a rigorous program, and it definitely is not the best fit for all first-year students.  However, for students really wishing to engage with the Western canon, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, H&P is the best part of DS.",
    "Yes, it is fascinating and engaging.",
    "If you enjoy political theory and wish to take Directed Studies then yes, I do recommend this course.",
    "DS H&P is an excellent track. Such a great lineup of writers, and wonderful professors. Favorite class at Yale.",
    "I recommend the DS program on the whole.",
    "This class would be great for someone who has an interest in the authors on the syllabus and likes to talk about really deep questions about civilization, but I wouldn't say it would be everyone's cup of tea."
