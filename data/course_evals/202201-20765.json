This is not science, it is speculation at best, sheer conjecture and data dredging at worst. Ostensibly, linguists do not understand the effect of a confounding variable. Don't ask about exclusion restriction violations, randomization, or interference-- these concepts are not important to linguists. Evidence is presented in the form of a series of experiments that simply are not worth their weight in salt. I would have rather taken a class on the numerous ways in which the experimental designs used throughout the term were flawed.",
                "The course covers a wide, shallow breadth of knowledge about basic concepts in linguistics, psychology, and neuroscience. As an introductory course, it's a good way to get your feet wet in the intersection of these fields, and helped me focus my interests. Professor Frank's version of the course includes a lot of analysis at specific, landmark studies, cultivating the ability to consume scientific studies responsibly.",

            "comments": [
                "The organization of the class was severely lacking. I would recommend, for example, that homework assignments more accurately reflect the types of questions asked on the exam. Novel questions and critical thinking are extremely useful, but not as a means of one-off evaluation. Why not have a homework assignment to theorize about rules of syllabic structure of an unknown language? Why not include IPA on the homework for phonology if IPA will be tested on the exam? It seems that Robert Frank takes a special satisfaction in obscuring expectations. If Frank spent 1/10th of the time he spends thinking about syntax as he did reviewing the literature on modern pedagogical techniques, the class would benefit enormously. Frank should understand that many in the class are just there to learn something new, and his attitude towards teaching turns students off from these topics that he obviously cares very much about.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are always fun and engaging, and you almost always walk away with novel insights.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures feel disconnected from one another. It was hard for me to draw conclusions about the bigger pictures in the field.",
                "Interesting course! So many strengths. Doctor Frank is amazing. It was a fun year. Doctor Frank is so passionate about his course and the material. It is so cute seeing him get so excited about some of the concepts he teaches. He is fantastic. The only thing that was odd was the strict grading from the TFs (I took this Credit/D/Fail, so it didn't bother me), but I am sure if you take this for a letter grade, you can just speaking to Doctor Frank when encountering these things. I am sure he would review scores from the TFs and (if you speak with him about it), and would likely take into account that you are still learning, and the TFs are still learning as well. So don't panic when you see a TF has given a certain grade on a homework assignment. Doctor Frank will see your work, take into account all sides, and this would probably becomes a C or a B. I personally never had to do this since I am taking this Credit/D/Fail, but I know students who have and it was an easy process. Doctor Frank is on your side, he wants you to enjoy linguistics.",
                "Prof. Frank does an excellent job of lecturing in an intuitive and engaging way, however, one downfall of this is that it is sometimes hard to know what to study for exams. The course was also a bit unorganized, homework assignments kind of came out of the blue.",
                "I think the overall high level view of what we are learning is super interesting, its just the weeds are a little too dense for a non-lingustics major.",
                "Strengths: Professor Frank cares a lot about this field, which is evident in every lecture. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a final exam and final project. Sometimes material was complicated beyond understanding.",
                "It was highly disorganized. With a quick look at the slides, you can see how ideas were not organized in way that flowed well.\r\n\r\nHome was well designed to make students actually learn and understand the material.",
                "This was my first linguistics class, and I definitely learned a lot. However, sometimes the homework assignments were unclear or it was hard to relate them to the lecture material we were learning at the time. I would have appreciated more guidance on the homework. Also, the exams were pretty difficult for a course that's supposed to be intro-level.",
                "Energized professor, but the content wasn't super interesting and I only took it for the cog sci major. Also some of the homework assignment were a lot more difficult than I expected.",
                "This course was generally solid, but sometimes felt a little scattered in its approach. Some of the assignments felt unnecessarily tortuous. The lectures were very good and the material was interesting.",
                "I found the topics of this course to be really interesting. I think that it could be further improved if for some of the problem sets, we went through more examples in class of what was actually related to the problem sets. However, a strength of this course for me was how it allowed me freedom to explore and engage with the topics we were learning.",
                "I enjoyed everything about this course this semester. One helpful thing would be more structured lectures, sometimes it was unclear when we were finishing a topic and moving onto the next one, which made taking notes less effective.",
                "I really enjoyed how Prof. Frank organized the class and he made the lectures much more fun and entertaining.",
                "Strengths: Professor Frank is super passionate and excited about this topic, which made lecture very engaging. His and TFs office hours were also very helpful, and they all seemed to really care about our understanding. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some lectures were hard to follow (like the one where we went over connectionism), so studying for the final required a lot of time spent reviewing those.",
                "I think the lecture on connectivity could have been a bit more comprehensive. That topic wasn't super difficult but many of my friends were confused. Overall though, super fascinating material and I found the class really interesting and informative. no class time wasted!",
                "I think that the course material was a bit scattered at times. I found it a bit hard to focus on what was actually the most important in the grand scheme of the discussion each week. I would personally improve the course by including even more engaging material or activities (perhaps short in-class experiments on the students) because I found it a bit hard to focus on/remember all the aspects of some of the more repetitive material in class. That said, not all lectures were repetitive. Especially those that dove deep into human spatial/perceptual cognition etc.",
                "This class was not very engaging and I shouldve expected that this class would be less like cognitive science and more like a class solely about linguistics. Syllabus was confusing and homework assignments were very inconsistent in difficulty. First one was very easy, but the last 3 were very difficult. Also there should be more practice with application of concepts to be able to better succeed on the exams.",
                "Strengths- Great instructor\r\nWeaknesses- Not alot of TAs, very difficult subject to go over so doing the homework/projects were a struggle",
                "I really enjoyed this course but I feel like the exams were tough and couldve used some practice beforehand.",
                "Professor Frank is an energetic and captivating lecturer, and the course is very well structured. \r\nMy only wish is that we had been given more incentive to do the assigned readings, perhaps with weekly reading responses.\r\nThe problem sets were enjoyable and instructive, but there were very few of them.",
                "Professor Frank is incredibly engaging and fun. The lectures are great, the assignments are interesting and not too difficult, and overall its a great class.",
                "Although this is an intro course, the professor jumps from unrelated topic to unrelated topic. This means that every lecture is crammed with tons of information that you have go over later to fully process. Often, he will spend a good portion of the class going over a theory only to later reveal that it is completely false. This just makes it confusing to understand the main point of a lecture. The exams also seem to be testing your ability to take a test rather than your understanding of the content. The homeworks later in the semester are also surprisingly time consuming. Once you understand it, the class gets interesting.",
                "This was a phenomenal course. Professor Frank lectured in a very engaging way and incorporated interactive elements into the class. Additionally, the homework assignments were very interesting and helped to complement and strengthen understanding of the material discussed in class.",
                "I loved this class overall. The lectures were very well done, and I liked that we had multiple types of small homework assignments. The one thing that could be improved is the recordings of the lectures: often I wanted to rewatch them in case I had missed material, and the audio was ok but definitely could've been better. If there were some way to do a more official/proper type of recording of the classes, I think that would help.",
                "Strengths: Bob is very enthusiastic and fun to listen to during lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The focus of the class tends to vary in its degree of scope. Some lectures tend to be on more broad topics while others are very nitty gritty, which can tend to get in the way of expectations during each lecture.",

                "It's a fun course without too much homework that will get your feet wet in the cognitive science of language. You can tell pretty early on if it's a topic you'd enjoy, so it wouldn't hurt to give it a shot!",
                "I took this to probe the linguistics department and see if I wanted to major in linguistics. I did the course Credit/D/Fail, so there was never any stress on me in the course. It was very smooth sailing in that regard. The midterm and the final are tough, so had I done this for a grade, I am not sure how well I would have done. However the grades get curved up due to the difficulty and so it all equals out.",
                "Yes, but really only to fulfill a requirement or if you have interest in both cognitive science and linguistics. I took this as my linguistics breadth requirement for the cogsci major and found it overall a good course, but as someone who is personally not particularly interested in linguistics, the linguistics information seemed tedious to me. However if you enjoy both subjects, then definitely a great course.",
                "Kinda good gut? But prolly only if ur gonna C/D/F it. Classes are sometimes interesting sometimes not, and homeworks are few but time intensive. Exams aren't bad.",
                "Only if you're definitely interested in linguistics, as it can get into the weeds.",
                "Not especially, unless you have a previous interest in linguistics and/or computer science/machine learning.",
                "No, it may be interesting but it was highly disorganized with an insane amount of content.",
                "No, not unless some changes are made to the course. Professor Frank is kind and explains the concepts of the assigned readings well in his lectures, but the assignments/exams made this course difficult. \r\nThe assignments were confusing at times, and there wasn't a set schedule for when homework was assigned. This sporadic nature made it tough when you suddenly had a long lab assignment to complete. It wasn't always clear to me what TFs were looking for when grading assignments. Even though they did release rubrics for later assignments, I wish they had done that initially. Also, I wished that we had received all of our homework grades in a timely manner; for example, we did not receive feedback on our last assignment in time for the final exam, which made studying hard when you're not sure where you need to improve/how well you did on homework.\r\nAs for the exams....as someone with no experience in linguistics or cognitive science, I felt that the material was incredibly specific and tough. There is a lot of technical information to memorize and you really need to know the nuances of each concept/study. I can understand if this was the case for a more advanced class, but this is an intro-level course! It shouldn't be this hard, and I felt discouraged after taking the midterm and final. It sucks because the material did feel accessible when Professor Frank explained it in lecture, but then you sit down for the exam and feel the opposite.\r\nFor the final exam, we were given extra time and told that we likely wouldn't need it...but most students stayed almost the entire time to work on it. I think that says something about the level of difficulty.",
                "Not really, unless you are super interested in linguistics or plan on concentrating on a linguistic topic for the cognitive science major.",
                "Yes! The lectures are interesting and move at a comfortable pace. The course is heavy on linguistics, so I would not recommend this to a cognitive science student who isnt willing to learn a significant growth amount of linguistics.",
                "I would recommend this course with reservations. It was enjoyable, but it did often feel like we were retreading the same ground in some of the material.",
                "I would recommend this class to any students interested in learning more about linguistics. I think it introduces students to a wide variety of topics.",
                "Yes! Very interesting.",
                "Yes, great professor and deep insights into the topic without too much technical rigor.",

                "Take this class! This goes really in-depth into a lot of really interesting questions about language, from cool pieces of grammar that we take for granted to fascinating comparisons between languages. Its a lot of things that are around you all the time and that become really interesting when you stop to think about them in this theoretical way.",
