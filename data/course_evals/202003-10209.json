I gained insight into what it's like to be a creative writer in each of three different types of creative writing: short story\/fiction, poetry, drama. I learned some techniques and main ideas for each of these, built writing skills, learned how to look for creative writing techniques in the pieces I read, and most importantly, got a lot of practice in each of the types of creative writing through brief exercises and final unit submissions. At the end, I had a full portfolio of creative writing.",
                "I learned a great deal about story structure and how to really write stories.  We really went into the weeds when it came to planning out stories correctly and making sure that we were able to know the nitty-gritty details that go into the fiction writing process, as well as how to analyze a story to extract interesting tools and devices to use in our own writing.  I also learned how to appreciate poetry a bit more than I did before (which is a miracle since, as you might be able to tell, I prefer prose).  I even learned how to enjoy the process of writing poetry, as we learned how to look at it from a different perspective than how a high school Lit class might look at it.",

                "This course was great! It was well run, with a combination of discussion classes, workshops and visiting speakers. It was always engaging and I felt like I learned a lot about creative writing. One weakness was that we didn't receive grades until a few weeks into the semester. It's also unclear how the final grade is determined, but it's good that the class is not centered around grades and is more focused on helping the students get a lot out of it, which we did.",
                "I thought the course was very well organized. I liked being exposed to three different types of creative writing and felt as if I was always learning something.",
                "I wouldn't change anything about this course! One of its greatest strengths was the guests who came to visit and share their process and works with both our individual section and all of the sections of ENGL 123 together. Another big strength was the three workshops and the willingness of our professor to meet with us individually outside of class.",
                "This course has a whole host of strengths! Dr. Green is incredibly supportive, fun, and a great teacher. He really knows how to coax out the writer in each student, and what worked for me is his more \"formulaic\" way to describe creative writing. He's able to split the daunting task of writing a story or a drama piece into smaller, easier-to-swallow subsections with clear tasks. The course is also taught in a small seminar format, which is refreshing from large p-set lectures and allows for more student interaction and table reads, even in a remote setting. There were several great visitors to the course in each of the units (I, for one, am finishing up a book by one of the authors, Caryl Phillips). Everyone in this course is so passionate about creative writing that it's infectious. I personally thought the course was really well-run with very few, if any, weaknesses. Sometimes, assignments would be posted on Canvas late or we'd stray off the syllabus, but I don't mind that very much, and we did get feedback fast. The feedback itself was extremely supportive, and I greatly appreciated it, but I never got around to getting the real \"critical\" feedback by the end of the semester, for better or for worse. Dr. Green liked to have one-on-one meetings with students to discuss their writing but I may have missed out on a few -- one way this could be improved is some form of sign-up, rather than emailing, which could get lost in inboxes.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-->You learn how to write fiction very well\r\n       -->Particularly story structure and characterization, which is the foundation of story in any genre and medium\r\n-->You learn how to read for craft (i.e to learn\/steal good techniques from other writers)\r\n-->You gain an appreciation for a variety of mediums and genres\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-->It focuses more on story writing than poetry, even though we have one unit for poetry (this honestly wasn't a con for me, but might be for any aspiring poets out there)"

                "Assignments were submitted through Canvas, which went quite smoothly. Classes were on Zoom, and though Dr. Green often mentioned he didn't like Zoom classes (\"the Zoom silence,\" \"workshop went well, despite being on Zoom,\" etc.) I personally found it to be effective enough. Since the class size was small, it was easy to participate in kind of an \"in-person\" way -- just raise your physical hand for the camera. This meant that there was no need for the Zoom chat, which I admit can get distracting in other classes. Reading pieces and doing workshops seemed to work quite well to me too, even some of the acting! I liked how Dr. Green experimented with breakout rooms sometimes; in the poetry unit, we were sent to individual breakout rooms to do sound exercises on our own. All of this to say, I think most of the virtual learning practices worked. I mentioned this above, but one thing I found didn't quite work as smoothly as I wished it did was scheduling one-on-one meetings. Maybe this could be done with a google form or calendly link to streamline the process? That could make it easier for all students to remain engaged with the professor.",

                "Yes! This class struck a perfect balance between instruction and practice, and it may be my favorite class I've taken so far at Yale and the one from which I feel like I've gained the most practical skills as a writer.",
                "Yes, especially with Professor Green! It is clear he has a passion for both storytelling and teaching. The course is structured to be unintimidating and build up basic skills in creative writing through homework and workshops, so by the end of the semester, you are much further than you ever thought you would be.",
                "1000%!!! This course was my favorite class this semester, and I'm a STEM major! I think this is not only an excellent humanities credit, but also an amazing way for anyone who is even remotely interested in creative writing to really dip their toes into the world of creative writing. I was really nervous to take this class since I had no experience at all in any form of creative writing, but if you're at all interested, then go for it. Lots of support and hype from the professors, chances to hear from famous writers\/poets\/dramatists, and by the end, you have an entire portfolio of creative writing (short story, poetry, drama)! Dr. Green makes the process easy to understand and breaks it down to make it less daunting. You don't realize how much you're doing and learning because it's chill, the assignments are spread-out, and the readings and writing are fun.",
                "This course provides a great opportunity to sample writing creatively in multiple different genres and demystifying the greater process of writing. I would definitely recommend this course, the readings were interesting, the discussions with writers were very worthwhile and the workshopping dynamic and process was rewarding.",
                "Certainly!  If you want to learn how to write fiction or understand stories better, then this class is for you.  If you are an aspiring poet, this class might not be so great if you want something poetry focused.  Either way though, learning the basics of story telling is really helpful for any medium, even academic writing to an extent.",
                "Yes I would recommend that everyone take this course because its an excellent sampling of different creative genres that are quite fun to explore and give a try"
