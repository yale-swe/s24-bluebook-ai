            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Recorded classes make it convenient to review and study, professor and TAs are super helpful\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "Strengths: Dr. Chang is a nicer and flexible professor. His textbook is excellent and truly a lifesaver. The office hours are extremely helpful (to the point of being practically necessary to attend, if you hope to finish + not fail the problem sets). \r\n\r\nLimitations: the problem sets are really difficult. Towards the end of the semester, they reached the point that I felt that they were difficult enough that I could only barely get them done, and I wasn't really internalizing much anything that was happening. The TAs change the office hour schedule constantly which is fine but makes it hard to plan my week out. The way coding is assessed is quite strange, being extensively required in problem sets but not in exams or projects. I feel that the way coding is taught in this class would be confusing if I hadn't already known how to code in R. \r\n\r\nThis class desperately needs a lab. All the other stats classes I've taken were so much more collaborative and hands-on, and this class was so much harder to digest than them.",
                "Strength - Prof. Chang is an engaging and funny lecturer, and his office hours are very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeakness - Most of the ULAs just show you the answer key and dont work through the problems.",
                "The course covers a lot of ground, and if you can keep up, you will be able to do some pretty cool (and actually widely applicable) things by the end. My main problem with it was that it did not devote enough time to some of the fundamental concepts (like likelihoods, priors, posteriors) so I, and many others, found it increasingly hard to comprehend the classes because we just didnt have a total understanding of the basic terms that were used constantly in the later lectures. I think students will understand things much better if the course spends a bit more time solidifying those basics before moving ahead",
                "Strengths: the teacher (he really seems to enjoy his job and the subject, which is always great), the problem sets since you first do the problem in a math-y sort of way and then run a simulation to see if you did it correctly. \r\nWeaknesses: The exams are very much under time pressure, so be prepared.",
                "Strengths are the course textbook written by Professor Chang and Professor Chang's patience/willingness to answer students' questions and give feedback. I think better organizing some of the content could help with learning it. For example, beta and gamma distributions were mentioned and applied to concepts before the Conjugate Priors lecture, but due to the time/content gap in between, I had trouble connecting them later on to conjugate priors and overall it just made some concepts unnecessarily confusing. In addition, only having the weekdays (since the weekly problem set was typically posted Sunday afternoon) to work on the problem set was quite stressful, as I work part-time in a research lab during the weekdays and so rely on my weekends to catch up on or get a headstart on my academic work. Having greater flexibility by posting the problem sets on Friday or even Saturday would have helped relieve this pressure.",
                "super well set-up course that covers a lot of ground. Joe is a lovely instructor and I found his office hours especially helpful.",
                "Strengths:\r\n1) Joe Chang!\r\n2) Fun problem sets\r\n3) Learning probability and Bayesian statistics in 1 class\r\n4) Great pacing\r\n5) Only 1 midterm + great curve\r\n6) Recorded lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThere was really only one weakness: OFFICE HOURS. The ULA/TF office hours sort of undermined the entire course. ULA's and TF's rather than answering questions, just rewrote or displayed the answer key on the board. As a result, most of the students in the course did not actually understand what was going on for much of the semester because office hours didn't reinforce course material -- it just gave answers away. This harmed engagement severely (many stopped showing up to lecture because they knew they could just get the answers from the ULA's)! This problem needs to be addressed if the course is to be taught again and the ULA's need to actually help students learn these tricky concepts -- otherwise, what's the point!",
                "strengths: truly one of the best courses i have taken during my time at Yale. it is challenging and it is a lot of work but it is totally worth it (genuinely one of the most rewarding courses i have taken). you learn a ton, and Prof Chang really connects the pieces as the course goes along.",
                "Engaging material",
                "The lectures are thorough, and Dr. Chang explains concepts clearly.",
                "I only started attending office hours halfway through the term and I only wished that I did it sooner. The hours and location can be a bit inconvenient but I really appreciated all the Zoom options. Alex Hawley was a great TF who tried to explain concepts from their own perspective too which I thought was really helpful. I think the only weakness is that a few TFs just give away the answers during office hours instead of explaining concepts.",
                "Strength: enjoyed the humour and the atmosphere during the classes. Well-connected, structured material\r\n\r\nWeakness: it would be more convenient to have the folders on Canvas with the lecture slides and code. For example, a lectures folder with all the pdf files for each lecture",
                "Strengths: The class covers a lot of material, but things build on each other naturally. I enjoyed the different approaches introduced by Bayesian statistics and simulation. The professor keeps very comprehensive records of materials used in class (slides, code) as well as detailed solutions, which made reviewing for exams more straightforward. Weaknesses: Even though the psets are 5 questions, they do tend to run long, so the time commitment for this class is high. In addition, some concepts are not thoroughly covered in class (or even at all) before being introduced in the pset, so attending multiple office hours becomes a necessity.",
                "Strengths: Professor Joseph Chang, accessible course materials, organized, interesting lectures\r\nWeaknesses: office hours were limited and had inconvenient timing for a lot of students",
                "I thought this was a great course- I learned a lot about the subject and really enjoyed the professor! It could definitely be challenging material at times so I would suggest more hands-on experience, like having us do a coding day on laptops during class or doing more of those quiz questions. The homeworks were also really really long.",
                "Strengths: the problem sets were really useful for reinforcing learning of the material. I felt like I always came away with more mastery of the material upon completion of the problem sets. The teaching staff was also quite robust - I found that there were always office hours I could go to, which was very useful. The exams (I felt) were fair, though the midterm was quite the time crunch. Prof. Chang also gave us so much supplementary learning material, and he organized the course really well - lecture slides, R Markdowns, and brief lecture synopses were always posted in a timely manner. Weaknesses: the weekly problem sets oftentimes felt like a lot, and I found myself falling behind at times during the semester.",
                "The course instructor is lovely, the psets and exams are fun and well-written, and the material is enlightening. My only qualm about the course is that the organization sometimes made learning difficult; it felt as though we were just given \"intuition\" for most concepts and had to do problems based on that limited mathematical foundation for quite a while before we received a more rigorous explanation. I felt that Prof. Chang's explanations were overall clear (and his humor in lectures is delightful), but sometimes skipped steps or didn't say things in a way that made the concepts immediately understandable to someone like me who didn't have any probability or statistics background.",
                "I think this course differs from 541/542 because each new concept / theorem / conclusion is inspired by a particular problem or scenario, which is helpful for me to grasp the intuition behind the mathematical objects. \r\n\r\nProfessor Chang's homework problems are not challenging once I get the idea, and are very interesting, even including the problems on the final.",
                "Really great lecturer, but the homeworks are quite a bit more difficult than what is taught in lecture. I guess it helps with critical thinking, but you really should utilize office hours. I already had a background in statistics, and I found that some parts of the course were difficult (markov chains on the homework, to give one example).",
                "Weaknesses: lectures not the most efficient/engaging, super fast pacing, difficult psets compared to level discussed in lectures\r\nStrengths: organized course materials on Canvas, organized textbook which was helpful",
                "I think Dr. Chang is doing an excellent job explaining the concept of the class material",
                "I think this course covers many important topics and has challenging psets, but sometimes goes too fast because of the amount of content.",
                "This course was exceptionally well organized, well-supported, and the content was usually clear and straightforward to follow (as long as you put in consistent effort).",
                "The Homework is too frequent, which makes the workload a bit heavy.",
                "Great intro to concepts, questions in homeworks/tests were so hard it was not like practicing material",
                "Although this course serves as an incredible introduction to statistics, please note that it is NOT designed as a square one course. If there is minimal prior knowledge, this course will be extremely difficult. Prof. Chang does a great job of explaining concepts in class - his examples are very intuitive and he does a phenomenol job making the content comprehendible. However, the psets themselves have perhaps 2 parts of one question that are doable using only what you learn from class; the rest of the pset is very difficult if it is your first time seeing the problems. Although there are office hours offered most dats of the week, they were often flooded with students and the TAs were not enthusiastic to help. Additionally, Prof. Chang would post the psets late Saturday or even Sunday morning with the pset due Friday - if the psets continue at the same level of difficulty, they should be posted AT LEAST one whole week (Friday before the Friday due date) before the designated due date. Another big weakness is that you will not receive feedback from your homework for at least 4 weeks - 3/10 of the psets were left ungraded before our final exam. Overall, I thought the content and theory presented in this course will be very useful to know, but the psets and overall disorganization of this course makes it difficult to recommend to other students.",
                "Course is well structured and lectures are prepared. Assignments require a bit effort but applied to learning materials very well. Exams are at a fair difficulty level. Professor is humorous and caring. Course materials are very useful.",
                "Strengths: This course was very well organized and there was abundant help available from the TAs. The course slides and all additional notes are easily accessible so it is never a hassle to track down what was said or explained in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: One point of improvement could be the reintroduction of the take home R coding exam or a proper redistribution of the grade weights by increasing the weight of the homeworks rather than simple making the final exam worth 40%. I believe that a significant portion of the class takes this course to learn the R coding language and therefore it seems wasteful to only test them on hand calculations with a few pseudo code questions thrown in during exams. The problem sets are a lot of work week after week as they do not reflect the same difficulty of example problems covered in class. Logistically, a major weakness is the outdated late policy -- you should have a full 24 hours to submit before receiving a 10% late penalty and another full 24 hours before the 20% penalty. The current policy just encourage students to use the hw pass early and never submit a Pset if they missed the saturday deadline.",
                "Strengths: \r\n-Prof. Chang is extremely knowledgeable and really cares about making the course materials (textbook--which he wrote himself!, psets, practice exams, etc) high-quality. \r\n-He's very likable and still gives off a very humble demeanor even after teaching this class for over two decades.\r\n-His exams are very fair and similar to the practice ones he gives (make no mistake though, they are still very difficult).\r\n-This class really packs a punch and gives you your money's worth in terms of content and skills. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-The prerequisites being Math 120 or the calculus knowledge equivalent to that class is NECESSARY. Be prepared to struggle and take extra time to review calculus (multivariable calculus) because it will come back to haunt you as the course progresses. \r\n-I think the line \"This class requires no stats knowledge\" is incredibly misleading and should be taken out in the future or have a caveat to it. The majority of people came in with AP Stats or Stats knowledge from college and/or high school, and the class disproportionately had a lot more graduate students than I was expected. Prof. Chang goes through extremely dense material at a pace that is difficult to catch up if you fall behind, especially if you have a weak math foundation. \r\n-I think Prof. Chang also could have made his office hours more often and in-person. He offered his office hours once on Wednesday nights on Zoom, which would be fine if the other TAs were more knowledgeable on explaining the course material conceptually rather than going over the problems with the solutions (which is great for a few weeks, but then just is not productive to understanding the class).",
                "N/a",
                "Office hours were incredible the TAs are very very helpful. Lectures could have been more clear they were sometimes convoluted",
                "I think this course is very intuitive, but I think the amount of content covered is quite intense. Possibly slowing down with less content would allow students to master the content",

                "Strengths: Prof. Chang is a passionate, caring professor and lecturer who is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter. He always answers questions in or after class, both in person and on Ed Discussions in an excellently timely, clear, and thorough manner. The TAs were also very kind and caring. The problem sets are challenging and fun (if started sufficiently in advance, otherwise they are miserable :-). Each topic that we cover is explored with a sufficient level of detail to solve interesting problems. The class also helps with other stats/ML classes which are usually less theoretical.\r\nWeaknesses: A significant portion of the course is based on a clear understanding of the two first weeks worth of material. If some of those basic ideas are not clear from the very start, compensating later will take a toll. Perhaps in the future it would be useful to spend a little bit more time on those questions. Sections were not always helpful: some TAs/ULAs just ran through the answers for the problem sets without explaining the reasoning behind the math, while others tried to explain with varying degrees of success. In general, there was a lack of conceptual discussion in section. It also sometimes took quite a while to get grades back on problem sets, which did not help with getting better.",
                "More applications, faster paced, connections to ml",
                "I really like the course. I think the professor went to great extent to make sure we understood everything.",
                "strength: Prof. Chang is extremely devoted to the course and always makes time to answer questions; the course is organized! \r\nWeakness: I found the exams to be a bit challenging, especially when compared to the work we did in class, but they were not impossible",
                "The strengths were the availability of office hours and amount of engagement needed to keep up with the course. The class was thorough and offered a solid introduction to Bayesian probability and statistics. The weaknesses were the class moving way too fast and most students being discouraged by not understanding. Many just stopped going to class and started watching the recordings. We did not get our pset grades back after the first few, which was frustrating for monitoring our progress.",
                "i thought the course content was great, and lectures were enjoyable. the biggest issue was the pace of the course. i thought it was fast but not impossible, the problem was that the second you fall behind it then does become impossible to catch up. i don't think the pace should be changed, there just needs to be more support for students who maybe fall behind a week or so. office hours were simply too packed with students coming in and out only for answers and there were no review sessions at all.",
                "The course covers a lot of material, which makes it a great overview of the topics, but also quite heavy in terms of workload. The professor is great and really cares about the students.",
                "The lectures are great. It would be even better if the slides for each class could be posted right before that class. The weakness is that it always took a long time to get the grades and feedback on the assignments.",
                "Office hours were a lifesaver for the psets, which were on the challenging side. Content was very interesting and well organized, but the exams (being at pset level difficulty) were too difficult for a timed setting."

                "I would definitely recommend this course because Bayesian statistics and inference is very relevant nowadays with the growth of the field of generative AI.",
                "Sure! It's a good introduction to the S&DS major, if that's what you're looking for.",
                "Well, it depends. This class and I have a complicated relationship. It is a huge time drain compared to my other classes, and the course takes a long, long time to feel useful. You also truly need to go to office hours to be successful in this course. Attend from the very problem set week on and you will thank yourself... \r\n\r\nBayesian inference is such a valueble perspective to be able to wield for people interested in stats, and I think this course will provide you with a great perspective for this. The exams are graded very forgivingly, so if you're really worried about your grades, just attend office hours for the problem sets and study the practice problems and you'll be ok (I promise!). \r\n\r\nUltimately, I don't think non-future statisticians should take this as a first stats class, but everyone who wants to use statistical inference as a tool (say, a researcher) should take it eventually, as the Bayesian perspective is so so valuable. The problem is that important things like regression and testing for differences between categories (tools a researcher will need) are taught with a weird amount of emphasis. Of course, you learn how to do them, but I don't think they were given the full theoretical/practical treatment my other stats classes used.",
                "Absolutely that i would recommend it to other students and i really enjoy it.",
                "Yes if youre doing the data science certificate. Ive taken up to Calc 2 but would recommend Calc 3 optimally. Some proof experience (which I didnt have) would also help.",
                "Yes, to those who want a good introduction on probability and statistics",
                "Yes, but be prepared to work! Its not that the problem sets are super long, and the TAs were great, but if you dont really learn the basic concepts well in the first 1/3rd, youll find yourself very lost later! Prof. Chang is wonderful and really wants you to succeed, but the problem is he assumes you are succeeding! Go to office hours early and often and ask dumb questions to make sure you know what youre doing!",
                "Yes, I feel like I learned a lot about statistics through this course in just one semester!",
                "As a biology major with (only) an AP statistics background, I would not recommend this course to others who are simply looking for a foundational probability class. This class was by far my most challenging and time-consuming, as the weekly problem sets were hefty and took me 9-12 hours on average to complete (including attending office hours after attempting the problem set first).",
                "yes! worth the challenge it made me a clearer thinker and i loved the mix of pencil-and-paper and coding",
                "Yes, if you want to learn Bayesian statistics and are genuinely interested in the mathematics of probability theory and the theory behind sampling from distributions. \r\n \r\nNo, if you have arbitrarily decided you want to get a data science certificate or feel like you \"should\" know statistics for your lab.",
                "absolutely yes. everyone should take this course if you're somewhat interested in math, statistics, probability, science, etc. It is surely one of the most rewarding classes i have decided to take during my time at yale. you learn a lot. it's a lot of work and there's a lot of material covered, but you really walk out of the course feeling like you learned a lot.",
                "Yes, it's a good alternative to 241 and actually includes statistics, not just math",
                "Yes. If students want to build a solid foundation of solving statistical problems using R, they should take this course.",
                "Yes! I often find myself sharing what I've learnt in this course to my friends in solving problems from other courses in disease modelling and phylogenetic analysis.",
                "Yes! It's a perfect course for a student who wants to learn applied statistics. Also if students have a frequentist background, learning Bayesian Statistics in this course is perfect for widening their statistical background",
                "You should take this if you already have some background in statistics and want to learn more from a slightly non-traditional perspective. I really appreciated the diverse approaches we used throughout the course, and look forward to applying it in the future, but it could definitely be overwhelming if you're just getting into statistics and/or only need it as a method to carry out a research in a different field.",
                "Yes. Great professor, problem sets actually helped me understand the material, midterm and final were very similar to problem sets (nothing on the exams that were meant to \"trick\" or \"surprise\" the students), and lots of practice with R!",
                "I would recommend it because I learned a lot and enjoyed the professor. However I would warn them that there was a lot of challenging homework",
                "Definitely - I really learned so, so much about probability theory and Bayesian statistics. I took this class for the certificate. I was originally going to take 240, but due to a schedule conflict, I ended up taking 238, which I was initially apprehensive about since I had heard that 238 was more challenging than 240. I am so happy that my schedule worked out in the way that it did, though. This class was perfect for me as I had substantial programming experience going in, and 238 tends to have a bit more emphasis on coding than the other probability theory courses. Prof. Chang makes the content accessible to everyone, and he is just wonderful. You can tell that he really cares about his students and loves the subject. He also wrote the problem sets in an entertaining manner; overall, he made the course and its contents very engaging. While the weekly problem sets can be a lot and the pace of the class tends to be quite quick, it was an enjoyable experience, and I would recommend anyone to take this class.",
                "Yes! I took this with absolutely no programming or statistics background, and no proof-based math (only calc until math 120) and found this course extremely approachable and lots of fun. I definitely found the first half of the course more difficult (probability theory; a totally different way of thinking and doing problems than I had ever seen before), but the second half was a lot slower and also more focused on applications (and less mathematically difficult). Overall, it was a well-balanced class, and I even had fun taking the final examthis made me want to take more statistics in the future!",
                "Yes. This course is not just talking about theory, but comes with intuition and a statistician's insight.",
                "Yes, your statistics will improve a lot and you will be able to add some nice skills to your statistical toolkit. Loved the way he taught lectures as well. He makes very difficult concepts manageable.",
                "If required, and if one has already has some background in math, prob/stats, and/or R. the more the better since this course covers all of those and can be a lot to take in",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend this course to any student looking to apply Bayesian statistics and simulations to data, but would warn about the workload/difficulty.",
                "Yes, if you want a good intro to bayesian statistics (and data analysis in R).",
                "Yes, it is a cool introduction to the S&DS major and not too difficult",
                "Yes. Bayesian statistics is very important for more advanced topics.",
                "Yes for pure math majors, otherwise it was not applicable enough",
                "Although this course serves as an introduction to statistics, please note that it is NOT designed as a square one course. The psets are very very difficult if you have minimal prior knowledge of probability, modeling, and Bayesian statistics. This course was advertised as an introductory course, and although Prof. Chang did say that the course was difficult, years past have shown it was doable. However, this year, the syllabus was changed 4 or 5 weeks into the course, changing the final exam from around 30% to 55% of your grade - this is unacceptable to do already 5 weeks into the class. With this change, there was no supplementary support for the final exam- there were no review sessions held by Prof. Chang or the TFs, and there are no solutions for any of the additional practice problems in the textbook. \r\nYou will learn a lot in this course and from the psets, but be prepared to spend 10-15 hours per pset (on a good week). There are many office hours throughout the week, but they were often flooded with students and the TAs were rarely enthusiastic to help. Additionally, do not expect feedback from the homework until weeks later- 3/10 of the psets were not even graded until December 29th, 2 weeks after the final exam. Your greatest help will be your peers in the class. \r\nThis class does have incredible potential, and I sincerely hope that Fall 2023 was an exception. Only take this course if necessary for your major or for the certificate if you see the grade breakdown is the same as Fall 2023 (e.g. 55% from final exam) - it is not worth taking the course as an additional class as it is incredibly stressful with minimal support from the teaching team. This course needs extensive reorganization from the teaching team before it becomes accessible to those that are not cs, math, or s&ds majors.",
                "Definitely will.",
                "This course is a great introduction to probability and statistics if you have never taken a class in the field before. You will feel really comfortable with R and basic computer modeling by the end of this course. However, understand that you will have to attend ULA hours to get through the psets. It is also helpful to read the textbook alongside the homeworks as it is very well written and easy to parse, offering another way of explaining the content if you have trouble with verbal explanations.",
                "I would not recommend this class if you have a weak math foundation or do not have the time/bandwidth to improving it in conjunction with spending quite a bit of time. It's so difficult and worth a lot of your time. I did not know this going in and definitely paid the price in mental health and time.",
                "N/a",
                "I would if the student is truly interested in stats and is looking for a real intellectual challenge. This course is not worth taking unless you are willing to put the time in to really allow the material to internalize.",
                "If you do not need this course for your major, do NOT take this course. The pacing and academic level of the material is way more demanding than any other math/statistics class. Additionally, the material brought up in lecture is based almost entirely on theory, while psets are heavy on the application. This gives students no basis to start their homework, and office hours are either vaguely helpful or a complete answer grab. Additionally, professor and teaching staff were extremely slow at giving feedback for weekly psets and exams. For example, our midterm scores were released less than 24 hours before the deadline to withdraw from a course, and three out of ten psets were not graded until days before course grades were due.",
                "Recommend only if you need to take it. Im doing the certificate and a part of me wishes I took S&DS 230",
                "If you want a more theoretical understanding of probability theory and statics, and if you want to discover Bayesian inference, go right ahead! This is an interesting, thorough, and challenging course taught by a passionate expert. If you have never studied Bayesian inference, this course will truly deepen your knowledge of probabilistic and statistical methods. You will discover ideas with both intrinsic elegance, and applications in a wide range of cases (including machine learning, if that is your thing). Be prepared for a bunch of math, but nothing really beyond simple derivatives and integrals. Also be advised that the course has a consistently significant workload with a lot of material to understand as well, so start your problem sets early in the week!",
                "Yep, good intro to bayesian stats & prob, useful for stats and ml",
                "Yes. This is a great course for grad students to haven't done math/prob/stats class for a while and want to re-familiarize themselves with the language and concept and also in the meantime learn bayesian stats!",
                "Only if you have to take it for the major or the certificate. If you do not have a reason to take this, the things we learn are not very applicable outside of acamedic endeavours",
                "Yes, I learned a lot of valuable math and coding.",
                "yes, if you are an disciplined student looking for a challenge. if you are the type to fall behind and skip lectures like me, do not take this course--it will make your life hell.",
                "In general, I would recommend this course to motivated students. I would definitely do it again but beware that it is not easy and has a huge workload. There are 10 psets and each one of them takes a few hours to write and will probably require you to go to (at least one) OH. On the other hand, the exams will feel quite doable if you have worked on the psets. The course requires a lot of work but you will feel like you have learned a lot from it and the professor is amazing. He really cares about the students and their learning experience.",
                "Yes. This course is very interesting, and Prof Chang is very nice.",
                "This heavily depends on your math/stats/R background and how far you would like to go with stats. If you prefer a more theoretical/mathy course with little R, 241 is probably a better choice and prepares you better for 242. You don't necessarily need to have taken stats before taking this course but it's probably better if you have and you should have a good foundation in math. This course feels like a natural follow-up to 230 in my opinion. This course is also unique in that probability theory and inference are discussed from the Bayesian viewpoint. Markov chains were quite interesting and are widely applicable and are in a way meant to be the highlight of the course."
