There was one lecture about immunology, which I thought was pretty fascinating. One lecture about development, which I found to be less interesting. When I took MB&B 300, I honestly wondered what more there was to learn about biochemistry. I couldn't imagine what else there was to know, if the point of biochemistry was to learn fundamental principles that could be applied in many different contexts. Well, there is so much more to learn past MB&B 300. This class is focused on shapes of proteins, reactions those proteins do, and orientations of proteins during those reactions.",

                "strengths: detailed lecture slides, TA help sessions, practice exams",
                "Strengths: I would really ask the teaching team to seriously consider recording their lectures even next year. I cannot fathom how I would have understood anything in this class if I did not have the recorded lectures. I consider the recorded lectures to be a huge strength. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The sheer volume of material. There is so much stuff. One of the professors mentioned this, and I think it's true, so it's worth repeating here -- some members of the teaching team have been teaching this material for several decades (not an understatement). As a result, they know the material quite well! Unfortunately, this is my first time seeing the material. If the teaching team could try to put themselves in a first-time learner's shoes, I hope they might consider slowing down the presentation of the material.",
                "occasionally going to TA office hours is hard; a lot of people are competing to ask questions and most of the time TAs will not know the answer. a strength is that the instructors have made this course friendlier by eliminating the curve & encouraging cooperation, which has been a huge relief on my mental health. they are really here to help you & their OH are very helpful as well.",
                "Strengths: the amount of material covered is astounding. The most up-to-date science is presented, and, by the end of the course, we were able to deduce mechanisms provided experimental data. The lac of a curve made for a much more collaborative atmosphere in the course, and the professors genuinely seemed to care about our learning and impressions of them. The professors are very willing to answer questions during office hours. \r\nWeaknesses: the p-sets are often outdated-- not relevant to this year's material-- and take a significant amount of time but are only worth three points. They require attending peer tutor office hours as they cover content not previously studied.",
                "Wow. So much information. I cant imagine doing this course without being able to rewatch the lectures. I like that they listen to students. It would have been great if the problem sets included some simpler problems that were just content based instead of all test-like questions.",
                "Strengths: the Professors and TAs were excellent, and the content of the course is super interesting. The course definitely pushes you, but you learn a lot! I also really appreciated that, although the expectations were very high in the course, there was a lot of support available. Office hours were frequent, the Professors and TAs constantly offered individual meetings, etc. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures went pretty overtime quite frequently, which was frustrating because the class already has SO much content.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the instructors, all of whom are excellent, engaging, and highly enthusiastic. They are all highly accomplished and know the material like the back of their hand. The slides are highly engaging and the class quizzes are a very smart and useful idea to improve engagement. A weakness of this course is that there are no answer keys for the problem sets, so it's somewhat difficult to understand the level of detail expected in a good response. A strength \/ weakness, depending how you look at it, are the highly comprehensive and difficult exams.",
                "Strenghts - The professors are extremely knowledgeable and can answer any questions on Ed or during office hours. Having the class graded not on a curve is very conducive to effective learning, which I and many others appreciated.\r\nWeaknesses - I felt that the course was slightly less organized than 300. The Problem Sets were oftentimes not written that well\/poor wording. Lastly, while I am thankful for the TAs, I felt that the TAs for 301 were not extremely knowledgeable about the topics discussed in 301.",
                "I really enjoyed the professors - they were all very knowledgable and they explained concepts very well. Also, the organization and the structure of the course was amazing.",
                "Strengths: really helpful as an MB&B majorI feel like I really learned a lot about biochemistry and about genetics. Weaknesses: Can be kind of hard to swallow all the information given at times, especially with all the names of various factors, etc, that we have to memorize!",
                "Strengths: This course covers a lot of material. Weaknesses: This course covers far too much material. For the first half of the term, all three instructors rushed through all of their lectures, making it impossible to absorb all of the information in real time. After mid-semester feedback was submitted and asked the instructors to slow down, Christian slowed down, and his lectures became much more helpful. But Joan and Franziska kept rushing. Joan once showed a slide on protein ubiquitination for a grand total of 10 seconds, skipped to the next one, and still wrote a test question on it. Moreover, even though the name of the course is biochemistry, this course was just molecular biology, with almost no actual chemistry featured at all. It was just memorization and no skill. The course could be improved if the instructors cut out a lot of content.",
                "It requires a ton of memorization with little help from professors or tas. You learn a great deal of information that is interesting and relevant to research today.",
                "I thought that this course was great. \r\nStrengths: the teaching staff were all incredibly knowledgeable and engaging, as well as being accommodating about COVID-related things, such as granting extensions on p-sets and quizzes. \r\nWeaknesses: I think it would have been useful to put the biology of eukaryotes and prokaryotes closer together. We learned about transcription, translation, etc. in prokaryotes, then took a few lecture break, then learned about it in eukaryotes. I think it would have been less confusing if the transcription lectures were right next to each other, as both processes would have stayed fresher and it would have been easier to compare.",
                "Strengths: So many!! Professor Schlieker and Steitz were sooooo amazing, and even though Professor Bleichert only taught a few lectures, they were also really good, especially considering this was her first time teaching the course. They were not only great lecturers (which of course is very important for such dense material), but also were very accommodating\/understanding (+ open to feedback!) and clearly cared about the wellbeing of the class, which certainly is not the case in a lot of STEM classes. Additionally, I thought the course was extremely well organized, which I always really appreciate. I also want to shout out the TAs for being so incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and responsive. \r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, there was so much material covered that even though the psets weren't very time consuming, studying for the midterms and the final were an extreme time drain. I don't think there's anything that can really be done about that though. Similarly, it was difficult to sit through the whole lecture without a break because of how dense they were, so maybe a one minute break in the middle would be beneficial.",
                "The quizzes each class were helpful in keeping us engaged and current on the material. The weakness was the online format.",
                "The course has a lot of very interesting content and there is a lot of support. The course has a lot of content, the office hour sessions are very helpful to keep track of everything.",
                "Wow I was extremely surprised with MB&B 301. I found Dr. Schlieker, Dr. Bleichert, and Dr. Steitz to all be so helpful and accommodating during the semester by always offering help and being willing to push back deadlines for assignments. The TAs were amazing! They all were so on top of what was happening during class and were always able to answer questions. I thought that the instruction team were a huge positive aspect of the course. My biggest gripe is with the extent of detail which we are expected to remember. Many of the problem set and exam questions centered on minute details from lecture.",
                "The practice exams and answer keys released were really helpful, so it would be great if more were released prior to an exam.",
                "Strengths: the professors, peer tutor help sessions, learning about experimental techniques, covering a wide variety of material, grading was not on a curve, the class felt very collaborative (especially when making study groups)\r\nweaknesses: sometimes the lectures were a bit disorganized which made them difficult to follow; many experimental techniques or famous studies were presented very quickly which made it hard to follow the conclusions of the studies; many questions on the exams seemed to test small memorization facts from the slides rather than more important concepts that we had spent longer discussing",
                "Strengths: material is interesting (albeit very hard), I liked the focus on learning rationale and developing intuition rather than memorization, the range of topics covered was really broad and engaging, the peer tutors were a great help\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the psets were often 5-7 pages long if not longer but would only count for 3 points regardless, sometimes there was too much content in each lecture and we would consistently go over the allotted class time by 10 minutes even though the professors were already choosing to breeze over some slides, the final exam was extremely hard for no reason",
                "Strengths: The instructors, TAs, and peer tutors are all so knowledgeable and very willing to meet with students. Ed was also a very useful forum for discussing problems.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures were a bit disorganized.",
                "Strengths: The professors are definitely a strength. Staying after lecture to ask questions was super helpful and their office hours were as well. The peer tutors are also great and really help with the problem sets. The problem sets are really useful to understand the material better. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: To be very honest, I thought the TA's could have been more helpful. Most of the questions I asked them during the discussion sections they just had no idea about (not kidding, my other friends in the class comment this as well) so I ended up not going to the sections, except for Katelyn who was an amazing TA. It's really frustrating that not even the TA's know what is going on and that I had to scramble to make it to the professor OH just to get my lecture questions answered. Also, the peer tutor office hours are only 2 hours a week total. I know that MB&B 301 has fewer students than MB&B 300 for example but it is also significantly harder. Because each tutor only had 1 hr this also meant that the whole hour went to talking about the psets, thus there was no time to talk about lecture questions (especially because the TA discussion sections on Tues\/Wed were totally useless, hence why only 2 or 3 people went per week to those compared to 8ish for the Thurs section). I also would have liked there to be answer keys to the psets and quizzes.",
                "This course was very well taught. It could benefit from more class time devoted to answering student questions",
                "At times I felt very lost.",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:",
                "This course is entirely too difficult for no reason, to the point where I couldn't focus on learning. I felt like I was grinding just to stay afloat. I don't think this course is very accessible to those with different learning styles.",
                "Though there is a broad and detailed content, the presentation of information is dense and esoteric. The lectures don't have a very clear goal or context-- just slides full of facts to memorize.",
                "The strengths of the course are that the instructors provide articles to supplement the text and shed light on the process of discovery, and limitations that occur during that process."

                "All the help sessions that were available through zoom were very helpful. It would have been nice to have sessions more spread out rather than Tuesday-Thursday back-to-back. For those who wanted to work on the pset or review lectures over the weekend, it made it difficult to find help outside of the weekday times. Also, many of the TA sessions became time to talk about the psets when it would have been more helpful to review lecture material as well. \r\nIt would have been more helpful for TA exam reviews to be open Q&A rather than going slide by slide for every lecture.",
                "The breakout rooms for in-class quizzes were a good way to keep students engaged, as were the questions scattered in during the lecture. Having the lectures be recorded also helped so much because I constantly found myself having to rewatch each lecture since we went through so much material in class.",
                "Recording the lectures and help sessions was extremely helpful.",
                "Having the lectures recorded so I could watch them again later was great.",
                "Success: The recordings of the live lectures were very helpful for review. All three professors frequently paused during lectures to see if there are questions, and the head TA always moderated the Zoom chat effectively to get any questions addressed, and the instructors also often stayed behind for 15-20 mins after class ended to address questions. The in-person engagement helped clear up concepts, but the Ed Discussion boards were also very helpful in asking questions.\r\n\r\nImprovement: The first week of TA office hour covered content that was not elaborated on in class (not really tested later) but I feel like that was not made clear and that in general the TA sections could be more content based (one TA talks through the slides and then asks for questions, another only answers questions that students bring) and that they could be recorded just in case.",
                "Having the recorded lecture was GOD-TIER. That should remain even after covid-times. However, the zoom format for exams wasn't cute. I don't necessarily know how to fix that though.",
                "The instructors gave students a lot of space to ask questions and that was helpful. The TA's were also very available and provided good feedback on homework responses."

                "Yes! Great course for learning various biochemistry topics",
                "Please only take this if you are an MB&B major. It's not worth taking, otherwise.",
                "This is a brutal class, and is too demanding in my opinion. If STEM courses can be divided into quantitative (physics, math) and qualitative (organic chemistry, biology, etc.) this was by far the hardest \"qualitative\" STEM course I have taken at Yale. I imagine that most, if not all, of the students taking this class are MBB majors, so they don't need to be persuaded to take the course. If you must take it, you ABSOLUTELY should not take it with a heavy schedule. Overall, the number of hours I have spent memorizing E. coli protein subunits and the method, year, and name of various experiments has somewhat dampened my enthusiasm for biochemistry. If you want a taste of this course, go try to make it through a page of Voet & Voet's Biochemistry and you will know what you're in for.",
                "MBB 301 provides a thorough understanding of cellular systems and includes many applications that go beyond textbook understandings, including a particularly interesting lecture on the specific viruses and genes involved in cancer. I was really satisfied with the content learned in this class, and I feel that much of the abstraction used in the introductory biology sequence was elucidated. I would recommend taking this course as an elective for the chemistry major as well. The choice not to use a curve proved to be really beneficial in fostering collaboration.",
                "Please take it. You will learn more than you ever wanted to.",
                "This course is definitely difficult; the amount of content in each lecture is probably the highest of any course I've taken. It is definitely much, much more demanding than the fall semester. I did learn a lot though, and I would overall recommend it.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student with true passion for biochemistry and the willingness to put in a LOT of time studying. This is the hardest class that I have encountered at Yale, yet also one of the most satisfying.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend MB&B 301 to students who are interested in nucleic acid biology. MB&B 301 is a requirement for MB&B but can be taken as an elective for various majors. It is an excellent course with a ton of information and very gratifying to complete.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class. Although it is challenging, it is very worthwhile and interesting.",
                "Yes, but know that you are getting into quite a lot of work!! This class is much harder than the first semester (MBB 300)",
                "No. Do not take this course. The instructors rush through as much content as they possibly can in as little time as they possibly can, and then test you on it after only saying 5 words on the topic. The problem sets are unnecessarily difficult. The instructors claim that this course is designed to teach you to think like a scientist, but asking unnecessarily hard questions without once showing students the process of answering such a question, does not sound like teaching to me. Many test questions are simply unfair; they ask about a minute detail that was mentioned on a lecture slide that was rushed through and which the instructors never even spoke about. The instructors will often ask questions during lecture, but few if any students will have a response; the instructors fail to understand that, if no students can answer your questions, it is because they didn't understand anything the instructors said, because the instructors went through the content too quickly. This course felt like one of those stereotypical competitions where hypercompetitive high school nerds are presented a lot of information in a short time and then tested on it. This resulted in a hefty amount of stress and anxiety for students, poorly impacting their mental health. Given that the instructors rush through all of their content without actually teaching the students anything, and then ask impossibly difficult questions about the content that they never explained to us, which destroys students' mental health, it is impossible to come out of this course viewing the instructors as anything other than our enemies. The course can be improved if the instructors take notes on better teaching practices from Enrique De La Cruz, Matt Simon, Candie Paulsen, and Michael Koelle.",
                "Yes take this course but it will be very difficult.",
                "i highly recommend this course to MB&B majors and those who are not! It is challenging and you are asked to analyze a lot of primary experimental data rather than just being fed facts about how all the systems work, but it is worth it and so satisfying when you figure out a process from the data - it gives you a great understanding of how biology\/biochemistry got to where it is today, and the perspective of the instructors, particularly Dr. Steitz, is so incredibly cool.",
                "Yes, if you're up for it! This class is probably the most time consuming class I've taken at Yale, just because of the amount of studying needed for the two midterms and the final, but it was SUCH A GOOD CLASS and I feel like I got so so much out of it. If you enjoyed MB&B 300, this class is like that but on steroids. I've learned so much biochemistry, but I've also become very comfortable with interpreting data and thinking about biochemistry experimentally. The professors really care about making the class a good experience, the course is really well organized, so it has probably been the best STEM class I've taken so far as a junior Chemistry major. I remember reading a review last year that said each lecture has enough material for an entire midterm, and that's definitely true. The first 7 lectures or so weren't too bad, but after that, each lecture probably took at least 3 hours to review, which is a lot of studying to put into a midterm and final.  Overall, if you like biochemistry and are willing to put in the work, I HIGHLY recommend this class!!",
                "Yes, if you really want to learn biochemistry.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend it. While you won't remember every detail, I think it's important for students to be exposed to the fundamentals of nucleic acids and their processes in greater detail than you'll find in most other undergraduate courses. The class is also great for getting experience in analyzing biochemical data and applying basic facts to novel situations. Professor Steitz was wonderful, of course, but Schlieker and Bleichert were also very able instructors who I'm sure run the class well in the near-future. Lastly, the tests are difficult but the grading is generous, if you're worried about that.",
                "Only for those very passionate about chemistry\/biochemistry. The class is broad and covers a large range of topics very quickly, which can be overwhelming if one is not on top of their game.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students that are interested in understanding both the principles of biochemistry and how biochemistry can be approached using experimental techniques.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in biochemistry as well as learning the type of thinking necessary to interpret data. The class covered a lot of material, but in the end, it was rewarding to see how much we had learned throughout the semester.",
                "I would recommend this course only to students who need it as a requirement. As an MB&B major, I found this course rewarding despite the difficulty, and it really delved so much deeper than any previous biochemistry course I have taken. That being said, unless you're already familiar with the material, it takes an insane amount of work outside of class to understand the content, and the tests are pretty challenging.",
                "Yes! This was by far my favorite class this semester. You learn so much from some of the best instructors in the MBB department.",
                "It's required for most people. Otherwise I think there are classes with better resources for students, although the professors clearly do try hard and I appreciate that.",
                "I would if you are interested in Biochemistry or any cellular functions",
                "Most of the students are MB&B majors, though the class also counts as an Elective for the Chemistry major. For anyone considering the course as an elective, I would consider a few things 1) are you really interested in molecular biology as this is not really a biochemistry course (it's mostly about transcription and translation, with few other broader topics; but the focus is not on enzyme catalysis rate or mechanism, at least not nearly as much as in 300 or for example CHEM 421: Chemical Biology; as a Chem major it felt like a straight up biology course and memorization heavy, and most of the class including Profs. are often not looking at the materials or answering questions from the chemical basis); 2) who are the instructors (I would definitely say some Profs make this class a lot more \"worth it\"); 3) do you have other friends in the course or will work to build a strong study group (you need it!); 4) how busy is your schedule otherwise (this is a big time commitment even though I did feel like I learned a lot, I would especially look at your midterm and exam schedules); 5) what are the possible alternatives (there is CHEM 421\/522 for Chemical Biology, there are also other course in MB&B and MCDB that focuses on specific topics covered here, mostly that are smaller class sizes)",
                "I would recommend it for the sake of learning cool stuff about biochem. For getting a good grade? Skip.",
                "I would recommend this course. This class really looks at the experimental data and articles. During the course you learn more about how scientists of the past few decades have been propelled by key discoveries and emerging technologies."
