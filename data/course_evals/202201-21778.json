                "Josh is an incredible teacher. Class is fast-paced, efficient, and focused, and also incredibly fun and funny. I am astonished at how much I've learned in such a short time. As much as I appreciated the take home assessments, I wonder if there could also be some traditional in class assessments, or some more oral assessments (maybe group oral). The questions on the take home assessments included free compositions, which I appreciated, but perhaps a bit more rote memorization of vocabulary (although not too much) could help more with retention.",
                "The strongest part of this course is the instructor, Josh Price. He ensured that the class would gel by incorporating the students into the lessons (in example sentences, e.g.) and encouraging student creativity by assigning poetry and story writing. He also provided very timely feedback and brought in sources from the Yiddish-speaking community. The small class size allowed us to form a tight-knit group that would practice outside of class. The class is well-paced and interesting. It is much better in person than online. One improvement could be to assign less homework daily or to have a break day from homework once a week, though assignments seemed to be more balanced by the end of the semester."

                "absolutely",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Aside from opening up a whole new world of literature and art, the course drives creativity and causes you to think critically about structures of gender, class, race, and religion in a productive and meaningful way. The students can tailor the experience to their own interests because the assignments allow a lot of freedom while still teaching the relevant grammatical and linguistic concepts. And it is SO MUCH FUN!",
