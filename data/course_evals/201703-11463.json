    "I definitely improved my speaking abilities by taking this course. I thought it was well structured and I have become more confident with my grammar as well.",
    "In L3, we reviewed the grammar structures that we learned in L1 and L2 to ensure that we understood them well and learned more about modern Italian culture by discussing Italian short stories, films, and music videos.",
    "After L3, I could more intuitively remember grammar. My speaking and writing skills improved a lot, as well as my reading.",
    "I advanced to intermediate level in L3 and consolidated my L1 and L2 knowledge. I was also able to learn new grammar and vocabulary as well as how to have extended conversations about intellectual issues and social debates about current events.",
    "This class helped me continue to build on speaking skills most of all. However, I think all aspects of my language skills got a lot better."

   "comments": [
    "The weekly temas were a great way to review weekly grammar structures while working on our own compositional skills and exams were straightforward and effective. Most of all, I loved that our class structure integrated ~20 minutes of partner conversation to improve our speaking and listening comprehension skills.",
    "This course is very good at making students more comfortable and proficient with Italian. \r\n\r\nNew challenges and more original coursework could help keep students engaged and keep us really getting better at the language."

    "I would definitely recommend this class. I felt as though I learned a lot and enjoyed attending class, but I didn't feel as though it was a huge time commitment. It allowed me to be successful in my other classes because it wasn't very work heavy, but I think as a required course (required as in you have to take an L3 language) I think it was the right amount of time commitment. I also feel like I have gotten a lot better at Italian through this class because I practiced a lot of speaking and grammar.",
    "Absolutely! I really appreciated that L3 served to ensure that you really understood everything learned in L1 and L2.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! It is fun and rewarding and flexible.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is serious about advancing their italian to intermediate level.",
    "yes, take italian its a beautiful language and there are some incredible profs"
