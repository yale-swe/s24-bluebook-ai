She gave extremely clear feedback and frequently checked in with students to make sure our class experience was going well. I also loved the course material including the weekly case studies. I really liked how this class merged theory with practice, as readings each week allowed simultaneous study of theoretical perspectives and more realistic scenarios in which they applied. I also liked how each class was contextualized with an email prior to class discussing the readings and a few sides at the beginning of class. No weaknesses!"
