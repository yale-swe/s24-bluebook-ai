                "The class has straightforward exams and a very fun final paper. The assignments are not stressful. I enjoyed the structure of assignments, but also the emphasis on readings and discussion questions, which were always worthwhile.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is possible, but it might be nice not to have the final paper due the night before the final exam. I know that this felt like a lot to handle in a few consecutive days, so if scheduling a different time is possible, that would be great.",
                "Good readings and pacing. Lectures and class discussions complemented each other. Class prepared us well for exams and final paper. Managed to organize a big topic well, and cover many sides of it in just a few weeks.",
                "While the recorded lectures were an effective way to review the reading materials before the live discussion, they were so jam-packed full of important information that it was difficult to filter through when taking notes. As a result, I would often have to pause the lecture many times in order to take notes, which ended up taking a lot more time than was expected. Moving forward, I'd suggest that if the recorded lectures will continually be used, the discussion session should use powerpoints (or other visual aids) more to organize and summarize the lecture information as the class goes into deeper discussion.",
                "I thought that it did a good job of introducing the material and making it accessible to a wide range of students.",
                "Professor Hayes knows alot, alot, alot and is very good at communicating the things she knows. The syllabus is  really well organized and timed. I think I would have enjoyed more literary and symbolic analysis-- it was centered on the historical context and I think part of what attracted to me to take a class on the bible was the question of what about the text makes it still so appealing\/meaningful today, which I don't feel we really addressed."

                "100% TAKE! A disservice if you don't...",
                "Absolutely. This is one of the best classes that I have taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nIf you aren't religious, you might feel like you don't belong in this course. However, this class is more about the Bible as literature than it is about the Bible as religion, and it discusses the creation and evolution of the text in the context of history. It is a fascinating exploration of the texts that helped shape western culture, from our laws to our customs. \r\n\r\nYou should consider that the class is quite a lot of work when you factor in meeting times, prerecorded lectures, and readings. All the work is tremendously worthwhile, but it is a lot to handle at times.",
                "This is a GREAT class. You not only read and learn what the Bible actually says, but you develop a deep understanding of the complex historical factors that influenced the biblical authors. The Bible plays a really large role in American society and in every day lifesomething I appreciated more and more as I was able to actually identify more obscure biblical references in tv shows or in readings for other classes. Regardless of your personal religious beliefs, you'll benefit from knowing more about the Bible. That being said, it is a decent amount of work. You can't really skip a lot of the readings and the final paper and final exam is a tough combination at the end. I'm still incredibly glad I took the class, so if you're willing to do the work and the readings, I could not recommend it more. Professor Hayes is absolutely brilliant and a really wonderful instructor. Take any class that you can with her.",
                "YES! I'm a junior who takes a lot of classes about the Bible, and this is my favorite so far. No matter how little or how much you know about the Hebrew Bible, you'll still learn something from this class.  You'll learn history, a little bit of literary criticism, and interpretive methods for your own study of the Bible.",
                "I would recommend it to students interested in studying the bible.",
                "If you are really interested in reading the bible, this class is great, especially if your interest is historical or religious-studies based, and if you want to pursue the study of the bible\/ancient literatures beyond this. If you are more interested in understanding the bible's literary influence, or how it has been read in later contexts, I don't think this class is a must-take.",
                "Absolutely! I came into this class with absolutely no knowledge of religious studies, and I've gained such a valuable perspective on near-eastern history and the Abrahamic religions."
