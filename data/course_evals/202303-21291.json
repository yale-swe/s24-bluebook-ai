                "I learned more than I had ever planned about market theory, with an emphasis on 20th-century and contemporary thinkers.",
                "This course was an amazing and fresh path from traditional EP&E philosophy and ethics, it built off of material needed for the major, but very applicable to understanding the foundations and intricacies of economic markets, and how they should\/can function with government, and what our limits are for markets. It was insightful and elicited realizations of how we as humans interact with each other and how the market plays a role in society. Modernity of markets and over time was a great aspect of the course.",
                "This class did a great job at focusing markets in three different units. We read authors from all different time periods, including Smith, Locke, Hayek, Marx, Mauss, Rousseau, Gandhi, Polyani, Brennan, Jaworski, Satz, and Michael Sandel. I learned about the contexts in which these authors wrote, and their main ideas.",
                "I learned about the foundations of markets and how goods are exchanged",
                "I gained a knowledge of the arguments surrounding the role of markets within society and their relation to broader philosophical questions of social justice, equity, and virtue.",
                "Gained a sense of the ep&e canon",
                "I really did learn a lot of foundational knowledge on EPE. Critical thinking skills for analyzing ethical issues. This class really did integrate ethical thinking into discussions about economics.",
                "This class gave me the big picture for the majorhow ethics, politics, and economics actually combine. My classmates and I seemed to have approximately the same education going in, having collectively read some authors but not others. So, the opportunity to relearn Locke or Marx through the lens of political economy was super helpful, since I feel like you learn most upon second reading of the texts. And then the last unit of modern philosophers was probably collectively new to the whole class, but was good for thinking about the extent of markets. It leaned more philosophical, but was very enjoyable! I feel like I learned a lot."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: for a class taught for the first time, this class was remarkably well organized. The readings were varied and manageable, and the professor is great. It was also great to pick the topic of the penultimate class meeting and the structure of the final exam as a class. \r\nWeaknesses: Student engagement in class discussions was low (just like it is in every EP&E seminar), but that was really despite the professor's best efforts to the contrary. Otherwise, the main weakness of this course is its grading structure. It does not make sense to give three 6-page writing assignments over the course of the semester and then give the sum of the three the same weight in the course grade as the final exam, which was basically a lower-grade version of the same type of writing assignment. 18 pages of polished essays should not get the same weight as two short essays written over the course of two hours. It was also a little excessive to have the final writing assignment due on Wednesday of reading week and then have the final exam the following day. \r\nIn the future, I think this class could do away with the final exam altogether and just have the final writing assignment be a critical reflection about the course themes, using the exact questions that we had on the final. Also, the class should probably just be called \"Fundamentals of Market Theory\" to better reflect its content.",
                "Strength - Professor Kevin Elliot 100%. Engaging, funny, TAUGHT YOU, made the 9:25am two hours worth it, went for him. The content was neccesary, it when chronologically in order, the reading was not overbearing - it was specific and not broad. Elliot made sure that we would understand the material, essays were very interesting and tied to the three sections of the class - which made it helpful. Feedback was helpful. Weakness - there's only so much we can limit ourselves to learning in a semester, there are infinite things to discuss and unfortunately it was reasonable that we couldn't mention every thing that exists in the world to discuss, but Elliot did the best way to include as much as possible. I think the final should be more split between identifications and short response and then 1 longer response - the only reason it was not this is because us students voted with a majority saying 2 essays in person as the final - but either way was just as effective and doable, and so the students will have a reasonable input to what can work well for us to be evaluated. I think maybe just for fun, it could be interesting to add a low stakes first essay at the beginning of the class where the student makes an argument just from their own thoughts, and then the 3 class essays of the term, then maybe another low stakes essay of their own thoughts at the end to see their growth.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Elliott is incredibly knowledgable. He has a wealth of knowledge about the authors that we read and so we always got a great understanding of the texts we were discussing. The texts we read were also connected to one another, and they would reference one another as the course continued. I appreciated this because it felt like there was a sense of continuity! I also really appreciated the flexibility on the deadline for our weekly reading responses. Even though we had a 9pm deadline every Tuesday, Prof. Elliott was gracious and just asked that we submit before the end of the day. Weaknesses: the last final paper overlapped with the in-class 2.5 hour final at the end of the course (paper due Wednesday night, final on Thursday night). I would have appreciated having either a final paper OR a in-class final, and it made the end of the semester extra stressful with 2 important assignments for one class being due back-to-back. I also would have appreciated a little more structure to the discussions\/lectures. Though I appreciated the interest in hearing what we wanted to discuss, at times it would have been better to have Prof. Elliott simply explain and elaborate on the texts, which could then have sparked deeper discussions after we got clarification. On the last day of class, Prof. Elliott also mentioned themes that we were supposed to have picked up throughout the semester, but I feel like it would have been better to know the themes or ideas to look out for before the end of the semester. Overall, it was a great course, seeing as it was the first class Prof. Elliott taught at Yale, and if I could, I would take Classics again with him!",
                "I dont think this course should have a final exam. I also think we were assigned a lot of reading material, but we really didnt cover\/need most of it for class discussions\/papers. I think if the material assigned could be more focused (or we cover more material in class) it would be beneficial.",
                "A strength of this course is that it explores markets using conceptual tools from all three of EP&E's constituent disciplines, facilitating truly interdisciplinary engagement. A (relatively minor) weakness of this approach is that the readings come from so many disciplines and conceptual approaches-- political philosophy, sociology, anthropology, etc.-- that it is sometimes difficult to see the connections between them.",
                "A strength was Prof. Elliott's teaching. He is great at explaining things in really clear ways. Topics that I've previously covered in classes made a lot more sense through specific readings we did and class. I also really enjoyed the material and was super interested. Feedback was helpful, too!\r\nThe class could have been a little more organized, maybe with a little more structure. The schedule at the end of the semester piled up in a tough way with a final paper due the day before an in-class final.",
                "Strengths: Professor Elliott! One of the very best professors I've had at Yale. He's clearly so passionate, knowledgable, and cares about his students! He makes an effort to involve the whole class. A 9:25 seminar would have felt like a drag with any other professor, but Professor Elliott makes it genuinely fun to wake up to. I really liked the units thematically, and thought it was vey appropriate that the last week or so was about connecting the modern authors to the ancient ones.\r\nWeaknesses: (1) the class workload felt reading-week-heavy, which is to say the last week of classes was a LOT of writing\r\n(2) The grading scale felt a bit jumpy and unjustified at times"

                "Yes - although I would not be able to speak to EP&E 216 or 217 for the classics classes, I am very happy I chose this one. Economic markets and their limits, how they develop, what the implications are, where they can go, the pros for capitalism, the cons, the alternatives, the corrupting factors and the benefits - all of that content - if that seems even a little bit exciting is this course. And Professor Elliot is one of those professors that you must know and must have been taught by at your time at Yale.",
                "If you need to take this to fulfill the Classics EPE requirement, then yes! Prof. Elliott is fair, and he's an intelligent professor. He has a wealth of knowledge he loves to share, and you'll most definitely learn a lot from him. Just like any seminar, there's a lot of reading, though!",

                "This class made me truly intellectually excited for the first time since I got to college. I definitely would recommend it. Obviously it's one of the required EPE classes (so anyone taking this class probably has to), and I haven't taken any of the other classics of EPE classes, so I'm not very familiar with the difference, but I really do this this was one of my favorite classes at Yaleand I don't say this lightly! I've taken a lot of classes over the years, good and bad, and I really thought this was a wonderful seminar (even if I found thought the grading\/organization left something to be desired. My TL;DR of the class is that it helped me see the big picture of the major."
