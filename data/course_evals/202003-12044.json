However, despite the virtual format, I still feel that I was able to advance my vocabulary, speaking skills, and especially knowledge of French culture in this course.",
                "Throughout the span of this course, my ability to speak French improved tremendously. I learned a lot of vocabulary and how to apply them to relevant scenarios and topics, as well as how to read much more smoothly through much, much practice. The articles discussed in class were often very contemporary and reflected modern issues in France and other francophone countries. I learned a lot about the culture and the challenges French society deals with today.",
                "Frequent weekly newspaper readings reinforced or expanded my knowledge of contemporary French society (education, immigration, religion, lacit, etc.), while improving my reading skills and vocabulary. Near weekly writing assignments raised my confidence in written composition, and I appreciated Mme. Schneiders feedback and corrections. The strong emphasis on vocabulary (exhaustive, weekly lists of vocab relevant for each weeks theme) was especially helpful in broadening my base of vocabulary. As for speaking, biweekly meetings (and short mini-presentations + our two oral exams) provided plenty of opportunities for practice.",

                "I thought this course was extremely engaging since it was discussion based, and it really pushed me to speak a lot more than I did before, as well as speak on the fly, so I liked that I could practice my speaking skills more. We also wrote 300-400 word responses each week, which was a good way to keep our writing skills in use and also helped me improve my writing efficiency. Madame Schneider always gave very clear feedback after each assignment or assessment and the lesson plans for each week were also clear, so I never had any confusion. I also think the exposs we did were a strong point since we had enough freedom to explore a specific topic we might not have otherwise talked about in class, but also challenged us to think very deeply on this specific topic in French culture. I truly really enjoyed this class, and I thought it was run perfectly, even with the online format.",
                "I really enjoyed the format of this course: students were encouraged to lead the discussion and Prof. Schneider contributed when guidance was needed or when she wanted to build upon a student's point. I think that the exposs were a meaningful and useful opportunity for students to showcase individual work. I see no glaringly evident places for significant change\/improvement.",
                "One of the strengths of this course were the many small spoken assessments that would be due every week or every other week. They generally required little research, being only 2-3 minutes, but they simulated public speaking and really were good indicators of my progress.",
                "The class engaged my reading, comprehension, writing and presentation skills, and covered a broad, interesting range of themes. Although Mme. Schneiders syllabus devoted two weeks to immigration, I still would have appreciated more engagement with Frances relationship with its former colonies, protectorates, etc. and these countries' consequent post-colonial scars and cultural + political developments.\r\nSince oral practice in class is constrained by the need to discuss course content, I would also appreciate if she asked students to organize a highly informal, off-topic discussion session (i.e. French table) just for the purposes of practice among ourselves--sometimes I found myself only volunteering to speak 3-4 times per class, and I think others would have appreciated an extra outlet to practice. \r\nAlso, I really enjoyed the movies she assigned, but there were two weeks in which she assigned two films per week, which I found very hard to manage.",
                "Strength: the distribution of assignments and grades. Compared to many other classes, I did not feel overwhelmed by a singular exam but the workload was spread out rather evenly."

                "The use of Zoom for our virtual discussions went very smoothly, and we could screen share for our exposs so everything was very successful technologically. We also all had our cameras on during class, which I think helped facilitate the feeling that we were in person and kept everyone engaged. One change in terms of the syllabus is that the professors replaced the second oral exam with an interview with a Francophone, which I really enjoyed since this gave us flexibility in terms of when we wanted to do the assignment, and also touch on more specific subjects that we didn't have time to cover in class. I thought everything about this course translated very well online, and it felt almost exactly the same as an in person discussion-based class.",
                "I believe this course succeeded as best it could given the setbacks of the COVID-19 pandemic and virtual learning. Our seminar was small enough that discussion could still flow easily and naturally, and presentations were made relatively seamless via Zoom's share-screen feature.",
                "The course was fantastic despite the limits of COVID.",
                "Professor Schneider adapted this course very smoothly to pandemic learning conditions. It was very easy to sign up for Zoom time slots for orals, and our two in-class written exams, conducted during Zoom class, went smoothly. Professor made sure everyone could speak when they wished.",
                "I definitely feel that although conducting a small language seminar online is challenging (and very different from in-person), I glad I took this course and the format worked out really well."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they want to pursue a major or certificate in French. The first few weeks of class pushed me out of my comfort zone a little bit since I didn't have the most confidence in speaking French, but it was a level of challenge that allowed me to grow without adding too much stress to my life. The workload is reasonable, and Madame Schneider was also very understanding in extending deadlines a little if you happened to be very busy a certain week. The best part of this class was definitely the discussions, because we cover a lot of societal issues and topics that we are all probably familiar with, but we do so through a French perspective which really changed the way I thought about certain things. We watched a lot of really interesting movies too. As someone who took 150 at Yale, the biggest difference about this course is that it feels less like a class that is teaching you French, and is really much more like any other discussion-based Yale class, just conducted in French and focused on French\/Francophone culture. That being said, you definitely have to put in continuous work and try your best during every class to get the most out of this course. Also, Madame Schneider is a wonderful professor! She has high expectations for all her students and is looking for genuinely thoughtful discussion, but she definitely sets you up with what you need to succeed. She's also such a passionate and energetic professor, so I constantly engaged and challenged to think.",
                "Yes! People should definitely take this class if they want to continue doing French at Yale.",
                "I think that this course is a great way to engage with French culture and media for students who already feel confident in their French speaking, reading, and writing skills. (This, however, is not to say that Prof. Schneider did not provide feedback in those areas when necessary--she absolutely did.) Also, I really enjoyed a lot of the films we watched; the course material was really interesting as a whole.",
                "Yes, especially if you want to further your speaking, reading and writing skills before pursuing more advanced offerings. Its a great way to dig a bit deeper into Francophone current affairs (mostly French affairs, though youre given chances to learn about la Francophonie as well). Youll get out what you put into it, and youll enjoy this class only if you invest the time to keep up with the short reading assignments so you can contribute in class.",
                "If you are looking for a course to keep up your French skills while talking about current and historic events - take this course. The language component is not overwhelming, and you get to practice your speaking quite a lot. The workload is also very manageable!"
