Rather than examining specific techniques in great detail, we looked at a variety of techniques with the goal of broad exposure. We also spent some time examining pericyclic reactions and derivatives thereof.",

                "I think the course was very well organized. We had enough opportunity to practice through problem sets, the expectations for exams were clear, and the lectures were well-organized.",
                "It's a lecture-style class without the involvement of students during the class. It could be good for those who prefer passive learning.",
                "I found it very difficult to learn when all the information was thrown into a PowerPoint and then talked about rather than using other teaching styles. I did love the material and found it enjoyable, especially with Scott's wonderful and uplifting attitude every day, but it was always difficult to actually remember anything he talked about.",
                "I enjoyed that we were able to cover a large swath of material without going into so much depth to the point of being overcomplicated. The problem sets provided a nice avenue to work through the material in greater detail. The course readings provided an opportunity to go into greater depth in alignment with student interests, while also exposing us to a variety of papers of historical importance. As a secondary benefit, I feel like I have a deeper understanding of how to read the chemical literature since the papers were often valuable for assignments. No weaknesses to note.",
                "The course was very interesting and well-taught.",
                "Super inspiring and engaging lectures. I just wish the course had been taught in a room with a bigger blackboard where professor Miller could have had the chance to draw more structures and mechanisms by hand. I felt at times that the course was too powerpoint heavy, which made understanding some of the concepts during lecture a little more difficult. I always find drawing on the blackboard is much more engaging especially for organic chemistry."

                "There are a lot of cool things that the professor brings up during the class.",
                "If they love physical organic chemistry, then yes. But if they're on the fence, I would take another course because it's hard to walk away remembering the material from this course.",
                "Yes! I found the material super interesting especially if youre interested in a higher level organic chemistry course.",
                "Yes if you have a very solid foundation in organic chemistry and want to go in-depth in the topic",
                "Yes, without reservations.",
                "Yes, this class was very interesting and engaging, even for someone not in the organic chemistry division. It gives a new perspective on things that can be used in unique ways in other chemistry fields such as inorganic.",
                "Great elective if you would like to understand rules regarding stability, kinetics, and reaction mechanisms better. The part of it taught by Professor Miller is incredible. The first half of the course taught by Professor Jorgensen was extremely difficult to get through because of how uninspiring the lectures were."
