                "My reading skills improved greatly in this course. Prof Hill had us do a lot of reading and while I didn't always love it, I became a much better reader. Lots of new ways to think about England becoming an empire, especially because that sort of stuff tends to get glazed over. I was fascinated by the Glorious Revolution and the insights on Cromwell's reign, and the growth of the West Indian colonies. It was also nice to have to do a secondary work presentation that didn't take a lot of work but forced me to read something and have an analysis of it.",

                "Strengths: The course makes an effort to cross the Atlantic, which I feel doesn't traditionally happen. The readings were a lot but usually fairly interesting and well selected. The short papers were interesting to write and reinforced some of the class concepts that I would've otherwise forgotten about. Though I hate having to submit a draft\/outline before the final paper is due, it really saved me this time. Prof Hill led discussions extremely well and gave really clear feedback and assistance with writing assignments, which was huge for me.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were long and sometimes didn't get posted until the day before class, which made it difficult to do them. The final paper was a bit challenging, but I'm not that familiar with the subject area outside the course material so that probably contributed.",
                "Very engaging and you learn a lot, but the 15-20 page paper at the end is quite hard",
                "I have a mixed opinion of this course. On the one hand, there is no prior context assumed in this course, but we skip over covering the historu of the peirod itself. I think the timeperiod chosen contributed to this, as we dont really discuss imperial devlopment after the English Civil War. On the other hand, I really gained an understanding of how the ideas in the Anglo-American tradition derived from, which I was not exposed to before.",
                "The strengths are that Professor Hill is fantastic - very knowledgable, capable of commanding a class, and clearly cares about his students' learning & enjoyment in the course. The material was interesting and covered a broad range and the written essays were clear and doable with detailed feedback and fair\/generous grading. The weakness was that there was often quite a lot of reading, and I think it meant to oftentimes students would come to class without really having done it. The class was a seminar schedule and when students had not done all the reading the discussions would therefore sometimes be a bit dry\/people seemed unprepared. Because of this, I honestly would have preferred more lecture from Professor Hill in the lessons (or less reading so discussions were a bit more talkative).",
                "Constructive and structured discussions, Professor Hill was very helpful and always happy to discuss readings, timely and insightful feedback. Readings were a heavy at times, especially when we didn't have time to discuss them all in class, but always interesting."

                "Sure. Professor Hill definitely was intimidating at first but he just really likes the subject and historiography in general. He definitely warms up, the paper assignments are challenging but rewarding, and the readings were pretty good. Class discussions were also really insightful because I was getting different things from the readings than other people.",
                "Yes - good professor and writing credit",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course to any student that is interested in English history or taking a seminar\/writing credit. It was definitely accessible to anyone regardless of skill background. That being said, a student should definitely be interested in the seminar style to take the class as it is very much the format.",
