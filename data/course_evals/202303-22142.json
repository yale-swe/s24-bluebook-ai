                "I learned how to think of literature in terms of greater ideas and concepts. I also learned how to make effective and thought-provoking comments in class, and find ways to express my thought clearly. A unique thing about this section was that we had to do a recitation and lead discussion for around 20 minutes, which was very challenging. It was nonetheless a good way to improve our communication skills.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of literature, and all the different ways a work can be read. I gained important skills in the organization of writing and in analysis.",
                "Learning effective reading and writing and how to deeply analyze texts.",
                "I developed my skills in writing and literary analysis. I gained a lot of insight into the texts we read, as well as the broader questions of what is literature and how we should approach the study of it.",
                "DS Lit with Prof. Soles definitely taught me how to think and write beyond the my initial thoughts and understandings. Soles encourages students to inquire, explore, and examine each and every text and write essays that a thematic statement can only be assigned to the text you're writing about. This class definitely taught me how to interact with texts in a way that allows me an in-depth understanding from multiple perspectives as well as write an essay I know I'll be proud of for years to come. This class is ecstatic if you get what I mean.",
                "My understanding of the value and use of literature was completely transformed by taking this class. There is a very high emphasis on close reading of the texts and attempting to extract meaning and draw connections between and within texts.",
                "Writing and discussion with peers",
                "Above all else, I benefited greatly from Prof. Soles' instruction to close-read the texts we coveredespecially in the context of our papers. This helped me form more nuanced understandings of the literary structure, and how it complements content, rather than the other way around."

                "One strength of this course is that the class was very engaged with the content and everyone was eager to comment. Discussion was always intense, and Professor Soles found creative ways to make class fun and engaging for us. We had class outside for a very long time, and it made such a big difference in making the class fun. One weakness was that the discussions very often went off topic and the class started discussing quite unrelated ideas or niche personal philosophical interests. The discussion was still fun, but I would not say it was as helpful as if we had more closely followed the text.",
                "Strengths: overall, the course material was very engaging. Weaknesses: I wish there was a greater focus on the history of each text - known interpretations and influences, for example.",
                "Strengths: Professor Soles!!!!! He is, without a doubt, the best Professor I have had. It is immediately evident how genuinely he cares about his students and literature. He leads the section as though he is sharing something (the texts and his findings) sacred with you, and it really allows you to get excited about the texts. He also went out of his way to make class fun and surprised our section on numerous occasions. His feedback is also absolutely amazing. He provides loads of constructive criticism, which is extremely helpful when writing future essays. He also always makes sure to be available for office hours.",
                "I thought it was a really fun class that was quite engaging and free in discussions, and I enjoyed being exposed to others views, opinions, and thoughts on common content. Given the format of DS, the pace of learning was often quite fast which was hard to manage at times.",
                "Honest opinion: I loved every moment of fall DS lit with Professor Soles. I don't have many suggestions, other than perhaps honing in on the structure more than the ideasa suggestion Professor Soles himself would likely make, too."
