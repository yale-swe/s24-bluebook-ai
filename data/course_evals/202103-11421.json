The midterm assignment felt really challenging to do since it was on a topic we only discussed in the first two weeks of the course mostly, and there were not many grades/assignments in the class which felt a little stressful knowing our whole grade would be based on a few things.",
                "Elli is a fantastic teacher and a total character.  He really cares about this material a lot and that's obvious throughout the class.  Be prepared for him to make it very obvious if he disagrees with a point you try to make though.  The course gives a really good overview of many centuries of Jewish thought, providing a lot of the intellectual perspectives that are often overlooked in favor of religious/spiritual perspectives when learning about Judaism.",
                "The strengths are the discussions and the concepts. I liked the readings, but some of the readings were difficult to understand without closely reading. I also liked the assignments of the course.",
                "Strengths: some of the core topics are interesting\r\nWeaknesses: readings are dense and not very informative",

                "I would if you are interested in this specific form of Jewish philosophy/thinking but otherwise maybe not. It was very thought/philosophy heavy when I thought there would be some more historical context. Also a few of the discussion especially at the end felt political when I wish that they would not be. This was partially due to students in the class bringing up politics, but it was kind of frustrating at times since the readings/class discussions were not giving big topics their due nuance.",
                "Yes, this class is fantastic.  There is a lot of reading, though it's usually pretty interesting.  You can also definitely get by without having done all of it, but you'll get more out of it if you come to class prepared.  The course also attracts students with a wide range of background on Judaism and Jewish thought, so sometimes it is necessary to catch up non-Jewish students on things that are already obvious to Jewish ones.  That said, even as a fairly observant Jew, the vast majority of the course content was stuff I had never been exposed to before, and I'm absolutely glad I took it!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class! Professor stern is a great professor, and the material is very interesting.",
