From the political sphere to persuasion to relationships to conflict, Dr. Gendron provided not only helpful technical definitions, but also famous experiments that both supported what we intuitively guessed and contradicted it.

                "The course was not very engaging as a lecture format. I often found some of the lectures to be very study heavy and it relied heavily on a person's initial understanding of the studies because there were no additional comments on the slides about each study. I think that this course could be improved with more clear expectations about what is expected out of who takes this course. This was my first psych course and I found that the expectations of the students were much higher than what I would think would be expected of an intro level course.",
                "Strengths: cool concept\r\nweakness: grading was insane, way to unnecessarily harsh",
                "Strengths: interesting, workload isn't too bad, comprehensible topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: graded pretty harshly, lack of information prior to first response paper and overall lack of feedback when getting papers back. Having a final exam and a final paper was also kind of a lot, given that that's over 30% of the final grade in just the last 5 days of the semester.",
                "I think a strength is the grading system. I like the format of the grading and the weight of each assignment. I wouldn't really say there's a weakness, other than I wish the slides explained the studies better because when you go back to study the slides you just see a bunch of pictures and graphs for the studies.",
                "The lectures were very straightforward and mainly easy to follow. However, the structure of the lecture was very tiring and sometimes tended to be a bit boring. However, the method of teaching was efficient for learning the material. A flaw would be a lack of feedback of response papers which made it hard to improve on the following papers.",
                "The professor is an immediate strength to this course. Maria Gendron is a gem for teaching, and you can tell she is passionate about the content she teaches and the students she teaches it to. I enjoyed the use of Inquizitive to test our knowledge on the material in a low-stakes environment. The tests were challenging, and the midterm was quite tough and took a long time (even though we had extended time due to technical difficulties.) Additionally, the ambiguity of some of the grading on our response papers made it tough for me to really understand what I was doing wrong and how to get better.",
                "Strengths- Topics are fascinating, information is delivered clearly, not a lot of homework assignments\r\nWeaknesses- Can be more organized",
                "A lot of content was covered in lectures, which moved quite fast. Often, it felt like we were breezing past things without really delving into their nuances, which would have been more intellectually stimulating \r\n\r\nClasses were very interactive, which helped keep me attentive, and the Professor usually related concepts to real life examples, solidifying my understanding.",
                "It was graded extremely harshly and we were expected to memorize studies rather than learn concepts. The studies were briefly covered so the professor made it very difficult to know what to study until the last minute",
                "Strengths: relatively low workload, Prof. Gendron was relatively responsive to feedback, in-class review for exams\r\nWeaknesses: unclear grading standards/inconsistent grading for written assignments, PowerPoint slides are difficult to comprehend when studying for exams, did not adequately address the biases within the field of social psychology in my opinion",
                "Strengths: weekly quiz assignments, organized lecture slides, accessible TFs; Weaknesses: lectures did not feel very engaging, Midterm Exam was graded too harshly even though it was open book and open note, Reading Response grading did not feel fair, Professor did not spend enough time in class explaining the Reading Response and Final Project assignments, the lectures did not prepare students properly for the Exams, Exams required too much useless memorization and weren't the best reflection of student learning",
                "It is a decent course to take on the side but it is not the easy A people think it is. The information to know for exams is released a week before and it is a lot. The lectures are interesting though. The real difficulty is with the reading responses since the grading is very harsh for those and it is unclear what the expectations are.",
                "Strengths -- the lectures were great and the studies were all interesting\r\nWeaknesses -- I believe the feedback on the papers was very weak and challenging to understand what to do, if the lectures were recorded I believe it would be much easier to review, and finally I think the final project criteria should be better reviewed because I think there was some contradictory information because the assignment was pulled from the past.",
                "The strengths are that the bi-weekly papers really get you thinking outside of the box, but are graded very harshly.  However, the feedback is very helpful.",
                "Strengths - interesting concepts\r\nWeaknesses - poor lecture slides, exams were too vast and general",
                "I thought the class could have honestly been more specific, and that the grading rubrics for things like the response papers could have been a LOT clearer. However, the content was interesting, the TAs were helpful, and professor Gendron was a really good lecturer. I enjoyed the content thoroughly, and I was happy I took this class over some other boring premed psychology intro class.",
                "strength: mostly interesting\r\nweakness: confusing content at times",
                "Strengths: lectures were engaging \r\nWeakness: lecture slides didn't have much detail",
                "The course content was interesting, but the grading was way too harsh for an intro course. As someone who took it as a senior majoring in psych/neuro, some of the grading was jarring. There was little guidance on how to improve, and a lack of grading consistency between the TAs.",
                "Strengths:\r\nI thought the material was interesting because I like learning about people and I liked that it was very multifaceted. I also enjoyed writing the 4 one-page response papers because I felt more immersed into the material. \r\nYou receive more detailed feedback for your first response paper to set the standard, which is helpful.\r\nI enjoyed learning through the nuances of the studies and I liked that I was learning about this new field as it is being explored.\r\nThe lectures were well-structured in my opinion, with a good amount of interactivity.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe grades for the response papers took a while to come out, so I didnt always know if my previous approach worked and if I should use it for the next one. \r\nThe first exam was very long and difficult, so Im not sure how we wouldve completed it during class if the format hadnt changed unexpectedly to be a take-home exam.",
                "One weakness is that the grading rubrics for assignments are somewhat vague and you dont really know what the professor is looking for.",
                "The course content was really cool and engaging. I feel like I zoned out from lectures a bit, especially in the second-half of the course.",
                "Strengths: interesting material and organized \r\nWeaknesses: more uniformity in the response paper grading system with the TA's (very hit or miss) w/ no feedback if you received a lower grade and certain lecture topics could be condensed to allow more time for more confusing concepts",
                "The grading is extremely harsh with not much feedback.",
                "Strengths are that the course was well organized on Canvas in terms of the lecture slides (not recorded), assignments, and readings. Hope was also a great TA. There are quite a bit of weaknesses of this course, however - mainly the format and grading. First of all the class itself feels like a social psychology experiment. Grading started harsh for the sole reason of showing gradual improvement throughout the course. In other words, no matter how well you write the first response paper, don't expect a good grade. They know Yale students are smart, so why not make them more satisfied about showing improvement? So there you go, you will do great at the end of the course, but at the beginning, don't expect to do hot on response paper #1. I could compare my first and last response papers and there is not that much of a difference in terms of quality and ticking the boxes on the rubric. Yet, I managed to get a 50% on the first one and a 100% on the last. Feedback you might ask? It wasn't helpful for the first response paper and then they stopped giving it for 2, 3, and 4. Also, the exams were a calamity. The teaching team tried hard to prevent people from cheating by instituting the Respondus LockDown browser, but that failed miserably during the midterm. The Internet never works when you have 200 students all trying to take the exam at the same time. So they had to make the exam open-note and open for 24 hours. The results of making the midterm a bit too easy were losing half a point on virtually every free response question and not seeing why you got those points docked (there was no feedback). Sounds about the same fashion as the response papers. It only makes me think that they were trying to push a narrative of a false sense of improvement over the course as the final exam turned out to be much simpler and easier (and on paper of course!). This is not the first time the course was offered so I am surprised at the utter lack of planning and organization for simple things like that. I am also not a fan of classes faking improvement just so they can say you improved. If you think you made the class way too easy, then don't push a narrative of faking improvement to make the class more difficult. It doesn't help anyone or make anyone happier.",
                "I think the course is pretty interesting and engaging. However, it is more heavy on the technical topics such as research interpretation and the like and it felt like it was more for Psychology majors rather than anyone who is interested. The weakness of the course in my opinion is that it is not recorded and the lectures can be very fast paced, especially when it comes to more technical psychology research topics.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: Intense reliance on research studies, some of which had considerable limitations and errors that made generalizations difficult. I would suggest making the course more concept-based, using the studies more so as supplements.",
                "One strength of this course is how the information is presented-- all of the information is posted in the presentation that is uploaded on Canvas before class. One weakness is that the exams sneak up on you if you don't keep up with the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gendron, TAs, Helpfullness and interesting lectures",
                "Lectures were very well done and course was very well organized",
                "I like that things in this class could be applied to daily life. There is some overlap with PSYC 110 but it goes far more indepth with the social psych stuff (obviously). Not too difficult but still interesting. My only grievance would be the first response the TAs gave everyone a bad grade and then being super lax with the next few responses. It feels like they try to artificially show an upward trajectory and even though I didn't change that much of my writing, my grades saw a tremendous improvement.",
                "No weaknesses! This course requires an understanding of a wide-variety of research studies, so this may be something to consider. Though making sure you clearly understand the studies requires effort, they are helpful in illustrating the concepts.",
                "I liked that lectures were mandatory, it made me more engaged with the class. However, I missed class one or two times due to sickness or not being in New Haven and felt like I had very little support for the content I missed, especially since the slides are ambiguous without knowing what Dr. Gendron said.",
                "I loved everything about the course, but I wish the grading policy was a little more flexible.",
                "The strengths of this course were the quizzes that were a great test of our knowledge while also not being incredibly stressful mentally to study for it was more for wonderful practice and comprehending the material. This way, I felt that I actually absorbed the material better and through the response papers we had I was challenged to learn how to read social psychology papers which I had never tried to read before. One of the weaknesses was that the lectures flowed in a little bit of a disruptive way in that they didn't connect as much from on to the other, however, I think this is ok since each of the topics did in a way build on each other by the end of the semester."

                "Unless you're really interested in psychology I would pass. I found this to be much more difficult than it should be to be successful in the class and oftentimes we woudl receive feedback on assignments after we turned in another one so we wouldn't have time to improve. I found the structure of the course to be quite boring in all honesty and would have appreciated knowing that the lecture would be primarily focused on studies instead of applications.",
                "Honestly, not worth taking unless you are in the first two years of a psych degree, I took it as a junior and it was just extra stress on my plate for information I had already learned or been introduced to",
                "If you're a psych major and interested, yes. It's annoying at times but generally not too tough of a course. Pretty interesting and a good foundation. If you're looking for a gut social science course, maybe not because the grading of assignments was pretty annoying.",
                "Yes, it was enlightening to see the scientific studies on social interactions and learn more about the literature.",
                "I would recommend it. Just make sure you know what you want out of it. I needed a class that I could earn a credit in while spending as little time as possible on the class. This class worked out well, especially because I took it Credit D. Went to class 4 times all semester (two of those being for the midterm and final), did the homework quizzes, 1-page responses, and final 5-page paper, and took the two exams. If you are in a similar situation and need a light-workload credit, this is a good option, especially if you're willing to take it Credit D. But I imagine if you want to really learn the material and are more engaged in the class, it would still be a good course to take.",
                "Yes! Loved it and it was very informative and interesting.",

                "Yes; it does a good job at incorporating different ways of learning (take home quizzes, response papers, exams, personal projects). Keeps the workload very varied.",
                "I thought there was quite a bit of content overlap with Introduction to Psychology, but this content was presented in ways that did not seem as intuitive for me personally to understand. The grading of the response papers felt high stakes and ambiguous which created a lot of anxiety within the classroom. Overall, I enjoyed the lectures but I felt the tough midterms and response papers did not reflect the material we were learning as well as it could have. But, what didn't work well for me may click differently for another student.",
                "Yes! Prof Gendron was absolutely amazing and the content was very fascinating. I think anyone, regardless of major, can benefit from taking this source. The stuff that's taught is really applicable to everyday life, and the workload is manageable.",
                "Absolutely not. It was poorly taught and we failed to receive feedback in a timely enough manner to put it into practice for our next assignments, leaving us vulnerable to the exact same grade reductions",
                "Probably not. The unclear requirements for written assignments and lack of clear feedback were a constant source of frustration throughout the semester, and the lectures were not particularly interesting. It's not a terribly difficult course, but I wound up Credit-Ding the course to reduce my stress over the second exam and the grading on the final paper.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Social Psychology is a very interesting topic and the course was overall organized, despite some of the challenges students faced throughout the semester regarding assignment grading and feedback.",
                "I would recommend it if you are willing to put in the work to get an A, and meeting with ALL the TA's to approve of your response papers.",

However, I would beware of the grading and make sure that you go to office hours if you don't get the grade you want on the first couple papers.",
                "Yes, it is an interesting course and makes you apply your knowledge of psychology to things you would have never thought about.",
                "Learnt some interesting things but there may be better psych courses to take",
                "Sure! I enjoyed the content and the teaching a lot, so if you are at all interested in social dynamics and how the presence of other people affect your psychology, I think this is a great class to take. The focus on primary literature is crucial, and helps you really grow accustomed to how the field actually works rather than having hand-wavy explanations of concepts that are boldly claimed to be true.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, but please be aware that the grades for your response paper are dependent on who your TA is.",
                "I would recommend it if youre interested in the material. The lectures are only easy to follow if youre actively trying to understand and ask questions. Try to fill in these gaps in knowledge during lecture because it makes studying for exams easier. If you feel like the material is boring, or it doesnt feel like you can apply it to things youre actually interested in, I wouldnt recommend the class. I took it as a social sciences credit, and I found it alright.",
                "I would recommend it as long as you are willing to put in the work",
                "If you're looking for a gut, this class isn't for youtrust me! It's very easy to get behind on lectures, quizzes, reading responses, etc. While some people might claim that this class is a gut, it isn't. You have to make sure you're putting the time in, especially for the midterm (the final was definitely more manageable in my opinion). In addition to a midterm and final exam (though they call it a second midterm), you also have 10 quizzes, 4 reading responses, and a final project. It was more work than I had expected. I think if you're genuinely interested in social psychology, though, you should shop it and see if you like it.",
                "Yes, especially if you are a psych major needing to fulfill the core social science req or someone just interested in basic psychology",
                "If you are genuinely interested in the material and willing to put the work in to achieve good grades since the grading is harsh, then I would recommend this class.",
                "Probably not in the present format. It is a easy manageable class (even if you don't go lecture) but if there is a more interesting psychology course out there, don't take this one. You are better of learning more Social Psychology by reading this class's textbook than taking this class.",
                "Recommend only if you can make it to office hours - very little feedback (only numerical scores according to a rubric) is given on papers unless you explicitly go and ask the TAs/instructor and even still you can never quite know how the TA will grade your paper. Exams also required high amount of memorization. Content was really interesting though and the lectures were also engaging!",
                "I would recommend this for psychology majors.",
                "No. There are better ways to learn the same concepts. You don't really walk away from the course having developed a skill set and the grading lacks coherence and consistency.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, especially if they are at all interested in psychology. I learned a lot about how and why people act the way that they do, and how this can be studied.",
                "YES!!!!",
                "Yes - covered a wide variety of topics that are useful for people not studying psychology in addition to those studying psychology",
                "Yes, I think it's as interesting as PSYC 110 and the grading schema is a LOT more clear. The instructor was engaging as well.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students with a genuine interest in the subject.",
                "It was an interesting course and I felt like I could explain a lot of social phenomenon that I experience in my everyday life.",
                "Yes! Very doable and you learn a lot that you can apply to everyday life",
                "Yes",
                "Definitely!  Dr. Gendron is amazing and the course is engaging and fun.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as a STEM major, this psychology was a wonderful introduction to the field. I learned so many interesting things about human relations and current controversies that made me think deeply about daily interactions and things I saw on social media. This course is definitely a great course to take to truly understand how social interactions shape the way we create communities and our livelihoods."
