   "comments": [
    "I developed the skill of careful observation. It's such a unique class in that you get to see kids interacting with one another without much help from adults. The writing that is required for this class is also unique, since you get to combine research and somewhat \"clinical\" writing with more personal narrative-based pieces from your observations.",
    "I learned about the course of developments of children. I learned how an infant toddler classroom runs.",
    "I learned how to be an active observer and incorporate my observations with readings and academic sources.",
    "This class helped me understand the various factors (neurological, legislative, societal, etc.) that affect child development. I have built a foundational knowledge in these various topics both through theory (readings\/responses) and practice (weekly visits).",
    "I learned generally about many aspects of early child education including behavior, neurology, language, parenting, and schooling. I learned about the theory and practice of implementing proper measures for children.",
    "In lectures, I learned much about children's development, adjustment to schools, curriculums, and much more. Through the preschool aspect of the class, I was able to gain experience as a participant observer as well as interact with children and directly see the concepts learned in class in action. I learned to be more observant and analytical of behaviors that are commonly seen and seek understanding in situations that are not expected.",
    "This course was an incredibly helpful overview of child development. The class addressed development from many different angles, and seemed to cover an unreal amount of content for one semester. I learned to better separate objective observations from my own analysis, and consider and observation from many viewpoints.",
    "We learned a lot about early childhood development, attachment, play, cognitive\/language\/social development.",
    "I developed a broad understanding of child development. Topics I feel well-informed about include: the importance of \"play\" for child development, techniques that best support learning, key developmental milestones, and much more.",
    "Theories in early childhood development.",
    "I learned how to identify principles of child development taught in class with real life behavior through childcare observations. I also discovered what it meant to be a participant-observer and to carefully notice some of the idiosyncratic actions of preschool children that might seem insignificant at first, but properly demonstrate normal or abnormal development.",
    "I learned a ton about child development and how children learn various skills.",
    "I learned a great deal about the various aspects of child development from the physical to neurological components.",
    "We learned about how the education a child receives during their childhood shapes their thought and cognitive development",
    "I learned about theories of early childhood development, and learned about the emergent curriculum and the current best practices for learning and care.",
    "A much greater understanding of child development"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Dr. Close and Dr. Horwitz are just fantastic people all around. It takes a very particular type of person to lead a class like this, and they are definitely those people. Another strength is that each lecture is given by a different person who is a specialist in their field. This is fantastic because you get to hear an in-depth and detailed presentation about all the different pillars of child development from people who really know what they are talking about. It feels like a lot more than just an intro class, where you would usually have a single professor giving an overview of everything, and they aren't necessarily expert on everything. Getting to hear from a wide-range of presenters made this class a great experience and motivated me to come every week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There's nothing weak about it really. The only thing I would suggest is that students are allowed or required to observe at least once or twice on a day\/time slot that they aren't usually scheduled for. I happened to be able to do that, and it was very helpful for me to be able to see the children in a different environment and at a different point during the day.",
    "Some guest lectures were boring, but some are truly gems. For example, the last lecture with Dr. Kagan on childhood dedication policies was crazy innovative.",
    "Strengths are definitely the observation- nothing beats actually getting to be in the classroom and observing children. As mentioned in class, I think the course could be improved by allowing students to occasionally observe at a different time of day or with a different age group.",
    "The fact that we had various speakers come in to talk to us about the different facets to childhood development highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of the field and helped me understand how I can contribute to it. The only feedback I would give is that I think the amount of readings weekly should be a bit more consistent.",
    "Teachers are great: Nancy and Carla and the others care so much about your learning and success and are so passionate about what they do. The information you learn is very practical and useful for life. All of the guest lectures are experts in their field and add a lot to the course. Observations take a lot of time out of your week but are extremely rewarding. Lecture can be a bit long and readings are practically useless, so don't do them.",
    "It was great that there were different lecturers for different topics so that we were getting input by experts. This class was heavily engaged in answering students questions and sharing our experiences in the preschool\/daycare rooms with our peers. The professors were all very approachable and caring of us as students and people. The preschool aspect of the class was very flexible and such a fun and enlightening experience. Actually getting to interact with children was a great break from the Yale sphere and there were such clear demonstrations of concepts learned in lecture that made the knowledge more engrained. \r\nI think that having readings that are more recent and lectures that are engaged with the readings would encourage students to do the readings for each week. Also sometimes the teachers would not upload lectures onto Canvas which made it difficult to reference these lectures in my journals or papers.",
    "The guest-lecture organization of the course was very helpful. Hearing experts tell us about their field increased my interest and engagement and diversified the content beyond what one professor could speak to. I also think it increased the number and quality of questions from my classmates, which pushes the learning of all.",
    "This class is a big commitment (just because of how far away the classroom as well as the daycares), but the professors are so lovely and kind, and are so genuinely interested in exploring what you are interested in. I did feel sometimes like the scope of the class was so broad, we couldn't always dig into things.",
    "It was wonderful to have rotating lecturers. They each provided a unique insight and it never interrupted the classroom flow. Please continue to have guest lecturers.",
    "The course was very well organized. I really liked that we had different professors for each lecture; this helped me to stay engaged in each of the lectures and meant material never felt redundant. It was inspiring to see so many experts in the field of child development present on the topics they are passionate about. This made me realize that there are many different domains in the field of child development. Having different professors also made me feel involved in the field and in the community, at the daycare I observed at. I was able to meet a teacher that taught in a different room at the daycare where I observed since she did a lecture for our class. Overall the course was excellent - truly one of the best I have taken at Yale. One way the course could be improved is by somehow allowing students to observe in different classrooms rather than just one (however this might be difficult logistically).",
    "I liked the the guest speaker presentations and learning about different theories in childhood development.",
    "I loved the observations. It was honestly so fun to show up every day and be there with the kids. I was at YNHH and I was able to select to work with preschoolers vs. an infant\/toddler room, and I really enjoyed being able to choose that. I also really liked that we had many different guest lecturers talking about specific topics of their own expertise. I wouldnt honestly treat anything there as a weakness. The room was pretty cold sometimes? That was really it.",
    "The lectures are poorly organized and basically just several instructors chiming in with comments over the course over an hour and fifty minutes. Really just covered the low hanging fruit of the field without much critical thought or analysis. However, there were two very good guest lectures- by a child psychiatrist and someone who works on education policy at the national level. The practicum (where we observe the children) was actually very eye opening and enjoyable. Grading was not fair in my opinion- make sure to press the instructors for specific instructions for the journals and paper (as they did not provide these to us and subsequently penalized us for not adhering to them).",
    "The strengths are the visits to local daycares. You learn how to apply the information from lecture. I sometimes wished I could visit classrooms of multiple age levels to better apply the material.",
    "I loved this course. My favorite part was going to observe the preschool, but I also felt so lucky to have the amazing professors that I had.",
    "Loved having experts in their field come guest lecture. Loved the two hour observation periods as well, that's where I learned the most about current practices in early childhood care."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Take this class if you have any interest in child development whatsoever. They let you really do your own thing on the final paper too, so you might be able to relate your observations to whatever you're personally interested in and good at. It's just a great class all around and the perfect writing credit in my opinion.",
    "Yes please take it. Great WR",
    "I would recommend this class - it is a pretty low stress writing credit and you get to play with babies!",
    "Definitely! The methodology of thinking you acquire is so applicable to any of your interests. The professors give you great leeway for your final paper, so you can focus on whatever interests you. You also develop a way of relating to children as more than just mini humans - they are incredibly complex and they have so much fodder for thought to offer to you.",
    "Yes absolutely! You get out of it what you put in, but the teachers are great, the content is great, and it's wonderful information to have for life. It's also a really nice change of pace from the average Yale class.",
    "YES! It is a great way to not only learn about children, but actually get to go to schools to interact and observe. The professors are also very involved and enthusiastic about what they teach and are very willing to answer questions and hear about your experiences. The workload was very manageable and I received clear feedback on every assignment given.",
    "Yes, definitely. Child development should probably be a required course for everyone, but certainly for anyone who interacts with kids or parents in any capacity. The experience of observing in a daycare and then discussing with the head of that center was invaluable, I highly recommend it to anyone at Yale.",
    "A fun and easy writing credit. If you like kids, a big stress relief. Just know there is a significant time commitment.",
    "100%",
    "I would recommend this class to another student at Yale who has an interest in teaching or in the field of child development more generally. I also found that the things I learned in CHLD 125 will stay with me and will influence me when I have children of my own. So, really this course is for anyone who is interested in the field, teaching, or wants to learn valuable information that is relevant for parenting.",
    "Yes I think the content we learn in this class is valuable and good to know.",
    "This class was so much fun. I think it can draw a wide range of interests, from pre-med students to English students and everything in between. Kids can be a mystery sometimes, but they sure are fun and entertaining and there is a reason for their actions. For anybody who wishes to know how to properly parent or is just curious about child development, would highly recommend.",
    "This class is great for everyone who might ever interact with children, be a teacher, or be a parent. The knowledge is indispensable.",
    "Yes this course is awesome and the classroom observations really set the course apart from others.",
    "I would, and have, recommended this course to all of my friends. I truly felt enriched by this course and the professors felt like mentors to me.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this class to observe and learn about children! Will definitely be taking the things I learned in this class to my future work and life.",
    "Take this class! You will learn so much about child development. Professor Horwitz and Professor Close are amazing and all the guest speakers are so interesting."
