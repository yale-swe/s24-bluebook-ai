Soon, it becomes much easier and you can certainly feel your improvement increase throughout the semester. The class gives you so many different insights into different kinds of writing: poetry, dialogue, narrative structure, punctuation, etc. It is truly a once in a lifetime experience of a class, and a must take for anyone majoring in the Humanities\/English at Yale.",

Each week, we worked with and discussed different aspects of writing, and by the end of the course, I found that my ability to talk about writing had greatly improved. Also: I developed A LOT of academic discipline through this course, which benefitted other areas of my work. It made me a bit more academically tenacious: there were days where I absolutely did not want to write 250 words, but I had to. I found that the process of writing, even on the days where I didn't feel like writing, or the days where I produced objectively bad writing, was more important than all of the finished Daily Themes I wrote.",

                "Really good place to experiment with new writing styles",

                "Skills: It's difficult to evaluate my own writing, especially so soon after the course, but I think my writing improved over the course of the semester. Each week of the course focused on a different aspect of writing (e.g. metaphor, punctuation, adjectives, lists), and I'm sure my writing is more proficient and intentional in all those areas. I also have a semester of practice writing almost every day.\r\n\r\nInsights: I have the ability to write. My writing will not be of the same quality as the works I'm used to reading, but if I wanted to write a fantasy story (as I have tried and failed to do in the past), I could.",
                "By writing every day, I learned through experience many skills and techniques that I can use to improve my writing. Having a tutor was also a big help, as I was able to learn with someone with a lot more experience than me.",
                "It made me a better writer. It taught me ways to improve my writing by forcing me to write consistently and meet with a tutor every week to talk about that writing. It also helped me to appreciate writing and English more, as a STEM major who was never that appreciative of them in the first place.",
                "This course taught me not just to write consistently, but to listen to my own writing and evaluate each small decision I make as a writer. From sentence effects to punctuations to dialogue to metaphors, etc., the course helped me collect new skills that I can draw from in fictional\/non-fictional writing. The most important lesson from the course was how to be more conscious with each decision as a writer to make the whole piece sound better and work better on the reader. It was also very meaningful in how it made me reflect about my new life, changes, and philosophical reflections.",
                "Paying close attention to word choice and sentence length; how to use different techniques to maximize the impact of a piece and have it resonate with readers; how to be concise in my writing\/storytelling",
                "You get a lot of practice writing quickly and at a regular frequency (once per day). I enjoyed exploring similar themes in my writing, going deeper into the same topics over the course of several weeks, writing about similar things multiple times. I found that it's very helpful for me to constrain the writing: a prompt with specific guidelines, like \"use only one-syllable words,\" would lead to better writing than the \"free prompts,\" most of the time. Similarly, I would crank out a great theme on the days when I waited until there was only an hour left before the deadline, compared to the days when I had all day to write slowly and chip away at it. I also found that it helps immensely to try to form a full theme in my head, or at least the general feeling of one, before starting to write. To make sure that I don't just have one good sentence in mind, but rather a few sentences, the rough sketch of the ark of the theme, how it starts and ends, how it ties together, and best of all, when it connects to something strange and unexpected, that's when I would enjoy the writing most. Lastly, I found it extremely helpful to speak out loud while writing. Either reading my writing, or treat the exercise as a dialogue, where my writing is in response to a question a friend has just asked... These are some of my main insights from the course.",

                "We could have just read the weekly packet on our own and not had lecture  it felt like lecture was mostly just Professor Ehrgood reading it to us.",
                "I love that we have 30 minute weekly sessions with a writing tutor, where we can talk in-depth about our writing.",
                "strength - 1 on 1 tutoring each week\r\nweakness - couldn't stay engaged in lecture",
                "Cannot think of any obvious weaknesses... only one was that by the end of the course, it felt like there was a clear format \/ content \/ perspective that was what ended up in the X themes (selected student examples from the prior weak). I wish that Professor Ehrgood had done a better job at picking diverse pieces that showcased various writing styles. As someone who does not come from a strong writing background, it felt difficult to imagine myself ever writing one of these themes and it seemed as though the easiest way to achieve it was to write an angsty piece rather than strengthen and pursue my own writing style.\r\n\r\nStrengths: super unique course format and idea -- really enjoyed!",
                "Strengths: forced daily writing and 1 on 1 with a tutor is very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: lecture was very difficult to focus in and the daily writing itself is very challenging to keep up with",
                "I loved my tutor she was super helpful and I thought that doing the 300 words a day was relatively easy",
                "Strengths: the tutors, the prompts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture could be more engaging. Not sure how to fix this tho",
                "I felt so lucky to have such a wonderful tutor, but it seemed like a hit-or-miss tutor\/tutee relationship, and I think that I would have gotten much less out of the class if I hadn't clicked with my tutor. I think the consistent workload is a strength, especially now that other assignments are piling up during finals period, and I appreciated the five built-in skips and three allowed late submissions. The biggest weakness for me was the lectures. Maybe Prof. Ehrgood's style and mine just didn't mesh, but I often found it hard to stay focused for a 2 hour post-lunch lecture that included lots of reading passages directly from the handout.",
                "This course is so much fun, I think a strength is that you have to do the assignments and you have someone to personally edit and develop a relationship with. I wish the lectures were a bit more engaging, they were informative but sometimes dragged on.",
                "I thought that the themes themselves were flexible and mostly challenging. I felt, overall, that lectures were much longer than they needed to be; guest lectures that lasted an hour felt more productive and easier digested than the more typical 90-100 minute lecture.",
                "I think the strength of the course is it's requirement to write (almost) every day. In that it succeeds. This year's course felt a bit disorganized across the board and I am unsure how much I learned beyond of the writing practice. \r\nAs I said to a friend, I think this moved the needle a bit in terms of improving my average writing but I don't believe it expanded my capacity for good writing in general.",
                "I think that Daily Themes is one of Yale's oldest courses for a reason. I found the concept to be really, really interesting, but I found that Prof. Ehrgood's teaching style was just not appropriate for this course, which was so unfortunate considering his high reviews.",
                "Strengths: Daily Themes is a unique course because whether you love it or hate it, you won't ever take a course like it again. There's something great about that. You learn a lot and in different type of challenge brought on by any other course. \r\nWeaknesses: I would not say there are a lot of weaknesses in the actual class. Your experience varies by your tutor. I would say if you do not like your tutor try to change who it is or take the class another semester. it will be a miserable experience if you do not have a good tutor.\r\nThe lectures dragged on and were boring. Very few times I found myself getting something out of them. You also will get burnt out at times, but that is part of the process.",
                "Lectures a little long and frustrating. Creative writing lectures are hard to pull off. However, absolutely loved my tutor.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Andrew's lectures were amazing, I left every class that he lectured in feeling delighted and inspired. \r\n- I loved meeting with my tutor every week and getting feedback \r\n- Being forced to write every day for a full semester is life-changing. It was so much work, but I wouldn't trade experience this for anything. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- There could have been more diversity in the pieces chosen in the lecture handouts. There were even some pieces repeated between weeks for different purposes, which felt like a bit of a waste because there is so much excellent writing out there to explore. \r\n- The lecture we had on expressing magnitude was so confusing and inaccessible to someone without an extensive writing background. It was very overwhelming, and I barely understood it. \r\n- The carrot-chasing of X-Themes is unavoidable. It caused me to obsess a bit over making sure everything I produced was a cohesive piece, when I think I could have benefitted from more experimentation if I didn't feel limited to tying every piece off with a bow.",
                "Strengths: creative weekly prompts. I liked how each week was a different aspect of writing. Having the opportunity to revise themes was nice. Weekly meetings with my tutor were generally helpful. Andrew is an engaging lecturer as well. Weaknesses: Lectures just dragged onnn. If you could say something in 5 words Andrew would say it in 500. As a result, I would often space out during the two hour lectures. It might be better to have 75 minute lectures and a slightly longer meeting with our tutors.",
                "The focus of a new writing technique every week was a major strength. The only weakness was that we spent a while talking about metaphors.",
                "Strengths: you get to write everyday and you really improve a lot. Weaknesses: experience with this course was highly dependent on individual tutors, I feel like only a small fraction of my tutor's comments were constructive and I wish tutoring sessions were more useful. My friends had a really enjoyable experience though. I also thought the lectures could be more helpful and the prompts could be more varied or non-technique based, they mostly covered basic information (like varying sentence length and asyndeton) that the average daily themes student would already be familiar with.",
                "Strengths: If you have a good tutor like I did, 30 minutes once a week to focus on your writing is an incredible amount of quality time just to focus on your writing. The feedback you get will be incredible. Plus the process of writing every day will make your writing better.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were, in almost every case, worse than useless. If Professor Ehrgood is teaching again, don't bother going to lectures. You won't miss anything.",
                "Its perfect.",
                "The strength of the course is the relationship between the tutor and tutee. My tutor was truly exceptional, and I was always grateful for her helpful and incisive feedback. It is also a strength that you have to write almost daily--and creatively. The prompts were all very interesting, and I enjoyed responding to them. The course might be improved with more attention to the lecture. No other class of which I am aware has a 1 hr 50 min lecture--and for good reason. It is hard to make that an productive experience sitting and listening. I wonder if the class could meet multiple times a week for shorter times, or if there might be time in lecture for tutors and tutee groups to meet and discuss things in smaller groups? I always felt like I wanted more time with my tutor, though of course she is very busy and has a lot of tutees, too.",
                "There were some weeks where I would have liked more alternate themes to choose from. (Not the first week though, I think it was good for us to start out with a clear language challenge we had to adhere to each day.)",
                "I thought the class was perfect",
                "I really liked the idea of this class, but I wish the prompts and lectures were more exciting. I heard there used to be happenings in lectures and I wish that would be brought back.",
                "The strengths are a great detailed attention to the mechanics of writing.",
                "The consistent pressure to write is helpful because you think about how you are going to write your theme at all times of the day. I think the lecture component was a bit of a weakness and felt tedious sometimes.",
                "The best part about this course are the weekly meetings with your writing tutor - it is amazing to get such detailed feedback on your writing and I often wished it was longer than 30 minutes a week! I think sometimes the content of the lectures could be improved - Professor Ehrgood is amazing but sometimes I wasn't sure how useful the lectures were in helping me understand different writing techniques",
                "Strengths: lectures, professor Ehrgood, my tutor, the prompts were varied, high reward \r\nWeaknesses: its tough? Isnt that what you sign up for though?",
                "Strengths: You are introduced to many techniques that improve your writing. While the tutor meetings are a little scary, they are really helpful. Weaknesses: The weekly lecture was a little boring sometimes!",
                "Strengths: Writing in a disciplined way always makes you improve. I learned how to approach writing more creatively, think of new ideas, trust the process while writing, and became a lot more detail-oriented while reading\/writing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: its easy to slack off because the class is focused on discipline and self-motivation. Sometimes I submitted bad themes that I didn't try hard on and then regretted it later because I could've written something better.",
                "Ehrgood's lectures are major site for improvement. The lectures were agonizingly dry and bland, with weekly topics that were poorly chosen and executed. The guest speakers were a welcome reprieve, particularly our guest for the dialogue unit. For a class of this renown, with such an interesting and flexible topic, lectures should surely be much more interesting, exciting, and engaging. The prompts this year were also not conducive to creativity, and often felt unnecessarily restrictive, repetitive, and much more like busy work than they should have been. The class must be radically improved to increase student learning and enjoyment in order to retain students next year.",
                "Strengths: consistency in assignment expectations\r\nWeaknesses: boring professor and few creative prompts",
                "I did what it set out to do: teach quick writing skills and help build discipline. It was great way to get fast and consistent feedback on your writing. Not only were tutors available often and friendly the lecturer Prof Ehrgood also made himself available and accesible for students.",
                "Strengths - the rigor of daily writing is necessary and effective! Weaknesses - I wish meetings with the tutors were not simply 30 minutes a week. Having the meetings run for at least an hour would help, because often times the meetings felt rushed and I was not able to ask all of the questions that I wanted to ask.",
                "Love this class. You have to be ready for it and ready to really put thought into your writing (I wasnt enough the first few weeks of the semester, but then I put more effort into it and it was much more rewarding). The lectures could feel a bit too English major-y in terms of writing strategy, when sometimes I wish it was a little bit more about trying to evoke what people naturally want to say in their writing. But overall, a great class that really lets you test yourself.",
                "This course has many, many weaknesses. The fact that it is an hour and fifty minute lecture is an insane waste of time. Lectures were redundant and unhelpful. Because of how terrible lecture is, the quality of the class rests far too much on the quality of your tutor and if you, like me, have a terrible tutor, then this class becomes terrible. The prompts of this class might just be the worst part. Prompts were not in any way, shape, or form prompting. They were simply small constraints (if constraints at all) to put on the form of your pieces. This class requires an immense amount of creativity on the part of the writer. I had heard amazing things about the lectures in years past that helped bolster creativity when you were at home writing but the version of this course of this year (2023) is completely devoid of that. The deadline is also terribly unflexible. For some some reason to reach the goal of habit in your writing, every one is required to submit by 9 AM instead of being able to set their own deadline that would work the best with their writing and their own schedule. If the emphasis is on forming a habit, there's no reason students shouldn't be able to set their own deadline.",
                "Great format if youre into it, can be hard to come up with what to actually write about though",
                "Some of the prompts were great but others felt like they were looking for a trick\/performance rather than good writing",
                "I thought the prompts were good - flexible while also encouraging us to try new things.\r\nThe X-Themes chosen seemed to conform to a type; I would have liked to see a wider range of students' writing.\r\nThe lectures could have been more succinct.",
                "This course could use better lectures that try to give specific pieces of advice on writing rather than offering examples.",
                "I wish this course was more easily accessible online. One advantage is that you could pick your themes submission schedule.",
                "My writing tutor was the best part of the course. Lectures were boring and poorly done.",
                "The lectures were often very chaotic and not the most engaging",
                "I thought the daily prompts were generally very interesting and helpful. They challenged the writers, but left room for us to choose our own subject matter. I definitely took more from some weeks of lectures than others, but the assignments themselves were great.",
                "lectures could have been much more engaging. the guest lectures were interesting, but I didn't get much out of Andrew's lectures that I wouldn't get from reading the packet. could incorporate activities, visuals, lessons (e.g. in the week on dialogue: how do you punctuate dialogue? Tips for what to put in dialogue vs narration? etc).\r\n\r\nmore variation of exemplary authors. got bored of Perec and Fadiman and Strunk\/White\r\n\r\nprompts also were hard to write for if they only had formal guidance like \"use adverbs.\" maybe a big list of potential subject matter, handed out at beginning of term? or just more stimulating prompts",
                "Strength: the weekly lectures were excellent. As someone with little exposure to the English major, it was very helpful to be walked through various examples of writing that matched the topic of the week.",
                "The prompts were great and so were the handouts but too much of class was reading the handout verbatim",
                "The strengths are the frequency of the writing assignments. The weaknesses are many. There appears to be disparity in the experiences with tutors. Some of the prompts feel unserious, either because my tutor made them feel as such or because they actually were.",
                "The lectures could be more engaging, or have some added accountability to incentivize attendance",
                "Strengths are that it feels like a relatively low stakes way to get out of your comfort zone with writing, and to get in the habit of just sitting down to write at any moment. Weakness is just that sometimes its hard to know how much your improving since the focus of the themes changes every week.",
                "id like more diverse prompts and content based prompts !",
                "Strengths - forced habit, clear feedback from tutors, interesting prompts\r\nWeaknesses - boring and sometimes irrelevant lectures, feedback was not in the form of grades so much as general positive or negative commentary",
                "Lectures could be more engaging and stray more from the handout.",
                "Pick a new professor. Don't take it if Ehrgood is teaching.",
                "The strengths are the incredible one-on-one tutoring that allows you to hear from a knowledgeable reader about your work and revise it step by step. Weaknesses are how difficult it can be to muster up the energy to write something good.",
                "The weekly tutor meetings are extremely valuable. They certainly improved the technical quality of my writing, and also pushed me to consider how other people read my work (can readers visualize a given scene, am I assuming readers will feel the same emotion I do without sufficient explanation, etc.). \r\n\r\nAlmost all of the prompts when I took the class focused on form rather than content (I don't think this is always the case). Many were along the lines of \"Write a theme that includes a periodic sentence,\" or \"Write a theme that includes a catalogue of negatives.\" This wasn't all of the themes - others asked for a character sketch, or a monologue, or something more nebulous - but most of them asked for some particular structure related to the focus of the week. I think these kinds of prompts were helpful, they pushed me to think about different aspects of writing, but I wouldn't have minded a few more content-focused prompts, maybe pushing me to write in different genres, or just allowing for an easier time coming up with ideas.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were helpful in that they highlighted various examples of the techniques we talked about, but at times I felt like I could just read the lecture handout without the lecture itself and get almost as much out of it. I don't really have a suggestion for something to do differently, though - having a professor talk for two hours about a general topic in writing might just be a bit awkward regardless of how it's done. The guest lectures definitely felt more focused, though, I think because the professors had particular theories or ideas they wanted to get across, rather than, for example, a general understanding of metaphor.",
                "Strengths: You write every day. Learning by experience is a very real thing, especially for something as abstract as writing. Weaknesses: Lectures felt pointless. Prof. Ehrgood was very interesting and clearly very passionate about diction, but I often felt like I could have just grabbed the packet of examples and read them at home.",
                "Weakness: Although the name of the course is daily themes, and the point is writing nearly every single day, I think I would have benefitted from writing only 3 times a week, instead of the required 5. I usually ended up only having 3 or so pieces I was proud of a week, and around 2 that I just phoned in cause I needed to write about something. Maybe it was just a heavy workload semester for me already and people with lighter workloads enjoyed the 5 days a week, but I would have preferred less. Additionally, while I like that you can write about whatever topic for each piece, as someone who struggles to think of something unique to write about 5 times for 12 weeks, it would have been nice to have some optional prompts to get the gears turning on what I could write about. Strengths: It taught me to really appreciate what goes into writing and how to better read others writing. Not merely focusing on the content or meaning of the writing, but how to appreciate the style and form that the writing takes. The system of meeting with a tutor every week to go over your writing is amazing and has led to a greater improvement in my writing than any other course I have taken at Yale. Professor Ehrgood's inclusion of sources and writers I was not familiar with beforehand was also very cool and good for exposure to different styles.",
                "strengths:\r\ncomprehensive curriculum, extremely engaging one-on-one tutoring sessions, consistency in assignments with an appropriate amount of leniency\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n9am deadline didn't seem too great for morning writers, if it was due at noon, there might have been more opportunity to write in the morning with more time.",
                "Strengths: I absolutely LOVED my mentor and felt that the act of writing every day made my writing improve dramatically. I really liked that the prompts were open-ended in terms of subject matter and focused more on syntax than content. Overall, one of my favorite classes at Yale, if not my favorite class! Weaknesses: The lectures were often not the most engaging (though I loved the guest lecture by Derek Green). While I appreciated Professor Ehrgood's emphasis on connecting the lectures to the prompts, during most lectures, we read excerpts from 10-20+ page packets, and not much explanation was given as to why the excerpts we read were good. I would have appreciated a more standard pedagogical lecture format like Professor Green's, in which the professor gave us clear tools to use in our writing and explained exactly how to incorporate them. More student engagement would also be wonderfulperhaps students could gather in smaller groups and read their pieces to each other, or the professor could give out prompts and have some structured time to write in class. We spent a long time reading X themes aloud as well, which often showcased only a sliver of students' writing and had similar voices\/subject matter; I think the time would be better served if students read the X themes on their own time. Lastly, perhaps having a break in the middle of the lecture period or hosting \"happenings\" would increase lecture attendance.",
                "Strengths: the 1-on-1 tutor meetings! They were an unparalleled experience to really focus on your writing and work closely with someone in discussing it. Also a great course for focusing every day on growing as a creative writer and writing pieces that are personally meaningful and important. To me felt like a very low workload (no readings was great!). I also really liked reading the X themes each week and having a chance to look at other student work\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures often felt useless and were very dry, you could easily write the themes each week without attending or paying attention; experience in the course is very tutor-dependent",
                "The tutor system is for the most part excellent. Each student is paired with a tutor and has an hour per week to meet with that tutor and discuss the themes written the previous week. I had a fantastic tutor, and this made the course experience wonderful. I understand that some other students were not close with their tutors, and this could make it difficult. But I would guess that most of the tutors, like mine, are great. The fact that the course has no special final project or exam is also a strength, I think. But the lectures were definitely a weakness.",
                "Strangths: Teaching fellows were superb and the use of student writings in the weekly handouts was a great way to motivate people.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture felt boring and unnecessary. I went to half the lectures, and when I was there I barely paid attention.",
                "The strength is definitely the tutors and the structure of the course itself. Prof. Erhgood was definitely the weakness. It was clear he cared, but he didn't do a great job in lectures--he tended to drone and was not at all engaging.",
                "The strength of this course is that it gives you time to practice writing, and that's invaluable. Tutor feedback varies significantly, so while some may be helpful, you cannot count on their feedback being at the level of feedback offered by any other Yale writing class. The biggest serious weakness I felt in this class is its lack of discrepancy regarding missed themes and extensions. In this class, late work = missed work. Beyond the allotted 5 skips and 3 late themes, you need a Dean's Extension for late work. This means that when life gets in the way, you need to think about whether your problem can be validated by a Dean within 24 hours to meet the deadline. For every theme you hand in late, you lose a third of the final grade for the class. Perhaps the allotted skips and late themes are designed for you to save for the whole semester until a disaster arises, although no one plans for that to happen and I don't feel that this was how they were advertised. When I became ill, a Dean's Extension didn't cover the entire time I was sick; in my case, while unwell, I grinded out the themes so that my grade wouldn't tank over the course of a single week. Because of the daily deadlines, after a semester of handing in themes, it would only take a week of illness to go from an A to a C+. In any other class, I'd be able to talk to my TF and work out a suitable schedule.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is the writing tutors. If placed with a writing tutor that is a good match, the class can have a disproportionately large impact on your broader academic experience at Yale along with making the class enjoyable",
                "Classes could focus more on content that isn't just on the handouts. Strengths are certainly the tutors which get to know each student individually and can provide very good critiques.",
                "Strengths: I liked most of the prompts, I like that it's a consistent amount of work, most of the guest lectures were cool. Weaknesses: The lectures could ramble a lot and were sometimes hard to connect to the actual practice of writing. But they were generally good.",
                "not many improvements necessary! \r\nStrengths would be the overall format of the course-- I loved that it wasn't a traditional structure, I felt like I learned a lot from taking a class that's so interactive\/incorporated in every day life, without the stress of exams!",
                "Strengths: You get to meet one-on-one every week with a writing tutor, who can encourage you when they recognize places where you have improved. You get to put 11*5*300 ~ 15 thousand words of your thoughts into a built-up collection. Your writing and thinking ability will probably improve because it truly becomes a routine. Weakness: your routine might be writing your themes at 3 am, 5 times a week.",
                "Harriet Bergmann, my tutor for this course, was an absolute bright spot. This year, the course was incredibly technical, taking the joy out of the practice of writing every day. I found myself trying to fit the theme restrictions rather than writing for the sake of enjoying my writing. This is not to suggest that there can't be technical instruction in daily themes  there should be  but rather that the instructions were unclear and the weeks were repetitive in their prompts. Prof Ehrgood spent too long each class reading out the X themes and some of the excerpts rather than explaining why these things might fit what we're trying to achieve or what makes it a good literary device, for example.",
                "The structure of the course is really good in theory. My main suggestion would be trying to adjust the way tutors are assigned. I appreciate that they were random -- I think the random assignments helped it feel less competitive and intimidating. However, my tutor and I were so different in terms of our interests, writing styles, and personalities that it made working together difficult, and I unfortunately did not get much out of the meetings. I know other students had really good experiences with my tutor, and I know of other tutors who I think I would have gotten along much better with. I wonder if there could be a system where students indicate certain genres or subjects they especially like to write, or even certain writers they particularly like. Then maybe tutors could indicate generally what genres or subjects they'd particularly like to teach. Even if the tutors could just request a few subjects they don't like teaching, it would help avoid situations like the one my tutor and I were in (where my favorite subject to write about was one of his least favorite to read). I'm sure it must be really difficult to assign tutors in a way that is fair and non-competitive, and I appreciate the benefit of being taught by a reader very different from your usual readers, but I think it would help a lot of students if there were a way to assign the tutors just a bit more deliberately, or at least to try to avoid particularly opposing pairings."

                "No. This course simultaneously shattered my confidence and destroyed my love of writing. I suppose my writing did improve a bit over the course of the semester, but I don't think I ever want to write again after having taken Daily Themes.",
                "Yes, absolutely!",
                "yes if they want to put time into learning to write",
                "Yes! It's a lot of work, but I think it has been genuinely fun and rewarding. You have no control over who your tutor is which I can imagine being very frustrating if you don't like your tutor. Otherwise, great experience.",
                "It's nice that the work is spread out over every day but it's hard to keep up with the load. I would recommend it mainly because it's a different style of learning than other classes and daily practice is so helpful for writing. It's probably mostly variable due to your tutor.",
                "I am a STEM major and actually really enjoyed this class",
                "Absolutely. If Yale does anything right, it's the English courses. This course taught me not only how to write well, but how to write quickly.",
                "Yes, if you're ready to commit to setting aside time for writing each weekday. There were definitely days that I had to phone it in (ie, crank out a theme in 20 minutes at 2am before going to bed), and in those moments, it didn't feel like I was getting the most out of the class. But the weeks where I was able to set aside time to write and really get into each prompt were great -- I learned so much about myself as a writer, I looked forward to the different prompts, and I could feel myself becoming more comfortable expressing myself on the page. It's definitely possible to do this class without getting a ton out of it, but I'd recommend it only if you're excited and ready to commit to it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course!!!",
                "Yes. Even when the lecture was not interesting to me, the one on one instruction and reflection with my writing tutor was unmatched and very helpful. My work with Professor Gordon made this class worthwhile.",
                "Yes",
                "YES! an amazing course to improve your writing and reflect on everything in your life",
                "Yes, but not with Prof. Ehrgood.",
                "Yes, I would take Daily Themes. You will never have another opportunity quite like it. You will remember what you wrote about and how you wrote for the rest of your life.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely. I would probably caution them that it really is so much work to write every day. It was probably more work for me, comparatively, because I can't simply write every day without obsessing over it throughout the rest of the day. That was important too, though. I am thankful I go to experience what it is like to live a life consumed with words. I hope I can do that again beyond this class.",
                "I would recommend it only if the person has a passion for writing. I didn't, and, while my writing definitely improved, I did not enjoy the course. If anything, my writing was forcibly improved by how much we had to write every week. It sucks up at least an hour of your life five days of the week. I thought we would have more freedom in what we wrote (and we did towards the end), some of the prompts were very picky. If you put in the work, though, it's easy to get an A-, hard to get an A (you have to show \"remarkable improvement\" throughout the semester). Lectures would drag on for a long time. But if you love creative writing, I would say go for it. Everyone else, think long and hard before taking this.",
                "Yes! But go into it knowing that the value of the course will probably be in the work of writing your daily theme. I learned so much more from the process of daily writing than I did from lectures or from meetings with my tutor, and I think I would have enjoyed the course more if I had gone into it with the understanding that this would be true (and that it didn't mean I would have a worse experience).",
                "Yes. I dont care who you are or what you studytake this course.",
                "I went into this class expecting writing every day to get easier -- maybe it gets a little easier, but it never became a part of my daily routine like I wanted it to be. I almost always got to my daily theme at 11 PM or midnight when I wanted to go to sleep and had to write something that I sort-of cared about. I got a lot out of the class and don't regret taking it, but daily really does mean daily, and unless you are really focused the theme will always be in the back of your mind for an entire semester. So, if you're interested in taking the class, take the class -- it is really rewarding -- but know what you're getting into.",
                "Yes!",

                "Yes. But it is a lot of work",
                "I would because I loved working with my tutor and my writing really did improve.",
                "Yup, a different kind of writing class, you'll have a great time if you get a good tutor. 30 mins a week face-to-face is a short time though, imo.",
                "Yes very much. Its such a good class to practice writing",
                "I would because it really helps you become more comfortable with writing and understand what your strengths and weaknesses are.",
                "If you have any desire to improve your writing I would heavily recommend this course! It teaches you how to establish writing as a part of your routine and forces you to reflect on your daily life\/surroundings (and replicate that in writing) in a way that I found really meaningful",
                "Yes! Great if you have the time and space for it emotionally",
                "Yes! But make sure that you aren't taking too many other high-workload classes. This class absolutely killed my sleep schedule (I often had trouble coming up with ideas and then would write on and off from 11pm to 2 or 3am), but I do not regret taking it at all. This class has been invaluable in improving my writing, and now even after the class has finished, I am writing for myself at least once a week.",
                "definitely! if you are interested in becoming a better writer (or reader) and are willing to put in the time (roughly 1 hr every day, 5x a week) to write, I would 100% recommend this class. it has easily been my favorite class at yale so far.",
                "In the class' current state, I would not recommend it to another student. The lectures and prompts must be vastly improved for it to be a worthwhile use of a credit or your time. Take any other English class instead.",
                "No. There are way better creative writing classes out there (ENGL 120,121). I heard such great things about Daily Themes from my friends, but this professor was very different from previous lecturers who taught this class. I disliked many of the prompts and I thought lecture was useless.",

                "Yes, I improved my writing greatly",
                "YES! If you have any interest in creative writing at all, please take this class. This is such a good entry point into the creative writing concentration because it really gives you a broad sampling of different perspectives into writing and it does not confine you to any one particular area. This class changed my outlook on creative writing at this school--I loved it!",
                "Yes! Especially if you like or want to improve your writing (mostly creative, but not exclusively). But Id say for anyone willing to put in the time. It is incredibly rewarding and just fun to write every day.",
                "As long as Andrew Ehrgood is teaching the course, I would not recommend it to another student. I also would be frank with them that there is a possibility they get a terrible tutor, in which case their experience in the class will most likely be awful. I wouldn't want someone to waste their time or their energy on this course if they don't have to.",
                "Sure! Its hard though",
                "Dear God, yes. While you're at Yale, you should make a point to take every Ehrgood course you can. As you might've guessed by the name, the \"daily\"-ness of the course is a bit of a slog, but it's worth it when you see your writing improve throughout the year. The lectures are engaging, the prompts are interesting, and the course overall was one of, if not the best course I've taken at Yale. I cannot recommend it enough.",
                "If you like or want to get good at writing regularly then yes",
                "I think it depends a lot on your attitude (how much you are actually going to invest in your writing vs just cranking something out every day) and who your tutor is (there seems to be a wide range in quality). The class is mostly about the tutor-tutee relationship - if they have good feedback, then I think it is a very worthwhile course.",
                "Yes, but only if you fully commit to the class. If you dont spend a ton of time on your themes, your writing wont improve.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to any student of any major. The skills you learn are applicable to any field and the assignments are fun!",
                "No",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class! Its so valuable to learn to write every day, and fun to have a whole semesters worth of themes to look back on.",
                "definitely. you get out what you put in, so maybe don't take it with a super challenging course load. it is not as rewarding if you're consistently trying to get each theme done as a checklist item. the one on one tutor structure is an amazing way to learn and improve your writing",
                "If youre serious about writing, yes.",
                "YES. If you think you can feasibly spend about an hour daily on writing, take this course. No matter your experience or discipline, you'll become a better writer through it.",
                "If you love writing, yes. If you want to take a class with Ehrgood, wait till he teaches a seminar. You barely interact with him in this class.",
                "I would recommend only if someone wants to write more. Thats the only guarantee from this course.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would for anyone who wants to get out of the normal patterns of writing theyve fallen into.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to improve their writing. It helps with fiction, non-fiction, personal narrative - anything that you write. I also think that the class gives students the space to reflect on their time as Yale students and would highly recommend the class to juniors and seniors.",
                "I highly recommend taking this course, especially with Ehrgood. You HAVE to take a class with this professor at least once in your Yale career. I promise you that you wont regret it.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Absolutely not. This is by far the worst class I've taken at Yale. I learned nothing during lectures. Please please please save yourself the time and don't bother with this class. All lecture is is Prof Ehrgood standing up at the front reading passages of writing he likes. Your experience is also entirely determined by your tutor, and I happened to get a law school student who wasn't a writer. dd",
                "100% yes. I look at writing so much differently now. I have been enlightened.",
                "Yes! But the student should plan to spend a lot of time writing. I think I spent around two hours on this course every weekday, and ideally I would have spent more. I also might recommend taking something more structured first, like English 120 or 123. Daily Themes relies on students to set their own goals for writing. \"Write a theme with a list in it\" is a constraint, and a useful constraint, but it doesn't tell you what your theme should accomplish (e.g. catch a reader's interest, convey a particular emotion, explain the concept of entropy, process emotions around a breakup). Students might want to take a more structured class before Daily Themes, to get an idea of what their goals are\/can be.",
                "I would, because of the writing by experience. There's also not a lot of engagement required. I wish there was a bit more grade transparency  Prof. Ehrgood says we would get an A if we turned everything in on time but I'm hearing of some tutors giving different grades because they feel like it. Definitely adding some stress on my end.",
                "I would recommend it as I really enjoyed it, despite the writing being a bit overwhelming or boring at times. However, I am also a STEM major who had not taken many classes on writing before, and, when talking to my friends that are English majors or serious writers, it seemed that they felt it was repetitive of things they were already familiar with. But for non-English majors I would absolutely recommend it as a good way to improve your writing as well as an excuse to write about those topics that you've always wanted to but never had the time.",
                "Absolutely, if you're willing to put in the work and are passionate for writing",
                "Yes yes yes!!! If you vibe with your mentor, you will have the best time. Take this course to relearn the art of writing.",
                "Yes, if they love creative writing! This course is an awesome way to be committed to creative writing every day, and the 1-on-1 tutor meetings offer an unparalleled experience to really focus on unpacking your writing and receiving input to find and establish your voice as a writer. I would take this course if you love creative writing and are open to writing vulnerable and heartfelt pieces to get the most out of the course, and to feel like you wrote things that were personally meaningful. I think your experience in this course is really dependent on what tutor you get. I was very fortunate to have an incredible tutor (shout out to Rona!), but I had other friends in the course who hated their tutor and hated the course as a result. Also, the lectures are pretty boring and not super necessary to do well in the course. Even so, to me the course was about the writing not the lectures, so I really enjoyed it! Also felt like a low workload because there are no large assignments or readings during the week",
                "I would recommend this course if you enjoy writing, want to write more at Yale, or want to learn how to write creatively. The lectures have nothing to do with your ability to fulfill the assignments well, so regardless of the professor, you can take the course and get a good bit out of it: loads of practice writing. However, if Andrew is teaching, then I can't recommend the lectures themselves. If someone else is teaching, such as Oppenheimer, I have heard that the lectures are great, in which case I could recommend the whole package.",
                "Yes, the wrriting tutors are the highlight of this course. You learn a lot from them and get out as much as you put in. This was also a great course to take senior spring as I now have a collection of writings to look back on.",
                "Yes! Daily Themes as a course is incredible; its such a special way to improve your writing through consistent practice and feedback. I do think student experience varies a lot from tutor to tutor, but ost tutor experiences I've heard have been lovely. I would say, though, that if Prof. Ehrgood is teaching the course again, maybe wait for a different year. He is not the most engaging lecturer, and most people I knew taking the course did not enjoy lecture\/did not find it worth going to. I've heard much better lecture experiences from students who took the course other years with other professors (I have heard, though, that Prof. E is much better in a seminar, so kudos to him there).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if you are willing to put in the work to take it. At the end of the day DT really teaches you discipline and consistency when it comes to writing, which is a skill that I am very grateful I now have.",
                "Yes if you're committed to writing this much every day and okay with working with the provided constraints.",
                "Yes, it's a great class if you have the time to invest into it.",
                "Yes, if you want to be self-motivated and explore writing a lot. If you don't like your TF I think it can be hard to engage with it and people I know dropped it because of that.",
                "Yes! Expanded and bettered my writing, also helped me experience a different type of class\/learning",
                "Yes, but this is a commitment. I would compare it to a language class that meets 5 times a week. It will become part of your schedule. As someone who wanted to write mostly personal essays, write frequently, and receive a little but not too much feedback, I got so much out of this course.",
                "Not with Professor Ehrgood. I was unengaged and felt as if my writing didn't improve very much because I wasn't enjoying what I was writing.",
                "I would recommend that students should decide whether or not to take the course based on their tutor. If you get along well with your tutor and have enough in common in terms of interest and writing styles, it's a fantastic course. However, if you meet your tutor and don't get along well or don't have a lot in common, you should consider dropping the course. It's hard to get a lot out of the class when you have a bad match with your primary teacher.",
                "Yes."
