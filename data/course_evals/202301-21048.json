                "I learned about the racism/sexism built into academic philosophy, specifically in Kant's work. This course challenged me to think about how the field of philosophy can rectify its past wrong and how philosophy students should study philosophical works that have been used to justify racist/sexist thinking.",
                "We learned about a variety of ways to critique the philosophies of Kant, Rawls, and Aristotle from the standpoint of gender and race. I learned how to write a good philosophy paper, how to read philosophy papers closely and critically and unpack them in discussion.",
                "I have put off reviewing this course because I have too many things to say. I have become a better writer and thinker and a more thoughtful community member because of this class. I don't think it was a writing credit, but it prompted me to understand what good writing looks like and to practice writing well more than most writing credits I've taken. The course content was fascinating and varied, and helped begin to fill in a crucially missing part of my education. It was definitely the best philosophy class I have taken. It made me engage the most deeply I ever have with complicated questions of ethics, race, and gender as well as ones about what it means to philosophize and to have a philosophical canon in the first place."

            "comments": [
                "The course was an amazing in-depth exploration of racism and sexism in Kant, but given that the syllabus also emphasizes evaluating Rawls as a philosopher, I would suggest giving more time to discuss Rawls' work. \r\n\r\nThis course was fairly short (time wise), and often discussion would not begin until 30 minutes into the course. We were often rushing to respond to our peers with five minutes left on the clock, so I would suggest emailing handouts and supplementary information before the course so we can come with prepared questions on subjects outside of the reading and with enough knowledge to begin discussion. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, the course treats every piece of work with care and is a great in-depth exploration of how systemic racism and sexism presents itself in Western philosophy.",
                "Strengths: great syllabus, great instructors, loved the classroom setting. We always began our class with check-ins, which really made a difference in allowing me to get to know and trust my classmates. \r\nWeaknesses: a lot of work. Sometimes the instructors would try to fit too many activities into one class session, which prevented us from having more meaningful discussions.",
                "Strengths: the learning environment was very warm, encouraging, and intellectually stimulating. Probably the most incredible part was the amount of feedback we received on all written work (my reading notes, short papers, long paper drafts, and other miscellaneous assignments). I have never been able to get that much personalized, detailed feedback in any class before and it was so incredibly instrumental in improving my writing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it sometimes felt like too much time was dedicated to activities which didn't really pertain to the meat of the course, such as signposting at the beginning of the class, historical context, and learning how to write a philosophy paper. I wish we would have been able to delve deeper into the intricacies of the arguments instead of focusing so much on these other things.",
                "This was such a fantastic class in every way. Really the only negative is that we never had enough time to discuss as much as any of us would have liked to!!  The first, immediate strengths of the class were Steve and Moya. Both of them are excellent teachers and genuinely caring individuals. I have never received so much and such thoughtful and consistent feedback on my work. I have learned so much from that alone. We all had to submit reading notes before each class--something I was initially disgruntled about, but really came to appreciate, because it forced me to come to class fully prepared--and Steve and Moya read and commented on EVERY. SINGLE. ONE., following up after class to make sure the questions I had had in my notes had been answered in class. I also really appreciated that Moya and Steve each brought something different to the table in their personal experiences and place in their careers, their particular philosophical interests, and their opinions on many of the texts we read. While the two of them sometimes disagreed on philosophy and on how things should go, they treated each other with respect and I think they taught very well together.\r\nOther strengths include:\r\n1. The daily check-ins. They created such a warm atmosphere in the class, which in turn helped us have challenging conversations with respect and charity.\r\n2. The course material and range of selections. I feel like I was somehow able to get both depth and breadth.\r\n3. The opportunity for students to share their papers in class, so that we could hear and think about the things our classmates were thinking about.\r\n4. Peer workshopping of the final paper in addition to comments from Moya and Steve.\r\n5. The way in which the professors treated both each other and us students as valued interlocutors."

                "100%. Make sure you are interested in philosophy though because discussions can be very abstract and difficult to follow without some previous exposure to philosophy. The course is very well-organized and you get great, in-depth feedback on every piece of work you turn in from Moya and Steve, not only on the content of the work, but on style, prose, structure, etc. Moya is also great about communicating with everyone in the class if there are any changes in the syllabus or the material. The workload is fairly high for an elective (weekly 2-page reading notes, short papers, small assignments here and there, and a long paper), but they are super manageable as long as you stay on top of all the assignments.",
                "Yes. If you are a philosophy student/interested in this philosophical canon, you must take this course.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Though the workload was significant, it was consistent throughout the semester which alleviated a lot of stress during finals period. There is no other course which looks in such a rigorous and critical way at these canon authors whose less savory writings about sex and gender are often skipped over, and I think this course offers crucial context and introduces a whole new realm of argumentation that every philosophy major should engage with.",
                "This class is what I came to Yale hoping for. It was probably the best class I have taken and will ever take."
