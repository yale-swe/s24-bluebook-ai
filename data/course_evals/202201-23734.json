Though music theory was discussed, prior knowledge wasn't required and application/discussion wasn't isolating.\r\nWeaknesses: Backwards chronological order was the intention but it started to go all over the place towards the end. Understandable, as music chronology is difficult to track, but it can get confusing.",

                "Many class periods felt like interesting show-and-tell periods rather than lectures of trying to get through a certain amount of content, which could be seen either as a strength or weakness. I felt like a lot of the stuff was mine to learn, and I got to decide what things I wanted to look more into, and what things I wanted to write my essays about (again, could be both strength and weakness).",
                "Course works well as a once-a-week thing and I appreciate the low workload but it would be nice to have maybe a listening list to keep us engaged over the weekend the weeks we don't have assignments",
                "Strengths: Lots and lots of new topics!\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it got a bit wordy and technical in music theory, which was cool to hear about but sometimes went over my head a bit."

A lot of people come in interested in the more recent forms of Japanese music, but this class goes further back, and I can see how it might sometimes feel boring to those who aren't really interested in the history of Japanese music.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in learning more about Japanese music, regardless of era. Mostly, the class tended to focus on more traditional, historic elements of Japanese music which was unexpected but welcome.",

                "Yes! It is such an interesting writing credit and extremely enjoyable.",
