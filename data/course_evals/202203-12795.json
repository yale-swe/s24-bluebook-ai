I would have found it helpful to have every lesson and grammar device learned centralized on worksheets in Canvas. Some were on Canvas, but some were handouts in class we had to take a picture of and some lessons didnt have any worksheet at all. This would just make it easier to go back and study for tests and complete assignments."
