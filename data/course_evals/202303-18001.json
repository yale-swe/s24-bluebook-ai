I found multiple possible topics thanks to this course (labor camps, the siege of Leningrad, dekulakization and deportation of ethnic minorities, the building of socialist cities, etc.) and I now have a ton of literature that will assist me with my Bachelor's thesis. There is a lot of freedom in this course for students to focus on what exactly interests them, so use it how it will most benefit your own academic interests."

                "seminar style is great for this class; very interesting readings and topics; Professor is great at leading the class; no obvious weaknesses",
                "Strengths: Nari is an enthusiastic lecturer who cares about the subject matter and wants the class to take away the more abstract and subtle ideas that come from the readings and presentations.\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that the seminar was hamstrung by its size. I get the impression that in other iterations of this course, there was a smaller class size which meant people were more engaged with the material and learning with the professor. As happens with many seminars, the first iteration of students rates the course highly, which means that many other students will sign up next time; ostensibly, this is a good thing, but I felt that engagement with the readings was very low in general which worsened discussions. Furthering that point, I think readings should be shortened in general. I think some weeks, the expectation of around ~200 pages was a little excessive.",
                "I really liked the overall structure of this course.",
                "I believe that more multi-media content could enliven the readings for some cities and help students to get a better sense of their genius loci.",
                "The class is very interesting and unique among classes that I have taken at Yale. I loved learning about the different cities, and I felt that we had strong in-class discussions. I did think that the order of the cities could be revised so that it does not jump from topic to topic so much. As it is, you never really know what you're going to get in class. Also we received little feedback over the semester, so I did not feel that I had improved as a writer very much.",
                "The course is great at bringing together a wide variety of academic fields under the umbrella of different cities, thus providing a concrete example to learn from. At times, however, I felt I was lacking the theoretical lexicon to discuss the specificities of urban planning and architecture.",
                "There are only strengths. The curriculum is incredible and approaches each city from diverse perspectives, so for each city there is something sure to suit every student's interests (there are topics relevant to literally every major here!). Something I think most will appreciate is that there is so much freedom for students in this course to focus on what exactly interests them in relation to these cities (at the beginning of the course, the professor makes this clear by encouraging students to focus their attention on those topics coinciding with their own academic interests). Additionally, and probably most importantly, this is a professor that cares a lot about his students. The professor is very responsive to emails and to meeting in and outside of office hours. The professor prioritizes his students, a rarity in the university setting!"

                "I would recommend this course to anybody interested in learning about the former USSR and about Central Asia. I certainly learned a lot that I had not known before.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. Prof. Shelekpayev is a very fun professor who taught me a lot about a region I had no real knowledge of before. Manageable workload and great readings",

                "Yes, I would. This course is very fun and interesting compared to most other courses taken at Yale.",
                "Depends. I think the right student will find this course interesting, and I think the wrong student will find it uninteresting. The title of the course includes the words Eurasian Cities, this should be renamed to Post-Soviet Cities as that is truly the focus of the course. Personally, I find Soviet history and urbanism to be interesting, and I enjoyed learning about some places that I only knew cursory information about. I think this course in general is less about a holistic approach to learning the cities but more so an approach based on Naris personal interestthe readings in general seemed to magnify those interests. Nothing wrong with that in the slightest, but I felt a little bit like the class was adrift at times, and there was no broader theme or purpose to the cities we were learning about. Again, nothing wrong with that. Im glad I got to learn what I did, but I do sometimes wish there was something greater that I took away from the classmaybe like a way to critically analyze said cities, or finding ways to compare them; just some thoughts that I had regarding structure that I think could improve the course.",
                "Yes! I think this is a great course for anyone of any major.",
                "Yes, highly. This class is interesting, entertaining and eye-opening. I believe any student with an interest in architecture, urban studies, history, or the post-soviet world will appreciate and learn much from this class.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in the former Soviet Union. This class covers a variety of topics about the region, and it is a low-pressure environment for practicing discussion and writing. There is a lot of space for people to explore their personal interests, as well.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who do not know very much about Eurasian history and are interested in learning more.",
                "Enthusiastically, yes. This was my second class with this professor, and from my experience I can say for certain that any class with Professor Shelekpayev is sure to be an incredible experience. The most important thing for me (and I think for most students) is that this is a professor that genuinely cares about his students. He is one of the only professors that I know of who makes it a point to reach out to his students outside of the classroom to make sure they're faring well in the semester. He makes sure that each student comes to office hours at least once for check-ins, encouraging us to come as often as we want and reminding us, sincerely, that his door is always open to his students (he'll even make you tea or coffee, and to this date, this is only the second professor I've met across multiple institutions that has ever cared to offer his students tea and coffee. An incredibly kind gesture, other instructors take note!). Regarding the course itself, each city covered is approached from a diverse range of perspectives, so there is something applicable to every major here. Students are encouraged to focus on what they find most interesting about each city and in the readings. There is a short lecture portion at the beginning of each class followed by a seminar style discussion led/ directed by the professor. There is no midterm, only a presentation and a final essay. The presentation is about a city not listed in the syllabus (your choice) and you are free to do this in any style (either creative, or academic, for example, one student made a documentary about their city which was absolutely stunning)."
