He asks probing questions, invites us to reconsider our opinions, is really candid and actually very funny. The seminar probably also hinged much on the seminar dynamic, which was pretty amazing this year! I really enjoyed everyone's perspectives. I particularly enjoyed the selection of books. They seemed a random assortment at first, but are definitely books I want to keep on my bookshelf and revisit over and over again!",
                "Doing all the readings is unrealistic. However, the emphasis on studying a different biography each week is effective in making students aware of the range of styles and perspectives on writing biographies. Professor Gaddis facilitates meaningful discussions around historical figures and the study of history while also guiding students to produce high-level, well-written historical papers.",
                "This course requires a lot of reading. A lot a lot of reading. But I also wouldn't get rid of it. It might be helpful to encourage students to relax a little more about reading every word. It's a whirlwind course, but it is so well-taught, and Professor Gaddis gives great insights and fosters student growth. He expects a lot, but that is a definite strength of the course."

This course inevitably seeps into everyday life  the weeks of the semester are partly defined for me by the biographies we read  and it requires deep self-reflection. It's the kind of Yale course that makes you a better person. I'd be careful not to take it with a super busy schedule, but Professor Gaddis is lenient if you ask."
