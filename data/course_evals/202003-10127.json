                "The course started off poorly because everyone was under the impression we would be attending class once a week given the fact that it was a half credit course and in prior years it only met once a week. We were told from the very beginning they were trying to make it a full credit in the future, but that just left everyone frustrated with the fact that we were doing the work of a full credit course and only getting a half credit for it. We also never received any feedback on any of our final versions of our assignments, which was extremely frustrating. We did have some fantastic speakers throughout the course though and they did try to gear the speakers towards more BME industry related topics, which was nice.",
                "Great speakers, some of the lectures were too long and drawn out though",
                "Andre brought in some wonderful speakers during this course. I wish we had the chance to hear from them earlier in our Yale career. I would also have liked a little more diversity in area of industry that the industry speakers were in; perhaps some SynBio, immunoengineering, etc. but I thought this was pretty well-distributed.\r\n\r\nOne assignment, I think, would have been an adequate workload for this course as it's a half-credit senior seminar. But I guess labs are a half credit and triple the work. Perhaps we could do weekly discussion forums instead of working on assignments. I didn't feel like the presentation assignment was particularly helpful, as I'd written multitudes of presentations (technical, slide decks, etc) before this class so really didn't benefit from it. I did end up having a good time with the topic, though!\r\n\r\nI also think that Andre would talk unnecessarily to fill up the space at the end of the lecture sometimes.",
                "The course had pretty interesting guest lectures and the assignments made sense. The teaching staff was also pretty invested in the course.\r\n\r\nThat said, a 0.5 credit class should not meet twice a week, like this class did. The course also did not have enough material to fill in all of these meeting times anyway, as during many classes it felt like the professor was purposefully filling\/wasting time to ensure that students stayed until the end of the period. Also, there was bad communication on assignment deadlines, especially early on in the semester, where expectations for presentations were explained only a few days before a preliminary deadline (not a huge problem). The diversity\/variety of guest speakers was fairly strong and each on their own were very interesting. However, I should mention that there was one or two weeks where every guest basically advocated for the amazing strengths of starting one's career in consulting, and this message just seemed a bit repetitive after some time (especially since this is a BME class).",
                "I absolutely loved the guest lectures. I thought they were interesting and super helpful to me in determining a path after college. However, on some of the days where we did not have a guest lecturer, I felt that we were just meeting for the purpose of meeting, and not to actually learn new information. Some of these days were helpful, but definitely not the majority. I felt this class could easily have met only once a week, especially considering it is only a half of a credit.",
                "Nice to see different perspectives and get practice writing and talking about BME. \r\nThis course should be 1 full credit (weekly hw + two class meetings per week!). We should have all gotten a full credit for this.",
                "This course was good in that we had the chance to work with people in our major and learn from each other's ideas. The weakness of the course was that at times virtual lecture could be a bit dry and not as engaging without more interactive components.",
                "This class was half a credit but met twice a week. It didnt really teach me anything I didnt already know as a senior BME major that hadnt been already covered multiple times in other required classes. Also confused as to why we had such an extensive final paper for a half credit class. Also lectures felt like we all knew there was no substance being taught but we all just had to sit there and let the time run out as we spoke about random BME related topics."

However, the extent to which we were told to have our cameras was extremely frustrating, given the fact that some people may be in a virtual learning environment in which they are uncomfortable having their camera on. I think it would have been helpful to find a better way to suggest prior to the first class that people should have their cameras on because even those who may have been granted permission must have been uncomfortable given how often we were told to turn them on.",
