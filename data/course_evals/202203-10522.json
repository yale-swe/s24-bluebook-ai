                "I learned more about post-tonal music theory, serialism, and various ways of analyzing modern music. Having studied classical piano masterworks for most of my life until this point (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, etc.), the course marked a natural progression in my musical education.",
                "I learned many new ways to analyse music including set classes and its associated operations, L\/P\/R operations, uses of augmented chords to quickly change keys, and much more. They were forms of music analysis Ive never thought of and I found them pretty compelling and worth diving into more.",
                "I learned about LPR, more about Roman numerals, 12-tone serialism, pitch classes, and much more! The class kept me engaged in learning more about music theory as well as some music history that added on to the lessons."

                "It depends. I would not recommend this course to students who like to seek help from teachers frequently, and I would not recommend this course to students who will expect very thorough and detailed instruction. I would recommend this course to any student who does not fall into the above categories and wishes to learn more about post-tonal music theory.",
