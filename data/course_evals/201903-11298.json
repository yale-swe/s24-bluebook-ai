    "The first half of the course covered some advance probability topics and an introduction to the probabilistic method focusing on various different strategies to approach the problems. The second half was student presentations, so the topics were varied, but were more focused on specific fun results and applications.",
    "mediocre knowledge of \"the probabilistic method\" as taught by one poorly written textbook.",
    "I learned to use probabilistic proofs in combinatorial contexts. Lots of random graphs (and # of triangles in random graphs), concentration inequalities including Azuma's inequality, and just showing existence of objects using probability.",
    "None",
    "Probabilistic Method,  applications of methods of probability and statistics in pure mathematics.",
    "Learned a little bit about the probabilistic method, but honestly nothing stuck besides material I've already seen in other classes.",
    "I learned a bit about the probabilistic method and its application to several different areas of mathematics. Through our final presentations, I improved my ability to explain complicated math, especially proofs, more clearly and precisely.",

   "comments": [
    "The material is very interesting and professor Vu is a great lecturer, it was also fun to see the topics classmates chose to present on.",
    "as the culminating course in the math major, this class is just depressing. I can't think of a single strength. As far as weaknesses go, it would be that the class is not set up for us to learn anything: the lectures in the beginning were okay but no different from any other math class I've taken. to call this a seminar is a joke. i don't know what I was supposed to gain from this course, but whatever it was I didn't gain it. If anything, I feel like this course should've improved our presentation skills, but that was not the case. The grading structure was bizarre, we received no rubric or really any instruction on how to deliver a presentation before they started.",
    "The course is good as it is. I like how it ended a bit earlier than the semester. The quizzes had a nice combination of straightforward questions, and questions which were a bit tricky.",
    "This is a pretty work-free class. Just a couple of pretty easy quizzes and presentation. Not much more to be said about it.",
    "This class is pretty useless as is. I learned a little during the first (lecture-based) half, but not having homework assignments meant that I didn't learn anything very well or in a way that will stick. Hearing other people present was cool, but we got no guidance on how to actually give a math presentation, so overall, I'm walking away with no skills or knowledge.",
    "The strengths are that the workload is very manageable (you only have to study for 2 quizzes and then prepare your final presentation) and you have many options to choose from for your final presentation topic. One weakness is that even though it is supposed to be a seminar, the course is treated just like a math lecture, but with fewer students. The only interaction between the professor and students is when a student asks a question, and there are no opportunities for discussing the material as a group in class. Another weakness is that there is no syllabus or information about the class online, and the Canvas page, which was only used to send emails to the class, was not set up until a month into the semester.",
    "Van Vu should be replaced by a faculty member who is able to teach the course. The second half of the course should have far more structure, and there should be homework to supplement the in-class material"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are interested in the material. I found the topic very fun but it is narrow so if you don't like probability or combinatorics it might not be the right fit.",
    "no, but if you're a math major you probably don't have a choice. honestly, if you have any research, you should probably go for the thesis. the reviews are right that it's zero work, but sitting there every week was...sad.",
    "Yep, a pretty interesting topic for a senior seminar.",
    "I'm putting my answers to all the questions here because it's the one that appears first on CourseTable (saving you a few clicks, folks). So, just to answer your first question, which is \"is this class actually as bad as it's rated?\"last year it was below a 2....yikesI must say that the answer is NO. I did not think this was a bad class. (I didn't think it was a good class either, which is why I rated it 2, aka \"fair.\") The first few weeks are taught by Van Vu, who is a fairly uninspiring yet perfectly adequate teacher. He doesn't add emotion or color to the class in the way that people like Stefan and Pat do, but he's pretty solid on the details, decent at answering questions, and has nice handwriting. (I've only had four math professors here, from best to worst: Stefan = Asher > Van > someone else. I would place Van third only because the first two were SO good, not because he is bad by any stretch of the imagination.) The only caveat is that it's all about combinatorics and graph theory, which I think is the worst part of math. Note that, not surprisingly, if you don't like this stuff, you probably won't like this class much. That is the main reason that I didn't particularly enjoy it, but I think you like discrete stuff you might actually have a lot of fun here.\r\n\r\nThe obvious question as a senior is one of thesis versus seminar. Obviously I chose the seminar so I can't directly speak to the thesis experience, but if you asked me \"do I wish I'd done the thesis?\", I would answer unequivocally YES. I chose not to do the thesis because I was under the mistaken impression that you have to actually do some \"new math,\" i.e. write a paper or prove a new theorem or something. This scared me because I never did SUMRY or anything and so I was basically like \"what if I can't actually do that?\" Well, good news: you don't have to. You can do a \"literature review\"-type paper or presentation, or exhibit a few existing proofs and connect them in some way. This has the potential to be even easier than this already very relaxed seminar andmore importantlyway more interesting, because you can actually choose a topic you care about. Just something to think about.\r\n\r\nHere is the entire amount of things you will have to do for this class: two quizzes, counting for a cumulative 20%, and a presentation, counting for 80%. If you've learned anything as a math major, you will read this as \"only the presentation matters,\" which is true. So don't totally screw yourself over by not preparing! The great thing about this class is that there is zero work for it, but when it comes time to actually present the thing you're doing, you need to make sure you know what you're talking aboutVan will ask you questions as you go, including some that you are probably not going to be prepared for. Fortunately, that's all you have to do! Other than that, just relax and watch the other people's presentations. Inevitably, a few will be excellent and a couple will be trainwrecks (again, don't let it be you). The majority will be somewhere in the middle: usually, what happens is that the person is clearly knowledgeable about the topic but the topic is way too complicated to adequately present on in 35 minutes (yes, if you weren't aware they are that short). This means that you get incredibly lost partway through and start zoning out, not because of incompetence on the lecturer's part but just because they are attempting to explain something that literally cannot be condensed into that period. NOTE TO YALEsuggestions on how to fix this: (1) be clear about how sketchy we can be with proofs (Van said a \"proof sketch\" was ok but then got annoyed when people left out details.....), (2) have longer presentations (granted this only works if the class is smaller), (3) be more intentional about the topics to ensure that they can fit in the space of a ridiculously short lecture. On the whole, not a terrible class, but I'd say ... do the thesis if you have the choice.",
    "This course is probably a little more relaxed than a senior essay, so I would recommend as a 5th class if the student is taking a lot of other more work-intensive classes.",
    "You probably have no choice, but just be warned that this class with Professor Vu is really bad. If you have econ experience, maybe consider the econ\/math seminar. Or maybe write a thesis.",
    "I cant see anyone taking this class unless they have to for their major, so this doesnt really matter, but despite its many weaknesses, I actually feel like I got something important out of this class. After the past few semesters, Ive started to feel like I just wasnt that good at math, but that changed after having the opportunity to spend hours studying just one specific topic for my final presentation. I learned that while I dont grasp the concepts as fast as most of the other people in my class, I still have the capacity to understand if I put in enough time and effort. For this, and only this, I am glad I took the course.",
    "Absolutely do not take this course. I recommend that all math majors write a senior thesis instead--I wish I had chosen to do so"
