                "Professor De La Rocha was amazing! He made the course very engaging as he encouraged participation but in a very organic way. He always knew how to spark a discussion and understood cues for transitioning topics. The class was always lively and I believe the course would not be the same without him. I really enjoyed the class-wide discussions on books and readings, as I felt like they always had a purpose and were related to the syllabus. I believe that in the future, more breakout discussions could be used to have more peer-peer feedback.",

                "One strength of this course was the various angles from which the concept travel was examined.\r\n\r\nOne part I thought could happen more was a bit more interweaving between different readings and topics. This interweaving was definitely present in our class discussion. However, I did crave for a bit more. Since we covered so many readings, we couldn't analyze each and every sentence of those readings. I don't think this badafter all, we did get to read about diverse viewpoints. However, a bit more time spent on each reading may be nice."

                "Absolutely! The course is full of entertaining gems that really allows one to reflect on the role of \"travel\" in our society. The small-class format really allows discussions to flourish and I enjoyed learning from my classmates. Professor De La Rocha was so concerned about the well-being of his students and left me no doubt he wanted us to succeed amidst the global pandemic. I had never taken a writing seminar before and this was definitely the highlight of an overall very difficult semester.",
                "I highly recommend taking this course with Professor de la Rocha (or Danny as we all came to know him). He is very knowledgable in travel writing as a genre and he leverages these insights incredibly well in our discussions about readings. I also thought the reading selection was exquisite, especially for someone like myself who had not previously read anything travel-related; I also found myself becoming a better reader (weird as that might sound coming from a Yalie) and much more proficient in analyzing texts through a variety of different lenses and perspectives. If Danny is teaching the course, I cannot recommend it enough! You will find yourself fascinated by all the nuances you encounter in your readings and class discussions, and I think the course is the perfect introduction to both the genre and the skill of writing effective essays in college.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in travel and loves thought provoking discussion. (and wants to improve their writing skills tenfold).",
                "As long as the student is interested in the topic of \"travel,\" I definitely recommend this course. The readings were diverse, exploring the idea of travel from multiple perspectives and from different times. The readings supplemented each other, and the essay prompts challenged us to think about travel with varying depths and angles. This course was definitely my favorite this semester."
