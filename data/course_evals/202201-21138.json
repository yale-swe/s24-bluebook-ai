The time devoted to each was just right, and no individual topic was ever overwhelming or boring. A wonderful overview of Russian sci-fi and its context in Russian culture\/lit in general.",
                "I learned a lot about Russian science fiction but also some Russian history and a bunch of vocabulary and grammar.",
                "My Russian vocabulary significantly improved throughout the semester, particularly when it came to the niche topics we studied.",
                "Insight into the history of Russian science fiction and fantasy, building vocabulary, and essay writing in Russian.",
                "I learned Russian language, grammar, punctuation through literary works.",
                "Exposure to and greater understanding of the science fiction genre in Russian literature. We covered many interesting pieces and films, spanning the whole 20th century and discussing a range of topics, including extraterrestrial life, dystopian worlds, and, most importantly, what it means to be human."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Relaxed but engaging pace, interesting content, very generous grading, inclusion of everyone in discussion, diverse readings\/movies. Lots of interaction with peers. Strengths far outweigh any possible weaknesses. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The homeworks can be a bit dry at times. Prof also assumes everybody has a pretty advanced grammar background which isn't always true. Could also spend a bit more time on some of the texts as we sometimes just read a few pages.",
                "I thought this was a great L5 language class!",
                "The course is taught wonderfully. The readings and movies are good. One thing that could be improved is that we would often find out about our tests only a week in advance. It would be nice to have the dates at the beginning of the semester.",
                "The strengths were that the course had very interesting content and class discussions.  It was also very structured and had a packet for each class, which were great notes for review.  The essays topics were also very flexible and the process for reviewing and corrections was very helpful.  I can't of a way the course could be improved.",
                "The works that we did were all interesting. I would have appreciated if we could have done fewer works and instead gone into them fully with a deeper analysis.",
                "Strengths: content. Pieces and films chosen were incredibly interesting. Wow. Absolutely beautiful works of literature. Another strength was Professor Selemeneva. She cared so much about her students and the topic. \r\nWeaknesses: I didn't feel like I was internalizing some of the vocab \/ grammar content we went over. It was great that we went over it: we did many vocab exercises and we went over the grammar rules where we made the most mistakes in our writing, but I tended to forget the information soon after we went over it, and only reviewed it briefly before the exam. Also, our class didn't like to share much. Doing more fun activities and mixing up pairs more often could help bring people out of their shell and make a more interactive, exciting classroom environment."

                "Definitely. Great advanced Russian class. If you have even a remote interest in Sci-Fi this class will be engaging. Placed in context of Russian culture and history. If you are a heritage speaker like me, I think this is the perfect class. Wide range of skill levels among students, and the professor does a great job promoting inclusion and equality.",
                "I would recommend this class if you're a strong reader in Russian. It's a science fiction\/fantasy course, so a lot of the texts you read use vocabulary that you won't have seen in previous courses. The class included vocab lessons and highlighted specific words, but be prepared to work through some difficult readings at times (not a ton at once - it's a very reasonable work load).",
                "Yes! It was incredibly well-organized and interesting. We covered a very interesting breadth of material and I definitely think my Russian has improved!!",
                "I would recommend this course to a fluent Russian speaker.",
                "Yes! Interesting course because it covers a breadth of works (from literature \/ short stories to film) and varied assignments allow to practice and improve on different aspects of Russian language.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in taking a Russian language course focused on literature and film.",
                "I would only recommend this class if that person is either a Russian language student, as a good amount of Russian knowledge is required.",
                "Yes. The pieces and films that this course covers are so incredibly interesting, and the professor is super knowledgeable and cares about her students. It's not that much work and not difficult to do well."
