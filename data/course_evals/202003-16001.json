You learn how to model different styles of writing (i.e. using german fairy tale specific grammar and vocab).\r\n\r\nIn general, I learned a lot about fairy tales obviously (and there's so much more to learn than I knew!). Each week we discussed different themes, such as authors of Fairy tales, religion, violence, family relationships, the portrayal of women, etc.",

The creative tasks were quite fun, and all expectations for the assignments were communicated well. I loved my research project, and I liked how it was so open -- it let me do whatever I wanted.",

The course gives students the opportunity to learn about a certain style and usage of German, rather than just modern-day German, and this was appropriately challenging and also expanded students' flexibility within the language."

I learned about so many things I never even considered, and it gives so much perspective to the stories we read and tell today. The fairy tales themselves are fun to read, the class itself is well structured and moves quickly, and all of the assignments are purposeful (there is never any \"busy work\"). This class DOES require time and energy, but Theresa never expects (and never would want) you to compromise your happiness and health for it.",
