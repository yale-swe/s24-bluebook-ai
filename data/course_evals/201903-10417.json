    "Learnt how to use the various machines available in the woodshop. Learnt about wood, its different qualities and characteristics, gained a better appreciation for the work that goes into woodworking, extracting wood, and any related wood info. I also became more appreciative of the different woods we have, and how processed some are, and also how different raw wood is. \r\n\r\nFinally, I gained a new perspective, and learnt to visualize my projects and aims better.",

    "Fun to work with wood, and learn all the new tools and instruments there are.\r\n\r\nBut it has little structure, and as a newcomer i at times felt lost, and a bit discouraged because I didn't know just how much I could do even with the little knowledge I had. I wish there was a bit more guidance in each project.",
    "It's a great course, I think everyone should have a go!",
    "The main strength and the main weakness of this course go together. I thought the amount of freedom in the course was a huge strength; I never felt creatively constrained by the course's deadlines. However, such freedom made the class feel very disorganized; I never felt I could rely on the syllabus' schedule or even what the professor said we would do next class."

    "Yes, its a fun class, interesting, and cool skills to be learnt.",
    "Absolutely, take this class to make for a challenging but rewarding 5th credit!",
    "Yes, but don't expect to be able to get through the course without putting in hours at the woodshop. The work itself is never unenjoyable, but it can be time consuming. With that being said, learning how to think and create as an artist is pretty cool, and I think the class is worth it for that alone."
