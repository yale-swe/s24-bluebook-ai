Additionally, conducting peer evaluations was beneficial, and I particularly remember how all the members of the class worked together as a team for our project.",

                "The strengths of this course are as follows. \r\nFirstly, I believe there is great value in implementing and creating what we learned in the lectures directly. Being able to apply the knowledge practically and see it come to life was highly valuable. \r\nSecondly, it was excellent that we worked towards a project goal, and I think this will continue with the submission of our papers in the future. Thirdly, the peer evaluation assignments provided a practical glimpse into the work of doctoral students and professors, which was highly beneficial.\r\nOne drawback of this course was that the total number of participants was somewhat small. I think it would have been more enjoyable if we had a greater diversity of team members while working on the project.",

                "I think the strengths and weaknesses of this course are both tied to how it was implementedas our class was small, we were able to form the class in a way that fit our interests. This is incredible as we could focus on the specifics that might be applicable to our other research (all students were graduate level). Unfortunately, it also meant some lack of cohesive message throughout the course. That being said, the course was very engaging and interesting, and I would recommend taking it once offered again!"

                "I highly recommend this course to other students. It's not often that you get to experience hands-on learning and practical application of what you've learned. Many courses tend to focus solely on programming, but this course goes beyond that by providing an opportunity to work on real projects. As someone aspiring to become a robotics engineer, this course sparked numerous questions within me. Particularly, the professor's question on the first day about what soft robotics truly is not only challenged my understanding of soft robots but also made me contemplate what robots are in general. Moving forward, I will continue to study and conduct research while contemplating what constitutes a robot and what kind of robotics engineer I aim to be. This course has not only covered course material but also encouraged proactive thinking, making it an enjoyable and engaging learning experience.",
                "I strongly recommend this course to both graduate students and undergraduate students who wish to learn soft robotics. The lab session is EXTREMELY FUN and HIGHLY REWARDING. My strongest recommendation.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, for the sole reason that professor Kramer-Bottiglio is a joy to work with in any capacity. She led us through the garden of soft robotics, allowing us to sniff the roses when we wanted to. I hope that this course gets offered again in some capacity!"
