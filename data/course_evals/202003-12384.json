                "The course did an adequate job of touching on key topics in game theory, but the papers discussed were generally decades old and incredibly dry. I think this course would have benefitted from better signposting of important vs unimportant material within papers.",
                "We cover a lot of papers, which was good for learning about dynamic games and various models. A weakness is that assignments did not have rubrics, and so grading is somewhat worrisome. Also maybe having more low-stake assignments as opposed to a few high-stake assignments would be better.",
                "The professor is very approachable and always helpful and detailed in her responses to questions and comments. Great guidance given during presentation preparation which helped students internalize content and pick out key points of the papers.",
                "I really enjoyed the opportunity to learn about the game theory literature through student presentations, but I would have preferred more lectures.",
                "I think the greatest strength of this course was the interactive\/presentation-style format whereby students would present a paper each week. This really forced us to dive deeply into the material- so much that we could present it in our own words. However, I do wish this was balanced better by a more thorough covering of the basic theory in addition to the presentations. By the middle of the semester, I felt kind of lost in all of the presentations and would have liked to spend more time on the game theory concepts and theory behind them as well. I definitely missed\/did not understand a few of the concepts up front which led to greater and greater confusion over the course of the semester."

But student presentations can be quite dry and boring, and discussions sometimes aren't that fruitful as not everyone reads the papers assigned. Hopefully Prof AS can make the discussions more engaging by discussing more of her own thoughts on the issue-at-hand, rather than leaving it completely free for all.",

                "Yes, though I might recommend that interested students consider taking another course in game theory first if they do not have a decent understanding of the material already. I found it somewhat difficult to take this course as the only game theory course I've taken. I would also caution prospective students that this is not an \"easy\" senior seminar. To get the most of this course, you need to read and understand difficult material carefully."
