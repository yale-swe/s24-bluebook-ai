                "A major strength is its ability to fully immerse a student within the Korean language. From the beginning of class, the only language spoken--aside from clarification questions--is Korean. Although this can be stressful for some, it's important to understand (and you'll see if you take this course) that NO ONE fully understands everything said in class, and that's perfectly okay! If anything, it is expected! Otherwise, why are you in this class? Enroll for the next one! Coming from someone who's learning/knows 4-5 languages, just make sure to participate by taking notes and asking questions. Trust, you'll grow with time.",
                "- There are no weaknesses to this course. It's fun, the workload is light, content is easy but helps you learn a lot.",
                "Discovering a new song every week kept the class exciting, and gave everyone something to look forward to. There were only two main assignments, and the homework assignments could be quickly/easily completed. The class wasn't stress-inducing at all. I don't think there were any real weaknesses of this class--maybe we could have had more time to have one-on-one discussions with our classmates in Korean but considering the class is conducted entirely in Korean there was already a lot of immersion.",
                "The strengths are the amazing Professor Lee, the small student size, amount of time we have dedicated to students' questions, and the flexibility we have for our projects."

                "I highly recommend this course to another student because Professor Lee-Smith is very warm, engaging, and helpful when she gives you feedback. The discussions in the class are a fun way to continue learning Korean, and I found myself picking up more vocabulary by using it to speak on topics covered in the course.",
