                "By reading good writing, I became a better writer. I kept an ongoing list of writing techniques I wanted to try and was able to practice them in our discussion posts twice a week. I learned about myself in reflecting on relationship with my family members. I also used the space to share experiences I hadn't felt comfortable discussing before.",
                "How to write attentively and with care about my family, as well interview skills.",
                "Really explored my family and my relationship with my family a lot more in depth than I had ever before",

I learned a lot about creative and personal writing and felt so much more confident as a writer after the course through my own writing process, but also through learning from other writers.",
                "I improved my writing skills tremendously and read various pieces of writing that presented different writing styles.",
                "I learned a lot about myself. I mean, I learned a lot about family and writing and all, but this class encouraged me to gain insights into my self and how I wanted to write in the process of working through this material.",

                "I learned how to write, express myself, and think creatively. this is the best class I have taken at yale and would 100% take it again. Professor hopper is brilliant, compassionate, kind, and makes the class not only a learning experience but fun and enjoyable.",
                "A deeper examination of my own relationships with my siblings and my parents, as well as how I feel about those relationships. It was a good incentive to confront those emotions which I've been too scared to actually think about. Also, effective communication on other people's creative writing.",

Some reading topics felt redundant, but it turned out to be cool to see how different authors write about the same event. I'm sure a lot of my peers might write that the final paper was rushed, but I really like how mine turned out.",
                "Strengths: the kindest and most compassionate professor and course assistant, the community of writers and support you receive, the range of pieces about family, watching and analyzing movies together\r\nWeaknesses: none, just a little crunched due to the nature of YSS",
                "Amazing professor and TA, very engaging",
                "I love how central peer editing was in this class - it really helped me feel closer to my classmates and more engaged with everyone's work! I also loved the guest speakers!! I can't even think of a weakness",
                "Strengths: Dr. Hopper and Minh; the class structure; the readings; the writing assignments; extremely thoughtful feedback on every assignment; pretty much everything.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "I think the strength of this course was the community the students, Professor Hopper, and Minh were able to form. I really felt encouraged to explore as a writer and a lot of personal reflection I experienced this summer was prompted by this class. One of the weaknesses of this class at first, though it changed over the semester, was how office hours took place. No matter how nice a professor or course assistant is, I find it intimidating to set up office hours when there is no scheduled time. Offering some set office hours is something that I wish all classes did.",
                "zoom fatigue! i really enjoyed some of our chat only discussions; i also wished we did more writing exercises",

                "I have no complaints. For an online summer class it was very well organized and I felt so happy to have gotten to learn so much from it.",
                "Strengths: fantastically arranged, especially over Zoom. Course content was organized in innovative ways, such that it was easy to stay engaged. Course content was also super interesting, and insightful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none! I loved this course!",
                "Amazing class, cant name a weakness. A strength is having your peers give comments and suggestions about your writing."

                "Yes! This class was an amazing experience. I didnt feel worried about grades, and because of that got to learn and write for myself. Though I should say only take this class if you are ready to address childhood trauma because you will end up talking about it.",

                "YES YES YES!!!! One of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale - the Professor and the TF's were incredibly understanding and articulate. They all helped me so much with my own writing while also upholding the most positive and accepting environment that I've ever experienced at Yale.",
                "Yes. This class is phenomenal and it is another great community within Yale itself. The assignments are great, and the professor and TA are amazing. This is possibly my favorite class I have taken at Yale so far.",

I really enjoyed it, Professor Hopper and Minh are great, the readings are interesting, etc. It's a great place to grow as a creative writer and as a person. The workload isn't too heavy and Professor Hopper is really understanding about deadlines.",
                "YES, no hesitation. This class will totally change the way you think about writing. You'll leave the class a more confident writer. The environment of this class is unlike any other I've ever taken--it fosters a beautiful and supportive community over the course of the semester.",
                "Yes! take this class, it will only change your life for the better.",
