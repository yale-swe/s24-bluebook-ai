    "I learned so much about writing a screenplay. I've realized that potentially I want to go into screenwriting and making movies. This class has completely changed the course of my career.",
    "It's definitely a good introduction to the world of screenwriting!  I learned so much - not only how to write an actual screenplay, but also how the industry is structured, etc.",
    "I learned that I can in fact write a compelling screenplay! I developed insights into what a screenwriter must think about. What they must consider both when writing a screenplay and when living life.",
    "I learned about films as an art form. I learned to appreciate what makes a great filmSo great,Either with dialogue, cool shots, or character development.I also learned the correct format of the screenplay.Then I got to write my own screenplay and workshop it with the class.",
    "I learned about the difference between writing for the page and writing for the screen.",
    "This course enhanced my understanding of the screenwriting process.  It improved my ability balance complex characters.  The course also strengthened my ability to deconstruct screen plays and identify both good and bad writing choices.",
    "Through in-depth analysis of classic films, Professor Lapadula teaches you how to watch films and notice their structure, the development of characters, and how they build suspense for the audience.",
    "An understanding of screenwriting formatting"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths were everything that was taught during class time. Marc is so passionate about screenwriting and that passion really translates to inspiring us to create better work. The weaknesses were that we often went 30 - 45 minutes over time -- almost every class. It was a bit hard to stay focused that long.",
    "I think the course does not need to be as long as it is in terms of class length.  Most of the time, we seemed to run out of topics of discussion after about two hours, and the extra time was filled with Professor Lapadula telling stories.  This was always fun, as he is a good storyteller, but it seemed silly for the class to be so long when there was not enough content to fill it.",
    "I felt that it would have been nice to do some kind of in class writing assignments. The midterm folder really snuck up on me and I had wished we had talked more about pitches and coverages etc.",
    "Strengths were that we got to write our own screenplay. I feel like I learned so much from doing that. It was also really cool and helpful to watch clips of great movies. One weakness is that the professor kept us really late after class almost every time.",
    "Great teacher, Great content.  Great class.  Little I can think of to improve the class.",
    "The strengths are the ability for Professor Lapadula to facilitate meaningfull discussions where everyone's voice can be heard. I would have liked more time to be spent describing how to actually create meaningful character arcs and less time watching them develop in successful films.",
    "Strengths- professor, relevance to current events, setting up smaller groups to discuss work \r\nWeaknesses- too much time spent showing and discussing movie clips rather than talking about screenplays and successful writing (character, story, plot), outside work was focused on full length scripts and no emphasis on short scripts like the ones we were asked to write"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely. My favorite course that I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, but it is different than other writing workshops I've taken.  Marc is strict on formatting and gives much harsher (although sometimes vague) criticism of rough drafts than most other writing professors at Yale.  He knows what he's doing, so the feedback is helpful, but it's not the open, welcoming environment of a typical Yale fiction writing course.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes I totally would. You'll learn a lot about writing and about yourself.",
    "No. I wish that the classes were more structured (and that the professor spent less time telling stories about his life) and that assignments were spread out weekly and not bunched around the midterm and final.",
    "Yes. It has high general interest value, but it was still quite challenging,  You have the opportunity to watch lots of films and read actual full length screen plays, as well as write our own screenplay short.  So, it was a lot of work, but also a lot of fun.  And, post class, I will write my next screenplay with confidence.",
    "Yes! This has been the best course I have taken at Yale. So fulfilling, such a different style of writing, and Marc is a really interesting and kind professor.",
    "I would recommend it during the regular semester, but not for Summer Session. I feel like there are cheaper and more targeted classes that could be taken to get good  at screenwriting. There is an advantage to the smaller working groups though."
