                "Absolutely not. As much as I liked professor Monero as a person, this is by far the worst class I have taken at Yale. After taking Gen Chem lab, physics lab, biochemistry lab, and orgo lab I really thought that this would be a fun way to improve my lab technique. I was very wrong. Trying to understand what was expected of us in the lab reports was exceptionally difficult. While thorough, the lab report guides provided were EXTREMELY unclear. For example, for the drosophila lab, the lab report guide said that 4 different things were the hypothesis we were testing. If you are reading this, you should avoid taking this class at all costs. Seriously, unless this is legitimately the only class the works with your schedule, do not take it. The one redeeming quality was that the final was fair and pretty fun. Other than that, the rest of the semester was extremely unpleasant. \r\n\r\nTLDR: ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS."
