This course expanded the concept for me in a way I did not expect and allowed me to see how infrastructures are both influenced and influential.",
                "This course fits together so many topics that I touched on in previous HSHM courses but never had the chance to fully explore. I thought it was intellectually stimulating and taught me how to find the connections between themes and re-organize my view of colonization and infrastructures.",

                "This is one of the most well-run seminars I've ever taken. Leslie clearly cares about her students' learning and structures discussions so that everyone is engaged. Unlike other seminars, she doesn't waste time with over-long summaries of the readings or mini-lectures, but she provides very helpful insights and fosters very insightful conversations. I think the final assignment was new this year and the guidelines were a little confusing at the start of the semester, but it wasn't too much work and was an interesting premise. Readings are generally quite good.",
                "Strengths: The course had a good range of readings that allowed us to explore infrastructures well. The seminar setup was good because it allowed us to have insightful discussions and feel more comfortable sharing.",
                "Strong teaching staff and it was great that Leslie and Faith also participated in the class discussions rather than just asking questions. It was great that the class was facilitated each week by different groups so that we all could do a very close reading of at least one of the works. I also enjoyed that my classmates weren't hesitant to push back on each other's ideas/arguments (though very respectfully) and bounce ideas off of each other. The only improvement would've been a little bit more guidance on the Fulbright Proposal.",
                "The course was effective at developing student ownership over the course content and discussion. There could have been more variability to the seminars with different mini-exercises and approaches to facilitation.",
                "This was probably the best-run seminar I've ever taken at Yale. Leslie has created the most truly collaborative learning environment I've ever encountered, where students were consistently responding to each other's ideas directly and meaningfully rather than just speaking to the professor, and where I really felt like I learned as much from my peers as from Leslie. I think it made a huge difference that Leslie put so much emphasis on us learning each other's names and citing each other directly in the reading responses. The use of small discussion groups also really encouraged collaborative thinking. The one major weakness was the final assignment, which was a Fulbright proposal. I think it was a really cool idea, but I don't think the parameters of the assignment were explained fully enough at the beginning, so I started off choosing a topic that was a bit impractical as a grant proposal in that I didn't know the necessary languages and had little background in the subject, and then was stuck with that topic for the rest of the semester. I was able to write a good proposal in the end, but the process was overall a bit confusing and stressful because I didn't totally know what I was doing. I also think it might have been helpful to go over some of the example proposals in class at the beginning just to have a good sense of the scope of the project for people who are unfamiliar with applying to grants. That being said, now I've written a Fulbright proposal and have that skill and experience to bring into future projects. Hypothetically I could even apply for a Fulbright grant with what I wrote for Leslie's class, if I had chosen a more practical topic earlier on.",

                "Yes! 100%; it's a great course since students come from a variety of disciplines (i.e., anthropology, HSHM, history, AFAST, MPH, etc.) plus I feel that at the end of the course, I was truly viewing how I interact with institutions and things differently.",
                "Yes -- this course offered a new and intellectually stimulating analytical approach to political and economic concepts I had encountered previously. We learned to analyze the world around us, but also think through transformative strategies to make the world we want to see.",

We got to dip into so many diverse and interesting case studies, and using the framework of infrastructure completely changed how I'll look at the world from here on out."
