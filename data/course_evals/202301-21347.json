We covered all the important material and as I leave the course, I feel that I have a really developed understanding of the theory behind all the economic concepts we learned, not just that I can regurgitate an answer I learned in class.",

                "The lectures were information and to-the-point, but they were relatively dry. I would have liked to see the professor make a better effort to connect the material to modern-day economic events",

It is very fast-paced, and I found it is very easy to fall behind with the material.",

                "Yes, mostly if you want to take higher level economics. It's not like a cool history class where you'll be wowed just by the course itself, it's much more of a low-key building block. Not that it's bad, it's just not fun or exciting.",
                "yes, the small setting is really helpful when you want to make sure you can engage with the material",
                "I just don't like econ that much I think, so take it with a grain of salt, but no I wouldn't. I don't think this class contributed very substantively to my understanding of the world/life nor did it teach me a useful skillset. I think those two reasons are the best reasons to take classes. This was overcomplicated abstractions of what seems like inaccurate assessments (or at least oversimplified) of human decision-making. If you're taking econ as a major, I suppose you should take this class, it's probably a necessary prereq, and I hear other econ classes get more interesting and concrete. But I wouldn't recommend this to fulfill QR requirements.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Reiche was an amazing teacher who always came to class with excellent slides prepared to teach us.",
                "Yes under the circumstance theyd be okay with a B, as thats the average grade! I learned a lot, but at the expense of many mistakes.",
                "Yes. I have never taken an econ class. This was a good well paced introduction",
                "Please dont take the seminarit might seem as a engaging way to digest the material more thoroughly, but the competition is fiercer and you cant really be off your game at any point in the semester.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student, whether they wanted to learn more about devision-making or economics generally. It's a good introduction to both!",
                "I would only recommend this course if the student in question had a high level of interest in the subject, as the workload and material can be challenging.",
                "It depends. If you have been exposed to econ before or feel confident in your economic abilities, then yes. A lot of the information will probably be familiar to you. If you have never taken econ before and/or do not feel economically inclined, then no. I found that the people who tend to take this class have all already taken econ in some measure in high school. The curve will not be in your favor. From what I understand, the lecture is better in this regard.",
