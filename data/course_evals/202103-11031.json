                "Better understanding of all the different types of grammar, and I really thought that I improved in my knowledge of how to say different things in different situations.",

I also developed a deeper knowledge of french culture across many french speaking countries whereas my knowledge of french culture was previously limited to just france."

                "I think the approach of expanding through reading texts worked really well. Connecting vocabulary to a narrative and to a greater context beyond a simple definition really helped me remember the words and seeing grammatical constructions being used helped me to better understand and remember how they work. \r\n\r\nOne weakness is that I didn't feel like I got as much practice with speaking French. There was a lot less opportunity to speak in class in this class than in the previous two levels of French at Yale, and I don't feel like my speaking skills improved very much even though I'm certain that my reading skills have.",
                "I think all FREN courses (at least in my experience) are very heavy workload-wise, but I feel like the amount of work can sometimes take away from my ability to process the new things we learn in class.",
                "The one thing I believe could be improved is the manner in which quizzes are administered. I think it would cause much less stress on the students' end if we were warned about being tested on a certain grammar concept a day in advance.",
                "Strengths: Madame Koizim is an absolutely amazing professor, she teaches in a very clear manner and is almost always accessible by email if there are any questions. \r\n\r\nPoint of improvement: although I really enjoyed the class, 2 hours of homework every night on top of meeting everyday was a bit excessive. I do recognize that this allowed my French to flourish, however.",
                "Strengths: Professor absolutely AMAZING!!!! Get to know classmates relatively well. Professor really understanding if students get sick, need a mental health break, etc. \r\nWeaknesses: Was online, so some of the speaking portions of the participation felt like it wasn't able to come out as naturally as it could've been in person (but the reasons I COMPLETELY understand why it was online, and I'm glad it was)",
                "This course is a lot of work with at least a few hours of homework each night and tests every few weeks. It is very strong in reinforcing the language, but speaking practice can be lacking in a class larger than 8 students. There is a lot that is covered between grammar, vocabulary, writing, speaking, listening, and reading French, and it is a credit to the course that each of these things is taught extensively.",
                "The strengths of this course are how much students are able to speak during each class and how much grammar we learn and are able to apply. Another huge strength is how much Madame Koizim cares about her students and how available she makes herself to help everyone. One of the weaknesses would be the pop quizzes."

                "Yes, I would recommend taking this class specifically with Madame Koizim if possible. Just be prepared for the huge time commitment that this class requires in order to do well.",
                "YES!!! Thought I would just say in general, language classes are really catered to specific people. If you don't even like learning language, then taking any language class might not be really interesting. However, Madame Koizim, is SUPER ENERGETIC and ALWAYS makes learning French really interesting and engaging. So, honestly, if you don't even like learning French, this would be the perfect class to take just because the Professor is so great at keeping uninterested students somehow interested :)",
                "Yes! Taking this course means a student will learn mass amounts of grammar and be able to implement it so soon. A student will also learn so much about french culture, and will get to read so many interesting stories and watch really good movies."
