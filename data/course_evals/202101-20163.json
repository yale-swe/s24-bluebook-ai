                "Most of the readings themselves were very interesting and our professor was very encouraging with questions. The class is great for a discussion space, even if you don't know much about postcolonial literature. The readings and papers together, with the timeline we were given over Zoom, were a lot. This was definitely my most challenging class this term, but would probably be less challenging if it were in-person due to its early start time, number of readings, and the number of deadlines we had.",
                "I think this course is just incredibly difficult to design. Because its somehow supposed to provide a survey of  the entirety of world English lit in one semester an impossible task. There was so much that we did not read in this course, but thats kind of unavoidable. I think I gained a lot from the texts we did read.",
                "Our class size was particularly small (6 people), so it was a very intimate discussion setting that really facilitated sharing with each other interesting things we noticed, common trends, etc. Professor Mukhopadhyay's feedback was definitely also a huge plus. During seminars, she wouldn't mind stepping in and clarifying things that might have been awkwardly or incompletely phrased by students, and she also put forth a lot of her own views when students disagreed or when she thought that we were only seeing one side of the picture. I definitely improved my thinking and writing as a result."
