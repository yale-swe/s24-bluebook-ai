    "I learned a considerable amount about the subject material, as was to be expected. I learned about the interplay between Wahhabism and politics in Saudi Arabia, which was fascinating. I got to learn about some countries, like Bahrain and Qatar, that frequently are not extensively explored in most Middle East survey classes. Moreover, I learned how to formulate a concise and effective research question. The class was also exposed to archival research and general tips on research methodology. The course was exemplary for its combination of historical information, research exposure, and high quality of instruction.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of Islam, the great powers, and the history of Persian Gulf states. I learned how to better incorporate archival material into historical research, and also learned about political theory frameworks that could be applied to the history of the Gulf. In general, I became a stronger writer and a more well-rounded historian.",
    "This course was great for an in depth study of the history of the Persian Gulf.  It was also really useful as an introduction to the Yale library system and doing archival reserach.",
    "Learned a lot about the politics and history of the Persian Gulf",
    "I learned about the history of the Gulf. I also learned how to do primary source research."

   "comments": [
    "The course was extremely strong and fantastic. There was a considerable amount of work, particularly with the final assignment and the original research component, but that may be necessary in order to achieve the academic aims of the class.",
    "I think the archival assignments were super helpful, the balance of polisci and history was well-struck, and the readings were interesting. I can't really think of any major improvements I would make to the course.",
    "I loved the archival research aspects of the course.  It was great to be able to connect our class lessons to the archives.  I think there could have been a little more time spent from 1955-1995 and perhaps a little less in the beginning of the class.",
    "I enjoyed the seminar format because we got to hear Prof. Macris's unique insights that he gained from living in the Gulf. However, as with all seminars, there is the problem that sometimes the conversation gets taken over by one student."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this course is fantastic. Professor Macris is a fantastic professor with a considerable amount of knowledge in the area of study, both as a practitioner and as a scholar. The material we studied was fascinating and novel to me, with insights that apply to the current state of affairs in the Gulf evident in every class.",
    "Yes absolutely. Prof Macris is a fantastic and very knowledgeable instructor. The best class on the Persian Gulf that I could hope for.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, because it does a really good job of giving you a ton of historical information and then providing the best tools with which to analyze it. If you are interested in the Middle East, you will definitely find this course interesting and well-thought out.",
    "Yes, this was a great way to start using Yale Library as a resource for research and feel comfortable writing a research paper using archival methods.  You'll learn a lot about the history of the Gulf.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course because the other courses on the Middle East at Yale tend to gloss over the Gulf, so this class fills in that gap."
