I also became much more comfortable with the essay writing process and developed a system of preparation and outlining that set me up for success."

                "The course was very enjoyable and engaging.",
                "The strengths of this course were the teaching, both in lecture and in seminar, as well as the high level of discussion. The main weakness of this course is that we go through the texts so fast that it's difficult to fully engage with some of them.",
                "Strengths: The connection of topics studied with current events, the continuity within the course, and the feedback on submitted work were all very good. Professor Smith was very good at both providing his own knowledge and encouraging us to make our own insights during class discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The amount of time spent on the later works in the course wasn't enough to have as good a grasp on them as we did with the earlier works, though I don't know how much there is to be done about that.",
                "The syllabus is excellent and the mechanics of DS work like a well oiled machine. If I had one complaint, it would be that it's that the course is really not at all about history but much more about political thought. We read Herodotus and Thucydides, for example, not at all to learn about the arc of the Greek story and entirely to talk about ideology. This is fine but maybe we could get a little bit more historical understanding in addition to the philosophical angle.",
                "This course was strong because the content was very interesting and the professor was engaging. However, the digital format obviously lends itself to some drawbacks with student engagement.",
                "The books we read were for the most part interesting and felt extremely relevant\/applicable (especially Thucydides and Tacitus). The biggest weakness of the reading list is that some books felt more suited for philosophical analysis than for studying in Historical and Political thought. However, this is a weakness of the curriculum and not Professor Smith or his teaching.\r\n\r\nI also thought the conversation could flow more smoothly and students could be encouraged to build off of each other's ideas. It often felt that Professor Smith would ask a question, 2-3 responses were offered and then we would move on. I would prefer a class where we guide the discussion and it's more free-flowing to allow us to discuss the things we find fascinating. I also think it would feel more gratifying if students actually discussed each other's points rather than throwing out their own interpretation.",
                "The syllabus is a strength of this course. I enjoyed the works and felt that they were all worth reading, and although I found myself more engaged by the Greek and Roman authors than with the later texts, that's just my personal preference. The subject matter of H&P is generally broader than the other two DS sections, which is a strength in that the seminar conversations can explore many different topics, but also a weakness in that it is easier for the discussions to feel unfocused at times."

I also loved that, for the first few weeks, we had a weekly zoom \"open house\" which was a non-class time where we could all discuss what was on our mind. \r\n\r\nProfessor Smith didn't usually watch the lectures and sometimes wouldn't be aware of what we already knew but that wasn't a big issue.",

This is not strictly a history or political science course, but rather an examination of the development of intellectual thought in those two disciplines. I found it very interesting to note the difference in values between the classical and medieval worlds and our own, as well as the valuable insights they had about different systems of government and the causes of conflict."
