My biggest issue is that the instructors can vary pretty wildly in difficulty, and sometimes it can feel like your professor, rather than your learning, determines your grade.",

It would be great to see fewer texts treated in the DS Lit track, with more time and attention given to each one."

Take Directed Studies: Literature with Jan Hagens not because its Directed Studies: Literature, but because its with Jan Hagens. Of all the professors Ive had at Yale, he is the kindest, sweetest, and the most fun. Take his section!",
