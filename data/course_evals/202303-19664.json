                "Strengths:  really puts in an effort to make class a fun and engaging place to learn Chinese. There are a lot of opportunities to practice your oral skills and the quizzes / tests are really helpful for learning new vocabulary.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of",
                "I think having class everyday is both a strength and a weakness of the course because it helps you practice the language often and improves your memory, but it also is a large time commitment because you need to take time every day to do the homework, and there are multiple quizzes to study for every week. I think the course could be improved by moving the asynchronous day to friday",
                "Love the asynchronous day, super helpful to study for the friday exams and also good to do small projects, review material, or other assignments without having to come in that day for another class. Would love to have another asynchronous day for the course. Strengths is good organization, bad is lots of work, but that is how you practice.",
                "As a language course, it was incredibly heavy on speaking and writing. I think that with the weekly quizzes, we were given ample opportunity to practice writing words. In addition, the lesson readings were very real-life-centric, so the phrases we learned to read and write were quite useful. I think that the homework is where most of the learning and improvement occurred, as they were repetitive (in style) but useful exercises. Perhaps one improvement is that we could be given more opportunities to practice speaking.",
