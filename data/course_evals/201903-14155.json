   "comments": [
    "Strength - we learned a lot of cutting-edge stuff\r\nWeakness - we sometimes went over very complicated topics somewhat superficially, leading to a lack of understanding.",
    "The structure of the course was great (giving\/hearing presentations from other students mixed with informative lectures from the professor was a good format)",
    "This course is truly special. Professor Vazquez really cares about her students, and you can tell that she put a ton of effort into designing this class. The assignments are all well made and give you hands-on exposure to ROS, neural networks, and classical CV techniques. The structure of the course is probably more conducive to graduate students, but the final project and paper presentations were actually amazing ways to dive deeper into each of the topics. The only weakness of this course is the pacing. This class is not easy. It's significantly more work than other survey courses like CPSC 470. I can almost guarantee that you'll be working on assignments during Fall break and Thanksgiving break, so if you do decide to take this course, I would keep that in mind. All in all, however, I really enjoyed the material, the lectures, and the assignments and learned so much more than I thought I would.",
    "LOTS of work but also learned a lot",
    "Very useful knowledge, presented broadly",
    "Weaknesses: A better curriculum and lecture schedule would help a lot. The lecture materials were all over the place and lacked a cohesive theme. Many of the lectures were \"Student lead quote\" and were on a seemingly random papers that had no unifying theme. The professor-led lectures were similarly disparate and did not build upon each other, but rather ambled between different topics that the professor found interesting.",
    "I liked the variety of engagements in the course (i.e. paper presentations, psets, and project), but I feel like to really get an in-depth understanding I would like this to be either a project or pset only class. The problem sets were rushed in the beginning and then the project was rushed at the end.",
    "I liked the Kalman filter and deep learning problem sets. I learned a lot from both. I didn't find the first three problem sets to present any intellectual challenge whatsoever, although they took up a lot of time. I also think that the late day system is broken. I think it should more closely model the systems in other classes, like 422, where you don't need to notify the teacher in advance of your use of a late day."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Read the syllabus; if you are interested in the topics, you should take the course.",
    "If you are interested in robotics, definitely take it",
    "I would highly recommend this class if you're interested in AI\/ML\/HRI\/robotics. This class is very practical, and you get a chance to work on a project of your choice at the end of the semester. Note that this is very different from other courses in the Yale CS department, which focus on the more classical approaches to each of these topics.",
    "I certainly would, but with the caveat that you will get out only as much as you put in! Professor Vazquz is super smart and an engaging lecture, and manages to cover a lot of different interesting content. If you skip out on lecture, only show up for presentations, just do the psets, then I think it'd be possible to get through this course with a sizeable amount of effort but minimal reward attained. One further note is: the vast majority of the problem sets deal with a robotic development platform called ROS, and it's a bit of a learning curve. The psets are all interesting, but if there's just a handful of things from the syllabus that you're really interested in, make sure that getting used to ROS is one of them. Definitely: shop this course. You'll have a good amount of freedom to engage with it in the ways that you want \/ challenge you best.",
    "Absolutely; wonderful introduction to relevant topics in computer science",
    "Yes, I would. It's a great introduction into higher level AI concepts.",
    "I would not. The course is not taught wellI left the course feeling I had not learned anything new. The PSETs do not teach you much and just require a lot of googling and reading library documentation to understand various robotics libraries.",
    "If you are interested in robotics\/AI related topics that are more current, I would recommend.",
    "No. Don't take this class. Half of your class time is spent listening to student presentations on important publications in the robotics + AI + HRI space. Listening to a 10 minute presentation on a 10 page technical paper is simply not a good way to learn. You will get, at best, a hand-wavy notion of what the paper is about. It's not expected that anyone read the papers that others are presented. Even if you wanted to do that, you probably wouldn't have time given the amount of other work the class requires. My biggest gripe with this class is that there is no final exam or evaluation of your knowledge of the info that Professor Vazquez lectures on. There's no incentive to pay attention in lecture. At the end of the class, you will feel like you have no understanding of topics that are covered quickly and never heard from again.\r\n\r\nThe first three problem sets are absolutely useless. And that's 3\/5 of the problem sets. It feels like the purpose of the psets is to learn ROS, the Robotic Operating System. Learning a new framework or programming language isn't knowledge that it feels like will be useful in the long-run. You can pick up ROS in a week if ever you need to. The bulk of the interesting material in the class (more of the deep learning and reinforcement learning) sees only limited treatment in the psets. I would have loved a problem set on reinforcement learning."
