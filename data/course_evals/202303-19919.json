                "Became much more familiar with Victorian poetry as well as the history of the Victorian poets themselves, improved my analytical writing",
                "More knowledge about the history and context of Victorian literature and authors; better ability to analyze Victorian poetry",
                "I got a broad survey of Victorian literature (mainly poetry) through the lens of love and desire as a thematic throughline.",
                "I gained much more insight into the analysis of poetry and how to read through and draw common themes out of the dense language of Victorian Literature. I especially zoned in on how to analyze poetic form and deconstruct the parts of a poem, searching for significance or authorial choice in the rhythm, meter, word choices, and more of a poem. It was especially interesting to dissect pieces alongside biographical elements and the literary models/ popular themes of the era.",
                "I have such an appreciation now for poetry of the nineteenth century and also for aesthetic and art history movements of the time that we learned about alongside the texts.",

I particularly enjoyed learning about the Victorian social dynamics through our studies  it made the course particularly fun! In my opinion, there is no better way to understand the culture throughout a time period than to understand the social dynamics between artists.",
                "A wonderful introduction to 19th/20th century poets and authors who covered themes of love and desire. A truly remarkable selection of works that were always engaging and delightful. Flexible essay prompts and great discussion."

                "NO WEAKNESSES. This was the best english class I have ever taken. Every strength you can imagine for a course, apply it. (Also prof Levine is super funny, which makes the course x10000000 better)",
                "The biggest strength is Prof. Levine. She really loves the readings she's chosen for the syllabus. Her sense of fun is infectious.",
                "Strengths: prof Levine, the syllabus \r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of",
                "Strengths: light reading load, good set of texts, chill class discussions, the overall themes in the course were easy to enjoy, Prof Levine does a great job giving an interesting history/background for each author AND she's funny\r\nWeaknesses: 9am was TOUGH to be engaged for all of class, sometimes I wish there had been more time for peer discussion and a more clear class structure, I'm not the biggest fan of analyzing art so the two mandatory class visits we had looking at art were not my favorite",
                "Strengths: Pretty good syllabus, good variety of readings and authors who I hadn't heard of. Prof. Levine was engaging and presented the material well - visual aids were especially good. I also liked the trips to the art galleries, which were highly relevant and well timed for our readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion sometimes felt stifled or aimed toward a specific conclusion or way of thinking about the literature. I  didn't feel like I was building or improving my reading, writing, or discussion throughout.",
                "Strengths: EXCELLENT Professor. Professor Levine is incredibly engaging, witty, and very well-versed in the course's content, and she made every class a delight. Professor Levine found ways to make the subject matter more approachable to students and fueled fascinating discourse on the pieces she assigned for us to read. The syllabus' selection was also very well-developed, approaching a wide variety of both prominent, widely-known Victorian authors and more obscure names with equal integrity. I also appreciated the class visits to the Beinecke, YCBA, and the YUAG. The seminar format was also very conducive to discussion, and the course's intimacy was a wonderful aspect.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would prefer less poetry on the syllabus and more prose for greater variety, but that is personal preference.",
                "All strengths, no weaknesses. Professor Levine is fantastic. She is a talented seminar leader and gave thorough and interesting background on the authors, their historical contexts, and their literary receptions over time while still leaving plenty of time for group discussion. The readings were also just great--often I felt like I wasn't reading for an assignment, and I was just reading for fun. I loved writing the online discussion posts (just four over the course of the semester); it was a great way to think more deeply about a text without necessarily committing a midterm or final paper to it. Even with her ADUS commitments, Professor Levine went out of her way to meet with us for office hours and discuss the course and our essay ideas. We got to go to the Beinecke, YUAG, and Center for British Art (even though it's temporarily closed!) and we got to see so many relevant paintings and handwritten letters up close. Everyone in the class was dedicated to the course. It's a testament to Professor Levine and to the course content that we were all so engaged, even in a 9am class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Levine is a wonderful seminar leader. She provides just enough context and direction to keep us on track without dominating the discussion. The syllabus was also well-curated. Also, I LOVE Professor Levine's no technology policy. Everyone was so focused, even though it was a 9am class! Weaknesses: none",
                "The only weakness was that there were too many people in this seminar for such a small table and small classroom. The overall vibe and discussion would be improved from capping the number of students at 16 (or something similar).",
                "The readings for the course were fun and diverse. I looked forward to reading them each week.",
                "Strengths: The readings were fabulous. I cannot overstate how amazing the selection of readings was. PLUS visits to the Beineke archives, YUAG, AND YCBA. Professor Levine offers great context at the beginning of the discussion and is generally brilliant I love her humor and her ideas are spot on.\r\nWeaknesses: Fairly average class discussion -- clear that classmates engaged with the readings but not on a very deep level."

                "Absolutely. One of the best English classes at Yale. It always felt like enjoyment was the priority. Lots of smiling and laughing in class (partially due to Levine being a great professor, partially due to many of the readings being ridiculous in the best way).",
                "Yes! The pretty light reading load and interesting set of texts make this a good English class. If you're not a fan of poetry, don't take this class because big chunks of it were reading poetry, but I really enjoyed this. Professor Levine makes Victorian literature and the history around it very engaging, and she told really fun stories about the authors that brought the class to life--something I don't think you get in most English seminars",
                "Not really, unless you haven't had much exposure to Victorian poetry and want a decent survey of it.",
                "Depending on their major and their year- this course functions excellently as a junior seminar, but I found it difficult in relation to my classmates because I did not have a strong foundation in analyzing poetry or much practice with the subject matter. I would recommend taking after Readings in English Poetry I or a similar course, but it depends on one's level of familiarity and comfort with poetry.",
                "100%. The class was so much fun, and I learned a ton. Professor Levine is wonderful. If you're at all interested in poetry, understanding the nineteenth century better, learning gossipy tidbits about the lives of the authors, or just having a great time I highly recommend taking this class.",
                "YES! One of the best English classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Levine is an amazing seminar leader. If you're on the fence, this is your sign to take it!",
                "YES!!!! If you can get into this class, take it! Professor Levine is absolutely wonderful. She would start each class with presenting the life of the author/poet and giving historical context, which was really interesting and helpful. She facilitated a fascinating discussion every class. She is also secretly one of the funniest professors. I have so many fond memories of this class. Truly, it made the 9am class-time a little less painful. We had a great group of students. You could tell everyone loves what they were doing!",
                "Yes, absolutely. The material was super fun to work with. This is an amazing 18th/19th century course for the major.",
                "Yes! 100% If you're looking for an English class that you're going to be excited to attend every other day (even at 9 am!!!) then definitely take it. The readings are moving and delightful and make writing the essays more fun than a burden. Professor Levine is kind, smart, and goofy class was always very vibrant and energetic. We often laughed at the drama between many of these writers who existed in a quasi-friend group."
