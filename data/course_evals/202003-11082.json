                "Strengths: during class, you speak almost the entire time which helps you repetitively practice the vocab, grammar, and pronunciation. We also did some karaoke which was a fun way to learn as well :)\r\nWeaknesses: This class requires A LOT of your attention. You have to be very engaged and spend time studying and practicing the kanji, vocab, and grammar. There is a lot of homework (kanji and grammar worksheets, listening\/reading comprehension, Writing practice, speaking drills) which is assigned nightly as well as nightly kanji quizzes. It definitely is a lot and can be stressful, but it is very rewarding when you look back and see the progress in your language abilities.",
                "This course was really excellent; I always looked forward to going to class, knowing that it would be fun and I would learn a lot. So, this class has very few areas for improvement: only two that I can think of. First, we didn't learn a lot of kanji. I found myself studying kanji in my own time because of how little kanji we were learning in class. Second, we didn't practice a lot of impromptu speaking. The drills and classroom discussions were always very structured with specific grammar structures we were expected to use. Thus, if we're ever asked to speak to a native speaker, we may have some trouble due to our lack of practice in impromptu speaking.",
                "I believe that I improved my speaking greatly but my knowledge of kanji definitely needed improvement.",
