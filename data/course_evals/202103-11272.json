I also learned about how social factors like race, gender, and status have impacted crime in the past, and in different countries. I have learned more about the process of trials in court and about subjects like drama, death, and performance in the justice system. I also learned different forms of writing like response papers and such.",

                "I learned how to read more complex documents (from primary sources to journal articles involving legal and\/or historical jargon). I also learned how to think more critically about what I was reading for the purposes of making meaningful contributions to class discussions as well as how to write historical papers.",
                "I greatly developed critical thinking skillsparticularly related to analyzing the criminal justice system in European countries and America. I learned much about the role public pressure and societal expectations play in influencing our concept of \"justice.\" There were also plenty of pivotal readings completed throughout the course: Crime and Punishment (Dostoevsky), Discipline and Punish (Foucault), On Crimes and Punishment (Beccaria), along with countless others. You learn to view the idea of \"crime\" from an objective lens and discuss with other peers.",

            "comments": [
                "The readings were sometimes too long, not enough time to get through all the readings occasionally. Class was taught well.",
                "Some strengths of the course are the small class size because everyone is able to have a voice and speak about what they are feeling about or want to discuss about the readings. Also, everyone is able to learn from each other in terms of what they got from the readings. A weakness in the class is sometimes it is too discussion-based because sometimes it would feel like there is no more to talk about and the conversation is more so being forced at times. It could be improved by having specific teachings at times so we could actually learn about the topic from the professor more.",
                "I think that the discussion part could be more structured.",
                "The course talked about a wide variety of topics concerning crime and punishment. It was very unstructured and it felt like the professor assumed you had background knowledge of the law making the readings and discussions hard to follow at times. The course could be improved by taking time at the beginning of the course to explain the mechanics of a trial and modern law practices.",
                "I think our professor was very knowledgeable about the subject of our class and was very receptive to student ideas, both in guiding discussions and in selecting reading materials. Almost all of the reading materials served as good fodder for in-class discussion, in which a good portion of the class became involved. Our professor would also provide helpful guiding questions or would explain any concepts that might have been misunderstood or overlooked in the assigned readings. I also enjoyed that the focus of the class was not on the American justice system (for the most part) but rather covered other legal systems with which students would likely be not as familiar. \r\n\r\nAs is likely the case with many seminar classes, there would be days where the discussions would drag a bit, or it would not be clear how to move forward. At the same time, sometimes discussions would have to be cut short because of time constraints. However, I think that this is also dependent on the group of students in the class (as the primary means of learning is through discussing the assigned reading material).",
                "Strengths: The content is quite interested and the end-of-term mock trial was very exciting and entertaining. There is also quite the array of different assignments, so you really hone your historical writing skills.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is very discussion-based (as are all seminars), however, sometimes only one or two students would actually engage with the material and the rest of the class would just listen without contributing much. The discussion were aided by the professor, although often students were left repeating themselves or unsure of the expectations of a seminar. This may be due to heavy reading that was often presented (although, manageable). Assignments were also somewhat unclear; we were given a book guide at the beginning of the semester that taught us how to write different types of assignments however you were always left almost half-guessing the expectations since the professor did not give his own instructions.",
                "Strengths: Writing is spread out over the semester, expectations are clear, some readings are very engaging \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not especially rigorous, few students do the reading",
                "I think that varying the types of classes that we had from purely discussions to other formats might make it easier for more students to engage with the course materials.",
                "This course could have greatly benefitted from more structure, as I felt the class as a collective was sometimes confused about the inclusion or discussion of certain readings or the overall topical direction of the class. It would have been really helpful to have some kind of introductory lesson to each main concept or idea within the semester sprinkled in throughout. Many of the readings were fascinating (Medieval Iceland, Lizzie Borden case, Durkheim, Lombroso) but many felt unnecessary or did not really enrich my overall understanding of the course subject."

                "I would recommend this course to another student if they really enjoy discussions and reading, as well as the topic of crime and criminal justice. This is because the topic itself is really interesting and the class is structured to allow you to reflect on readings and discuss about them. However, if reading isn't something you like to do and you don't feel engaged with discussions, the class would not be for you.",

I would certainly recommend this course to another student, with the caveat that they have an interest in law and\/or the inner workings of criminal justice systems.",
                "It depends. I came to Yale absolutely fascinated by the American criminal justice system and its caveats, but after this course I'm quite disillusioned with Yale's history department. I feel like I did not learn that much through this course, although I diligently completed all the readings. I would recommend shopping it, but it was a very \"meh\" course. The mock trial was definitely a redeeming factor but the overall class expectations (and the general lack of student participation) ruined the experience for me.",
                "I would recommend this course!",
                "If the student enjoys literary discussions then yes. Otherwise, I might recommend a class that is not as heavily based on discussion.",
                "If another student expressed interest to me in understanding foundational criminology, forensic psychology, or even legal systems around the world, I would probably direct them to some of courses offered in the legal or ER&M departments. Those interested in reading Russian literature of the 19-century era would probably be better suited to take a lit course or one from the actual Russian department, as I feel the class structure didnt give justice to Crime and Punishment.",
                "I would recommend the course to another student only if that student has a strong interest in law and the history of legal classifications of crime. Otherwise, I would advise not enrolling in the course."
