It made bioethics much more topical and the content evolved throughout the semester, allowing us to discuss the progression of cases through the Supreme Court as well as future implications.",

Professor Latham's book selections were riveting, and getting to listen to his reflections on the issues they raise, as well as grapple with ethical, legal and political questions with classmates during seminar discussion, has been a highlight of my semester and Yale education.  Absolutely take this course; it is stellar.",
                "Strengths: The books and articles we read were really interesting and often surprising. Hearing Professor Latham's thoughts and reactions also offered important insights.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Latham tended to lecture for the majority of class meetings, and there was little discussion among students.",
                "Great discussions",
                "The format of the course as a seminar based on weekly books is strong and enables a lot of discussion. Professor Latham brought in a lot of current events throughout that increased engagement and made the course more flexible.",
                "This course was very strong in discussing current issues with the addition of some historical context. The field of bioethics is evolving as we speak, and the ability to engage with that in class made it even more interesting.",
