However, it would've been nice to have a bit more structure to discussion and the requirements for the different parts of the final project. The once a week format was nice, but given the theory-heavy nature of the readings, it was sometimes difficult to maintain discussion for a large portion of the hour and 50 minutes we were in class. I think I would have appreciated if there were more guidance to apply the theories we read about.",
