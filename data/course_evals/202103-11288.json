                "So much. I feel so much more comfortable with my historical writing skills, and I also learned a lot about medieval history and medieval culture along the way. I learned about the dynamics of medieval society, and I learned that revolts happen in various forms, for various reasons, by various people.",
                "Learnt how to write better arguments for papers and better papers in general.",
                "I developed the ability to think critically about historical topics and dissect the motivations of popular movements. I learned a lot about medieval European society in terms of geography, economy, politics, and culture all through the lens of rebellion spanning multiple class levels to include royalty, aristocrats, urban merchants, and rural peasants. The course also furthered my writing abilities with weekly short writing assignments and the larger essays. Prof. Westermeier really took the time to break down the historical writing process for us and offered helpful feedback. I am now able to better assess my own writing as well as the writing of others, including both primary and secondary source authors, for potential bias and flaws in argument.",
                "I learned a great deal about the different kinds of revolts and rebellions which occurred throughout the Middle ages and gained a better understanding of what underlying problems gave rise to the revolts and how those revolting organized themselves.",
                "Medieval revolt among servants, nobility, and royalty. We had a survey understanding of rebellions in the High Middle Ages (from the Magna Carta to the Hundred Years War). Also, we had a rigorous development of historical writing, something I am particularly grateful for.",
                "I learned extensively about different kinds of revolts in medieval Europe from 1100 to 1400 through primary accounts and secondary sources. We read many primary sources, which I learned how to analyze and integrate into my own writing. I also learned how to identify the argument in a secondary source and how to craft my own."

            "comments": [
                "One improvement of this course was the amount of writing assignments. I think it would have been beneficial to have more little writing assignments, so I could practice being specific and I could practice making arguments. One strength of the course was the writing component! We would have sessions in class where we discuss different components of writing, and it helped so much. I feel so much more confident as a historian, and it's all thanks to this course.",
                "The readings are all very different and interesting which makes it easier to do.",
                "STRENGTHS: Weekly writing assignments were low-stakes and allowed students to be creative while still integrating the readings and reflecting thoughtfully on the class themes, the longer writing assignments were well thought out and did not seem excessively long or unsatisfactorily short, every assignment came with feedback that was constructive and helped better students' understanding, the final paper was broken up into tasks (proposal, annotated bib, rough draft, final draft) that made sure students prepared ahead of time and could receive feedback early on, readings were never excessive, and course felt well-structured.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: N\/A",
                "This course is well-ordered, with each 'unit' focusing on a different kind of revolt and looking at a variety of historical examples for each kind. One downside of this method however, is that it is sometimes difficult to understand the greater linear timeline of all the revolts.",
                "Burt prepared us well for the final paper. He also invited interesting guest speakers and crafted a thorough, interesting syllabus. Burt was organized, always available, and clear with his expectations. To improve this course, I would have included a variety of ways to spend the class (a mixture of lecture, small group work, independent work, perhaps activities outside or at the Beinecke, etc.)",
                "The courses focus on primary sources helped me develop my toolset by teaching me how to contextualize and analyze complex passages. However, more general context on medieval history would have been appreciated and would have made the course more enriching and comprehensive."

                "I absolutely would! This course solidified my major in history. It was an interesting topic, the readings were fascinating, and everything was very cool.",
                "Yes I would recommend it. Its a great course for a writing credit because you read and write about interesting stuff and still learn writing skills.",
                "Absolutely! Prof. Westermeier is a great seminar leader who truly cares about each of his students and possesses such a deep passion for the topic. The course is focused entirely on Europe, but it covers a range of class conflicts and shows the diversity of rebellions during the period. It challenged my view of what constitutes a rebellion and showed me that medieval popular revolts were not monoliths. I enjoyed doing the readings each week and always felt like I could speak up in class and be heard by my peers and professor. We also had multiple guest lecturers related to the field which was very exciting and kept the class interesting.The topic is interesting and applies to many themes in modern life: class struggle, environmental degradation, revolution, poverty, familial conflict, etc., The workload is not overwhelming and every assignment feels useful. This was truly one of my favorite classes this semester. I would recommend it to anyone, History major or not.",
                "If you are interested either in Medieval history or the history of social movements then this is definitely the class for you.",
                "Yes. It's the only history course at Yale where I actually learned how to write history papers. Also, there were important themes that every medievalist should know.",
                "Absolutely! Burt is a wonderful instructor who is dedicated to making sure we understand our readings and the arts of argumentation and historical writing. This seminar is a fascinating and engaging entry point into medieval history for both medievalists and non-medievalists."
