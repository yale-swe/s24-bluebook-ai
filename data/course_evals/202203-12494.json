                "strengths: The content of the course is soooo interesting!! The labs, while they are long and reports can be time consuming, ultimately do cement the concepts learned in class.\r\nweakness: the lecture content could be organized a better. Sometimes we speed through many slides, without actually pausing to understand what's on one slide. Maybe they could be consolidated to only include the information we will actually cover.",
                "The homework problems were largely self-led. While Professor Tang went in-depth on the theory of semiconductor equations in class, I wish he could have led through the homework problems in class and explained how they functioned within the semiconductor or device. I went to almost every TA office hour to work on the problems instead, and even then we sometimes struggled as a group to understand a concept. I also wish we went over how devices are actually made in the lab (i.e. photolithography, epitaxy, etc.)",
                "Strengths are the exams and textbook homeworks. General workload strictly for the lecture portion of class is fair. The biggest weakness are the mandatory labs which are some of the most confusing assignments in the EE major. The lab procedures were written years ago and have not been updated, so students are always left wondering how certain analysis can be performed when the procedure never explained it, nor was it covered in class. It essentially turns into a guessing game to figure out what the TAs actually want in the reports and understanding how to do said analysis. It was frankly baffling how disjointed the class can seem from the lab material and how unhelpful the TAs were, in terms of providing a clear outline for what each report should cover. Ultimately, students end up learning whats happening in class due to the extensive research they are forced to conduct when trying to decipher the lab assignments.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that an entire scientific field worth of advancements in boiled down to uncontextualized factoids, and it is a shame.",
                "While the material is interesting, the course itself is poorly organized. Labs could be scheduled better so that they fall after the relevant content has been covered in class instead of before, leaving students with no idea what the lab is about."

There will be lots of math and physics involved so be prepared to be challenged.",
