                "This course has broadened my perspective on the definition of genius and if there truly is a definition for genius. You come into the course with a pretty solid opinion regarding the definition of genius, and that opinion won't survive much longer. Musical Genius emphasizes the nuances of this terminology while allowing me to learn about culture, music, perceptions on disabilities, and much more. I've learned that we are wrong when we talk about \"society\" because we easily overlook how many societies exist in the world that have different judgements and perspectives on what genius truly is. The mixture of music and philosophy, along with other academic subjects, has intrigued me in so many ways and has formed opinions and thought processes that I see myself using outside this course as well.",
                "I learned how to engage with many different types of academics texts, including writing about them and discussing them in class. We read everything between very old scientific papers to contemporary critical essays, and doing so helped me understand different methods of analyzing similar topics.",
                "This course probes one to question the assumptions they make about the concept of musical genius as well as talent and success in general. I was shocked by how several of the readings contradicted my initial beliefs about genius. The course also discusses the societal implications of genius and its perceptions of it, which I believe was the most meaningful part of the course. Prof Wright was also very helpful in providing advice for writing in general as well as reading and summarizing. Above all, I think this first-year seminar helped me formulate nuanced ideas and thoughts in a discussion setting.",
                "I gained a nuanced understanding of various musicological perspectives on the perception of musical genius.  I gained practice with reading professional level publications, and learned how to communicate my thoughts concisely through in class discussion.",
                "Through readings and discussions on numerous debates and contradictions on musical genius and genius in general, I learned not to discretize debates on not just genius, but issues in general. There are so many nuances to account for in any debate, with information almost never totally supporting one side when there is no concrete, empirical answer.",
                "The biggest insight I developed was a refined ability to look beyond the surface level of a subject. Reality TV competitions, for example, appear to be fun and games, but Ive learned to analyze the deeper meaning behind the choices production teams make. There are also deeper meanings behind words depending on the context and time period. I developed a strong ability to read text from a variety of different perspectives. These varying perspectives have strengthened my ability to argue from conflicting POVs. \r\nMy writing skills were also developed thanks to Professor Wright and her constructive advice.",
                "I learned how to engage with difficult academic scholarly writing. There is a lot of technical musical elements that you learn to navigate in the class (if you aren't a musician) so from that perspective it was definitely doable. I learned how to better my argumentative essay writing, how to quickly read lengthier materials, and how to summarize complex texts. Professor Wright challenged us to write essays taking two sides of an argument, in which we could not favor either side but present them equally well. Another one of our assignments asked for us to write a satire using the different themes of each unit, and our presentation was one of the highlights of the semester. I liked how I was able to engage creatively with this class and learn a lot in the process.",
                "I developed my essay writing skills and my knowledge of how genius works.",
                "I learned to write and read effectively. The most important skill I developed in this class is recognizing and understanding the nuances of topics.",
                "I developed my writing and reading analysis skills as well as my critical thinking. I learned to question concepts I had previously accepted without thought.",
                "This class was very helpful in evaluating nuanced issues from multiple point of views. Analyzing the concept of musical genius from contradicting sides allowed me to consider things I would not have considered otherwise and to read articles that I likely would not have sought out. Even though this is not a writing class, the feedback from this class helped my writing significantly, maybe even more so than my English class."

            "comments": [
                "I believe that the small size and intimate conversations that come from the seminar are Musical Genius's strengths. The only weakness that I can say is that many times, we'd run out of time to discuss everything in class because there were so many interesting things to talk about.",
                "Being a new course, I believe there was a bit of a learning curve with how to engage with the content. The course was attempting to cover a lot of material, and did so for the most part, but I think the seminar style of the class lends itself to more guided discussions and controlled debates.",
                "I think the format of the course, in which students must argue for both sides of a debate on genius, is a very insightful one. The readings were also very interesting, though they could be a bit repetitive in some instances. The final project was a very creative satirical script which I really enjoyed. One thing that could be improved was the class structure as we often ran out of time during discussions, but this was pointed out in the mid-semester evaluations and was better by the end of the semester. Though the weekly summaries and daily readings were a bit overwhelming at some points, I would say they were significant to the discussion and essays; looking back, I feel pretty accomplished writing them.",
                "A weakness of this course would be the sometimes limited opportunity students had to discuss together due to limited time. A strength would be the evident investment and care put in by the professor (for instance, readings were well selected to be interesting, informative, and to cover a diverse range of topics).",
                "The biggest strength and weakness with this course is that there is an overload of possible content to analyze and no way to study as many readings as desired. That being said, this is the first year that this course was held, so such an issue can and will be taken care of in the future as there is much \"trial-and-error\" necessary when a course is run for the first time, with our class setting precedent for time management and allocation. Obviously, there being almost too many things to talk about is fantastic for the course as there is no shortage of materials to study inside and outside of class. Furthermore, discussions were thoroughly engaging thanks to the plethora of engaging content to discuss.",
                "This class was a great first-year seminar. The coverage of a large range of interesting topics in a seminar stylefacilitated by the amazing Professor Wrightwas one of its greatest strengths.",
                "At the beginning of the semester, it felt like there was never enough time in class to finish each lesson and we always felt rushed through discussions. There was so much material to get through, and some of the more difficult readings, we never really addressed in depth. But after we gave our professor feedback, she quickly adapted the class to allot more time for us to flesh out our thoughts. You really learn how to balance different opinions, because each unit is set to engage with a contradicting set of principles that surround what it means to be a \"musical genius.\" I also would've liked if we had dedicated more time to modern artists, as I felt like the units with Aretha Franklin came at very busy times where we couldn't really sit down to appreciate the art.",
                "Some of the weaknesses were communication with assignments sometimes but that was very rare. Overall it was a very well run course.",
                "Strengths: classes are small and engaged; discussions are mostly student led\r\n\r\nWeakness: Essay. Did not know where to start and it felt like it appeared out of nowhere. \r\n\r\n???: The name of the class was also a little misleading. I thought we would learn about Beethoven and Mozart, but we got to write a 2000 word script about Simon Cowell losing touch with reality from watching a talent show.",
                "The course layout is a strength and evaluating contradicting viewpoints definitely allowed you to see all sides of the issue. The readings were all so interesting and as long as you stay on top of them, the class discussions are interesting and fun to participate in. It is also a strength that this class is a seminar, rather than lecture. Even though it could be a lecture and many would benefit from the material in this class, a lot of this interesting parts of this class were the discussions and activities in class, all of which allowed me to truly think about the issues being considered and helped me absorb the information better."

                "Without a doubt, I would definitely recommend this course to other students (I already have for whenever this class occurs in the future). If one is intrigued in topics of evolution, musicology, psychology, race, gender, and philosophy (or all of them), this class touches upon all of these things. The energy of the professor also facilitates the learning process because a comfortable environment is created for students. I didn't feel intimidated at all in the class to enter or begin discussions because it felt familial and professional at the same time.  It was and amazing experience that I believe other students deserve to have.",
                "I would recommend this class to both students interested in studying music and those that are not. Looking at a contradiction of a a belief of musical genius in every unit allowed us to analyze and argue different sides of debates in general, not just with music.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! Though it's the only humanities course I've taken at Yale, I thought my understanding of a wide array of relevant topics was greatly expanded. Prof Wright is the perfect professor to be teaching this course as her research is very aligned with the discussions, and her feedback and prompting questions are what really got the class going.",
                "Yes. I enjoyed broadening my perspective throughout this course.",
                "Although this course is called \"Musical Genius,\" the skills learned about analyzing contradictions and their nuances apply to anybody, and although the course centers around genius from a musical standpoint, anyone of any musical ability will benefit equally from the course as readings do not consist of any music theory but rather arguments about defining genius and its origins.",
                "Yes! Musical Genius was an amazing course andespecially if Professor Wright is teaching ityou're in for an amazing experience.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. As the professor continues to mold this course, I can only see it getting better from here. You engage with classical western music, modern day televised talent shows, and are allowed to bring up your own favorite musicians as well. You foster an appreciation for the way we view \"genius\" and learn to think through some really difficult concepts.",
                "Yes, it is one of the most unique courses Ive ever taken. It was very interesting to learn about the topic as it is one Ive not had much engagement with before. Meaning that for those who have somewhat of an interest in music I strongly advise them to take this course.",
                "If you are interested in music (specifically classical), then I would recommend. Even if you are not that interested, this class is still interesting because you learn about the geopolitical and cultural beliefs and perception of music during different periods.",
                "Yes, this class challenged my critical thinking skills and I thought it was an excellent course. I do not play an instrument yet I was able to follow along with the class and derive a great bit of satisfaction",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in this topic. It is such an interesting class and probably my favorite class this semesterYou truly dont need any musical background to succeed in this class but it makes this class significantly better if you have some interest in music, no matter how small that interest may be."
