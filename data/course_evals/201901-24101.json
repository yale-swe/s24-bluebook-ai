    "Really interesting material, loved being in the seminar. Really applicable material considering how relevant it is!",
    "Learned a lot about the unique role social media plays in today's society",
    "I learned a lot about different social media networks and different social and political science issues related to them! From Russian interference, increased polarization, more protest, and race relations, we studied social media and its connection to social science really deeply. I better understood not only the political setting surrounding social media, but also the elements of social science that go into studying these issues in more depth.",
    "I learned a lot about the function of social media in politics, particularly in the American context, and what its implications are for democracy moving forward. This course effectively evaluated both sides of the argument and allowed for adequate space to draw ones own conclusions as to the role and responsibility of social media in society today.",
    "I reconsider the role that social media plays in the current political climate and my personal life.",
    "This course helped me become a more thoughtful reader and to actively think about the implications of the material beyond the course.",
    "I gained a much greater and broader understanding of the impacts of social media on politics. It was also really nice to learn about social media in environments different than the 2016 presidential election.",
    "I learned about the political impacts of social media: in developed and developing nations, and in democratic and authoritarian nations."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Interesting material, professor was really engaged and other students seemed to be engaged as well\r\n\r\nWeakness: Some of the discussions were not facilitated super well and things could get repetitive.",
    "Strengths are that the readings are super cool and the professor is pretty woke. This is also his second class at Yale, so he's very receptive to feedback and really puts effort into the class, revising the syllabus, having regular office hours, and giving mid-semester feedback too. \r\nWeaknesses are that with heated debates, people sometimes bordered on being rude. Also, I'm not sure how productive debates were. And a final paper worth 50% of your grade is pretty stressful. I also wish the class hadn't just been all PolSci students, just because its always interesting to see the lens with which students in other majors approach this subject.",
    "The only weakness of this course was that 8 weekly reading responses was a pretty heavy workload. Otherwise, I loved every aspect of this class from the professor's guided discussions to the readings we did.",
    "I think that all of the readings were extremely interesting and promoted high in class engagement.",
    "Strengths  Prof. Thal was very engaged with the topics we discussed as well as very thoughtful. It was obvious how much he cared about it and the students.\r\nWeaknesses  not really a weakness buyback it would have been interesting to return to previous debates towards the end of the course.",
    "The syllabus was very well thought out and there was a lot of structure to the class, which was nice. The class debates were something new for me in a class. If anything, perhaps the debates could be tweaked slightly in the future to allow for more constructive conversation instead of what at times became somewhat heated questioning.",
    "Great class on important topics. I think the debates improved as the course went on.",
    "This course covers a lot of interesting and relevant topics critical to our current society and political landscape. Readings were engaging for the most part, and classes were structured to facilitate participation with debates, reading responses, etc. That being said, the topic of the seminar became a bit repetitve and redundant after a while, but perhaps that can't be avoided."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, not a ton of work and pretty interesting material.",
    "Yeah I would. I think our discussions and readings were super interesting.",
    "Yes! This course was so fun and engaging and there was always so much to learn from the in-class discussion! I really enjoyed every session and thought it was super relevant and topical to what is happening around us in society. A great class for everyone interested in social media and social science.",
    "Absolutely. Whether you are already familiar with the social media's impact on politics or have had little exposure to it, there is plenty to learn in this course. At the very least, it offers concrete evidence and findings that support (and at times deny) some of the assumptions many of us hold about social media.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course.",
    "IdDefinitely! I believe this was Prof. Thals first time teaching it and I can only see it improving! It was my favorite class this semester.",
    "I would recommend this course. At times I think studying social media can be frustrating because it is such a new format and technology so, despite its tremendous promise and significant problems, it is oftentimes very hard to leverage past history in order to prescribe solutions. In that regard, the class definitely opens your eyes to some of the large debates that are really only coming into the national spotlight now, such as the potential regulation of social media platforms. While it may not give answers, this class allows you successfully engage in those debates, which is certainly worth while.",
    "Yes. Great Class.",
    "Yes, it was interesting and enjoyable. Pretty average seminar, and great if the topic is your thing."
