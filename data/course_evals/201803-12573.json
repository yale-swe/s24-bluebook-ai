   "comments": [
    "It actually covers really interesting, relevant material. I can hold a science conversation with my STEMMY friends for like more than 30 seconds, which is a feat for me.\r\nSometimes it makes 1.5 hours feel like 30 minutes, and sometimes it makes 1.5 hours feel like 4 hours and it really just depends on the module.",
    "I wish the materials for the modules were more easily accessible.",
    "Mostly just students looking for an easy science credit. The material was not as engaging as I had hoped and the class was much less discussion based than anticipated.",
    "The course has many different topics that range from many different fields, which helps keep the students engaged. Sometimes assignments are a little unconventional, and the debates usually go on for a while.",
    "A strength is that there is not many people in the course, so class discussions are very efficient.",
    "The lecturers are amazing and the materials are quite intriguing. However, it would be easier for the students if the lecture powerpoints, assignments, and grading schemes are posted online.",
    "It was a great course! I love it!"

    "This is the guttiest SC first-year seminar. if you are the type of person to brag about going to Yale, this is not the class for you. However if you, like me, can swallow your pride, this is probably the easiest way to get a science credit at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course seeking a survey course for diverse scientific topics.",
    "Only if they were not a STEM student.",
    "I would because it's not very time consuming, but very interesting and engaging.",
    "Yes, because students can learn about the various topics in science in a very enjoyable way.",
    "Yes, to anyone with a bit of interest in science. Interesting lectures by extremely knowledgeable professors from different fields, very manageable workload, and cookies\/drinks catering every week. A great way to get exposure to various contemporary topics in science and doesn't require a strong background in math or science.",
    "Yes! You'll learn a lot about fresh topics in a really cool way. I think in the long run, the things i've learned in this course will really serve me well!"
