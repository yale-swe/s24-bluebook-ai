                "I would say the main subject I learned through this course was the history and culture of Sicily. We watched thirteen films and read three books, and through these different medias, I learned what Sicilian society looks like, from the good to the bad. I don't think I particularly learned too much about film analysis. Instead, I would say the content of the films was the main source of knowledge.",
                "Professor Marcus insightfully instructed us in close reading literature and film, through the lens of Sicilian culture, history, and politics.",
                "I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge regarding analytical film insight (e.g., juxtapositional montage) and Sicilian culture and history that really illumined the deeper themes of the films. I had seen some of the movies beforehand but after Professor Marcus's explanations and discussions, I left with a newfound appreciation and understanding of the themes and/or critiques of the films.",

                "I gained insights into Sicily as a whole as well as how it is different than depictions shown in pop culture and movies in Hollywood. I also learned about the complexities of Sicilian identity and other issues that face them with changing times."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I loved the films we watched and as someone learning Italian I thought it was a great way to increase my exposure to the language\r\nWeaknesses: I'd never taken a film class before and I don't feel like I'm walking away with an understanding of how to analyze films. There was a good deal of instruction on specific aspects of Italian/Sicilian history and culture but not on film analysis itself. Somehow though, during in-class discussions it often felt like there was a \"right\" answer which I found off-putting. I didn't think the papers were fruitful assignments as I was unable to analyze in any meaningful way three films in conversation with each other in 5 pages. I also don't know why a course with 3 papers needs a final exam too  it feels excessive and I imagine a longer final paper would provide a better medium to apply and show what we've learned. Also, the class session itself would often run overtime which was very frustrating.",
                "Strengths: great films, interesting seminars / lectures, clear feedback on essays, and Professor Marcus and Federica were both very approachable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the class was structured to be more of a seminar especially for weeks where we had two class periods for one film; I would have liked to hear more about my classmates' own opinions and readings of the scenes / movies than go over plot points. I really enjoyed hearing what everyone truly thought about a film or the perspective of the filmmaker in a certain scene and thought it made me look at the movie through different lenses and made me a better viewer / consumer of film. I also think that a clearer understanding of grades in this class would be great.",
                "The strengths of this course were the discussions we had about each film. In class, after watching the film altogether, we would talk about different aspects of the film and our interpretations of them. This ended up leading to a lot of interesting discussions on society, gender roles, and racial issues here and abroad. The weaknesses, however, included our lack of studying actual film techniques that convey certain messages. Honestly, this class felt more like a history class than a film class in the sense that we didn't really study film techniques. We focused heavily on the content of the films rather than the mechanisms of the films themselves.",
                "I wish there had been some more conventional film theory as readings",
                "Strengths: very engaging films, seminar is often fun, paper topics are given well in advance of due date\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Professor Marcus was a strength of the course. I wish that she had lectured a little more instead of having class discussion.",
                "The course's strengths are its emphasis on open discussion and its structuring by Professor Marcus. Its only real weakness for me was a couple films that seemed redundant. Sometimes we didn't get enough time to discuss aspects of the films and books on the syllabus.",
                "Strengths - the small size of the classroom really encouraged me to participate. I feel that I really got an in depth knowledge of Sicilian film as well as the films that we viewed were truly fascinating. Professor Marcus and Federica were both extremely vivacious and I always looked forward to going to class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - there was very little structure given to the coursework especially in regards to grading. I was extremely confused on how to prepare for the final exam. The proportion of the grade allotted to the papers was a bit high in my opinion and made writing each assignment extremely stressful as they were each worth 25% of our grade. I do wish we had the option of writing more papers of a smaller length analysing fewer number of films. I also do wish we had a few classes dedicated to learning about Sicilian culture instead of being expected to learn about it ourselves as the course went along.",
                "Less papers as a whole would be benifcial with more of a guided structure as it would serve to better shape a narrative and professors should read papers and give feedback"
