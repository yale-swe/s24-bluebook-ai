                "I developed an understanding of geography as a social science and how to apply that field to my everyday life. Analyzing maps and monuments was also a big learning objective.",
                "I learned about geography and cartography as disciplines, as well as what differentiates place from space through place-making activities that form place-based identity and attachments through nostalgia and memory. We discussed mobilities & paths into/out of town, and how these alter the fabric of a given area. I gained tools to approach my chosen home place, the research site we looked into for the semester, through map making, landscape analysis, and observations of place-making activities. We also discussed the cultural importance of monuments, and how to think critically about conversations surrounding the historic preservation / removal of monuments & memorials which is incredibly relevant today. All in all, it's made me question the social and geographical dynamics of my surroundings beyond my home place, and introduced new techniques for approaching research questions in urban & non-urban environments.",
                "I learned to use theoretical frameworks to assess my home -- this course did a great job at allowing me to explore how my home interacts with itself and its environment.",
                "Taking this class was wonderful because you delve into the nuance of place making and the human relationships that transition a space to a place, essentially studying and observing human interactions and reinforcing the personal ties toward a place."

            "comments": [
                "The readings were relevant and discussions were broad and engaging once we really got into it. There were only a few assignments, none of them too difficult, and honestly quite fun to do in analyzing my own home-place.  Low workload but big takeaways if you do the readings and engage with some of the central texts like Cresswell.\r\n\r\nThere were times when most of the class didn't do the readings (because there was no consequence to not doing them really, which is fine), but that made class discussions a bit choppy and awkward. Professor Hankins did a good job of giving an overview of them for people who don't do them.",
                "One of the main strengths of the course was Kristin Hankins -- she made the seminar so comfortable, engaging, and a truly great place to learn. Her thoughtful feedback and questions in response to our papers encouraged me to think about my home place differently, and from a variety of angles. I loved the miniature presentations we did on a landscape painting in the art gallery, and later in the semester, a monument of our choosing. From start to finish, the course was well-paced, encouraged critical thinking in a setting that felt safe for experimentation by analyzing our home places. I was slightly apprehensive about the final paper which builds off of, but doesn't directly incorporate the 3 initial short papers, but I had the experience that it was actually a great opportunity to expand on our previous research and was much less daunting when approached with that mindset. The course had no weaknesses.",
                "Professor Hankins is a huge strength of the course -- she commit time and effort to make sure every student is on track to succeed and made the in-class conversations engaging. She provided great feedback and the small classroom excursions helped provide an exceptional complement to learned material. The readings were a bit of a weakness, at some points. They were sometimes too dense to grasp.",
                "I think all of the assignments are excellent- interesting to do without being too much work. The final paper especially was very fun and interesting. Also, many of the readings and class conversations were really interesting. I do wish that there felt like more of a coherent concept sometimes with the readings as I felt sometimes they were more case studies or unique situations and then our conversations drifted from them."

                "Yes, definitely one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Hankins' enthusiasm to support her students is unmatched and her feedback in grading papers is so, so valuable.",
                "Yes, it is not a huge workload and you get a lot out of it if you really commit to the seminar discussions. There are a lot of social geography principles that can be applied to so many fields!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone! Please do yourself the favor of taking this class. I'm an urban studies major and came to class excited about the week's topics every time -- from place-making to cartography to monuments, the course blends together a variety of topics and tools that will change the way you see the environments around you.",
                "Absolutely, with Professor Hankins. She is committed to each student's success and cares a lot about the course.",
                "I would. It was really different from anything I've taken but super interested and I think has certainly influenced how I think and talk about things. Also the workload felt totally manageable and appropriate",
                "Yes absolutely! If youre interested in learning about the power dynamics that are involved in naming somewhere or how a place might have originated or how personal memory can be drawn to a collective in the way of place-making, then this class is absolutely wonderful for that."
