The only weakness was that the teacher would announce the questions ahead of time, so everyone had a lot of time to prepare answers, which meant I did not develop my speed and fluency with verbal response as much.",
                "Daily class strengthens practice and reinforces learning. Class time was very conducive to participation. Homework and tests were reasonable and fair. Schedule was very clear and organized, allowed students to focus on the learning.",

                "Strengths: class rigor greatly improved my vocabulary and oral proficiency",
                "The course was very organized and it was very helpful to have the structure for the class schedule from the very start of the semester. I also loved having the asynchronous day to process some of the material and have a small break from the rather tiring schedule every week. One weakness was that there wasn't as much speaking and listening practice through the assignments and homework, which I would have preferred to have rather than limiting it to only the context of the classroom.",
                "The pacing of one lesson covered in the span of three class days was far too fast to allow for proper review and study of the content. I would recommend adjusting the lesson schedule to be more slow-paced.",

I feel more confident in my Chinese after this course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The asynchronous assignments sometimes took me way longer than our normal homework (e.g. when we had to watch a 2-hour movie and then create a presentation on it)"

                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in improving your Chinese in any aspect! You can also learn about Chinese culture more.",
