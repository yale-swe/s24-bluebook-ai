    "I learned so much about the Spanish Civil War from all angles in this class. I feel like before I took this class I was missing a critical component of studying ideological conflict in the 20th century.",
    "I got so much better at reading in Spanish and learned more about the cultural impact of the Spanish Civil War.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the Spanish Civil War, the literature influenced by it, and the effect that it had before, during, and after it occurred.",
    "During the course, I developed a keen understanding of the forces that lead to and fought in the Spanish Civil War through literature and art. This course allowed me to study history in an unconventional way, as different aspects of the war were evaluated through novels, movies, and historical artifacts. In addition to practicing my reading, writing and speaking in Spanish, this course allowed me to gain further knowledge on how to interpret literature, poetry and film.",
    "A great knowledge of the Spanish civil war in depth; I really enjoyed the class readings and discussion.",
    "A great understanding of the Spanish language and Spanish Civil War from several different perspectives."

   "comments": [
    "This course was great but a lot of material and a lot of assignments, so it was a bit difficult to keep up at times. I really enjoyed the lectures.",
    "I think maybe if we had a gotten slightly more information about the beginning about the actual events that led to the war and how the war unfolded that would have been helpful for contextualizing the books we read. We had one lecture that gave a basic overview but I didn't feel like it was quite enough information. I did enjoy the variety of sources we got to read because they each had such different perspectives.",
    "The biggest strength of this course was the professor and the TF Sarah. They are truly great people that are always willing to help and further discuss anything talked about in class. I cannot think of a single weakness.",
    "This course is definitely one of a kind. Exclusive visits to the Beinecke, rich literature and film, and all form part of this courses' charm.\r\n\r\nI considered classes not imparted by the professor, but by a graduate student as weaknesses in the course. This is because in the end, the course was taught in Spanish but not by a native Spanish speaker.",
    "I think a simplified background of the timeline of the war should be made available to students, but overall, I think it was a well-structured course."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! If you are willing to put the work in, this course is super rewarding.",
    "Yes I'd recommend it, but be prepared to do a ton of reading. It can be especially time-consuming if your Spanish isn't super sharp coming in.",
    "I highly HIGHLY recommend this course to other students! There were only about 15 of us taking the class so it was a very intimate setting and it was awesome to get to discuss everything in such detail. The papers are manageable but the midterm is a bit more challenging. Regardless, I think it is very worth it to take this class whether you're interested in Spanish or History.",
    "Definitely! This course was a unique experience through which I improved my Spanish skills, learned about history, and was introduced to all of Yale's incredible resources for doing so (especially the Beinecke).",
    "Yes  it really forced me to develop my language skills through historical analysis.",
    "Yes, it is an incredible class to any student with an interest in the Spanish language and or history."
