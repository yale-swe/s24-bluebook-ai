Aside from that, reading these texts was most of all fun wild, fantastical, adventurous. All the things I love about literature!"

The only improvement I would consider recommending is swapping out some of the more similar early Latin vision texts for a wider variety, although there may also be a benefit to having to read closely similar texts or even translations and pick out the differences.",
                "While I thought Professor Thorbury and my TA were great, I think the overall structure of the course is a little confusing. It already assumes a significant amount of religious knowledge and we read a lot of short excerpts from things that I felt were often a bit decontextualized. I would've preferred to read fewer but longer texts that we could have dived into more.",
                "Strengths: organized lectures, good feedback, engaging assignments\r\nWeaknesses: extensive workload near the end of the class",
                "We had way too many essays during the course. We had two midterms, a final essay, and a final exam that was essay-based. I just ran out of ideas! I had nothing else to talk about and it was exhausting by the end.",
                "Strengths: very engaged, knowledgeable, and creative instructors. Could be improved by perhaps including more translations and discussions on translations for Middle English texts",
                "I actually thought the reading load was perfect in this class. I think it isn't useful when reading assignments are always hundreds of pages a week, because that means they oftentimes cannot be completed by every student and everyone ends up on a different page. This class had a great, moderate reading load which meant I almost always felt prepared for our discussions and managed time to properly listen and make notes for the prerecorded lectures. I definitely enjoyed the structure, content, and teaching of the class."

While there are some essential medieval texts that were not covered in this course, the most exciting texts in the course were those that most students would not encounter elsewhere, and are tons of fun to read and study.",

Instead, I got one of my favorite classes of my Yale career. The readings were incredibly rich and unlike most texts I had ever read before, I learned to read (and actually like?!) Middle English, and the class combined literature with history and philosophy in such an engaging way. Professor Thornbury's lectures provided such a useful roadmap through which to understand these texts, and we always had the opportunity in seminar and section to ask our questions and direct the discussion to what we thought was most interesting. I would most definitely recommend this course to another student."
