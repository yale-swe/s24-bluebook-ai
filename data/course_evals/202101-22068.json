                "This class was not bad at all. It is definitely the type of class where you get out what you put in -- but try not to think of it as a self-help class per se. Maybe it was because of Zoom, but the class discussions were usually shallow and not a lot of people did the readings. But the process of writing the essays helped me reflect on and interrogate my values and the way I live my life. Although my worldview has not changed fundamentally, I feel like my lifestyle is slightly more informed and intentional now than it was before the semester.",

I think it is more challenging because no matter how hard you try to evade it, your authentic and genuine opinions will be confronted. But its not difficult to engage. This class will genuinely leave you thinking and I think it is a great opportunity to log and record where you were at during this point in your life as a twenty something year old.",

I think that the reading materials and the asynchronous guest lecture recordings are all really rich, and I've enjoyed engaging with them. I think that the course is what you make of it, so if you aren't doing the readings or trying to engage in class discussion, it could up being a class you get less out of. On the whole though, I am glad I took it."
