                "Clearest strength of this course was the instructor's enthusiasm and willingness to help the student. I scheduled office hours several times outside of class to try to clarify material concepts and the professor was always willing to accommodate. I think another strength of this course was the frequent homeworks and the fact that they were graded on effort. This encouraged me to keep up with the material and do consistent review of the concepts covered in lecture, and made me feel less discouraged from getting questions incorrect on the homework (which I personally thought were challenging). I also liked that the instructor released an answer key for the homeworks. Lastly, the final exam I thought was quite fair."

By the end of the half semester, my ability to understand the literature of the field which utilized some of the spectroscopic techniques was significantly better than the beginning. This course was fairly challenging for me, and it was definitely out of my comfort zone but I'm glad I took it with the instructor that taught it."
