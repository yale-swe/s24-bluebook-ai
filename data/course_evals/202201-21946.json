We discussed the advantages\/concerns around big data, the details\/strategies\/effects of algorithmic pricing, and the underlying technology and applications of blockchain. There were only 3 problem sets that were focused on programming simulations and implementing strategies discussed in class, and 2 presentations where we got to teach and learn from our classmates topics that we researched on our own.",

            "comments": [
                "I really enjoyed the course! Very interesting material. Challenging but in a satisfying way.\r\n\r\nI think the one weakness is that some course times could ave been used more productively. For example, we spent 2 whole class times reviewing problem sets. It would have been nice if Professor hosted OH and people could have asked questions there. Also, nowhere in the syllabus did he have office hours listed. He was super responsive with emails and I imagine if I had emailed asking to meet he would have said yes, but having formal OH would have been nice and less intimidating.\r\n\r\nWe started the course with 6 people and ended with 5 students. Another weakness was that it really never was like a seminar. I guess I signed up for a lecture, but it was so small that having discussion would have been nice and really interesting.",
                "The content of the course was great. It was understandable but went into a decent amount of depth. The coding exercises enhanced the learning. I thought that the weaknesses were that we didn't participate as much as we could have in a 5 person class, and I didn't love the fact that the coding exercises were done in groups (I think shorter individual projects would be better).",
                "Strengths: Course was well structured and balanced, especially for being taught for the first time. Topics are interesting, novel, relevant and not too hard to understand. Workload was not very heavy. Classes were engaging. Problem sets were partner assignments. Professor Schaefer was super responsive and understanding.\r\nWeaknesses: Might not be a weakness, but it was definitely programming-heavy; could be quite challenging\/intimidating if you have no coding background, but not impossible. I thought this was definitely worth it though, since the problem sets really allowed me to really learn and understand the topics that used to be a black box to me.",
                "Very small class so very interactive\r\nThe coding assignment is a bit challenging.... Took much longer time than I thought it would be. But really challenged me a lot!"

                "Yes great class. Max is very kind and knows a lot about the different topics. You will learn a ton and become a more competent programmer too.",
                "I would definitely recommend it if the interests and prerequisites (ideally python coding proficiency, but other languages could work too) align. If you're at all interested in these hot topics in tech, this is a great class to learn more about them in depth.",
