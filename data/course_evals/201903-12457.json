    "Honestly I first thought that having every cadet give an hour long lesson was Capt Baik checking out before separating but ended up enjoying it. Having to brief for that long was good for me and I learned a lot from other cadets, and there was still plenty of time for Capt Baik to share wisdom. My complaint as always with AS courses is that so much of the material is redundanthope to learn new, applicable things next semester (especially financial strategies in the military)!"
