Prior to this course, I basically didn't know anything about Ukraine except for what I'd learned through reading about the current war and also talking to my Ukrainian friends. This course provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the timeline, key actors, and major influences in Ukrainian history. Furthermore, this course also expanded my understanding of European history at large. The themes that were introduced in lecture were extremely insightful and thought-provoking. Snyder introduced themes that are not only central to Ukrainian history, but also apply to history at large! In terms of skills I learned, I learned how to have a conversation with someone about the current war! If I were to meet with someone who took Russia's side, I'd have the ability to counter their argument!",

                "I gained an understanding of Ukrainian history and how it differed from Russian history in the context of past events. I learned of the diverse makeup of Ukrainian people.",

                "The course gave me better understanding of how nations, particularly the Ukrainian nation, come into being. Moreover, I learned to use history and historical facts to understand social concepts better today and to build persuasive arguments using history. In that sense, the course did not only teach me the historical facts of Ukrainian history but I could also improve my argumentative writing.",

I gained insight into colonial narratives and their power and the incredibly rich history of Ukraine. I now understand the reasons why the war in Ukraine is so dangerous to global democracy and freedoms.",

                "Strengths was professor Snyder and how cool learning about this stuff during this time was. Weakness was that Professor Snyder couldn't be at every lecture so we had a few guest lecturers, but I would have rather had Professor Snyder for every lecture.",
                "This course is very engaging; the reading load is on the higher side of normal, but is very manageable. The lectures are engaging. The exams are fair. Very little needs to be improved.",
                "Strengths are the lecture. Weakness was that the exams sometimes did not align with what we learned in class. I wish we had more guidance on Map quiz/exams/etc.",
                "Strengths: organized incredibly well, phenomenal lectures\r\nWeaknesses: none, best class I have ever taken",
                "I thought that the lectures themselves were incredible and I was so privileged to learn from someone as brilliant as Professor Snyder. One weakness of the course was the organization aspect. It didn't always feel like the terms provided to us in lecture were the most useful... we didn't always cover them in lecture and sometimes the actual content of the lecture was completely different to that represented by the terms.",
                "Strengths: Great readings in syllabus, chronological structure is good\r\nWeaknesses: Unlike other Snyder courses, his lectures felt very rambly. Like there was not a very coherent structure to the lectures - at least, I could not discern such a structure. That is partly because this course is new and I think Snyder treats this as just his twice-weekly brain dump on Ukraine with scattered musings about what is currently going on in the war. I still learned, but did not learn nearly as well as if he had implemented a clear structure in each lecture. Could have literally been a 30 second - ima do this this and this",
                "Strengths: Timothy Snyder and the guest lecturers - they all have such a depth of knowledge of what has happened and continues to happen in Ukraine and I learn so much just by listening to the stories they tell. The reading load is manageable and Snyder/the TFs do well to prepare us for the topics that are covered in the exam/exam essays.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "A weakness is the assumption that readings are done before lecture because the lecture style bouncing around and summarizes readings instead of clarifying themes.",
                "I thought the course was structured very well and the discussion sections really helped me make sure I was understanding the concepts in lectures. I didn't find that all of the readings were super helpful, but some definitely were.",
                "I think one big strenght of the course is that Timothy Snyder is an amazing lecturer that makes the course very engaging. Moreover, the course has good and relevant readings and there is generally a focus on using history to think about the today. Moreover, the discussions sections gave room for more in depth discussions and I liked writing my own memo cause it gave me the possibilty to write about a topic that I am interested in more extensively.\r\n\r\nSome weakness is the structure of the course, it sometimes feels unstructured, for example the term sheets given in class are not very organized and sometimes don't fit the lecture. Additionally, I wished the course and the instructor to be more rigoros sometimes. The information presented was very one-sided and their was not much controversy presented. It could have been interesting for example to present or talk about views that oppose Timothy Snyder's arguments or focus more on evaluating evidence.",
                "Strengths: Snyder's lectures are well-known throughout Yale and the world for being engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: The main book that was assigned for readings was dry and in many ways just repeated what Snyder covered in lecture in a less engaging fashion.",
                "I appreciated the format of the class in terms of assignments. I liked having two 50 minute exams instead of having three hour exams, and the final paper was an interesting reflection. The professor kept the lectures engaging with anecdotes and jokes. The weaknesses were that, due to the lack of slides, the material could be somewhat hard to follow and it was difficult to find information if you missed a detail in the professor's lecture. I also found the over 1000 year scope of the course to be somewhat daunting, but I understand that it was necessary after finishing the course. I maybe would have spent less time on the early history of Ukraine and more time on the 18th and 19th centuries. Also I would have appreciated more formal review sessions for the exams.",
                "The readings complemented the lectures very well, and every lecture was incredibly engaging. I found the second half of the course particularly valuable - perhaps another lecture could be spent on the modern era ~1980-present.",
                "Strengths: my TA, Nikolaus. He worked hard to make section engaging and cared about our learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Everything else about the course. Tests were not structured well. At least half of students' test grades were based on our ability to memorize terms and dates (which is frankly unacceptable at Yale University). The survey nature of the course was not at all conducive to deep learning. I feel that this course did not require me to think critically until the final essay (and even then, I was encouraged to write it within the narrative provided by Timothy Snyder rather than form and defend my own conflicting opinion). Timothy Snyder, while brilliant and clearly an expert on Ukrainian history, is not an engaging lecturer. Lectures felt disorganized and more like a stream of facts/opinions than a coherent narrative. Students also had extremely limited exposure to conflicting opinions. I was extremely disappointed by this course.",
                "Strengths: Amazing lecturer and TFs, lots of support for assignments, clear expectations, interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: Too much reading expected, not always clear what was necessary to take the course",
                "S: Really interesting course W: The readings are extremely lengthy and often times didn't align with what the lecture would be about but they were still interesting.",
                "The lectures and readings were strengths of the course. Professor Snyder puts a lot of thought into his lectures so that they naturally follow along with the readings. He often demonstrated his points in class, for example, highlighting the greater similarity between Polish and Ukrainian than Russian and Ukrainian. By enrolling in this course, I also was notified of many other visiting speakers who were hosted by professor Snyder or professor Shore. Attending these lectures was an excellent way to connect my learning with modern events. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found the examination style very challenging, since we were given 50 minutes to answer several free response questions and write an essay on a concept from class. I believe I could have better demonstrated my knowledge if more time was provided for the examinations."

                "Yes 100%",
                "Yes, I would. I think I came out of it with a much better understanding of Europe, European history, Ukraine, Russian history, fascism, and more.",
                "100%. Such a cool opportunity to learn from such an amazing professor. It was great",
                "Yes! This class is incredible. You learn so much and Professor Snyder is a great and engaging lecturer.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. To be lectured by Professor Snyder, and about something so relevant, is an opportunity that nobody should miss!",
                "Yes! It is a real treat to have a truly talented lecturer.",
                "I would say so. Interesting class, very relevant and contemporary subject matter. This is a less strong Snyder class than say Eastern Europe Since 1914 though, so I would say if you wanna take a Snyder class at some point, do not do this one. That being said, TA's are good, and you will learn a good amount especially if you do the readings",
                "I couldn't recommend it more. You won't find a better teacher of Eastern European history, and the topic is especially relevant to current affairs. Snyder is an excellent teacher and the material is engaging as well.",
                "Yes because of current events. Its one of few Ukrainian history courses offered nationwide and the history is interesting.",
                "Absolutely! Such an amazing course to learn about Ukrainian history, especially to build a context for understanding the current war.",
                "Yes!!",
                "Yes, anyone interesting in learning about the history of the region will enjoy this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anothe student, even if not interested in particular in Ukrainian history. Timothy Snyder is an amazing lecturer and the course gives you a much clearer understanding of why understanding history is so important in discussing contemporary affairs. Moreover, Ukrainian history is very rich, interesting and you also learn a lot about European history.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about Ukraine after the invasion.",
                "Yes. It provides you with essential contexts for present-day conflicts and broadens your perspective of European and world history. I would recommend this course to any and all Yale students.",
                "Yes. The historic buildup to modern times is very long and very detailed. There is constantly a lot of input. After taking the class, I feel that I have understood what is going on in that part of the world and I have a much better understanding of the dynamics.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. Lectures were extremely dull, and memorization was emphasized over critical thinking. Students had extremely limited exposure to conflicting viewpoints. I also did not enjoy this course because of its survey nature; by the time I felt like any topic was getting interesting/complex, we would move on to the next topic.",
                "Yes if you're interested in Ukrainian/European history or the current Ukrainian-Russian war.",
                "Yes, please take the class if you have a chance!! Snyder is amazing!!!!"

Some of the personal anecdotes shared by Professor Snyder and Professor Shore also gave the history a meaningful human character.",
