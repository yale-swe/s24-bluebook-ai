From the medicalization of women's bodies to the birth of the feminist movement, the material learned in this course provided a comprehensive view of perceptual changes surrounding womanhood.

                "Really liked most of the discussions. Tannenbaum's readings were mostly interesting (although a few were kind of bland). Everyone in the class had interesting insights into each topic, which made classes enjoyable.",
                "strengths: FASCINATING topics and material (we talked about witchcraft, the invention of the vibrator, women's economic work, cultural constructions of women's bodies and sexuality, and so many more interesting topics); 98% of the readings were honestly so interesting and well-written; professor Tannenbaum is a great discussion leader, she poses the right questions to direct us in different directions; workload: 60-80 pages of reading and 2 reading responses per week (I felt it was a good amount of work but still manageable)\r\nweaknesses: make the seminar environment more encouraging for students who may be shy or insecure in speaking up",
                "Strengths- consistency in workload with two readings for class was very manageable. I also felt a great deal of community in this course.\r\nWeaknesses- sometimes discussion felt like it was dragging on. I really enjoyed when we had new content in class like photos, articles, etc. and think this would be a good improvement to the course.",
                "Strengths: Discussion was facilitated very well! The professor was really skilled at pushing us in all the right ways on how to think about women's history and question the ways we have thought of women in the past. It was a really homey feeling in class (which is hard on Zoom). Also loved the multi-cultural aspect of the readings and the FIELD TRIPS!!\r\nWeaknesses: Would've loved to see Latin-American and Black-American voices in our readings (I felt like these groups were very underrepresented)",
                "I would've preferred to receive more clear feedback on assignments.",
                "Excellent discussions; I felt that the first-year seminar format really made me feel closer with the professor and the other students than any other class I'd been in. The selection of readings for each course were varied and interesting, incorporating a wide variety of cultures. The week on witchcraft in colonial New England, featuring selections from Professor Tannenbaum's own book, was a highlight.",
                "Course is very heavy in complex readings, often limiting discussion to only one aspect of what was read in a certain week rather than all"

                "Yes, very interesting subject material and great professor. She is willing to help if you ask for it and the material itself is mostly very engaging. Also think it is a good seminar class for more introverted people or people who are more anxious about speaking in class. At first, I was nervous about speaking during discussions, but everyone, including Tannenbaum, is very open minded and I think the class is well suited for all types of people.",
                "Yes! Especially students interested in but not committed to wgss as a major because it was a great introduction to themes in women's history.",
                "Yes!! It was one of my favorite classes at Yale and really challenged me to think critically about women, especially those outside of the Western world. Professor Tannenbaum did a great job facilitating discussion and making the classroom a safe space for us to talk about these history topics that remain very relevant to this day. It's an amazing way to meet other first-years and form friendships through the small class environment. Overall 10/10 experiebce",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to all students, regardless of what major they are in. The study of women and gender as a whole is essential for social and cultural analysis. This course pushes students to question the norms surrounding femininity that are widely accepted today, and informs of historical ideals that have led to the development of modern societies. Besides learning more about history that is often erased from the common curriculum, students are able to easily engage with the course material, as readings and assignments give students the liberty to explore their own interests and interpret texts as they choose.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students regardless of their intended major.",
                "Yes, great course, but this will be the most writing a writing credit can be.",
                "Absolutely. This was the best course of my first year, and I feel that it's helped me develop my writing and discussion skills tremendously."
