    "I learned about the Holocaust and the history of how it has been represented.",
    "I learned how to learn new information about a subject I thought I already knew a lot about and reshape my ideas about the subject. I learned about the Holocaust's history but also what defines it as an important and unique event. We discussed the legacy of the Holocaust and the controversial ways it is remembered. By understanding the factors that led to the Holocaust, we discussed how the Holocaust should be addressed and remembered today.",
    "In this course I learned a lot about Jewish history regarding the holocaust and the events that led up to the genocide against the Jews, the actual events that took place during World War II, and the aftermath of the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. Additionally, I learned a lot about the holocaust in contemporary culture and in political context and how as citizens of today's generation we should respond and react to thoughts and discourse about the holocaust. Through debate discussion and conversation I learned an enormous amount of different viewpoints about holocaust discourse in today's culture and what we, as citizens, have an obligation to listen to and to share regarding this topic.",
    "A better understanding of what happened during the Holocaust, as well as how it is used as a political tool, and what factors contributed to the events of the Holocaust.",
    "I learned about various contemporary issues that involve the Holocaust.",
    "A very present reading of the Holocaust and related subjects",
    "Evaluative and worldly techniques for approaching atrocities and all-encompassing entities like the Holocaust as well as its relationship to Jewish-related and history-related politics of today. The course goes over a variety of factors of the subject. Check out the syllabus for a good look."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Interesting lens to approach Holocaust history, especially since contemporary questions almost always underlie our understandings of the Shoah. I know that this dynamic probably wouldn't happen again, but the balance between the two professors was a lot of fun. I also enjoyed writing the papers -- they were challenging and let us use different analytical skills than we were using regularly in seminar. Lital was a wonderful TA and I really appreciated her presence. Weaknesses: I wish that the contemporary focus would've been more explicit throughout the middle 2\/3 or so of the class. We started off the class really immersed in contemporary politics and I thought this was going to continue throughout the class, but we became much more focused on the actual history instead of how it has been used. Of course, the history we learned about was fascinating and I did enjoy all the topics we discussed, but it was less experimental than my initial impression suggested. I also wish that we would have gotten feedback on our assignments earlier, though this wasn't a big problem. Small thing, but I wish we read some Hannah Arendt (instead of merely having her referenced in other texts)!",
    "The class topic was extremely interesting and well done. No weaknesses, but you have to like Prof. Stern's erratic teaching style.",
    "The room was open for discussion. No idea was bad, and we could have real intellectual conversations. The readings were incredibly interesting, and the student body full of diverse backgrounds, which provided the perfect environment to discuss the different ways the Holocaust should be remembered.",
    "The strength of the course lies in the quality of conversation between the students in the class and the professors themselves. Each person comes to class with different viewpoints from different backgrounds and allows each conversation to be completely different from the last. The bounce Ideas off of each other, debate with each other, and push each other to use hard evidence to back up claims whether that evidence be from readings books interviews or personal experience.I think that the weakness of the class is often times the amount of reading we have does not allow us to go as in depth with the readings themselves and therefore if there were less readings for class, we may be able to go into a deeper conversation.",
    "Topics were interesting and course was well-structured. Reading load was sometimes heavy, but you could skim some readings",
    "Great discussion section with very interesting readings. Professors Stern and Strote properly guided the conversation and gave their insights while also allowing all the students to properly participate.",
    "This course was amazing. The readings were interesting, the conversations in class were thought-provoking, and the professors were excellent.",
    "As this was a one-time team taught course, it could improve in organization of topics",
    "Strengths: TF (Lital) was very helpful. The Jewish students around me and teaching staff were such an enricher for me since I had never taken a class in this setting on such a topic. With that said, there was also cultural diversity in the class which allowed for the great discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the assignments can be a little blurry, but this can be solved by speaking with the TF or a professor."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's such an interesting topic and a mixture of history and modern topics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. This course challenged my preconceived opinions about the Holocaust and the Jewish identity. It really made me think and provided the readings and intellectual environment to learn and discuss the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who wanted to learn more about the holocaust not only in a historical context but also in a modern context. This class helped facilitate discussion about the holocaust, a topic that conversation does not come easily to many in today's generation. By taking this class, I not only feel more comfortable talking about the Holocaust, but relating it to topics in today's culture that have jarring similarities to some of the topics discussed during World war II.",
    "Terrific class to contextualise the Holocaust.",
    "Yeah a solid class! Workload is manageable (2 papers, 1 in-class, very low stakes presentation about readings). Subject matter is super interesting",
    "Yes I would recommend. Many people know about the holocaust, but they don't know about all the politics\/issues surrounding it which is very valuable. It is good to know what we mean when we say \"never again.\"",
    "Absolutely. Definitely take this course if you can.",
    "Yes, always an engaging discussion with prof stern!",
    "Yes. If you are interested in WWII politics and the historical application of Holocaust\/Jewish history in today's society, this class is a must. The professors\/TF always have something interesting to say in each discussion as well as the students."
