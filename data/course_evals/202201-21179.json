It was very nice to have a super open-ended final project, as we were all encouraged to branch out in creative directions.",

The only aspect of the course I did not like was starting on Zoom for the first weeks, but that could not be helped.",

If I had gotten into this course as a frosh, I probably would have ended up majoring in art/it totally would have changed my Yale trajectory. Bummed that I only got to experience this as a senior.",

However, it was perhaps too critique-focused--I've taken art classes before where frequent critiques made sense, but in this class it just felt like they cut into practice time, which was the real thing that made me improve.",
                "Great class, great drawing exercises and professor suggestions. \r\n\r\nI think the class could improve with fewer people in the class (shorter crits) and shifting the timing of the collage assignment."
