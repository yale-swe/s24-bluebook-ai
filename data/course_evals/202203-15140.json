It's really fascinating how many intricate structures and elements there are to language that you would never realize until you have to figure out a way of doing it in a language you're making from scratch. It also served as a really good introduction to the field of linguistics with units in every subfield.",
                "Basically an Intro Ling course with a conlang flavor! Overviews of phonetics/IPA, phonology, morphology, syntax/basic rules and trees, and semantics. Links to real-world examples in natural languages and conlangs. We also spent a lot of time working in groups to develop our own conlangs for assignments, so the course also teaches linguistic collaboration and feedback-giving.",
                "This course was outstanding and I was so excited to go each time. The course focuses on exploring the basics of linguistics in a stress free environment. Language creation was mostly an application of the topics we learned in class.",
                "A first hand experience of all the aspects of what makes a language! It was a very good opportunity to actually engage with linguistic theory by applying it creatively, and I think is a great way to introduce linguistics to a beginner.",
                "Through this course I learned a high top level overview of linguistics (including phonology, morphology, syntax, etc.) and got to apply them in a really interesting project (creating my own language).",

                "Strengths: the class handouts are super helpful for learning the material during class and to use for reference when making decisions about your language. Psets are due every 2-3 weeks and are super well designed/organized and not too difficult. Class is a really fun and collaborative environment. It's never just lectures, there's always activities and lots of engagement/participation for us. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses at all!!",
                "Strengths: lecture was engaging, working in teams for culminating conlang, course environment is welcoming\r\nWeaknesses: slower pace - though it is an intro course, this could perhaps be addressed with short supplementary readings to allow more class time for collaboration/discussion of our conlangs",
                "Since languages are immense, and the semester is short, you probably wont have a complete language by the end, but it is surprising how much you can accomplish.",
                "Strengths: Freedom in the assignments and the direction of your constructed language with pretty clear guidance on improvement, and a fun work environment in groups!\r\nWeaknesses: The professor is new so the lectures were not that engaging for what I enjoy. Also, the handouts seemed too high-school-ish and I would've preferred more of a focus on lecturing and hands-on work instead of going through a handout and chatting about linguistics in the process.",
                "The course has a very good topic - applying the concepts of linguistics by creating a new language is an excellent way to make the subject interesting. The grading system (grade is based on weekly progress updates and a final submission) is also fantastic. My one issue with this course is that as someone with no background in linguistics it was at times tough to follow along with the class.",
                "Strengths: absolutely loved learning the concepts through conlanging (making a constructed language)! It's a fun, hands-on way to apply linguistic ideas. The fact that it's a partner project is also nice, as that way you have someone else to bounce ideas off of.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of many. The assignments were well-structured. Overall an excellent course.",
                "I loved the structure of this course. The readings were all informative and engaging, the assignments were deliberate and helpful, and class discussions were engaging and dynamic.",
                "The class taught how to construct a language in an easy to understand way. Constructing a language seems very complicated, but after learning the class materials it became quite manageable. No weaknesses"

                "ABSOLUTELY!!! This is probably the best class I have taken at Yale. If you have any interest in language/linguistics at all or have ever thought about making up a language you should 100% take this class. It's so interesting and fun.",
                "Yes, as long as you were planning to take an intro linguistics class anyway! If you are an inexperienced conlanger, the course will give you new ideas and directions to take your languages in; if you haven't tried it but are at all curious about constructed language, this class is an excellent introduction.",
                "Professor Newirk is amazing and made the material so much fun and was able to set the stage for fascinating discussions. The class had a mix of students with different preparation in linguistics, and because of the structure of the class pretty much anyone could enjoy it, whether new to linguistics or a seasoned linguistics major. I couldnt recommend this class more highly; anyone with an interest of the inner workings of language should take it.",
                "The professor is new, so I didn't expect much of the actual lectures, and they were, frankly, not the most engaging for me. Otherwise, the material given was great, the assignments were concise and allowed for a lot of creative freedom! So if you don't mind a chatty type of lecture and find the prospects of creating a language fun then absolutely take this class!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in linguistics because it has such a unique concept, which is also executed well. You can really get creative with your language and explore linguistics from a unique perspective.",
                "If a student is looking for an introductory course to the linguistics major--that is, they're planning to major in linguistics and haven't yet taken a linguistics course--I would probably recommend LING 110 instead, because the coursework in that course more closely matches expectations for the major. However, for a student who has a passing interest in linguistics or conlanging, or who has some linguistic background and wants a more relaxed class experience, this is a really great way to dip your feet into it without being overwhelmed. For me, it also served as a good refresher for a variety of linguistic concepts.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. In addition to being one of the most entertaining classes I've taken so far, it helped me gain a working understanding of a field that I was previously entirely unfamiliar with. I also love that every student came out of the course with a finished product (in the form of a fully functional conlang that they could continue to develop and grow).",
                "I would recommend this course to a student curious about how to construct your own language. You will learn a lot about the topic and enjoy the process."
