The topics covered were relevant to the pandemic and helped create a learning environment where the matter discussed had real implications.",

Even though it was online, I still had a great time each class and was excited every week for this class. There were so many activities, which made every lesson interesting. Also, another strength was that I actually got to know and get close to some of my classmates given the structure of the class; it felt great getting to know the other students and professor through conversations. Overall one of my favorite classes at yale so far",

We didn't learn a new tense or grammar rule every day but would rather learn one and in the upcoming weeks, we would learn about the rule in various situations to understand why it is used. Our understanding of the tenses and structure was valued. \r\nWeaknesses: The spacing of assignments was not the best. Sometimes weeks would be very writing heavy that requires a lot more time and revision but the allotted time to hand in the assignment would be insufficient.",
