I've never considered myself a person of faith, but this course and Professor Wiman offered me a space and tools to reconsider what that even means. Not to mention, I encountered some of the most incredible poetry I've ever gotten the chance to read. Please take the class.",
                "This course has taught me how to read poetry, how to think about faith, and how to be a better person in the world.",
                "i learned how to read and analyze poems in depth, while also gaining insight to the nuances of faith exploration.",
                "Poetry & Faith gave me the motivation and the space to explore poetry without any unnecessary or limiting apparatus... and then once I'd had a chance to steep in poetry and questions of faith, asked me to synthesize and actively respond to the poetry more and more. I appreciated the structure of the course in that sense.",

                "this is the best class I have ever taken at Yale. I learned about paradigms of faith, spirituality and religion and the subtle differences between the three; i learned about contemporary poetry but also some about slightly older poetry (I love sunday morning by Wallace stevens, from the early twentieth century); I learned some about the role sound plays in faith. I learned about poetry as the most complex and honest and ambivalent and wonder-filled container for the human yearning for God. I learned about literature the way I have always wanted to and have never been able to in the Yale English department. I learned from all my classmates about their own lives and the poems they have carried around with them. this is yes a very soulful class but also intellectually rigorous since it requires you to reflect deeply on your preconceived notions about faith. it certainly made me a fuller person, in all ways."

                "I'm not going to say there are any improvements that need to be made. You get what you put in? It's hard not to get something out of it. It's not a writing-workshop class, however, and there were not *so* many opportunities to receive feedback. It's mainly a reading and absorbing and slow-changing class. It may be that you come out with the same style of thinking or writing that you came into it with  though there are also opportunities to change and grow thought-ways, too, through guided class discussion ...",
                "Strengths - I think I will treasure the course packet of poems my entire life. It's utterly fantastic, encompassing a range of poets you might know and those you absolutely won't. Poetry memorization for assignments was also deeply rewarding and will stick with me. Professor Wiman is fantastic, insightful, but does not take up oxygen in the class discussions, which were great. He also knows many prominent poets that we read personally and slyly uses that knowledge to elevate our understanding of their work. The environment he creates in class is a space where we could feel vulnerable and honest in discussing our spiritual/religious views (or lack thereof)\r\nWeaknesses - some vagueness in final assignments, but otherwise none.",
                "I could not think of how to possibly improve this class. except I might have liked if we did a bit more creative writing/writing of our own poetry but, in fairness, this is not a creative writing class so it is understandable why we did not."

I don't consider myself a person of faith, and this bore no impact on how much I was able to engage with the course material or contribute to class discussion. If you are looking for a though-provoking class, love good poetry (a course reader of some of the best I've ever read), or even if you're a STEM student wanting something different, PLEASE take this course. It is the best course I have ever taken at Yale. Ever.",
                "If you do nothing else at Yale, TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I'm a senior and it is by FAR the best class I've ever taken here (and it's not even close). Professor Wiman is truly phenomenal -- smart, thoughtful, funny, perceptive. The readings are so good, the discussions are so interesting and engaging and comfortable. The workload isn't much at all and you actually want to push yourself to do well on the assignments. I feel like a better person and thinker for having taken this class. If you have any reservations (either on the poetry or faith end of things), trust me, take the leap -- it's well worth it.",
                "Anyone who has an interest in poetry or faith should take this course. Regardless of one's level of knowledge or experience about either topic, one will be able to learn and grow profoundly under Professor Wiman's guidance. This is perhaps the best course I have taken at Yale.",
                "YES, especially if you want to be stretched in your ability to express your thoughts well",
                "YES! This is probably the best class I've taken at Yale. The combination of intellectual growth, artistic discovery, and spiritual meaning is unmatched. It felt utterly necessary and rarely (if ever) like work. Take it, take it, take it, though only if you can approach it with investment or openness to discussing spirituality.",
