Also learned different musical composition techniques and effects such as delay, reverb, low- and high- pass filters, etc. Also learned about different eras and important milestones in musical history, such as different technologies used to record audio (gramophones, tapes, DVDs) and the artists who spearheaded new genres in their time (such as the development of musique concrete and electronic music).",
                "Sadly, very little. Virtually all of the material would be better learned through self-teaching and the Internet, particularly if your goals are learning more about music technology and music production. Lectures were hard to follow, and the homeworks felt like busywork of plugging numbers into equations. If not for this course, I probably would not have studied musique concrte, but frankly I am not very interested in it.",

The course demystified a lot of my confusions about the more scientific\/quantitative aspects of music tech, like decibels and midi-to-frequency conversion. The course was great for dipping my toes in a lot of different waters and getting a sense for what is possible, but it of course did not make me a computer music wiz or give me detailed practice in super advanced topics.",

                "STRENGTHS: Konrad is a very cool professor and really knows what he's doing. His demonstrations in class let you see immediately how the concepts you learn can be applied to the real world in music! Course content is also interesting and multi-disciplinary including science, math, computer programming, history, and messing-around-with-the-music-programs-yourself-to-make-cool-beats-to-vibe-to. WEAKNESSES: We literally got no grades back until like two weeks before the semester ended, so it was difficult to tell how any of us were doing until the end. This was the one and only weakness. Everything else was pretty great.",
                "This course needs an overhaul. Most students were either not paying attention or not showing up to lecture.",
                "This is an amazing way to get science credit (in a not-too-technical class) and really just listen to Konrad talk about all sorts of music tech topics that are really fascinating. The course did go a bit fast\/feel like a really high-level overview, but that's kind of expected with the amount of material we covered. The only",
                "strengths: great subject material, interesting assignments\r\n\r\nweaknesses: little to no feedback on psets\/exams, psets hard to connect to what was taught in class",
                "Strengths: interesting material, engaging examples in class, great professor\r\nWeaknesses: PSETs that were difficult to interpret, relatively little knowledge that is applicable to projects.",
                "Strengths are the material is super interesting, but its hard to understand what is and is not important to the class.",
                "The course was great for exposing me to a variety of music tech developments and possibilities. Lectures covered a wide breadth of concepts, which was great, but this felt like it was at the expense of clear crystallized explatnaions of some of the core concepts.\r\n\r\nDiscussion sections were more geared to this type of learning and were incredibly helpful.",
                "I think the listening could be more integrated into the class. Half of the things on the listening list were not once mentioned which made both studying for the listening exam and taking of the midterm exam quite difficult.\r\n\r\nAlso, grades were not returned to us until the last two weeks of class. I would love for the class to have been more transparent in this respect.\r\n\r\nI think the sections are a great help in getting through the PSets. I also think Konrad is a really wonderful professor.",
                "Strengths include the lectures, which were engaging and interesting; the demos and cool things Konrad did in class kept it really fun, and it wasn't a class I dreaded for the length at all. The psets were the right amount of challenging; I always felt like I was exercising something I'd learned in class, but wasn't spending more than a few hours on any one. I especially liked the creative ones. The course as a whole could be improved by 1. making sections a place where more listening is done but making the pset review time more like a study hall where students can collaborate and work together and 2. increasing the turnaround time on feedback, especially for the exams, as it was hard to know where I stood in the course due to the amount of time it took to get feedback.",
                "lectures were sooooo boring (i'm sorry) i stopped going and, whenever I did, it felt like a waste of time.",
                "I really enjoyed the content and lectures for this course. The sections provided cool opportunities to talk with other students in a smaller group and both Professor Kaczmarek and Ben were very helpful in answering questions and helping us figure out how to make our creative projects happen. My only suggestion would be that sometimes the PSETS felt somewhat disconnected from what we had learned in class because although the equations were familiar, it was unclear what order to put them in and uncertain if you had done them correctly.",
                "Great class, awesome syllabus and fun assignments!",
                "interesting class with interesting psets",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Great lectures, excellent energy from Konrad! He is so knowledgeable, funny, and engaging\r\n- Manageable homework assignments that contributed to learning\r\n- Interesting content for music majors and music lovers!\r\n- Fun creative project opportunities\r\n- Extremely organized class, with a ton of resources neatly laid out on Canvas!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The first exam seemed to divert quite a bit from the material we'd been practicing, and it felt like the homework assignments didn't help me to prepare as well as they could have\r\n- The amount of content on the listening quiz felt very unreasonable. I spent my whole week studying 30+ songs (like 20 hours of music with dates and composer names), and the exam ended up being only 5 of the most recognizable ones. I feel like the list could have been a lot shorter, or we could have had a long listening list but without memorizing all of the dates and full composer names.\r\n- Grading was very slow (I think partially due to trouble uploading Grades to Canvas)",
                "Professor Kaczmareks in-class demos and lectures were fun and kept me engaged. The homework assignments also felt like they actually helped me learn. I would rather have several shorter classes each week instead of the one long class, though. Near the end of most lectures, I was getting a little restless",
                "the course was interesting and expanded my understanding of music recording and engineering. really enjoyed it as a science credit",
                "I felt this course was incredibly well taught. Sometimes there was a bit of a gap between what was taught in lecture and what was on the PSET but the GAs were always available to answer questions.",

                "Well paced and is the format gives students some breathing room. Exams are manageable though there is a listening exam that can catch you off guard. Very manageable and interesting!",
                "This was one of the worst classes I have ever taken at Yale. The instructor rarely taught the material we were assessed on (all of our p-sets were based on quant yet there was never a single sample problem done during lecture). I am not sure how we were expected to be able to complete the psets with such little instruction on such niche material. Additionally we didnt get any grades back until the end of the course. We had two midterms and by the second midterm we had not seen the results of the first one or any of our psets. I found this completely unfair as I am not sure how we were supposed to learn\/improve. The course was generally disorganized as well (I.e. instructions for assignments were unclear and when the answers for the psets were finally released many of the answers were incorrect\/out of order).",
                "I very much enjoyed the lectures and demos and things. But I did feel like it sped through some complicated things that may have needed more explanation, especially for people like me that didnt have extensive knowledge of music technology already.",

                "IMPORTANT TO NOTE: You may notice that the ratings for this class are not in the super high range. THE REASON for this is due to the nature of class being at an intersection of science and music: those who are good at music and less so at math will struggle a bit; likewise, those who are good at math\/coding and less so at music will struggle a bit. But it's a good type of struggle, one where you're exposed to different ways of thinking about the world. Therefore, please don't let the lower ratings deter you from taking this course - as long as you're willing to take on the challenge that inherently comes with multiple disciplines coming together, I'd honestly rate this course really high. If you're even mildly curious about how these topics interact it's honestly a very neat class. We learn really interesting stuff, and I was finally able to draw correlations between history, programming, math, how it all translates to music. For the final project, there's also a LOT of freedom in which topic or project you want to pursue, so there's ample opportunities for you to explore your own interests. YES, I do recommend giving this class a try. Go to a lecture or two during Add\/Drop period, see how you like it! It was pretty enlightening, at least for me.",
                "Yes! with the caveat that you should be ready to not understand a lot of what happens in class and embrace that",
                "I would recommend this course. I would call it a QR course for music majors. It's not technically challenging for STEM majors, but is appealing to anyone, no matter what music background they have.",
                "Only if you're really passionate about the technical side of music. If you're more interested in the music, maybe not.",
                "This is a fun course! If you're up for a (very doable) challenge and listen to electronic music (which you definitely do all the time), you'll find a lot to gain. Prior technical knowledge about fundamental computer music and music topics isn't required or anything, since this is an intro course, but it's definitely helpful. If you're already a wiz, though, you should look for harder courses.",
                "I would! The more creative assignments towards the latter half of the course are really fun. Also, I feel like the content of the course is broad enough that it can apply to anyone who wants to take it!",

                "No! If you need a science credit you can but it is badly run, you don't get any feedback, you don't learn any science or much music. Cool songs tho and the TFs are so nice",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is interested in sound and learning how to use digital audio technology. The content of the lectures is quite interesting and the PSETS, although challenging, are rewarding. For example, it is cool to see math equations result in midi notes. My only warning would be that we did not receive feedback on our PSETS as consistently as would have been helpful.",
                "Absolutely, take this if you want to learn about the basics of music tech and making cool music!",

                "Yes! Take it if you are interested in the history and methods behind music technology.",
                "Yup, if youre interested in how sound works in a physical and technological way today and in history, this class is very manageable and interesting. Some of the assignments are very low commitment but do require some investment in the course to feel manageable since they are open-ended and creative.",
