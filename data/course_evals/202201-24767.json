                "So much.  Mostly mineral identification via properties such as hardness, cleavage, shape, luster, streak, color, magnetism, environment, associated minerals, twinning, crystal class and system.  Started the course by learning about crystal class and system (basically, symmetry of crystals) and topics such as Bravais lattices.  Then, went on a very comprehensive tour of minerals including tectosilicates, nesosilicates, sorosilicates, inosilicates, cyclosilicates, phyllosilicates, carbonates, oxides, sulfates, sulfides, phosphates, hydroxides, and native elements.  For each of the groups I just listed, we talked about major and minor minerals, their properties, and relevant ternary composition diagrams. Introduced concepts such as polymorphs and pseudomorphs, liquidus, solidus, and solvus.",

                "Strengths: seeing the Peabody museum's mineral collections in class and getting to touch and hold super rare minerals was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I will never forget.  The collection is incredible and it's such a cool opportunity we have! Jay was phenomenal as an instructor and as a person--he is so calm and laid-back and funny and kind.  Our TA Benjamin was also great and helped me so much with the lab component.  I liked the setup of the course--how we had a 2 hour lab each week where we were able to finish most of our homework.\r\nWeaknesses: the midterm and final were really tough, but at least they were on a curve.",
                "strengths: interesting, excellent lectures, beautiful specimens\r\nweakness: the \"labs\" are not labs and are instead very tedious and monotonous",
                "Strengths - comprehensive, approachable for non-majors who are interested, opportunity to see and handle hundreds of Peabody collections minerals rare and from far away, mild readings, grading system robust to poor grades\r\n\r\nweaknesses - definitely a memorization class, labs were good for memorizing what you need to know, but we were essentially just scouring the internet for info about minerals as opposed to true hands-on work never finished in 2 hours especially if there was a lab quiz that week, exams required a lot of memorization and were difficult"

                "Yes! Its an amazing course. The department has an incredible collection of minerals that is really a once in a lifetime opportunity to get to pass them around and study them in class. Professor Jay is a fantastic lecturer. The content is really interesting too.",
                "One million percent.  This quickly became my favorite course of the semester and is now in my top 3 favorite courses at Yale.  The professor and TA were incredible.  The content was super interesting, and who doesn't want to look at pretty pictures of crystals and minerals all day?  And even better--get to see and hold and touch them!  Every class we got to examine 15-20 mineral specimens from the Peabody Museum mineralogy collections (including some special collections that had never been shown before).  Definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I will never forget.  Jay was such a great professor and the structure of the course was really great: we had a 2 hour lab each week where we had ~10 mineral specimens to analyze.  The only work outside of the lab each week was to finish our lab reports, this usually only took me an extra hour.  Word of warning: study a lot for the midterm and final because they're pretty tough but at least they're curved.",
                "Incredible course! Information packed and organized well to facilitate learning. Minerals are everywhere and important to know about.",
                "I love Professor Ague's teaching style and am very interested in the course material, so if you are also interested in the material, I would definitely recommend.",
                "If you are interested in minerals and have a good capacity for memorization, yes",
                "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course, as it was one of my favorites I've taken at Yale. The exams are difficult, but the material is fascinating, the lab component is fun and not at all taxing like many are, and the classroom atmosphere is calming and enjoyable (and you look at so many cool minerals in class!), so I think it's definitely worth it.",
                "Yes this class is awesome. I liked seeing all the minerals in person and the labs were really fun."
