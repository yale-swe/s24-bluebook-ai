    "Improved my writing skills and learned about some outstanding fiction writers.",
    "This class taught me a lot about the ways in which one can write about coming of age stories, whether through personal essays, creative nonfiction, or fiction. Additionally, the class helped me hone my skills in writing, specifically in using voice and dialogue as a means to show and not tell key moments in a character's life.",
    "learned how to write memoirs\/personal narratives; read a lot of good books",
    "This class was wonderful, allowing me to really reflect on my life.  I also felt that the readings helped me to develop my writing skills.",
    "We read a lot of great things, and workshopping was a good experience. My storytelling ability also improved, I think.",
    "This course significantly helped me in improving my creative, personal writing, and gave me several new techniques to become a more effective storyteller.",
    "This class taught me so much about how to be a more effective writer, how to craft a story arc, how to be efficient and poetic.",
    "Great creative writing seminar in a welcoming discussion setting with selected readings on the topic of coming-of-age stories and turning points that were very diverse and helpful examples of styles of writing.",
    "I gained an appreciation of various short stories and literature that I had not read before. I also learned how to write from a child's perspective in a believable way."

   "comments": [
    "The syllabus was really well constructed, although I would have liked to read fewer excerpts and short pieces, instead focusing on more full-length texts. Additionally, I appreciated that the syllabus included diverse works from Native, Latinx, Black, and Queer authors; however, I felt class discussions about the nuances of experience raised by these authors were at times reductive and lacked humility to the experiences of others.  \r\n\r\nI also felt the course could have benefited from more discussion of writing techniques and strategies outside of essay workshopping.",
    "This class is really fantastic. You'll be able to read some amazing works, engage in thoughtful discussion with the class, then apply some of the writing styles you've seen to your own experiences, real or imagined.",
    "Strengths include the manageable workload and the interesting readings. Would prefer to see a little more diversified syllabus but otherwise readings were good.",
    "This class is wonderful!  Very interesting, great readings, very thoughtful and reflective.  I think the class could be improved if discussions became a little more dynamic, instead of the professor stating her opinion so clearly right off the bat.",
    "I really enjoyed almost everything we read, and discussions in class were generally very interesting. Workshopping was great as well. I feel like we often did not have enough time to effectively engage with the in-class writing prompts though",
    "The reading list is really fantastic and fun, and Elise is a warm, thoughtful and high-quality professor. Workshops were a great experience and the essays were genuinely fun to write. This is one of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale. My only suggestion would be doing more creative writing exercises during class to discuss how to use certain techniques we find in the reading in practice.",
    "Strengths: Prof Broach is incredible, you receive clear and helpful feedback on your writing, the assigned short stories are all great.\r\nWeaknesses: none.",
    "The best part of the class was reading each others' papers and discussing strengths and weaknesses there--I think it really helped with the quality of our writing. I think it would have been nice if we did more in-class writing though, to work on our style and voice and maybe have more opportunities to experiment and tweak.",
    "The strengths were how great the readings were. And the class was so small and intimate so the conversation was great."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but know that it isn't a gut or easy fifth class. You'll have to work quite hard on the papers to do well in the course.",
    "I most certainly would recommend this course to another student! Professor Broach cares a lot about her students and what they think about the course. The readings are reasonable and fantastic. You'll get a broad survey of works, including poetry. The writing assignments are very do-able, and they allow you an opportunity to not only reflect on your own life, but also how exactly to best express those moments. This class helped me work through some moments I never had really thought deeply about portraying before.",
    "if you're looking for a nice 5th credit, look no further",
    "YES!!! SO GREAT!",
    "Yes! The readings are great and it's a very chill creative writing class",
    "Id highly recommend this course to a student who wants to become a better storyteller and improve their creative writing techniques. Its a fun class with a great professor and fairly typical workload for a Yale seminar.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. If you can get in, take this course. The readings are so good, the discussions are so good, reading each other paper's and discussing them is so good. I feel like I'm a much better writer because of this class. It almost made me regret not being an English major and, for about two days, I thought about how I could make money as a professional writer. Easily the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it! It's a fun way to spend an afternoon talking about really interesting readings and the class culture is great thanks to Professor Broach.",
    "Yes, if you love reading and writing",
    "Yes. Super fun creative writing class with good readings for writing and analyzing"
