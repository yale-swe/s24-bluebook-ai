I find myself telling my friends about concepts and studies from this course because they are mind-bending and really cool and such a great introduction to psychology. This class made me want to go into psych or cog sci. I learned about how people think irrationally, I learned about self-concept and mind-reading and all of these things that we normally don't think about, and I learned about how we desire and how we try to achieve those desires."

            "comments": [
                "The strength of this course was that it was very interesting knowledge and nearly everything I learnt was something new and exciting. One weakness is that there is a quiz at the end of every single lecture, which is incredibly annoying since it means you have to have complete focus for the entire hour and then read every question incredibly close since the answers are not usually straightforward. This makes the lectures very stressful as to get an A you need 100% for the majority of the quizzes. Furthermore, the sheer amount covered in class is ridiculous. Some days, there are over 100 slides. This means that the lectures are extremely fast paced with no time for a minute break which means you need to concentrate non-stop. Then you better hope you have memorised all 100 slides :)\r\nAlso, some questions on the exam you have to come up with your own answer (e.g. a different example than the one from class) but then your example is never as good as the ones from class so you don't get full marks.",
                "I really liked the daily quizzes (this may be an unpopular opinion). They definitely forced me to pay attention in lecture and attend and I would take them over homework any day. Also, it helped me get a feel for the way that professor Ahn words her questions which was helpful for exams. Don't stress if you don't do too great on the first few, it'll definitely get easier as you go and they're very low pressure! I wasn't sure how I felt about the discussion days because although they were helpful for studying for the exams, it didn't really feel like a \"discussion\" just because it was a lecture course and it was honestly kind of stressful to get called on randomly.",
                "Strengths  very accessible material. Anyone can grasp the core concepts.\r\nWeaknesses  at times I did feel it was just rogue memorization.",
                "Strengths: very engaging, the professor is an EXCELLENT lecturer, workload is not too high, but daily quizzes and review question every three lectures keep the knowledge in my brain and hold me accountable\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes I think there are different ways to think about the material, and the professor doesn't always understand students' different ideas (but this doesn't happen that much, I just struggle to think of weaknesses)",
                "Strengths: slides and recordings make it easy to review, no homework in exchange for quizzes after every lecture, engaging examples\r\nWeaknesses: a little fast-paced",
                "Strength: Small lecture, so easy to stay engaged and ask questions\r\n\r\nWeakness: N\/A",
                "Lectures were very engaging and quizzes were helpful for learning (although I wish we could have dropped 2 instead of 1)",
                "Overall, a really good course! But some of the things we covered would be better to discuss, but that's hard to do with a big class (even when Professor Ahn capped it). Maybe optional discussion sections would help? ( the idea being participation there would basically give you an A in the participation grade)",
                "Strengths: Very well organized and quizzes after lectures supplement learning. Exams are straight from lectures with further reinforce learning\r\nAreas of improvement: None except maybe grading distribution, I got unlucky on the first exam and it was an uphill battle to recover my grade.",
                "The lectures are extremely engaging, but they go very quickly and cover a lot of material (sometimes it feels like too much material -- but at the same time, I wouldn't want anything to be cut from the curriculum). The end-of-class quizzes stressed me out at first, but they became much less stressful once I realized that if you're engaged throughout the class you'll do fine. There was virtually no homework (aside from review homework, which was helpful for studying for exams). While the lectures were packed with information, Prof Ahn always took questions and made us feel like we were part of the conversation, which I really appreciated.",
                "Strengths: Very manageable workload, fun lectures and fun professor, approachable and friendly TFs, REALLY great knowledge we got out from this class\r\nWeaknesses: No discussion sections to talk deeper about the course material, which I really think would've actually been REALLY helpful; I (personally) also think the grading is really subjective and the criteria is not the most clear. Going over my test with the professor and TFs sometimes they tell me I didn't say a specific point, but I pretty much said it exactly in my answer.",
                "I think that the lectures and content in the course were great and Professor Ahn did a great job teaching the material in an engaging way.",
                "Extremely interesting course. Very applicable to your everyday life.",
                "Very interesting",
                "One strength is the organization of the course (the lecture slides are wonderful), and another strength would be the wide array of studies which Prof. Ahn covers to reinforce claims presented during the course. \r\n\r\nA weakness would be the fact that we would often pause lecture slides to see what time it was and to ensure that the class was proceeding in a timely manner. While I applaud Prof. Ahn for being so disciplined and organized with her teaching, I did find it largely distracting when class would pause to check the time. It would often disrupt a flow, and then I would begin to calculate the exact amount of time left in the class until I could depart. A second weakness is that Prof. Ahn seemed to get progressively less-organized as the semester went on - the last review set contained many redudant questions and errors, which was a bit of a headache only four days prior to the final midterm exam.",
                "Though this course is a lecture, I was able to stay engaged with the material and pay attention (partly because of the quizzes at the end of each lecture). The workload is also light compared to the other courses offered at Yale, and it was also fairly easy to study for exams because we had already been reviewing the material after each lecture with the quizzes. A lot of the actual material covered by Professor Ahn is pretty applicable to our own lives and there were actually times when something happened in my day-to-day life which reminded me of concepts we covered in this class. There were also a couple activities to demonstrate concepts that kept us engaged every so often, which was always fun to watch. Sometimes, we would go over time because there were so many questions asked by students, but it wasn't a super big issue for me. Obviously, because it's a lecture course, it's hard to get personalized feedback but you can always go to office hours, zoom meetings, etc. if you have specific questions to ask.",
                "strength: although it was a huge lecture it felt like there was high engagement among the students and the instructor was easily available for questions",
                "Strengths: Prof Ahn is a great lecturer, the course is very organized, the content is interesting and she makes lectures engaging, Weaknesses: A little bit cumbersome to review your quizzes\/exams (need OH appointment)",
                "Really interesting course idea and concepts. Also loved the structure of having quizzes rather than homework - this was the best. Towards the end of the semester, started to get a little repetitive and so many studies!",
                "The lecture\/review question format was very strong, and aside from the final (yikes) exams never really deviated from the review questions so there were few surprises.",
                "so interesting. did not like a few trick questions on exam 3",
                "This course has good pacing and covers a nice range of material. I think more time could be spent reviewing permutations of concepts and less time spent on redundant studies.",
                "Strengths: Extremely interesting, engaging course material. Everything is taught with examples, and the lectures and slides are very well thought out. Prof Ahn is not just one of the most brilliant professors, but also a great \"teacher\"",
                "Professor Ahn structures her lectures in a way that directly aids in the effective consumption of learning material. She engages students intermittently with video and other media that chunk the lecture into manageable pieces. Similarly, Prof. Ahn requires short quizzes after each lecture that ensure student engagement with the material. I would only suggest that the due dates for these quizzes should be extended to the end of the day the lecture is taught to allow for slightly more leniency in their completion.",
                "Professor is great",
                "I absolutely loved the lectures, I think Professor Ahn is very engaged with the topic and I was excited to go to class each day. I also liked that this was not a very writing heavy course I felt like I was very much learning for the sake of learning.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Lectures made very engaging by Prof. Ahn. She is a great lecture, plus she would always have \"breaks\" in class so that it wasn't 75 minutes straight of lecture.\r\n- The quiz at the end of each class REALLY helped me remember what we learned. And the \"review & discussion questions\" (questions every couple of weeks reviewing material and then reviewed together in class) cemented the learning, so that studying pre-exam didn't take nearly as long.\r\n- The three different segments of the course (behavioral economics, rationality in its different forms, and methods of thinking) were well structured and extremely useful to my everyday life.\r\n- No homework made this class very doable.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The exams, especially the last one, felt tricky. A lot of \"one word makes the difference.\" But still able to do well.",
                "Taking a quiz at the end of every lecture really helped solidify my knowledge of the lecture information and tell me what I needed to study.",
                "The strengths of the course are Professor Ahn made it very easy to engage with and kept all of the material as interesting as possible. The weakness of the course is the difficulty of the exams, I don't believe they matched the studying resources provided.",
                "I wish there were more ways to test our knowledge that just exams.",
                "It was very clear in how the lectures and information was presented. Almost every point had a study as evidence to corroborate the point. I think the main weakness is the speed of the course as there are some very complicated topics and ideas that were generally sped through because the lecture was going to run long.",
                "Strengths: there are quizzes after each lecture instead of a lot of homework, which was very nice. They were relatively easy to score well on if you paid attention, and they offered good review before tests. Also, the way Professor Ahn brought real-life examples into the lecture and then explained a concept was very helpful in learning the subject matterher lectures were very engaging and I really looked forward to attending class. It felt more learning-based and less grade-based, which was definitely a breath of fresh air.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course was very stringent and the policies were very opaque. The lack of COVID-19 policy and understanding, specifically in the beginning of the semester, was disappointing considering the already-stressful public health situation. For example, missing class for quarantine purposes and not receiving leniency or full credit even if the assignments were completed on the same day and instead being asked to receive a Dean's excuse (when they cannot give excuses for COVID precautionary situations, and rather teachers were asked to be lenient and understanding) made for unnecessarily stressful times throughout the semester. Through email communication, it felt as though the instructor was, at times, committed to curt communication of existing policy before engaging in conversation to reach more common ground and understanding.\r\n\r\nI think that healthy dialogue and more communication on ambiguous policies would definitely improve the course, because the lectures were genuinely enjoyable and the other elements did take away from course fulfillment.",
                "I actually really like that the professor gives quizzes at the end of each lecture. If you listen they aren't at all challenging, but they do a really good job of forcing you to stay engaged and not skip lecture and so never fall behind.",
                "One weakness of the course is the depth. There were a few bullet points for each topic, and a wide array of topics, but little depth. More studies supporting or refuting each topic would be better. Additionally, an expert viewpoint on how to understand which studies matter more than others would have been appreciated.\r\n\r\nI think one strength is the interactive demos! Those were a lot of fun and will stick in my memory for longer.",
                "There are way more strengths than weaknesses.  This class was taught very well and the content was interesting and engaging.  There are no significant weaknesses that need changing in my opinion.",
                "Very funny, engaging, and so easy to remember the information. It could be improved by more discussion sections or more interaction between classmates."

                "I would recommend this course to another student but warn them that it is quite stressful honestly. It has a low workload but this is very deceiving as you have to take a quiz at the end of every lecture. The quizzes are 'instead' of homework but you still get review and discussion questions every other week which takes a couple of hours to complete. This homework is also stressful as you will get called out to speak in front of the class of 100 students at one point so you need to make sure all your answers are right if you don't want to embarrass yourself. This is made even worse by the fact that some questions you don't even have the answer to from lecture slides.\r\nOverall, even though I got an A in the class, I would only recommend this class to someone who is willing to work hard for the A or someone who doesn't mind getting a B\/B+",

                "Yes. It's fun and engaging and interesting. I apply some of the things I learned on a daily basis. Don't come in expecting a more neuroscience-based class as I did; the class is half classic psych and half behavioral economics. You don't go into how cognition actually works unfortunately.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course -- the material is fascinating, Prof Ahn is wonderful, and by the end of the semester you'll notice that you're implementing elements of the class in your own thoughts and life!",
                "YES! I think this is definitely one of the essential classes for all freshmen and sophomores to take as it really touches upon so many different, applicable aspects of life. Not just a \"psychology\" classa life class.",
                "Yes, it was a very interesting and engaging course that I think has many applications to all students regardless of major",
                "Yes, probably my favorite course I have taken at Yale. Everything we learn is super interesting and easily applicable to one's everyday life. Also, super cool to be taught by Dean Chunn's wife.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, if you want an introduction to the study of human irrationality and descriptive behavior, then this is the course for you. I actually have found myself often discussing concepts covered in class with another classmate who was additionally enrolled in the course. We especially reference both sunk-cost, as well as planning fallacies. A lot of this material is truly of practical value.",
                "I would recommend it. Theres a lot of interesting material and engaging studies that i think everyone should be exposed to, such as the studies on predjudice and confirmation bias. Theres also a breadth of fun and lesser known studies that helped me become a better thinker in daily life.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed taking the course and it's a very light workload. You don't have any regular assignments except for review questions every now and then, which you can honestly finish in a day. The some of the content can get confusing, but Professor Ahn goes over everything in class and also takes time to answer clarifying questions (even giving feedback in email) and also goes over the review questions in class after they're due. You have no final exam, and it's a relatively easy class to keep up with. The concepts and material I learned in this class I would say is also applicable in my everyday life, so it's not just a gut class.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Prof Ahn is great and the things you learn are relevant and interesting. If youre interested in psychology on a level where you can see the concrete relevance, its easy to pay attention in lectures and do pretty well.",
                "Yes! I thought it was great and think most students would enjoy.",
                "Yes, if youre interested at all in psychology",
                "definitely. so interesting and applicable",
                "Yes! With a little background in psychology and an interest in human thought processes, this course is really fun and informativeI find myself using the concepts frequently outside of the class itself.",
                "Recommend without a doubt! Prof Ahn is one of the best professors you will have, and she structures the course in such a way to maximize your learning. The content is extremely interesting, and you'll never find yourself struggling to engage with the class!",
                "Yes; Professor Ahn is a brilliant instructor who engages students with lesson materials in a unique and effective way. Outside of the review and discussion questions scattered throughout the course, there is almost no work that must be completed outside of class. The quizzes after each lecture are easily completed if you paid attention.",
                "Yes it was my faborite",
                "Yes!! Take this course if youre at all interested in how we think about the world. It wasnt too math or science heavy and I learned a lot",
                "Yes! \r\n- Great lecturer.\r\n- Excellent intro psych course\/Learn a lot of material.\r\n- Low homework.\r\n- Very doable to get good grades.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Ahn is an amazing instructor and the topic is fascinating. It's a great and informative class.",
                "If they're interested in psychology, I think it is a good course to take.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot!",
                "Absolutely! Whether you're looking to pursue psychology outright or to try something new.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It gave me great foundational knowledge of psychology and had many neat tricks that I have and will continue to use in my own daily life. It is not too hard of a course so it is definitely worth the time if you have it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another studentthe principles taught are applicable to real life and the workload is definitely manageable (however this is not an \"easy A course\"). I would especially recommend this course in a non-COVID environment, because that was honestly the most stressful part of the course. Missing class due to waiting for a test result and originally not receiving leniency and full-credit on post-lecture quizzes took away from the course enjoyment because it felt like I had to choose, at times, between being courteous towards others or attending class for full credit on assignments.\r\n\r\nThis policy was eventually addressed later on in the semester and cleared up so I think it will be better in the future, but it definitely added stress during the beginning of the year.\r\n\r\nI was excited to get into this course after waiting a few days, so make sure you add it to your Course Search as fast as possible! It's popular for sure.",
                "Yes definitely. Super fun class with really interesting concepts. Wouldn't say it's a gut but relatively easy with basically no homework outside of studying for the three exams.",
                "I would, with hesitations. I think this course suits a very niche purpose of opening your mind to new perspectives, but doesn't bring any tangible skills to the table. Additionally, the material is quite boring. That being said, I greatly enjoyed it and the small workload was a nice balance to my otherwise-heavy schedule.",
                "Yes.  This is an incredibly interesting class.  There is very little homework as well, but you have to be focused in class because of the quizzes at the end of every class.",
                "Yes. It is a low workload and you learn so much you can apply to daily life and use in your own writing and research papers. It connects well with papers from any other discipline such as philosophy or literature."
