                "By taking this course, I was able to appreciate human diversity and learn how to reject the standards of normalcy, through an evolutionary lens. Professor Valeggia structures the course in a manner where everyone will leave with a general takeaway. If you want to get into fine details explaining concepts, she provides the framework for this as well. She is very honest when she says students are in charge of their own learning. Throughout the semester there were many moments to genuinely reflect on what we learned and connect content into our lives. I have learned more in her course than I have in most courses at Yale because she knows how to facilitate real learning without stressing students out.",

                "Through the study of human evolutionary biology, we come to intimately understand topics that are relevant to our lives. The interdisciplinary nature of human evolutionary biology is especially important because it allows us to look at human biology from a perspective that accounts for both social and biological realities. Biology has societal implications, just as social environments can affect one's biology. Therefore, in regard to society, the study of human evolutionary biology is useful because it allows us to understand the scientific root of certain societal problems so that we may be more adept at solving them. Personally, the study of human biology has helped me understand the links between evolutionary biology and my everyday life. Therefore, in studying this subject, I have learned what lifestyle choices I can make to maximize my body and minds daily performance.",

You come to view science as a more dynamic and interactive academic space rather than a stiff and factual field of study. In terms of the actual material, you gain insight into basic human evolutionary theory and specific important phenomena within the field. It's a good introductory course.",
                "I learned a basic overview of what human evolutionary biology is and why it is relevant to day to day life. We covered a lot of basic issues that humans face and why the human body works in the way that it does based on evolution over time.",
                "We learned various aspects of evolutionary biology, including why our bodies developed certain behavioral characteristics in order to survive. We also learned the ways the environment can affect our biology and how to incorporate evolutionary ideas into medicine in order to create new and more effective treatments. Thanks to this course, I had a much better understanding of my body in reference to the whole of nature and the history of evolution. Because of the weekly questions we had to answer, my writing ability and my ability to synthesize and use information increased dramatically.",

There were many aspects of human biology and medicine that I had not previously considered. One especially important aspect of this class is that it intentionally funneled STEM and humanities students into the same space, balancing each other's perspectives.",
                "This course gave someone with very little science experience, a foundational level of anthropology that changed the way I looked at the world. It taught me  the ways through which social motives alter scientific understandings, the purpose of our evolved traits and countless other topics that are essential in understanding the human race.",

                "Strengths being the constant reflection, and space to take charge of your own learning.

                "Strengths: Instructor and TAs are amazing, very interesting material, good balance of complex and simple concepts.\r\nCould be Improved: More engagement on student side during class (but is understandably difficult since it is a lecture)",
                "Doesn't cover much material beyond what is learned in an intro bio anthropology class, but does offer new perspectives! Does not shy away from potentially senstive topics (race, etc).",
                "Some segments felt very brief.",
                "The main strength has to be the professor. Professor Valeggia is an absolute gem who cares deeply about her students. Her lectures were clear and the material we discussed during the course was interesting and eyeopening, at times. The grading is pretty fair and the TAs, at least for this semester, were pretty lenient graders. Can't really think of any significant weaknesses of the course.",
                "The course was very interesting",
                "This course touched on everyday lifestyle in our society. It was very relatable. The professor and the TAs were extremely resourceful and ready to help.",
                "The reading responses every week were very good and helped with the understanding of the information. I think the final exam was a little too open ended.",
                "Professor and TAs are absolutely amazing and the course material is extremely interesting.",
                "Strengths - great teaching team, good balance of assignments, interesting content\r\nWeaknesses - some concepts could use a bit more thorough oof explanation, especially if they show up on the midterm\/final",
                "Strengths: the professor takes a holistic approach to teaching the class, making the course very accessible and comprehensive. Additionally, the professor provides all the recorded lectures and powerpoint presentations on the Canvas website so that students can refer back to the lectures. Weaknesses: due to the online lecture format for the course this semester, the class engagement during live lectures can be low sometimes, especially with a class of 50 students. The course sees more engagement when students are in smaller groups.",
                "Strengths: prof valeggia is awesome! each class started with a short meditation which was nice. the TAs (Kat and Vicky) were great as well and I found the material pretty interesting, even as someone who is not at all a fan of most things science-related. Loved the emphasis throughout the course on biology being situated in social context--thought that was really important because science is not all that objective.\r\nWeaknesses: not much that I can think of",
                "It was a very well organised course and was pretty interesting. It is great for non-science majors because after the first few lectures the science is fairly straightforward . (the first couple of lectures there was a lot of jargon but after this it is fine)",
                "The course was super engaging. Professor Valeggia did a great job ensuring students were paying attention and in a more focused state by taking a few minutes before each class to conduct guided meditations or listen to relaxing music. The way the midterm and final were constructed made them a lot less stressful without sacrificing proper student evaluation. No complaints.",
                "Strengths: section was structured very well, the lectures were very engaging, and I loved Professor Valeggia's meditation at the start of every class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have preferred fewer instances of small group breakouts in lecture, simply because I felt that we often got off track.",
                "Sometimes, the lectures were too information-heavy, and a little overwhelming. Besides that, however, the course is wonderfully suited to anyone who wants to learn about their own speciesand overcome a lot of the misinformation swirling around on the Internet.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Valeggia and the Teaching Team, emphasis on student wellness, discussions of highly-relevant social issues, assignments and grading are fair, was the first 'easy' class I've taken at Yale that was actually easy (but was nevertheless enjoyable and rewarding!)\r\nWeaknesses: Weekly discussion questions felt a bit redundant (quite easy and speedy to do, but the 'right' answer is obvious)",
                "It was difficult to engage through the online format",
                "The greatest strength of this class was that while it certainly expanded our knowledge of human evolutionary biology, it also aimed to improve our mindfulness both on a social and personal level. We were encouraged to adopt sometimes unconventional viewpoints and think introspectively. The five minutes at the beginning of each lecture dedicated to guided meditation is evidence of that internal focus.\r\n\r\nSome things to improve, however, may include more opportunities to discuss topics within smaller groups with instructors present. I understand the difficulty of this in a pandemic.",
                "The format of this course is fantastic and allows for questions to arise during the lecture instead of us having to wait through prerecorded videos. The only downside I could think of was very little engagement with our fellow classmates, but the sections did provide some of that.",
                "Some of the many strengths include the presentations and the open-format of the exams. They really allow for the student to show their understanding as opposed to just regurgitating facts. I also appreciated the fact that all the lectures were recorder because they allowed me to go back and review at my pace."

As a result, participation was very high and the discussions were very fulfilling.",

                "The small breakout rooms of three to four individuals during lecture was a great way to discuss some of the material while interacting with other peers in an engaging way. Any more and participation felt incredibly intimidating. Section was also structured nicely to include small-group work. The flash talks were also a good  way to ensure that everyone participated in a set time with plenty of notice to prepare and practice.",

Additionally, the slides were made available online and all the resources were available online through canvas. This was extremely helpful and saved a lot of money for low income students like myself. I think all professors should do this.",
                "She did a good job with sharing the lecture content, providing online reading, and making use of breakout sessions to ensure small group work.",
                "I definitely felt that section helped keep me engaged in the course, and although the weekly discussion questions sometimes snuck up on me, they definitely kept me engaged with our readings.",

                "Yes! I learned more in this class because it simply structured for learning, sometimes it feels redundant but you end up internalizing so much information.",
                "Yes! Please do. It will help pre-med students understand certain health inequalities.",
                "If you want a reasonably interesting science credit with little work this course will work very well for you.",
                "Yes! If you need a science credit but arent a science person, take this course.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed the topics we learnt about, and section was also really good.",
                "Yes, if you are looking to get an intro to bio anthropology",
                "Yes, Professor Valeggia is a great professor and explains many important things very well.",
                "Yeah definitely. If you're looking for a pretty chill SC credit as a non-STEM major, I think this is the good course for you. The material is interesting and very relevant to our daily lives. I also think the professor goes out of her way to make sure all students are learning and enjoying the course. The assignments and grading are all pretty lenient, which makes the course not too stressful.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I will recommend it because it opens you up to the study of human life history and evolution.",
                "Yes! This is one of the best courses for holistic understanding of science.",
                "YES! This course was really enjoyable, and Professor Valeggia is such a kind and compassionate professor. She cares so much for her students, which she demonstrates daily in her teaching style.",
                "Yes, it's a good science credit",
                "ABSOLUTELY! This is an AMAZING course, and I recommend it for anyone! Premeds also have a lot to gain from this course.",
                "Yes! If you want a good science credit that isn't too much work, I would recommend this class. It is definitely not a gut, but it is interesting and a nice fun science credit if you need one. Very applicable to daily life, and useful info even for a non-STEM major.",
                "Yes, this class is amazing and you learn so much, even if you are not an anthropology student. The professor really cares about the students and works to ensure that the class works best for the students.",
                "I really enjoyed this course! I think that all students, both science and social science majors would benefit from this course. As someone with no background in biology who is not stem inclined, this class was still very manageable and engaging. The study of evolutionary human evolutionary biology is extremely important because it allows us to understand the various links between human societies and biology. In learning about topics that are extremely relevant to our lives as human beings, human evolutionary biology can give us the knowledge to make changes in our lives and societies that would engender better health outcomes and higher standards of living.",
                "Definitely! Easiest science course if you hate physics and chemistry like me :)",
                "Yes. Interesting material, great teaching team, not a ton of work but still rewarding.",
                "If you are a non-stem major looking for a science credit, this is the class for you. You learn about the basics of engaging with scientific material, human evolutionary biology as a field, and interesting research that connect to modern issues. The class is exciting but approachable!",
                "Yes, it is a great science credit for a non-science major!! Also, it is a really interesting so would recommend to anyone.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student looking to take a science credit but does not have a background in science. The lectures were very clear to follow and the assessments were open notes so you can spend more time understanding the content than memorizing it.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Valeggia was fantastic and incredibly supportive and welcoming of students.",
                "I would recommend this course to non-STEM students who want a science credit but also want to learn something new about human history and anthropology.",
                "I definitely would! This course overturned so many of my misconceptions about my own body and the human species, and I hope that everyone learns this material at some point in their lives.",
                "If you need a science credit, absolutely. If you want to take a class with a phenomenal professor who genuinely cares about her students, then also absolutely.",
                "Yes! Very highly",
                "This would depend on the interests and goals of that student, but yes. I believe this course would be enriching to humanities majors without much STEM exposure since it aims to build an understanding of the scientific method and how we arrive at scientific findings. Likewise, STEM majors are to benefit as it supplement their learning with social issues surrounding health and medicine.",
                "Yes--especially if they have little knowledge of human evolution or reproductive biology. It is a perfect foundation for understanding our own bodies even if you are not a STEM major.",
                "Definitely! The teaching team are really thoughtful and understanding of the current context and make every effort to be supportive."
