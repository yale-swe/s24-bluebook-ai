I enjoyed the small class format because it gave me a lot of chances to practice speaking. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the texts and films seemed a little dated, and some of the vocabulary from these texts didn't seem totally modern. Also, having both an oral exam and a chapter test in two consecutive classes is too much, I think they should be spread out to separate weeks."

                "CHNS 159 (Advanced Chinese IV through Films and Stories) with Dr. Zhang Yongtao () has been the single best Chinese language class Ive ever taken. I was fortunate enough to take CHNS 158 (Advanced Chinese III through Films and Stories) with Dr. Zhang during this past Fall 22 semester and loved it so much that I decided to continue this semester with CHNS 159 (important to note that the courses stand separately and do not have to be taken consecutively).\r\n\r\nZhang Laoshi is a rockstar who has created an engaging curriculum developed around carefully curated contemporary films and stories spanning multiple genres, geographies and time. If you think you would enjoy watching, dissecting and discussing major and important Chinese language contemporary and popular films, this is the class for you! \r\n\r\nZhang Laoshi has thoughtfully architected a classroom environment that is light, collaborative and fun. Like most L5 courses, there is significant daily work including weekly quizzes, homework, presentations as well as individual and group projects - all of which require time and energy; but the workload never feels onerous and perhaps most importantly, relates directly and grows your ability to engage with the films and stories. Throughout the entire course, Dr. Zhang was always encouraging, supportive and incredibly responsive    an engaged teacher who works tirelessly to provide actionable and helpful feedback and who cares deeply about his students experiences and language progress. At the risk of sounding obsequious, Dr. Zhang is an amazing resource for Yale  he taught at Princeton before coming to New Haven and prior to that, he is the person who helped architect and run the renowned Princeton in Beijing (PIB) program for many years. If you are willing to put in the work, I could not recommend Dr. Zhang and this course (and entire sequence  CHNS 158 and 159) more highly.",
                "Yes. This class is so fun."
