I learned some basics about a variety of types of weapons systems, night vision, radar and sonar, cyber, etc. I have zero engineering background and my last physics course was freshman year of high school; I had to do some initial work on my own to catch up, but I would say it was well worth it and now I'm extra excited to see and work with these systems in the real world outside of the classroom. I would also say that LT Barszowski explained everything very well and very clearly, and someone without a STEM background can manage this course and get a lot out of it."

We got a really solid overview of all the topics, and we were able to ask questions and go into depth into topics in class and in office hours. It is a solid course for students to learn about these topics without needing a STEM background, but to learn them well. For students entering the Navy, I am very happy with what I learned and thing I have a solid foundation from which to learn more before hitting the fleet; it is also a solid foundation from which to do more reading independently from some of the more technical material from the USNI reading materials. LT Barszowski goes out of her way to make sure everyone is happy with their understanding of the material."
