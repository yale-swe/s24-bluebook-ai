I particularly enjoyed the moments for self-driven learning (the midterm and the final projects),  but I felt like this course did not facilitate a lot of student agency over their work."

                "Professor Dugdale's lectures are phenomenal--he is poetic in his descriptions, and works to connect each class topic with contemporary events/structures.",
                "I felt like the professor acknowledged that the long-standing canon of western architecture is narrow in scope when considering the true global development of \"architecture to 1750\" but despite this focused almost solely on that architecture of Europe. I truly appreciated and enjoyed the guest lectures.",
                "The course purports to be a history of architecture pre 1750. Though the class does teach about a handful of sites outside of the European continent, it spends an even long amount of time quasi-complaining about how unjust it is that courses of this caliber don't. I really appreciate the wonderful storytelling and passion that Professor Dugdale has for his lectures but it felt that we spent a lot of time talking about the weaknesses of the syllabus when the department actually could just teach a course with less of those weaknesses.",
                "Mostly strengths. Grading feedback was not entirely clear.",
                "This course was perfect. Easy to follow, super digestible, and the professor was amazing.",
                "I thought the lectures were really interesting and really enjoyed how Professor Dugdale spoke about architecture and buildings. However the class was not particularly concrete and I am not sure I gained any hard knowledge about architectural history but it was definitely an interesting course. The discussion section was definitely the main weakness of this course.",
                "I didn't find the lecture to be as engaging as I would have liked. Even when questions were asked to the class people weren't very eager to respond.",
                "I really enjoyed the course but I personally would prefer it if we talked about more examples that demonstrate the topics we are addressing instead of focusing in one or two sites per topic.",
                "For what this course needs to bethat is, a rather topical survey of architectural history that necessarily is biased in favor of some architectures and omits others as a resultthe professors and TFs do the best that they can. The strength of this course is in the amount of material you cover, and the weakness is in the fact that this analysis has breadth but, I would argue, little depth. I think it could be improved by straying farther from the textbook, which for many weeks was the least interesting reading and promotes this sort of surface-level learning (and indeed, I doubt I'll remember a good deal of what this course covers).",
                "Professor Dugdale created a very intriguing atmosphere for class",
                "Lectures could tend to be boring and seemed to drag on a bit on certain topics and also felt it was structured pretty randomly. Section was engaging and helped relate critical questions to the lecture slides.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Dugdale is an engaging lecturer and a very clever speaker. His class really helped me think about new ways to talk and write about architecture. Weaknesses: I had a number of frustrations with this course. 1) Despite being marketed as global architecture to 1750, the focus is overwhelmingly on Europe. 2) Certain lectures were highly esoteric and became difficult to follow during the latter half of class.",
                "material had nothing to do with assignments",
                "I enjoyed the lectures as well as the section. However, it would have been nice to have some more field trips and outdoors tours of architecture.",
                "Strengths -- I really enjoyed the selected supplemental readings. They were lively and snappy. I also enjoyed Kyle's speaking style. He orates quite eloquently, and if you can approach the class like \"I'm going to an interesting lecture where I can -- at the very least -- marvel at the rhetorical ability of my teaching team\" then the class is interesting. I also really loved my TF, Sharon. She brought specific knowledge to our section, was humbly honest when we were learning together, and was a great TF. Finally, I really enjoyed the one time that Kyle brought us outside to look at the \"stone-iness\" of the walk outside Loria going to Gypsy. Kyle was totally geeking out, and it was so fun. I would love to see more of that! (And also, I think this points to a larger limitation of the course. Yale Arch. requires a survey history course. Someone has to teach it. It sometimes felt like Kyle did not fully love the material. The stone-iness walk was a clear indication of what it loos like when he is stoked about something, which was awesome, but also made other parts of the semester feel obligatory by comparison.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- I found the guest lectures to be pretty hit-or-miss. While some where interesting (I particularly enjoyed the Hagia Sophia one), others were less captivating. I found myself comparing the public speaking ability of the guest lecturers to Kyle's -- and that was a recipe for disappointment. One point of suggestion for you, Kyle,  is to allow a 5-10 minute question window at the end of his own lectures. You clearly understand the pedagogical importance of Q&A periods (as evidenced by your preference for Q&As at the. end of the guest lectures), so I was confused when you did not give yourself the same opportunity to facilitate student engagement."

They build off the \"content\" of the week, which is the reading, so you should do the reading before the lectures, if you don't already have a basic understanding of the content for the week. If you don't get the theme of the lecture (it isn't explicit), then the lectures might seem like random assortments of insights into the architectural style/movement that you study that week. That said, if you do get what the professor is trying to convey, architecture starts to feel a little magical.",

                "I would recommend this course to people interested in architecture history, but don't expect a survey course. The textbook is essential to fill in all the formal stuff like dates and variety of buildings.",
                "No. I had to take it for my major, and I think that is the case for many, but if it weren't required I would recommend an architectural history course that is focused on one specific topic and thus teaches you about the topic in a great deal more depth.",
                "Yes.",

                "yes",
                "If you don't have to take it for the major but are curious to learn about architecture , I would say you're much better off taking other survey courses in architectural history (Elihu Rubin's American Architecture and Urbanism or Kishwar Rizvi's Intro to Islamic Architecture are both fantastic).",
                "no unless you're an architecture major (requirement)",
                "Absolutely! If you want a general overview of different architectural styles and their history, I would take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to 3. categories of prospective students: someone who has a general interest in arch. history, someone who is an arch major (it is required for design and HTC tracks), and someone who wants to be able to bette understand the cities they live in (or visit throughout their lives). \r\n\r\nHowever, one caveat that I'll mention is that if you are looking for an architectural history course as a course to learn generally about the field and then be able to apply it to your walks around NHV or other cities/landscapes, then I think that ARCH 150 (Alexander Purves Introduction to Architecture) or ARCH 280 (Elihu Rubin American Architecture Urbanism) do a better job at facilitating the \"excitement\" and \"wow! this is changing the way I see things!\"."
