This course gives exposure to a large field within chemical engineering that I believe other courses neglect to touch upon.",

Additionally, I developed skills needed in the design process for any project in the field of engineering thanks to the large design project at the end of the course.",

                "Professor Vanderlick is a key strength of this course. She is an expert in the field, and there is no one better suited to teach this course. Another strength of this course is the breadth of the content: it gives a great introduction to many different aspects of interfaces. The content is also organized in such a way that you always understand where the specifics of the material lies in the broader scope of the field. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the course is the varying difficulty of the material. The course is advertised as an elective for all years (sophomores-seniors). However, the material requires a decent amount of existing knowledge (thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, etc). This makes it difficult to cater to all years, as some time is taken out of the class to devote to explaining the basics.",
                "I think that this course was really well organized. We had weekly problem sets that coincided well with the material we were working on. There were no weaknesses that I can think of.",
                "This class was well thought out and structured. The material from the first half of the class helped to establish the base line for the final design project. It was fun to work in groups and design a real product!",
                "I think the strengths of this course include the fact that it's an elective without any exams and relatively fun and laid back projects where you get to work with others. Also, I enjoyed meeting with mentors a couple times through the semester to discuss our final project. I think the weaknesses of this course is that while there were answers uploaded for each hw assignment, we received no feedback on our assignments and didn't know what was being marked off. This made it hard to know what we were doing wrong.",
                "Dr Vanderlick always has a flexible schedule for office hours and due dates which helps students immensely in juggling their semester courses. No weaknesses in the course really.",
                "A project based course with no exams and a very clear grading system given to us in the beginning and followed through during the semester? This was an incredible class, the only weakness was that it was kind of very technical at times, mainly towards the end of the course, and while I could do the math, the concepts were extremely hard to understand. Besides that, this class was amazing."

The content is interesting, and you learn a lot about the history of chemical engineering as well!",

Dr Vanderlick is an awesome, hilarious professor who clearly loves engaging with students during lecture and motivating learning. If any background knowledge is required on a certain topic that is not listed as a prerequisite for the course, Dr. V will surely cover it and provide students with the necessary material to learn effectively in the course. Awesome professor!!",
