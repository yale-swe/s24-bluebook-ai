                "A familiarity with Machiavelli's Prince and Discourses and some of the major questions that generations (Spinoza, Rousseau, Hegel, Fichte, Viroli, McCormick, Baron, Strauss, Gramsci, Althusser) have asked about this work. Sticking with one author for a whole semester gave me an ability to see connections and tease out major themes and develop my own interpretation of a body of work. Working with Livy as well helped me understand the form of Machiavelli's political theory in its relation to history.",
                "I developed my ability to analyze texts in comparison to each other pick out the most complex pieces. I also significantly improved my ability to write longer length essays.",
                "You learn a lot about Machiavelli though the second portion of the course could focus on less of his readers",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of Machiavelli's thought and his impact on the history of intellectual thought. The two papers also provided helpful opportunities to receive feedback on my writing.",
                "In this course, we took a deep dive into the seminal works of Machiavelli's career, as well those of a smattering of the most prominent interpreters of his writing. I was already familiar with Machiavelli going into the course, but over the course of the semester, I gained a newfound appreciation for the complexity, brilliance, and influence of his writing. I am left with my own interpretation of Machiavelli but also with the recognition that he can be read in drastically different ways and how he is interpreted likely depends at least in part on the individual's personal political philosophy."

                "Prof Smith is an excellent professor, but I think the theme of the course just wasn't for me. Also, the class was a bit disorganized: we didn't get the syllabus until a few weeks in, some assignments were wrong or missing, and he didn't tell us when our two 10-12 page papers would be due at the beginning of the semester which would have been really helpful for planning. It was also a little stressful not knowing how exactly grades were calculated, since that information wasn't on the syllabus, we had to write discussion posts every week in response to the reading but there were no word limits given and it wasn't clear how they would affect our grades.",
                "The course was a little too large for optimal discussions, and I would also suggest that it be restricted to undergraduates.",
                "I thought the strength of the course was the engagement of the students and the writing feedback. One weakness was that the discussion was sometimes a little disjointed because we would all want to talk, so we would have to make a queue instead of building off of each other.",
                "It is not a course that is extremely friendly to beginners, most of the students seemed to have extensive prior exposure to Machiavelli and other prominent philosophers. could be more accessible.",
                "Overall, I really enjoyed the selection of readings. However, once we moved past Machiavelli's own works and to his readers, discussing multiple somewhat related readings in one week may not have been the best approach: I felt spread too thin, with the volume and breadth of the readings. In the beginning, reading Burckhardt was very helpful for establishing the culture and history of the Renaissance in Italy in Machiavelli's time, but we rarely discussed that reading or the Livy, despite their designation as primary readings. Professor Smith gave wonderful lectures or remarks at the beginning of every class, and I wish we could've heard some more from him. He was also very available for meetings, which was always helpful.",
                "The level of discussion in this seminar was higher than any other I've experienced at Yale. The syllabus allocated enough time to The Prince and The Discourses to allow us to thoroughly analyze those centerpieces of Machiavelli's political thought, although there is always more to discuss. I thought the latter half of the syllabus was a little too ambitious in the number of different works it assigned each week, and it left us without sufficient time to discuss those works as deeply as I would have liked."

                "I would not unless youre passionate about Machiavelli. It is a course to read his works, but not to learn or grow from yourself as a writer or student of political philosophy",
                "Yes, if you'd like to learn more about a Machiavelli that goes beyond his popular caricature as a wicked and manipulative teacher of tyrants.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in studying modern political theory further since Machiavelli is such an influential figure in it. This is an intense and demanding course with a heavy reading load, but it is well worth it for those who put in the work."
