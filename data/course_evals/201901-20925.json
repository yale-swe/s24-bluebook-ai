    "Strengths: Same every week, know what to expect \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were elements that we were told we did not need to learn in French 110 that the professor expected we know for French 120 so there is a clear divide there. Also, the classes are spent WAY more on the videos than 110 which is kind of annoying since we were learning so much grammar. We would spend 5 minutes re watching the same 10 seconds of the video or having technical difficulties but only 30 seconds talking about important grammatical concepts. Our section also had much worse grades than other sections so keep that in mind.",
    "The pace of the course was a strength, but I wish we had more time to speak in class. Also, class participation was extremely stressful.",
    "Too much homework, it ruined the level of focus I spent learning the material as I was just trying to get it done."

    "If you are on the French track, might as well take it. I would not say I would \"recommend\" it, but then again if you are taking this class it is probably to just get through your language requirement or because you actually want to\/need to learn French.",
    "The course was worth taking, but I had a difficult time finding common ground with my instructor.",
    "Yes, but I would tell them that it is hard."
