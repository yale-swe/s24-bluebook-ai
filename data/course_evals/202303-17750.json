Also got to practice writing a theoretical paper, building on the frameworks of sound change we discussed during the semester.",
                "In this class I learned many theories about historical sound change. I learned about how the theoretical discussions surrounding sound change have themselves changed over time, and I have seen these theories applied to a diverse array of languages, from South Paamese to ancient Greek to English to Shanghainese. Through the final assignment, I also learned how to properly write a long-form linguistics paper for the final project in this class, and I learned how to prepare a conference poster and conference abstract."

                "Strengths: format of the course works really well. It was really nice to be able to discuss all the theories and argue and counter-argue with them. Also good that every week, two people got to serve as discussion leaders, which I think forced us to engage with the material on a deeper level. Additionally, I think Professor Bowern did a really good job of leading discussion in meaningful and interesting directions while simultaneously giving us time to argue our own perspectives.",
                "Strengths: I appreciate how, along the way of learning the curriculum in this class, Dr. Bowern prepared us with practical academic skills like how to present at a conference and how to write an abstract. These are skills that I haven't really honed in any other classes, so it is good to have this training worked into the syllabus of a class. The readings were also very well-curated. I like that we learn everything by reading papers, not with a textbook.\r\nWeakness: Classes were typically led by two student \"experts\" rather than by Professor Bowern. While I think student leadership works very well in seminars, this class was only 7 students, and not everyone showed up every week. As a result, one of the days I had to lead seminar only 4 students were present, so it was just me and my co-leader trying to start conversation when we only had 2 students and one professor to go off of. Even when we had all students present, sometimes people were timid so conversation didn't go very far; it often felt like one or two students were doing most of the talking. So, while I really like the idea of student co-leaders, I think this class might have been a bit too small or too shy for it to work very smoothly."

                "Definitely would recommend. The content is really interesting, and I feel like I came away with a better understanding of both theories of sound change and how to write a theoretical paper. But be warned that there are between 50-60 pages of reading weekly (honestly it's not that bad, and genuinely quite interesting), and a looming paper at the end of the term. Definitely get started on it earlier than I did!",
