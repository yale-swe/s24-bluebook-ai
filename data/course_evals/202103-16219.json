Through that engagement, I came to better understand Deaf culture and its complexities. I feel like a better ally leaving this course!",

                "I think the main strength is the attention to language immerse built into the curriculum I think this is why I was able to learn so quickly. One weakness I would say would be the structure of the course closer to the end. I think there are still some things that need to be worked out logistically with the final project, but it ended up working eventually in the end.",
                "This course benefitted greatly from its asynchronous programming on Fridays. I also really enjoyed the service project as it highlighted important issues while also being a good academic project. I think that one way this course could be improved is by finding a way to take better notes.",
                "This course is almost entirely strengths. Andrew maintained a phenomenal balance in terms of utilizing different vessels for learning. For example, class was consistently split between lessons which delivered to the entire class, and then additional  communication with other classmates via groups of pairs. We also played many games which were highly relevant to what we had learned in class recently. While these games were quite fun, they truly served to reinforce the concepts which we had been learning in class. I really don't have any suggestions on how the course could be improved, I would simply suggest that this course proceed almost entirely as is in its current format.",
                "Everything about this course was engaging; I felt I was constantly learning and growing as an ASL signer. The only critique I have is that communication in terms of assignments, quizzes, etc. could have been a bit clearer. I recognize that this was Professor Fisher's first semester and it was a learning curve for all of us. Just something to note going forward, but still an amazing course!",
                "I think a clearer way of giving deadlines and assignments would be helpful. I felt like I was often playing catch up because I wasnt sure when quizzes or projects were due or what they were. Also for the service project it would be helpful to get more info earlier on."

                "Yes, I honestly came into this semester dreading having to complete my language requirement. In hindsight, ASL 110 was my favorite course this semester. I am thrilled that I was able to enroll in this course, and join what is a rapidly-growing, wonderful ASL community here at Yale.",
                "Yes, 100%. I don't think I would've had such a great experience with any other language at Yale."
