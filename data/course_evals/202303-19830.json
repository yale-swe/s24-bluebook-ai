Learned a lot about Latin American history and culture, from art, to poems, to customs and practices, to current issues. The cultural exploration in this course was really valuable"

                "I did not learn any grammar in class, which was frustrating because class almost felt pointless when the real learning came from supersite. The homework on VHL often wanted super specific answers. This caused answers that were not wrong to be marked wrong because it was not exactly what supersite wanted. Because of this, I think it is unfair to use the VHL work as a homework grade. Being in class five days a week was overkill.",
                "I dont know of any specific weaknesses but having the course be conducted in Spanish was definitely a strength.",
                "The variety of content we learned (both vocabulary and grammar) were interesting and kept me engaged. However, the class felt a little disorganized in the beginning and it was hard to figure out where assignments were posted as well as what the professor expected of us at times. The daily class assignments weren't strenuous, but the group projects (the cultural project and the play) were challenging in the sense that we were expected to be able to do research in Spanish, while still learning basic tenses and grammar. The immersion was good but sometimes felt out of the reasonable scope of our ability as L2 students still getting acquainted with Spanish.",
                "It seemed a bit unorganized at times and expectations for work and assignments and tests were not made clear.",
                "Strengths: Well organized, emphasis on speaking practice, variety in assignment type, lots of group work\r\nWeaknesses: limited writing practice relative to speaking in class, limited professor feedback (I felt in Spanish 110 the professor intentionally sought to communicate what we needed to improve on to be successful in using the language)"

                "Maybe. I think it depends on how comfortable you feel with Spanish. I had a lot of experience with Spanish going into this class so I felt like it was manageable, but without additional experience I think this class could be harder than expected for some. Overall it's still a good course.",
                "Yes. Learning Spanish is a very useful tool for your life.",
                "Yes! You will probably have to take it. It is a lot of \"busy\" work, but you learn the value in routine practice to effectively learn the Spanish language"
