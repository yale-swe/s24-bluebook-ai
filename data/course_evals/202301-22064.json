Homework only really requires students to find the relevant piece of class code and make a few edits to make it work in their code. Although more work, I would prefer more homework like the final project, where students are given less direction and have to understand the methods well enough to know how to apply them.",

                "The statistics materials covered in this class is really comprehensive and I am fairly confident that I can tell meaningful things from every dataset I may acquire using a plethora of tools. There's a nice focus on the strengths and limitations of each tool and in which occasions they may be applicable.\r\n\r\nThis class is too big and there's really no sense of engagement. Everyone's just doing their own stuff. The office hours are not easy to keep track of and keep changing. Towards the end of the term, few ed discussion questions get answered.\r\n\r\nYou learn coding \"the statistician's way\"if you are more well-versed with CS and takes technical terms very seriously, you will be deeply saddened by some of the misconceptions in class (like how some regex syntaxes work, or what \"objects\" are, etc.) You walk away with the knowledge of producing templates of R code but you don't really learn R as a language.\r\n\r\nBecause the course is so undemanding, the curve gets really harsh and in the end many starts worrying about their grades. Your grades will not be correlated with how much you know the material because the scores are all taken off from minute details like text running off the graph boundaries.",
                "Strength - JDRS is an excellent prof and makes the course very accessible. You can seamlessly transition between in-person, synchronous online, and asynchronous online with no trouble at all.\r\n\r\nWeakness - The TAs and ULAs are terrible about office hours. So so many of them get moved or cancelled at the last minute, sometimes without any announcement. Don't bet on office hours occurring when they're scheduled.",
                "I think the class is structured so that you really don't have to learn anything. You don't have to go to lectures, you can just copy from class codes for psets, there's only take-home open book exams and final projects. It's really chill, but unless you take initiative, you don't really learn much.",
                "Strengths - Flexibility of delivery, the prof is really good\r\nWeakness - Limited feedback on problem sets",
                "Bruv, I know you want the whole remote thing, and I think it's great because otherwise I couldn't have taken this course. But it is really really really really hard to actually commit to a fully remote class. STUDENTS READING THIS: GO IN PERSON!!!\r\n\r\nstrengths: very clear lesson plans that teach you exactly what they say they will. I appreciated JDRS' silly little jokes. project is really fun.\r\nweaknesses: difficulty to stay locked in remotely. no actual incentive to learn the math (other than love of the game)\r\nboth strength and weakness: Psets and exams are very much just tests of can you replicate what we did in class  and you're given the notes to do that. So they're pretty trivial.",

                "This course had many weaknesses. I feel like I just got through this class rather than feeling like I truly grew as a statistics student, so I am disappointed by this. I think the asynchronous format could become more interactive rather than solely being videos so that students actually feel like they are learning while consuming class content.",

                "The best part was gaining practice and code from class and psets that I can use for my research.  This class feels very useful. I appreciated the flexibility in timing. The main area for improvement is making grading more about mastery of concept and less about attention to detail.",

I also really like that this course offers various formats; students can take it in-person, via Zoom, or through previously recorded videos.\r\nI don't really see any weaknesses in this course. Great class!",
                "Strengths = asynchronous, many resources to go back to for the psets, office hours that are helpful and accessible for the most part. \r\nWeaknesses = high work load, there is a pset every week that it sometimes becomes difficult to work on it AND go to office hours to get questions answered. Sometimes there are exams and psets due around the same time. \r\nI think it could be improved by giving more time in between the p sets. For the asynchronous option, I also think that the videos could be more concise because it takes a lot of time to go through.",
                "I think this course is very good because it offers flexibility for students to learn at their time convenience. However, given this course can be fully remote, the ed discussion board becomes very important in helping students out. There are quite some time that students post questions about concepts or homework in ed board but the TA did not response within 3 days. This definitely puzzled me given there are so many TA for this course.",
                "Strengths: asynchronous so it's really flexible and can do the work on your own time, workload is not overwhelming. Weaknesses: TAs / ULAs can be pretty slow in answering questions on Ed. They are also quite slow in grading which was really stressful at the end of the semester when I didn't know my exam 2 grade so I CDF'd the class but found out over a week later that I ended up doing well on it....also the grading is very very picky.",
                "This course was offered entirely asynchronous; while JDRS is a fabulous professor and I am certain the live lectures were engaging, being able to stop the recording and have the code on your computer all at the same time was really helpful.",
                "I think the asynchronous format and overall structure of the class is fantastic, but some kids abuse it since they can copy off of last year's p-sets. I wish that psets changed more from year to year to favor students who actually went to lecture to learn.",
                "This class is a very solid introduction to R. It wasn't always exciting, but I learned a lot and am much more comfortable with the R platform.",
                "I like that the professor offers the option to take it asynchronously. It was very easy to keep up with the assignments without having to make it to every 9 AM class. One weakness of the course was that the TAs often delayed their office hours last minute, making it more difficult to connect with them.",
                "Strengths:\r\nHelped me quickly gain understanding of R and how data can be transformed, parsed, etc. major weakness : the grading system and extreme down-curve since everyone does well in the class.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material. The videos were really helpful. Weaknesses: The pacing of the course was a little too fast. The final project was also a mess.",
                "The strengths are how organize the class was and how everything felt doable because of how much support there was from office hours.",
                "It was way too asynchronous for me. I like in person and that was hard.",
                "Strengths: I liked that the course was asynchronous because you could learn at your own pace. It made the workload very manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think that the teaching staff was very responsive on Ed discussion. I also did not like the grading system for the final projects.",
                "add some labs",
                "The grading of the final project was very problematic. I understand the class is large and there is the expectation to get final grades out in time, but peer grading the final project is not the best way to cumulatively assess how much we learned the semester. The rubric was like a checklist of items needed to be included on the project, but did not truly assess knowledge of correct biostatistical application. Furthermore, some classmates very obviously did not read through the entire final project and so did not give an accurate grade.",
                "Strengths: thorough; covers breadth of topics. Weaknesses: unengaging at times; lack of variation in work.",
                "It's very flexible in terms of schedules and really light workload, but I doubt if I would still remember things I learned in the class. A lot of homework were just copying lecture codes and I did not find that helpful in developing one's own way thinking.",
                "Strengths: helps you learn a programming language if you put in effort\r\nWeaknesses: asynchronous nature and the fact that the psets are the same year to year means that it's super easy to stop doing any of the work and fall really behind",
                "too much workload",
                "The worst thing about the course, is that no matter how well you learn the content or how well you do on the assignments, the amount of people that do well is way too high for you to get a good grade",
                "It was really hard to keep myself accountable with watching lectures and going over class material.",
                "I think the flexibility of this class is amazing. All of the lectures are pre-recorded and the live ones are recorded as well. I wish that the live class took place during the 4-5:15pm slot instead of at 9am in Marsh because I think more people would attend in the afternoon. There are also tons of office hours throughout the week and the problem sets are very straightforward. Weaknesses are the live class time and the lack of clarity regarding final project grading.",
                "super good",
                "This course had a completely asynchronous option, which was useful if I ever needed to skip in-person lectures. The homework assignments are very closely tied to lecture material, which was a strength as I was able to learn how to apply what I learned. One weakness was that it was difficult getting access to help from course staff during some weeks.",
                "absolutely no integrity of the students in this class, the peer grading system for the final project is horrible, class size should be smaller w multiple sections to encourage actual learning, some pset grades were posted super late not enough time to make adjustments for next homework",
                "The course being asynchronous was very helpful at times, at others though it felt a little disjointed as I didn't really meet in person with anyone for the entire semester.",
                "Strength well organized\r\nWeakness: not much engagement",
                "Totally remote, easy A but you learn nothing and they take off points for the dumbest things because otherwise everyone gets 100",
                "Strengths: well-organized, interesting content, lots of help available",
                "Structured well.",
                "JDRS is a goat professor",
                "The homework is too much, even though they are very good practice materials.",
                "Strengths: great introduction to R\r\nWeaknesses: not really many opportunities for learning. Most of the homeworks involved using code directly from lecture. Some more exploratory assignments like the final project would have been helpful for more real world applications. Very petty and inconsistent grading.",
                "I like that the class is fully remote. It helps students keep up at their own pace. The homeworks keep you in check. However, I think there should be one or two late day exception. Everything with regard to homework submission seemed to be so strict",
                "strength: great professor and learnt a lot in R",
                "Strengths: Very flexible (asynchronous)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly since I didn't have a super strong stats background in the past, I kind of just copied the code from class notes into my assignment. I don't feel like I gained a super deep understanding of stats.",
                "Honestly, the final project was hectic and the peer grading made it terribly disorganized. However, JDRS handled everything  with grace.",
                "The strength is that JDRS is a great professor and there is an option for students to take this asynchronously, which allows for maximum flexibility. The weakness is that it is often difficult to engage students who are asynchronous when there are pre-recorded lectures already.",
                "Weakness: too much of a big class. Very difficult to know what is going on towards the end. Especially there are a lot of blindspots in the final project grading. Since there are no in person exams, you dont really try to learn things.",
                "The lectures are always interesting, as are the examples. It is asynchronous which gives you full autonomy over when you do your work.",
                "The remote format really helps this course. The code and lecture slides are very well made. Psets are legit: great at helping learning.",
                "Strengths: indepth knowledge and exploration of data analysis skills\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: although it strives to be an intro class to R programming, it's somehow difficult to understand the code walkthrough because the instructor doesn't do a good job of explaining why some things happen in the code. At most times I felt like I just copied over code from class rather than do it myself",
                "Strengths: a lot of office hours\r\nWeaknesses: too high proximity between final assignments",
                "Strengths: This course is highly flexible as it can be done entirely asynchronously. There are a multitude of resources for help (the Zoom office hours were a little unpredictable for my tastes, but the Ed board has been a lifesaver). It offers a comprehensive introduction into working with data in R, and Professor JDRS uses engaging examples to illustrate the concepts.\r\nWeaknesses: The marking scheme for the psets is unclear at times - points that werent asked in the question (e.g including titles) might be deducted anyways. The final project peer grading led to frustration and unfairness both on the side of the grader and the one being graded, since we were only able to see the report and not the source code.",
                "strength: professor was great, no exam but a lot of homework, which I think gained me a lot of coding practices",
                "I really liked how there were a handful of ways to engage with lectures and office hours. I watched lecture videos so I could pause, and reviewed notes, which is a system that worked well for me. I found that in-person office hours were the most helpful to me, but I liked that there were different options for asking questions.",
                "Strengths: You do come out of it with a working understanding of R, although it is not very in-depth ie. you don't always know why an error occurs and you do rely heavily on example code. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class works best if you already have the stats theory. It is more difficult if you are looking at these stat theory elements for the first time ever.",
                "none",
                "I think this course is strong in its options given to students for in-person and asynchronous, as well as resources in beginning stats if there are topics you need to brush up on.",
                "Nice",
                "It is completely asynchronous if you want, which always poses the issue of engagement and discipline. While I was fully responsible for that, I didn't always engage the material as much as I needed to. I found the PSETS to be very reflective of what we learned in class, and I liked that there was constant help available due to TA's/office hours. Sometimes, the TA wouldn't show up to office hours. It'd be helpful to have clearer checklists for common stats processes/questions to help us understand exactly what we need to include in our homework (especially on explanations).",
                "excellent",
                "Strengths: Class format, assignment directions, grading.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TA office hour consistency.",
                "Weaknesses: ambiguity following the final project and how it would affect grades",
                "I think that it shouldnt be asynchronous and should be taught at a later time with sections because it can be very confusing. Also the grading curve is really rough so if you are doing this course and need to worry about gpa i would recommend dont take this class as its curve though he doesnt tell you until like the last week of class is very rough and its really hard to get an A in this course if you dont basically get a perfect score on everything",
                "I appreciated how straightforward the homeworks were and how they connected directly to the lectures. However the peer grading for the final project seemed really arbitrary and seemed to only work to make the curve. Also, the TFs frequently canceled or changed their office hours.",
                "I thought the HW was directly related to the concepts learned in lecture. I liked the flexibility of the class and lectures. I also appreciated all the office hours that were available to us. \r\n\r\nI thought the grading was sometimes arbitrary and expectations were unclear, so more transparent rubrics or expectations would be helpful. Also the office hours schedule was never consistent and TFs would often postpone or cancel with little to no warning.",
                "The strength of this course were the plethora of different strategies which students may use to learn in this course. As someone who does not wake up for 9am lectures, the ability to watch pre-recorded lectures at my own pace was incredibly conducive to my learning in this course. A second strength involves the plethora of resources available to help you succeed in this course, including plenty of office hours each week. The major weakness of this course involved the final project. It felt like the guidelines were scrapped together at the last minute without much thought. Rather than receiving a grade from the Professor on this assignment, we were instead peer-graded by three students in the class. I do not think this is all that fair as students have highly differing viewpoints for what constitutes a good final project, even with a common rubric, and thus there is no baseline for comparing how well a student actually did on a given project. As this class was incredibly systematized in a seamless fashion up until this point, this last minute project chaos was disappointing.",
                "The class is good at teaching R and easy to complete.",
                "I really appreciated the flexibility of the course with the available module videos, live captures, slides, and r markdown files all made available. They were very useful to look back on as a reference and helped me reinforce some of the topics I needed more time on. All the available office hours were another great thing since you really need a TF or the professor when doing the problem sets. Sometimes the problem sets felt inconsistent with the module it was supposed to follow so I had to rely on the internet for solving the problems required. I think there could be an improvement in including more of what is in the module in the problem sets could help students learn more from the actual course than relying on the internet.",
                "Very dense homeworks that address the material well, but the homework questions are some times ambiguous, and if possible more time allowed for the final project would be helpful.",
                "I think this course is already really good. There are plenty of materials and resources available to facilitate learning."

                "Yes.",
                "I would recommend this if you want to do statistics and learn something slightly more advanced than t-tests. I would not recommend this if you like CS and want to learn R as a language. You would be better off using other learning materials.",
                "Yes if you're looking for a QR to cover the basics of what you need to understand social science research",

                "Absolutely! You learn practical stuff and improve or learn R programming and Statistics",
                "Yeah, sure. I mean realistically, you're probably taking this course as some sort of requirement for Stats major/certificate or like a PLSC/EPE/ECON major. But I think it's fun. If you have any amount of analytical dawg in you, it's super fun to poke around and play with data. I really enjoyed it. But don't expect it to be the most exciting in terms of the class part.",
                "Yes, this class teaches students lots of data analysis techniques.",

                "Yes. Workload is good, course is well organized.",

                "Yes, I think this course is fun to listen to and we can learn practical skills from it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it if you're interested in learning how to use R in a pretty chill environment.",
                "If interested in learning R. Good for that purpose, although not a fun class in my opinion (still worthwhile to pick up that skill though)",
                "Great way to learn R and build some statistical foundations.",
                "Yes, JRDS is kinda a Yale celebrity because he is such a fun character. You gotta have that experience at least once. Also, a yale 100 level class will prepare you for this wayyyyyy more than AP stat if you don't already have coding experience. The TAs are a bit nit-picky on the things they take off points for which can get a bit silly. But overall worth it to have an asynch class which we desperately need more of here at yale.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! If you are interested in statistics or R at all, this is a really helpful and important introduction. It was fairly consistent work with regular psets and take home exams, but there is so much support and guidance available.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning basic stats and improving R skills.",
                "Yes, definitely.  R is crucial to any sort of science or social science that would require statistic analysis, and this class is a great introduction to R.",

                "It's a good class for basic stats concepts and it's not hard to do well in the course if you stay on top of the material...at least I don't think it's hard to do well but the peer grading system for the final project is very disorganized and as I'm writing this there is 1 hour until senior grades are due and we still don't have our final project grades yet.",

It covers key concepts and provides you with the necessary skills to work with data, conduct statistical tests, and perform regression and correlation analysis. Additionally, the inclusion of best practices, data cleaning techniques, and visualization tools like ggplot2 can be valuable for practical data analysis.",
                "Yes! definitely. I think the skill you learn is pretty useful and it is taught well. I think the grading is a little too particular, for example, you can easily lose points for very small things in psets which takes away from the fundamentals of being able to use R.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students of any majors. Data is a part of life for everyone, and is becoming an even larger part, and thus learning how to better interpret data models is a skill which is tremendously beneficial in the modern world.",
                "Yeah, if you want to learn r take this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student looking to get more familiar with R code and especially apply statistical analysis to their coding for the first time. It is a beginner friendly course and helped me start my interest in doing data analysis with coding.",
                "Yes! Great intro to R with breadth and depth",
