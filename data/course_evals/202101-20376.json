Professor Barringer is fantastic and engaging professor, and his deep knowledge of and familiarity with the material always led to interesting anecdotes and great discussions, despite the online format. My only critique is that we didn't address approaches to aesthetic theory at all-- I would have liked to have read Burke, Reynolds, Hegel, etc.",
                "The course does a great job of interrogating all of the methods we learn, so that we can learn to be critical of the approaches themselves. It spends a great amount of time on each different approach and builds knowledge that we could apply throughout the semester.",

I would have loved to engage with the art in real life in the museums and galleries of Yale, but since that could not happen this semester, the course was the best it could have possibly been."
