By the end, I felt like I had a good grasp on the plot, themes, and music of almost every one of his shows. I also feel like I have a much stronger ability to critique theater and understand how it works. I always wondered what the big deal with Sondheim was, and I definitely have a grasp on his importance in musical theater and why I should care.",
                "Learned a lot about Sondheims music and how to analyze musicals",
                "Developed a great understanding of the work of Stephen Sondheim. Great chance to learn more about his work and the history of musical theater.",
                "Learned to talk about the ways that Sondheims shows work and talk about the techniques and trends that go throughout",
                "I learned how to be confident in my abilities and to give myself permission to share my thoughts and opinions in class. Gained so much knowledge about the musical theater traditions and learned a new way of analyzing Sondheim's work. Learned how to talk about and analyze music as it relates to character and theater.",
                "We learned a lot about the general history of American Musical Theater (to build context for Sondheim), Stephen Sondheim's life, his early work in lyrics, and his work as a composer. Read about lyrics, set design, music, orchestration, and just about every aspect of theater as it related to Sondheim. We also learned a good amount about his collaborators (Hal Prince, Jonathan Tunic, and more) which I really appreciated",
                "A working knowledge of the shows of Stephen Sondheim in their theatrical and cultural contexts, as well as the ability to analyze them for dramatic effect.",

                "This was one of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale. I learned so much about Sondheim, his work, techniques, and influence on the American musical theatre canon, but I also learned how to more closely analyze a script and score with a critical eye.",
                "How to critically analyze a musical; how each element in a show makes it work or not",

                "I loved the structure of the course, where we focused on two shows each week and then after spring break focused on different themes. I appreciate all the discussion and also the way Prof. Egan tries to steer it. He does a very careful job of selecting a group of students with a variety of perspectives. He does cold call, but not too frequently and is pretty forgiving if you don't have an answer. He also took us to see a musical on Broadway!!",
                "Great curriculum and material. Dan does an awesome job structuring this course!",
                "There is a lot of work, but it is really worth it.",
                "I felt the beginning half moved us very very fast through the shows, but we were able to talk much more in depth about shows in the second half, which alleviated my concerns.",
                "Strengths: Professor Egan, the discussions, the readings, the works. Weaknesses: can sometimes be a lot of readings and viewings, but they are all very interesting, so really none!",
                "No weaknesses from my experience! Great format in which we focused on a couple of shows every week for the first half then brought it together with topic focused discussions in the second half",
                "I enjoyed the organization of the semester into two parts, and I thought this structure was very effective. I was most engaged as a discussion leader and felt disappointed that I only got one chance to take on that role adding discussion leader slots to the first half of the semester as well could be a great way to get students more engaged earlier on and to set expectations for class prep.  \r\n\r\nI also loved getting to hear my classmates perform a Sondheim song, and I wonder if a creative project or extra-credit opportunity might be added, or in-class performane otherwise incorporated into the schedule.",
                "An almost perfect course.",
                "The organization of the first half of the semester was great -- the focus on the shows themselves was very exciting. The second half felt a bit wavering. I wish there had been clearer \"takeaways\" for each class -- sometimes the ideas bled into one another too much.",
                "I cant think of any weaknesses! I loved this class: the readings were fascinating, as were our discussions. I learned so much from Professor Egan and my peers.",
                "Very participation heavy, but also very open ended!",
                "The strengths were in my classmates who had such wonderful and nuanced perspectives on Sondheim's works and whom I learned so much from about music, acting, and analytical ways to examine Sondheim.  The readings and viewings were really interesting and insightful.  I wish this course met twice a week so we could really dive deep into the two musicals we covered each week.  I wish students who had the topic of the week for the second half of the course led the discussion as opposed to Dan leading the discussion."

                "Absolutely, it is taught with passion, and it's honestly just interesting. I highly recommend.",
                "Yes! If you like musical theater, this is the class you should take.",
                "YES! If you have the chance, take this course. Professor Egan is phenomenal and the rapport built in the class was so wonderful. The material is extremely engaging and I feel like I really expanded my general analytical and discussion skills while learning about such a niche and interesting topic. The readings and viewings were so entertaining and I loved listening to all of the scores. 10/10 would recommend.",
                "ABSOLUTELY!!! this was one of my favorite classes and I'd definitely recommend to both people very into theater and people who just dabble. The depth of discussion and everyone's passion around the topic is truly amazing",
                "Yes, absolutely! Set aside plenty of time to do the readings/viewings/listenings each week, even better if you get a headstart it always took longer than I accounted for. You get out what you put in, and going to class unprepared is not only nerve-wracking but unsatisfying in the long-run, especially in this class, where knowledge of every show is essential to your engagement. It's also a great opportunity for learning that goes beyond the classroom because of the chance to see shows on and off campus. I found this course especially valuable as a theater major who wanted to learn more about music and musical analysis, and I definitely found that taking this class strengthened my skills in that area.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It has wonderful workflow, engaging discussions, and a varied seminar composition.",
                "Yes, if they want to learn about musical theater. You need intrinsic motivation to get through the material.",
                "AbsolutelyProfessor Egan is an incredible lecturer, and Sondheim legacy and catalog is fascinating. No matter what part of theater or music youre drawn to, you should take this class!",
                "Yes!!",
                "Yes! Even if youre not a theatre person, theres a lot to learn here and its super interesting to take a deep dive into Sondheims work and the MT medium itself",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in musical theater because I learned so much about the genre and Sondhiem's impact on it.  It was a really fun class and a highlight of my week every week."
