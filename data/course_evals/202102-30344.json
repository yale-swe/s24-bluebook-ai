            "comments": [
                "It's extremely intense and difficult to follow at times, but the material is useful",
                "We did lots of problems in class which were super helpful to reinforce information that was lectured on. I especially appreciated this because not many economics professors take the time to do this and I felt that I was more prepared to tackle the problem sets. The TA's were also very helpful in section - we went over the problem sets every week.",
                "The material was taught well but given the condensed time frame it was difficult to get enough practice on the concepts. Each topic really only had one single practice question associated with it, so any variation of the problem on an exam was much more difficult and slightly unexpected.",
                "Strengths: The class was very structured\/organized and well taught. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more interaction between everyone in the class, but it was hard given the virtual setting.",
                "it was a good course, nothing to really make better.",
                "The course was good, just a bit rushed which made it difficult to grasp some of the complicated math topics. In a normal term, this course is likely fine but the summer-format made it sometimes difficult to understand the math. Other than that the course was good, it was interesting enough that the 3hr lectures did not feel too terrible, and Professor Hawkins keeps things interesting by bringing in a lot of real-world examples.",
                "The strengths of this course were the way that the concepts were taught to us and there was a good amount of problems to practice on in preparation for exams. I also think this that this course was very fair in the exams, if you were on your stuff throughout the whole course. Very little weaknesses, not much I would change, pretty solid course.",
                "In my opinion, the course was very well taught, especially for a five-week course. The expectations of the course were fair and clearly lined out from day one, and the structure of the course was very reasonable - 3 problem sets, a midterm, and a final examination. Examinations and problem sets were great in that they were both challenging but also forced you to think and explore the material. Jonathan is a great person and a good teacher who really tried to answer every question in class and humanize the material (and complex algebra), and the course provided enough TF support during the summer to help students really understand the material. Virtual classes are also the best thing since sliced bread.\r\n\r\nThe syllabus and class discussions were well-organized but the course materials sometimes were not. It may be helpful in the future to post things a little earlier, especially the problem set and midterm\/final examination solutions. Also, announcements when materials are uploaded (and concrete dates as to when they will be) would be extremely helpful. I completely understand, however, that this might not have been possible due to the abridged schedule and the novelty of the course. \r\n\r\nI'm also uncertain about the structure of the course in solving complex algebra problems during class time on the board. I do feel like a lot of the muddling through algebra during class time could have been shortened with pre-written latex or algebra, leaving time for discussion on more real-world applications or problems? (For example, just having all of the latex solutions written out). It was also confusing at times to follow the algebra, especially when looking back at the derivations as there were steps that were \"skipped\" on the board. But to be honest, I'm not 100% sure on this - the algebra was helpful at times when we worked through each problem, and the course material is already tough enough that this might not be needed? Either way, not sure.\r\n\r\nRegardless, this course served as a great introduction to microeconomics (far better and more fair than the intro sequence) and would highly recommend. This is the first time the course was offered in the summer, so I expect the course will only improve as it is offered in later sequences.",
                "Strengths: Professor and TF accessibility; Structures to facilitate learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes vague understanding of what we needed to know for the tests",
                "A strength of this course was that the teaching fellows and instructor were very helpful in trying to provide explanations for concepts that may not have been clear to me. A weakness was that the tests were extremely focused on doing math properly and did not really test your understanding of concepts as much as I wanted them to.",
                "The course is very rigorous overall, and compressing it into a five-week curriculum is challenging for many students who take this course. There is a tremendous amount of knowledge to cover, and I would say illustrating and adding more examples into the curriculum can help me, at least, to sink in the knowledge. We had three problem sets and two exams throughout the course. I would suggest including some quizzes, and another type of assessment other than the psets and exams would be helpful to improve the course.",
                "Great classs",
                "The course was very well run for an online course. However, the TFs could've have slightly longer office hours because they often felt rushed.",
                "The course covered a good swath of material and made me feel comfortable with the content. I thought it sometimes got a little bit in the weeds with the math (esp in the psets), but I suppose this added to the rigor of it. For covering game theory at such an accelerated pace, I thought it was covered very well (as someone who took a Game Theory class before).",
                "As a product of Yale summer session, the content moved very quickly and due to the relatively complex nature of some of the topics, it was difficult to keep up with class some of the weeks. Breaking the content down into shorter but more frequent lectures would have improved this."
