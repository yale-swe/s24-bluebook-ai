I felt like the assignments were all beneficial towards my learning. However, I would have liked to have done more of the partner work in class--this was a great way to practice conversational Chinese.",

If I could change anything, it would be to not have approximately weekly character phrase writing quizzes, or maybe to have fewer phrases on them, or even a quiz that checks understanding rather than hand writing because studying for those was very time consuming and I felt that my time could be better spent in other ways practicing Chinese."

Most importantly, L5 is great because you get more practice with conversational Chinese while also learning about the cultural issues affecting modern China.",
