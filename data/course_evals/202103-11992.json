                "This class is primarily a studio class that focuses on the physical dance aspect of the class. I improved my coordination, spatial awareness, and rhythm. There are a few readings and guest speakers\/videos, which provided insights into the history of dance in West Africa and different perspectives regarding the Western perspective of West African dances.",
                "I think the most important takeaway I had from this course was I made some really close friends who I could dance with. The choreography and cultural elements are fun, but the bonds for me were the most important.",
                "Basic theory behind West African dance, basic dance technique behind West African movement like keeping grounded and finishing a step to its completion before the next one, it is not possible to appropriate West African dance in West Africa because dance is considered a collaborative art",
                "The basics of West African dance and a new appreciation for the connection between rhythm and movement.",
                "I learned that everything is dance. Movement is dance. Dance does not have to be structured; it is a form of expression. Dance is not something some people are good at and others aren't. Dance is whatever you want it to be. African dance has been changed from its original meaning. Traditional African dance is done in the presence of groups as a form of support for the dancer.",
                "This course tried to get students to be more in-tune with their bodies and their movements. I can say the emphasis on introspection and self-exploration was pushed throughout the course, but it was ultimately not as effective as it could have been. We maintained a limited number of dances that were introduced in September. The readings weren't incorporated into the class as well as they could have been because it felt like we had, at most, four discussions this semester that were completely unrelated to the dancing portion of the class.",
                "I learned a lot about myself and what it means to live the good life. This class is more philosophy than you think, especially on its open ended papers.",
                "This class allowed me to be in tune with my own body and I so much about the history of several West African dance traditions. Additionally, I learned how to dance to West African rhythms, improvise to those rhythms, and choreograph my own movement.",
                "I learned about the connection between dance and culture, from Africa to the African American communities in the united states.",
                "Thinking about dance in a creative way.",
                "Knowlege and skills about dance and music in West Africa and choreography, body control in general",
                "I learned a lot in this course about dance, rhythm, and dance history. I learned how to improvise and choreograph my own dance moves, and how to work with a group of dancers to choreograph a group project.",
                "First and foremost, I learned that dance is a natural art -- its one that fully expresses one's emotions, troubles, and successes through their body and movement. Through this, I was able to deepen the sense of community I found in the classroom and, in turn, my understanding of African dance."

                "Prof. Coulibaly is a fantastic and caring instructor who is super chill, yet clearly knows his stuff. He is an absolute beast at dancing and creating polyrhythm with his voice, and he understands the music very well.\r\nOne weakness is that he could be a little more clear with instructions at times, but this is mostly due to the mask making his voice very muffled. It's still very easy to follow along with his steps, and if you make a mistake, he is very understanding.",
                "Strengths: lots of hands-on dancing and instruction\r\nWeaknesses: could not hear the instructor talking for a lot of the course.",
                "Strength: the dance classes were enjoyable and educational regarding technique, teaches students to hold numerous pieces of choreography in their heads\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class did not finish on time nearly every session, not enough learning of history of dance beyond three readings in the beginning of the year, lacking explanation of importance of certain movements and what they portray or meant in West African culture \r\n\r\nImprovement: follow syllabus if one is created (we did not learn anything about Salsa or any other forms of dance the syllabus said we would be learning during the semester), use Canvas to post all assignments, end course on time.",
                "Strengths: Dancing every class period!\r\nWeakness: Lack of organization\/clarity in terms of papers and class expectations",
                "I wish we had the opportunity to use some of the drums used in traditional African dance during our class.\r\n\r\nThis class taught me to be comfortable with the movements of my body and myself as a person.",
                "Strengths: It's a great idea\r\nWeaknesses: It could be broadened beyond Burkina Faso dances and better explore the meaning and practicality of the dances",
                "The studio classes are amazing and you get to learn different form of dances and you also get guest appearances from other artists around the world. My only qualm is that the discussion sections couldve been better if done outside the studio which was kinda echoey.",
                "This class was amazing; it was definitely my best class of the semester and it was stress-free! We danced the whole time, and the discussions were chill. The midterm was very easy and straightforward, and the final was really just a reflection of the whole course. The one weakness of the class was that we didn't follow the syllabus, and everyone was confused about our weekly discussions since we didn't know if we had to do them or not. Another weakness is that we didn't know our grade the whole semester.",
                "This course was very fun and provided a nice way to relax and learn. I do think more conversation about the significance of dance in class would have been beneficial.",
                "I like the emphasis on feeling which is not experienced in other classes. I did not like the fact that for some to the written papers it seems like the professor doesnt understand some concepts and that affects my grades. For example, in my final the professor gave me feedback over email and made a comment on what I called equity, except based on his comment he seems to think that equity and equality are the same thing. Thus, his comment did not make sense and his understanding and ability to grade my essay must be also messed up a bit due to this small misunderstanding.",
                "Professor Coulibaly is a really nice and engaging teacher. He made every class fun and interesting.",
                "This course was excellent! I really enjoyed all of the in-class dance studio practice, as well as the readings, and the workload was not at all difficult to manage. \r\n\r\nThe only way it could be improved would be if the instructor was more communicative. He would often tell us the details of an assignment in class without making a post on canvas, which made it difficult to recall the exact tasks required of me or even for me to recall that we had an assignment in the first place.",
                "I think one of the main weaknesses of the course was that we didn't know what our grades for our midterm or final was -- we only received feedback. Although we could gauge where we were in the class, I would wish that we had access to the letter grade too. The strengths of the class was that I was able to fully understand the dance content and make analyzations from it."

                "Absolutely! This first-year seminar was such a unique class in the sense that it is a studio-based class, but you also learn quite a bit about a subject that is EXTREMELY neglected in Western education. It's such a fantastic opportunity to get an entire credit (humanities too!) for a class that is mostly physical, and the exercise component is great for mental and physical health. It's obviously not a super rigorous class in terms of academic vigor or readings, but the physical and discussion components of the class provide a very distinct education as well. Definitely recommend!",
                "Absolutely! It's a great way to take a break from your other classes and just let your mind go and dance.",
                "I think I definitely would because the intellectual challenge is a different one from regular classroom settingsit is an intelligence that is both physical and mental. It is a fantastic way to challenge how you learn, and an even better way to be introduced to cultures beyond the very white one we are surrounded with on campus. We spoke about very relevant topics like appropriation and community in dance, and we applied this knowledge to our movements. Definitely a course that encourages growth.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course because you get a full credit for dancing! The first half of the course was really engaging and there was a large emphasis on learning different West African dances. However, I didn't like that we spent six straight classes working on walking patterns.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Every time I arrived at the dance studio I was able to de-stress and just dance. The class challenged me in another way that was different from typical lectures.",
                "If you're looking to deepen your understanding of Africa from this course, run. If what I thought about Africa came from this course, I'd think the whole continent was painted with rainbows and filled with dancing fairies. If you're looking for a break class, go for it.",
                "Take this course if you want to have that liberal arts experience to a tee. Professor Coulibaly will forever be your favorite instructor.",
                "YES!!!! I love this class. The dancing is very entertaining, and Coulibaly has so much knowledge.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in having a relaxing and enriching credit. The themes of this course were very thought-provoking and dancing itself was a nice way to stay relatively active while learning.",
                "Yes, the class is cute , fun , but dont think you will actually learn anything. You can learn something if you personally decide to reflect on the dances.",
                "Yes absolutely! If you are interested in dance, African culture, choreography, or just exploring your own physical potentials.",
                "Absolutely! This course was super fun. It's also extremely welcoming to students with no prior experience in dance or music, such as myself.",
