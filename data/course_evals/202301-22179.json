            "comments": [
                "Strengths are that Kirk is a great lecturer and is obviously knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter. The workload was low, so it gave me freedom to come to class and just listen and understand rather than worry about taking notes to study for an exam or complete a pset later. The TFs were lovely and sections were lively and fun. The field trips were great! Weaknesses were sometimes lectures felt like they jumped all over the place and I had trouble picking out a main theme for each session.",
                "Strengths: Really interesting topic and surprising insights into Roman and Greek culture and life. The background of philosophy and legend in the beginning of the course is a great way to engage with more foundational classics from the EVST side of things, and some weeks connected environmentalism to human constructions especially well. As someone who isnt particularly oriented toward the study of animals, the weeks on animal consumption and demonstration were really incredible lectures, and section helped reinforce this. Professor Freudenburg and the TFs are so knowledgeable and approachable; after asking about possibly including a brief section on a topic of interest, it ended up being included in lecture the next week. Essays are free enough to be structured how you would find them most helpful, which allowed me to really dive into a topic from many perspectives and learn a ton about what most interested me. Both foundational and some niche/surprising texts. Also, baking bread and finding foraged objects is a fun and unique opportunity!\r\nWeaknesses: Readings were interesting but could be a little bit heavy in the beginning, and some of the more niche texts toward the middle could have been a bit better synthesized for takeaways and meaning. This could have also incentivized more diligent reading. Lectures were really interesting for the most part, but a few of the weeks in the middle lost some focus and felt a bit more like fun facts than other weeks. Sometimes it felt like, especially with more commonly known texts, classics majors could dominate discussion just a little bit.",
                "Strengths: I liked the way the essays allowed us space to really dive into our particular point of interest\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were very long; it was not very realistic to have read all of it.",
                "I found the small lecture format to be very engaging, and at most times it felt like a seminar with Professor Freudenburg's teaching style and engagement with his students.",
                "Although the general subject is interesting, the course is heavily section-dependent. Had it not been for my amazing TA, the course would have been much less engaging. Generally speaking lecture is not always relevant to assignments but is applicable and enriching for anyone interested in the material.",
                "My weaknesses of the course were mainly on comprehending ancient texts and becoming comfortable with them.",
                "Great course, loved it! No weaknesses. One of my favorite classes at yale!",
                "I loved this course. Lectures, readings, section meetings, and special activities (touring the Peabody, visiting Yale Farm, bread-baking at Prof. Freudenburg's house) were all fun and interesting. As a Classics major who is very interested in thinking about human relationship with our environment, the focus of the course was perfect. We didn't end up doing as many foraging/non-classroom activities as the description suggested, but that was fine with me."

                "Maybe! If you like classics, go for it. I took this class as a STEM major (for the humanities credit) and ended up finding the content interesting, but not necessarily super engaging.",
                "Would recommend to anyone who is strongly interested in Ecostudies or related fields and wishes to learn more about the ancient Greek & Roman cultures.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Particularly if the topic sounds like something you would want to spend time learning about, this is an interesting course and there is a wealth of knowledge and capacity for support on the teaching team. Texts are interesting, you get good exposure to a few important classical texts, and the combination of EVST and classics works well here. Papers were well-formatted for learning and individuality. A few lectures lost some focus in the middle and classics majors could dominate just a bit on the texts they knew better, but this course is a good exposure to an engaging topic that you can really learn a lot about at Yale.",
                "Yes, so long as you are truly interested in the material.",
                "Definitely! It was a really relaxed space to learn about antiquity, even without a classics background. It felt approachable (most of the time) and the bread making at the end was super fun. The TAs were amazing and discussion section was interesting.",
                "I have already recommended this course to many of my friends who want to take classes within the classics department but don't know where to start. It was a great way to use my knowledge of history in a different discipline, and i also enjoyed just how interdisciplinary it was.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! Students who are interested in classics will get a lot out of taking this, but those who aren't particularly drawn to it like myself will also find it rewarding. There are plenty of unique experiences that make it worthwhile (i.e. visit to Yale Art Gallery, bread baking) and even looking past them the material is fascinating and delivered in an approachable environment.",
                "Yes, this was my favorite course at Yale. The perspective on Ancient Rome given in this class is very unique as it looks at the life of an average Roman rather then an important figure. Overall, the topics thought were engaging and interesting.",
                "Absolutely! I had a great experience.",
