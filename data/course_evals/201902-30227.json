    "i learned a lot about italian history, art and culture",
    "I learned a lot about Siena's culture and history, as well the history of some other cities such as Livorno. Overall, I gained a deeper understanding of Italy in the present and in the past.",
    "I learned a lot about how to critically evaluate the history, literature, film, art, and traditions of a certain area in Italy. I also improved my Italian skills greatly in the course of discussing Italian poems and films in Italian, which allowed me to engage with difficult and enlightening concepts in another language.",
    "This course provided me with a vast amount of knowledge and skills. I was able to learn a lot about the history and culture of the Tuscan region and especially Siena. Thanks to what I learned in the course I was able to have conversations with my host family and have an awareness of what was happening around me during my stay in Siena. I also learned a lot about the history of the Tuscan region in general as well as notable figures from certain areas within the region. I furthermore learned to analyze Italian texts and be able to discuss them as well as interpret them. Throughout the course, I also developed my speaking and writing skills in Italian even more.",
    "In this course I gained an understanding and appreciation of myriad places, texts, traditions, and historical contexts important to both Siena and the larger Tuscan region.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of bothTuscan history and general Italian culture.",
    "I learned about the rich history of Siena and its importance to the surrounding countryside and Italy as a whole. I also learned how to read and interpret an array of texts in old Italian.",
    "Learned about Italian culture!",
    "Continued practice of the Italian Language and learning the history and culture of Tuscany and Italy as a whole.",
    "This class was a good overview of Italian culture. It covered many different topics and was a good way to practice my language skills.",
    "I learned about the history of Tuscany."

   "comments": [
    "strengths-the field trips were awesome\r\nweaknesses-sometimes it was a little difficult to understand the readings in italian",
    "I absolutely loved all of the excursions we had in this class as it brought what we were learning to life. It was also nice to learn information from the tour guides while actually being in the sites we were studying. Overall, it was very engaging.",
    "Material was interesting but we never really saw anything in depth, which I would have liked.",
    "We discussed a lot of interesting works and concepts in this course, from Italian poems to the Siena Palio to the history and significance of the city of Livorno. I was engaged with it every day, despite being exhausted from all the traveling I was conducting over the summer, and there was always a new concept to get excited about learning every afternoon. I would have liked to cover more material, as there seem to be some major concepts listed on the Syllabus that we never got around to learning about.",
    "One of the greatest strengths of the course is the fact that we take trips to different places in order to witness and learn more about what we had discussed in class previously. I feel like these trips definitely helped in enhancing my understanding as well as providing me with the opportunity to learn more than I would have if we had just had lessons every day. I furthermore thought the reading materials provided and the ability to write on topics of our own choice made the course a lot more enjoyable and provided an opportunity to get creative and not feel limited.",
    "The weakness of this course was its inconsistent format.  I was happy to experience so many excursions outside the classroom -- visits to Livorno, Rome, San Gimignano, the contrada museum, the bottini, the Duomo, other churches, Lo Spedale, and many other locations -- but the in-classroom aspect of the course was so disjointed among these many excursions that it was difficult to establish consistent or prolonged engagement with any one topic.  I might have preferred to cover fewer specific topics for a bit longer of a period.  Normally, I am happy to experience as many insights about as many different things as possible, but in this case it struck me as slightly pointless to, for example, engage with the Decameron for just a single day.  While it's true that even relatively brief engagement with some topics inspired me to want to learn more, it was slightly frustrating that such learning would have to be done on my own rather than in Italian in the midst of Tuscany during the summer program.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the program was its focus on topics that were so different from each other.  I appreciated how the curriculum was not only centered on Sienese history or traditions, but also featured emphases on Rome, Florence, Livorno, and important texts and artworks from all around Medieval Tuscany.  Such an experience provided a more holistic approach than I was expecting and exposed me to the great differences in perspective, tradition, and lifestyle of various areas of Italy.",
    "I felt that I learned more when we learned about topics from presentations and class discussions rather than just intensive and lengthy readings.",
    "Loved the field trips and trips to the museum and learning about Italian history",
    "No weaknesses! Great course! Grazie!",
    "I enjoyed the majority of the topics but I wished we had gone into further depth with some topics. The knowledge was sometimes surface level but the field trips helped. They were sometimes a bit long, however."

   "comments": [
    "yes, the field trips were very cool",
    "Yes! I loved actually studying the culture and history of Italy. A lot of the information was new to me and it really complemented learning the language while being in Italy.",
    "Yes, would recommend",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Italian culture and literature, as well as simply learning the language, as Simona does an excellent job engaging students in speaking and studying in the language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it provides crucial knowledge to understand what's happening within Siena and gives a fundamental basis to understand Italian at a more profound level. It is a course that provides a lot of freedom when it comes to the assignments and the material is very interesting and engaging. The entire course's content revolves around trips designed to further understand what was learned or to provide a basis to learn before a trip. It is also a space to improve and enhance one's Italian.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as long as it was being taken in Siena.  I think the course would fail to offer nearly as much engagement or relevance if taken in New Haven or some other location where the student would not be exposed firsthand to the art, history, and customs about which they would learn.",
    "Yes- definitely!",
    "Yes! Simona is amazing",
    "Yes, very fun and engaging way to learn the language and culture.",
    "Yes. It was a good class."
