Practiced close reading of sources and writing short to medium-length papers. Themes in the course included (but were not limited to) humans' relationship with nature, the Anthropocene (is this an accurate categorization of our current age?), indigenous cultures and nature, disaster stories across human history, science communication)."

                "The readings in this class were very carefully selected and provided a great introduction to the field of environmental humanities. The class discussions were very engaging, and I learned a lot from them. However, the papers were a bit challenging because we didn't get feedback on our weekly reading responses. More clear and regular feedback would benefit us greatly and would give us a clear direction for the papers.",
                "Strengths are the reading materials and Prof Lindskog. She designs the reading and is very engaging herself so the entire course is a joy!",
                "Strengths: Love the discussion style of the class, very engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too much reading assigned per class.",
                "I liked the group discussion structure and the range of topics in the readings.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings \r\nWeaknesses: only 2 major assessments.",
                "More readings in the mold of Ideas of Nature! That framework fundamentally changed my way of thinking about Nature as a concept, and would have loved to go even more in depth.",
                "Strengths: The class brought together a group of students from various disciplines. The readings were generally quite interesting and enjoyable to read. Prof. Lindskog is also an excellent professor- she is approachable, understanding, and gives good feedback! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As a history major, I would have preferred a slightly more historical angle to the topics we discussed in class. However, I understand that there is a variety of students in the class and that the course is cross-listed in multiple disciplines."

Former DS students already know Professor Lindskog for her compassion, wit, and dedication to student learning, but her passion for the Environmental Humanities takes this class to another level. If you have an interest in approaching critical modern environmental issues through an ethical lens, or understanding the history of the ideas that define contemporary climate discourse, take it!",
                "Yes! This course is great for anyone who wants to discuss climate change and society in depth. If you prefer an interdisciplinary approach, all the better- this course touches upon and synthesizes several disciplines."
