The office hours are stellar, alongside all the resources. I would say the tests are tough, but expected in regard to economics. It's an amazing course regardless.",

On the first day of class, we were informed there would be  a third mandatory class meeting Friday mornings (a change still not reflected in course information or room reservations), and despite spending close to 5hrs/week in class and office hours, it felt like a large chunk of the time was often not spent on Econ, which made learning material very difficult, and towards the end, very rushed. It would be nice if the TA were more accessible outside of the one monday office hour too.",

It's important to understand financials in the greater world, and I find the study applicable. The course was accessible for students, regardless of what information they came in with, which for me, was close to nothing. The seminar is a bit stress-inducing because of a less forgiving curve, but overall, I think it was worth it.",

Feedback is nonexistent, there is little understanding given to students, and multiple full-length classes will feel like it was for naught. I do think the material itself is definitely worth learning, but if you want to learn it, this class isn't for you",
