                "It was awesome, and the design of the course was super accessible to people with little proof experience (like me)",
                "Strengths: Professor Hall is really good. Really cares a lot about his students, lectures clearly, and makes sure students understand material, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: it was a bit frustrating at times to work on psets when they just got released and not have learned all the content on the pset yet but it wasn't the biggest deal",
                "Moved too fast, very stressful, no strengths, take 202",
                "Great job at leading class time, the only issue is that there sometimes is not enough time to get through all the material. The PSETS are reasonable and tests are closely tied to them.",
                "This is a typical math classproof-based, moderately challenging psets, lots of chalkboard proofs to copy down.\r\n\r\nThe pace is IMO a bit slow. There's a lot of time spent on the warm-up question that could have been quickly explained. This means we covered less materials than ideal.",
                "strengths: john hall. his lectures are extremely well thought out and organized, is able to explain things extremely concisely and clearly. very much enjoyed the course material as well. psets very well written and challenging. weaknesses: tests were a bit watered down, no proofs on in class test portion for a proof based class.",
                "The class is well taught, and canvas page is well organized. I like how the class focus on both the computation and the proof aspects. The workload is also very reasonable.",
                "The strengths are Prof. Hall, his approach to lecturing, and his wonderful group of TAs/ULAs. He is accommodating in every way, and truly made your success your own: for example, he posted multiple practice exams for each final, explained in-depth solutions for each problem set and exams in videos posted to Canvas, designed the course in conjunction with an amazing book, and tried his very best to approach lecture in a light-hearted, engaging, question-based, investigative way. Though some may complain about him being scatter-brained, I truly believe that they chose to not engage with the material on a level that Prof. Hall was presenting it. He made everyone feel welcome (by memorizing everyone's names), took class at a pace that was comprehensive (with a warm-up, presentation of theorems, no overly-formal/pedagogically-unapproachable proofs), and took questions with all seriousness. Lecture felt more like a discussion than a lecture, and I feel wholly sorry for those who didn't go to class consistently. As far as weaknesses go, I will say that it is easy to get lost in topics day-over-day. Discussing trees, then X theorem, then Y theorem, then colorings, then genus, then ... was challenging, and I do fear that the concepts will be mixed up in my mind while taking the final. However, there are always resources to aid, like office hours (which, even after going to once/twice can help immensely), the book (which you should buy!), and Prof. Hall himself.",
                "Strengths: John Hall is an active and engaging lecturer. I really gained a lot from going to class which is not always the case in lectures. Very student-friendly policies around grading and homework (dropping a pset, having optional \"bonus\" questions on homework, etc.) The course staff was generally helpful and accessible. Weakness: I appreciated that the take-home sections of the exams allowed us to revise and spend more time on proofs, but it felt dragged-out and exhausting. It turned an exam that should have taken a few hours of my life into a multi-week affair.",
                "Professor Hall and Ines (one of the TAs) were the biggest strength of the class. I appreciated the recorded lectures, the fidelity of the class to the textbook, and the fact that we began each class with warm-up problems. The biggest weakness was how the class handled proof-writing. As someone with no experience in proof-writing (or even competition math), I felt like the class penalized me, despite promising to be an introduction to proofs. I didn't do well on the first couple of problem sets and the first midterm, largely because I lacked the experience. The proof-writing sessions came late in the semester and were not very helpful. There is a hurdle you have to get through when learning to write proofs, but starting the class with an introduction to proofs (for example, contradiction, contrapostive, induction and direct proofs) would have been immensely helpful at evening the playing field. The class does not require MATH 225, so the assumption that we would know what any of these concepts meant before entering the class was very harmful to my performance. Students will perform better if they make time to talk to Professor Hall each week, whether about the material, the problem sets or the exams. Still, it isn't feasible for everyone to make time to talk to Professor Hall, so something must be done to make sure students without proof experience don't go through the class with a 5-week disadvantage.",
                "I wish what we were learning day to day was more structured but considering professor halls first time teaching the course he did really great",
                "Strengths: Pretty interesting content, loved the professor, generally well organized, and not too challenging.",
                "This course has very few weaknesses. It's incredibly well taught by Professor Hall, and it covered a large amount of material. It's very organized and there are so many resources that allow you to keep up with the course material (textbook is amazing, TAs, peer tutors, supplementary videos provided, lectures recorded). In the future, I'm not sure how it will be taught or what material will be covered because discrete math can mean a lot of different things, but this iteration of the course was a phenomenal experience.",
                "Strengths: Very organized course (professionally recorded lectures) and video solutions to all HWs, exams, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: It was very difficult to transition as someone without previous proof-writing skills. The course eventually became manageable. I felt like the course was more focused on memorization than anything else. Not even a cheat sheet on midterms/finals despite the MANY formulas/thms that one would never need to memorize otherwise. Class should have began with intro to proofs, but sort of just assumes you know how to write proofs beforehand (creating a very bimodal grade distribution). The midterms were fair. The final was rather difficult. There were only 3 ULAs, but not many people attended office hours anyway.",
                "The strengths of the course are that it is intellectually challenging, fair, engaging, and adaptable, and it presents the math in a very interesting way. A weakness that could be improved upon is structure of the course, which sometimes changed because it was Prof Hall's first time teaching it. This is of course to be expected, so I am excited to hear from future students about the course in future semesters as it becomes more stable.",
                "Strengths: John Hall is an academic weapon, course material is fun, tests are manageable Bonus Qs on the PSETs reduce stress about grades. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: maybe moves slightly too slowly at times",
                "Psets and tests seemed to have tangential relationships\r\nA LOT of material condensed into a semester, extremely fast paced for a more introductory math course\r\nProfessor was very engaged and helpful to all students, working to learn their strengths and weaknesses individually",
                "This course was absolutely incredible, I have found no weaknesses with the course. I feel like the class created an environment which was really conducive to my learning of discrete math and growth as a mathematician.",
                "I really appreciated the way this course was organized. John started the class with a warmup question, which helped remind me of what we learned in the previous class and get ready to learn new material, and he also asked questions throughout class which helped me stay engaged. I found the psets a little too long, but they did help reinforce the material.",
                "The content of this class is pretty relevant and interesting.",
                "Strengths: fun, intriguing, manageable work load. Weaknesses: none",

                "Strengths: the material is quite interesting and very well-taught by Prof. Hall; Weaknesses: the class could have gone through material faster",
                "I thought every lecture was extremely well-planned and clear, and the pacing of the class was also very doable. I think the homework was a good difficulty and forced us to think, but was still doable. I also liked how the exams were split into two portions, and the take-home portion allowed us to get feedback and was accommodating to students that have not had much practice with proof writing.",
                "Great prof, knew everyone's name which made the big class feel more intimate",
                "John Hall is an INCREDIBLE lecturer who made this class a joy to be in every lecture. The content is also awesome and was presented very well. No major weaknesses.",
                "The course was organized incredibly well and the supplemental materials are something that I will forever be grateful for. The answer solutions to the problem sets as videos as well as with the practice exams were invaluable. I do wish some of the materials could have been posted additionally as PDF files as they would make it far more accessible",
                "Its very thorough and does a good in depth dive into discrete mathematics. It is very tough and not beginner friendly, though it says it is.",
                "Strengths: Well organized and easy to follow.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: if you had a strong proof-based math background, the course seemed to move quite slowly.",
                "Very good class",
                "Strengths: Well-organized, the pace was perfect, the topics are introduced in an engaging manner.\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "John Hall is one of the best professors Ive ever had. He is able to make the material so interesting and its only the first year of him teaching this class! The content organization felt natural and never inappropriate. The TAs are very helpful. Overall amazing class with very few weaknesses",
                "Strengths: Well-taught lectures that align well with a great concise textbook, psets are of reasonable length and have well-chosen problems. Weaknesses: Unforgiving exam structure. It seems like the exams are easier than what has been given in some previous semesters, with not being proof-based, but you are punished hard for making even little mistakes. I know we cant cover everything but covering the Big O content that we skipped over would have been useful for CS. I wish we spent a little longer on an introduction to proofs as it was a little jarring at first coming from MATH 115 but after a few weeks they became comfortable.",
                "Math 115 is not an adequate pre-requisite for this course. Neither is Math 120 or Math 222. This course requires you to know how to do counting problems, the logic of proof-writing and how to write them semi-formally--none of which is adequately taught or advertised beforehand.",
                "I like how the course is set up and the lectures are engaging",
                "Strengths: The recordings and textbook are amazing and office hours are really great. The course was very organized and the syllabus/modules were easy to follow. Also exam prep resources were extremely helpful. Weaknesses: Sometimes class time felt disjoint from the topics we were required to know problem sets and exams. Though I see how everything is/was connected, it would be nice to make the connections more blatantly clear. I think the professor was a bit overzealous in the syllabus, as we originally have TWO problem sets due after classes ended. Though one was ultimately removed, the final problem set was still difficult to prioritize while also studying for other finals, completing final projects, and writing final papers.",
                "The professor was amazing.",
                "The course lectures and psets were both fantastic for learning and getting experience with the material. The pacing and rigor are phenomenal.",
                "Strengths of the course are that it's very well-structured. John Hall provided a lot of material to review and work with; if you need extra support, materials, or office hours, he'd make these resources very accessible to you. Weaknesses are that we crammed a lot of problem sets into the last couple weeks; the course was very fast paced.",
                "So organised. John hall is structured, clear, supportive. Wonderful all around. TAs great.",
                "Strengths: John Hall! He is a kind and reasonable professor, and the course is highly organized. He makes lectures engaging with some warm-up questions and encourages active participationhe made an effort early on to memorize nearly the whole class' names. The natural con is that the pace of the course won't always be too quick, as he really does want to answer all of our questions...",

                "This is obviously required for students interested in CS, but it is also good for pure math majors, as a pathway to studying combinatorics, which uses techniques and ways of thinking somewhat different from those of the typical analysis and algebra pathway.",
                "Definitely. I really enjoyed this class. Prof. John Hall's lectures were incredibly interesting and definitely worth listening in on.",
                "Yes - I would recommend this course even to a student who doesn't need the course for a prerequisite.",
                "Yes! If you need to take discrete, don't shy away from 244 if John Hall is teaching. It was a great class!",
                "Yes I would, it's a really well-taught course if it's taught by Professor Hall and the content is interesting",
                "No, very very hard if you havent done 225",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, it is really well taught and lots of material is covered.",
                "Yes, especially for students who have an interest in math or discrete mathematics, I feel that I learned a lot from this course.",
                "Yes if you like proof-based math. The psets may be demanding but the exams are very handleable.",
                "yes, if you are deciding between this and 202 i would recommend this course. if you are just interested in challenging math ideas and problems, this is a great course to take as well. i think this course provokes a ton of critical thinking and has very interesting material, a lot of which is relating to open problems. especially if it is with john hall, i would highly encourage you to enroll.",
                "Yes. Fundamental stuff for CS and math. Also well taught by John Hall",
                "Absolutely. Math 244 with Prof. Hall is the perfectly executed mix between a formal math course and one where you know you always have the opportunity to understand what is going on. It is one of the best-taught classes I have taken at Yale, and, for a CS/math/econ student, this is a must-take.",
                "Yes, definitely if it is taught by John Hall.",
                "I'd reccommend it to anyone majoring in something math adjacent. It's worthwhile and helped me understand some fundamentals which I use often in my CS and AMTH courses.",
                "yes",
                "Although most of the people taking this course likely need to be taking it for a major requirement, I do think that this is an interesting course for people interested in math and competition math.",
                "YES! I decided to take this course as a CS major instead of cs202 and I'm so glad I did. I think it was an excellent way to work on my proof skills, and the topics were incredibly interesting and enjoyable. The class was a challenge, but Professor Hall made it feel accessible to anyone regardless of prior math background. I would take this course if it's being taught by him again.",
                "Sure. I took this course just as an intro to proofs course; I don't think I emerged with any particularly strong grasp of proofs (outside of basic cases) but the content was interesting at times. I had zero proof experience beforehand and felt like I was drowning for the first few weeks, but eventually, I started to understand the material, and it wasn't as awful but certainly very tedious at times. Professor Hall is very kind and engaging though.",
                "ABSOLUTELY!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if it is taught by Professor Hall. He is unbelievably committed to your learning and will do whatever it takes to help you succeed in the course.",
                "Yep! Its fun and John Hall is the GOAT",
                "Yes, tests were enjoyable, homework was not; would probably caution against other graduates students taking it",
                "Yes this class is amazing.Professor Hall does everything possible to make the material as interesting and accessible to everyone as possible. He learned all 100+ students names in the first weeks. The lectures had great pace and all the topics came together in the end to build a powerful problem solving system. I found the tools and results in the study of graphs and combinatorial counting to be really interesting, and there is nothing I would change with the course.",
                "John Hall = very nice",
                "Yes, if you take it with John! I took this course as a senior after not taking math classes for a few years and I really enjoyed it! John explains things in a way that makes it easier to understand, and listens to student feedback about when things are too difficult and we need extra time.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning some math, but not interested in the more rigorous proof courses like analysis, etc.",
                "Yes, the material is interesting and the P Sets are actually fun. Make sure you take it with John Hall though, it's a very different and worse class without him.",
                "Yes definitely. John Hall is great and will support you. Learn a lot from a great professor.",
                "Yes; not even for the course, but take Professor Hall!",
                "Yes; it's an interesting course with fun material!",
                "Yes, great prof and interesting topic that's helpful for CS and other areas",
                "YES. Especially with John Hall. Fascinating math class where youll cover so much cool stuff thats very fundamental and also very powerful.",
                "Yes! Take this course with John Hall if you can! The topics are really interesting and prof. Hall makes class engaging and accessible. If possible, take this course after a proofs-based math class. While I had experience writing proofs in MATH 225, I found some of the proofs on psets and exams to be quite difficult. While prof Hall did a great job of running proof writing workshops for students with no proof-writing experience, some psets and exams had insanely technical proof questions.",
                "Yes. Professor Hall did a very good job of making resources available and I learned a lot.",
                "Yes. One of the best and clearest math classes I have ever taken. As a math major, this is a great introductory course and is well suited for students of any background in mathematics",
                "I would only recommend if youve had previous experience in discrete mathematics. It is not the intro course it says it is.",
                "Yes definitely, you learn a lot and are shown how amazing math can be.",
                "I'd highly recommend this course! It's a great introduction to proof-based math and the topics are super interesting. It isn't super computational at all and the examples / practice problems are super fun.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, even people who dont need any math classes for their major. This class runs smooth as butter and its just a fantastic learning experience overall. I learned so much in this class from both the prompt feedback and John Halls immense effort that he has put into the class by recording a video solution of every single problem.",
                "Yes. Good course but take it w John",
                "Yes, the course is well-taught and the content is very interesting and applicable.",
                "Please do not take this course unless you have to (stats majors). Please do not take this course if it is your first encounter with proofs. Otherwise, I think the course is good for people who are adequately prepared for it.",
                "Yes, because it teaches valuable skills in terms of mathematical proofs and just general discrete thinking.",
                "Definitely! This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. It really made me feel confident in my mathematical abilities AND I strongly believe any student could excel in this course because of my experience. Also, the topics were really interesting.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course, especially with John Hall. It is a well developed course and wad easy to follow without sacrificing mathematical rigor.",
                "Yes, if you're looking for a good math class with lots of interesting material, discrete is a great class to take.",
                "John Hall is the GOAT, definitely take it if hes offering it. Super considerate professor and lectures are easy to follow",
                "Yes. Discrete Maths is essential for CS majors. The knowledge learned in this class will be used in 223 and 365 and above so please take it as early as possible.",
                "YES! Particularly with John Hall. Would watch those videos and his lectures for years.",
                "Yes. From talking with friends who have taken 244 with different professors or 202, I think 244 with John Hall is one of the best versions of discrete math at Yale",
                "Absolutely, I think the concepts learned were very fundamental and applicable, and the class itself was fun."
