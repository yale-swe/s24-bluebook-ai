More importantly, it helped hone the all-important skillset to read, assimilate and analyze multiple, often-conflicting, technical research papers in the field. This course has definitely equipped me with a better scientific mindset, as well as a more nuanced understanding of what makes humans special in comparison to their closest relatives.",

Prof Watts is one of the most knowledgeable academics in this field, and will always eagerly dish out detailed answers to any possible question you might have; 3. the readings, albeit long, were very relevant to the lectures and helped a lot, although they weren't necessary to succeed in the course if one didn't have time to do them. Weaknesses: nothing really comes to mind, this was a great course.",
                "The use of examples and videos was very engaging. The assignments were manageable, though the readings were not as engaging.",
                "The course is extremely well-structured, with a detailed syllabus covering a variety of topics.  The assignments are also very interesting and help with understanding course material: three short papers (reading critiques), one response to a famous documentary film, and a term paper.  The papers are very flexible and are designed in such a way that students are able to select topics of their interest.",
                "Strengths: if you actually attend lecture and follow it, the topics are really interesting, and Professor Watts is really enthusiastic about what he teaches.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures can be a bit dry sometimes, and the PowerPoint presentations can be improved",
                "Strengths: the course content itself was interesting, the reading critiques and video essay assignments were often fun to write, and the instructor was clearly extremely educated in his field. He was often able to offer relevant anecdotes from his own fieldwork and research experiences to answer questions from students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the readings could be a bit excessive.",
                "Incredible course, lecture could be more discussion oriented",
                "It was a quite interesting class, especially since Dr. Watts is such an interesting lecturer and shares his own videos and stories. However, the papers are the only assignments and sometimes they can feel a bit disconnected from the lectures. This can be nice or bad, depending on your style. I would say, though, that more feedback on why we got the grades we did could be useful.",
                "A strength was the amount of videos shown in class to contextualize the lectures and readings.  I think more targeted feedback on writing assignments would have been helpful.",

                "The course was engaging and Professor Watt's passion for the subject shined through each lecture. The class fostered a very free and open environment for discussion.",
                "Great writing credit option as a stem major, interesting material, kind professor, open ended paper topics that allow you to write about what interested you the most. Definitely would have been better in person though, Professor Watts's lecture style is somewhat dry over zoom and class engagement was very low."
