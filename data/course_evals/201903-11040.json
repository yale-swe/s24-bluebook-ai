   "comments": [
    "I learned how to identify different types of rocks (metamorphic, igneous, and sedimentary), learned about minerals, and am able to summarize basic composition of rocks I see. We also learned how to use field lenses, draw topographic maps, and read basic geologic maps.",
    "Making geologic maps, identifying common rocks.",
    "Learned how to identify different rocks by sight and quality, how geology research and survey work is done, and how that glaciers shape landforms. Learned the history of Connecticut and the east coast - did you know we're a bunch of island chains squashed together (with some of ancient africa thrown in)?? Really incredible. Learned how our earth has changed over time and how to combine skills over the semester into a holistic view on constructing earth's history. \r\n\r\nThe fieldtrips, especially the overnight fieldtrip, were the most enriching and exciting parts of the course. Great opportunity to bond with the professors, TFs, classmates, and to see first-hand some really incredible features.",
    "I gained the ability to identify rocks and minerals, infer how they formed, and understand how their formation fits into the larger and broader contexts of rock formations, tectonic activity, and ultimately earth's history. I learned about the impressive scale of geologic time, and realized how humankind as we know it fits into the smallest sliver of that timescale. I witnessed and learned firsthand the thought processes of geologists when attempting to understand rock formations. I visited impressive mountaintops as well as windy coastlines all while learning about the extensive history of how these features came about. Ultimately I gained a steadfast appreciation and admiration for the raw physical record of earth's history and how that record is constantly changing through earths' natural [and unnatural] processes. I gained a basic vocabulary to discuss and learn more in-depth about these complex systems.",
    "I learnt how to identify minerals and rocks, and I have a better understanding of how geological processes form our landscapes, and the tremendous scale (in space and time) such processes take.",
    "It was good to see examples of rocks to go along with the lectures.",
    "I developed some knowledge of the different types of rocks, their origins, and their constituent minerals.\r\n\r\nI also improved my ability to recognize rocks and minerals by sight in the field, and to read into the history of a rock or mineral formation based on various characteristics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are the field trips. The weaknesses are that sometimes the lab can get boring because youre looking at rocks all day.",
    "Strengths: good field trips\r\nWeaknesses: labs are pretty tedious though not intellectually challenging",
    "Strengths were the fieldtrips, and the labs where we got to learn how to identify rocks while in the classroom. Also, seeing the landforms by the side of the highway and learning how to understand the history of an area by nuanced study of its rocks. I'll never forget these experiences, and know I'll carry them with me the rest of my life and travels. Weaknesses - some of the labs were very long but it wasn't a huge problem (thinking of lab 1, with the many timelines and stuff. that could have been a group project). The biggest weakness for me was the scavenger hunt, in which it was rainy almost every day and very hard to find a dry day to inspect the sites during the week (before nightfall).",
    "The strengths of this course are, first and foremost, the field trips. Going to an interesting formation, picking the brains of a geologist, and attempting to sift through the often convoluted and mysterious historical possibilities that lie behind a mineral, rock, or rock formation, is a great way to experience geology. The multi-day field trip through the Appalachians was an awesome experience where, through a sequential series of impressive rock formations, I was able to piece together the tectonic history of how the Appalachians formed. On the field trips, Danny and Dave were always great about giving geological context and answering any and all questions about the topics at hand. The lab days that were in the classroom were naturally not as memorable but equally as informative as I gained the basic skills of mineral identification, rock identification, topographic cartography, inferring bedrock structure, and much more. This lab, combined with its sister course, Dynamic Earth, was a phenomenal introduction to geology. Can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "I thought the activities were engaging in the lab. 6\/10.\r\nIt seemed liked the lab was not always super organized, and I don't think I always got as much out of the lab as there is the potential to."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if youre really into rocks or if it is a requirement for your major.",
    "Take it if you have to or if you're REALLY into rocks\/geologic maps",
    "Yes! It's a fantastic, fair 0.5 credit, and an incredible opportunity to learn the unbelievably way that our homes and states are formed. Really gives you a new, fresh perspective on the world.",
    "This class rocks. I would recommend this course to anyone who is remotely interested in rock formations, rocks, or minerals, or is generally curious about these things and likes the outdoors. The field trips are awesome and informative, and provide great opportunities to get to know the professors as well as your classmates. I learned a ton of cool skills from this class like how to identify rocks and minerals, as well as how to infer the history of a region based on rock composition. The assignments are really straightforward and are super engaging and interesting, yet the workload isn't bad at all. I'd highly recommend taking this class with its sister class, Dynamic Earth 110, because the material overlaps and is complementary in the best way possible; although it is a little bit more work to take both classes it is totally manageable and it is definitely worth it.",
    "I think this is very good to take with G&G 110. Helped to solidify my understanding of topics.",
    "If youre a geology and geophysics major, you should take G&G 111L. It will give you an excellent intro into geology and the solid-earth track more generally.\r\n\r\nAnd even if one isnt a solid-earth geology major, I would still recommend this class (and its associated lab). If one thinks theyll find geology AT ALL interesting, the labs are enjoyable, youll learn a lot, and it isnt too much work, even with the required final paper."
