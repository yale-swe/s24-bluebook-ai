                "This was an AMAZING methods course. It's incredibly well organized. It's the best class I've taken in terms of being very clear about expectations from the very beginning the syllabus did not change much, the themes, deadlines and readings were laid out very clearly, and Professor Smith even did the courtesy of listing the amount of pages of reading due each week ON the syllabus so we had an idea of how to make time for the class each week.",
                "Strength: Prof Smith is really nice, passionate, and humorous. Vanessa, who was the TA, is also amazing. Topics discussed in class is also fairly interesting -- not sure where else I would have learned about such content if it wasn't this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of reading that can be dry and boring, but the reading guides helps us skim the readings. A lot of the class is self structured -- you conduct two original research throughout the semester and you are expected to ask Prof Smith and the TA for help throughout the process.",
                "I loved how small the class was; it made it easier to participate and get to know one another. I also loved Prof. Smith and Vanessa and how willing they were to meet with us after class and discuss/help with our two projects. Another big strength was the reading guides that they made for us every week; the readings are already pretty interesting but during busy weeks, the guides definitely helped narrow down what main points we were supposed to get out of the reading. Prof. Smith is hilarious and the course never felt like it was almost 2 hours. It was definitely one of my favorite classes this semester.",
                "Strengths: never expected too much from students, relatively interesting reading list, and the use of reading guides made readings feel more purposeful. Weaknesses: very long class time was used to just go over reading guides which is not a very useful teaching style. discussions remained unproductive until the end of the semester. Weekly, random made-up assignments would be emailed to us, and we would share our ideas in class but it was always very low effort and didn't meaningfully expand on the readings. Overall, I think far more effort is put into planning how class-time will be used in some lecture courses, for a 12-person seminar more thought should be put into what activities are taken place during class rather than spending over an hour regurgitating the main points from the readings every week.",
                "Strengths: We do mini experiments which were nice, and received clear feedback on them. The reading load was not intense, and the readings were generally interesting. Class discussion wasn't boring.",
                "Strengths: I believe that this class did a great job introducing visual sociology and helping me think like a visual sociologist. I enjoyed our readings and the way that we were breaking them down.",
                "Strenghts: The instructor, Philip Smith, and TA, Vanessa Bittner. Great instructors willing to clarify any questions and proactive to work with students on projects or course material understanding.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NA",
                "It was great and very adaptive, we started one way and then figured out how to best run classes and engage in discussions."

                "I don't think the exams or project assignments suffered too much during covid, but given that it was a two hour seminar with only 12 students more time could have been allocated for really fleshing out ideas for our projects and working within groups for peer feedback. I think in maybe two classes we were spontaneously asked to come up with ideas for our projects, which was not really that helpful. It might have been more helpful to have students pick a methodology for their projects, spend some class time in small groups every class, first developing a research question, later a hypothesis, then fully outlining their methodology, etc. I felt like class time could have been used far more efficiently given remote conditions.",

                "Yes! If you want to learn about sociological research and conduct your own research, this is the class for you! Prof Smith and Vanessa (who was our TA) are AMAZING. They are very approachable, kind, and care about our well-being. Vanessa was especially a great help when I was working on my two research projects throughout the semester. Even at times she is unsure of the answer to my questions or concerns, she guided me in the right direction or referred me to another resource I can reach out to. I especially enjoyed this class because of this personal research component (which was a total of 74% of our grade). I got to use the class content that we learned in my own research, and more importantly, you have complete freedom over what you want to study here!\r\n\r\nThat being said, you are responsible for learning the class content through readings and by participating in the discussions during class. The weekly readings were quite a lot but the reading guides helped me skimming some papers. There are two non-cumulative in class exams (short answer format, answer 5/8 of the questions) which were quite challenging because of the time limit but these two exams are only 20 % of the grade.",
                "Yes!!! If you are a sociology major you NEED to take this course. If you're not a socy major, you should still take it if you have room on your schedule just because it's so good. I learned so much about visual sociology in a non-traditional way. The projects you create really push you to come up with creative ideas that haven't been discussed in the field of sociology before. I feel a lot more confident going into my senior essay next year because I got two trial runs with this class. Prof. Smith is hilarious and makes class so engaging. The readings are not super dense and usually very interesting (which isn't always true for sociology classes). This was one of my favorite classes at Yale so far!",
                "Yes, it's not too hard. Projects were almost entirely completed outside of class and it helped me work on time management.",
                "Yes! It's a really interesting take on sociological methods, and makes methods fun.",
                "I would recommend it.",
                "Yes, fantastic course with fun and engaging course material!",
