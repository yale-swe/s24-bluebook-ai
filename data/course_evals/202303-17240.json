The workload wasn't too high, but it forced me to engage with the content enough to understand it well. The programming assignments provided us with code to animate our algorithms, which facilitated easier debugging, more learning, and more enjoyment.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we'd spent just a little less time on discrete planning, which I'd already seen in multiple courses, so we could have spent more time on the more novel aspects of the class, like continuous optimization.",

The notes are super helpful to understand the course materials. Also the professor is a very good person and helps you if you have any questions about the course material or the assignment.",

The course notes on Notion are amazing.",
