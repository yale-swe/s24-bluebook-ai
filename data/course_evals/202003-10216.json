                "The strengths were Prof Hammer's incredibly dedicated teaching style and deep knowledge about the literature and poetry of the course. Hammer would meet with my about every paper and give insightful advice and criticism. The feedback was excellent, and the class is very well organized. He also adjusted the course to our needsI can't stress this enough, when other professors were demanding we meet impossible deadlines, Hammer was making sure we weren't over worked and could commit to doing our best work under difficult circumstances. A legend. One weakness was that the discussion could get a bit into the weeds, and often ended up with him talking at us rather than. cultivating conversation. But he's a brilliant analyst so even that was enjoyable.",

                "Professor Hammer is an amazing teacher! He has so much respect for his students and engages everyone in discussions, while also conveying his enthusiasm and passion for English. The class always had a trajectory but it felt like it originated in our thoughts which shows how much he values his students. Professor Hammer's investment in class, office hours, and over email put him as one of the best teachers I've ever had. The syllabus itself was great in that I got to read important works of American Lit and appreciate them without it feeling like a survey course. Plus there's a good combination of poetry and prose. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the subject and, more importantly, willing to invest in the class. The level of work is scalable based on how much you invest (though it's certainly not a gut), but you won't get much out of it unless you come to class ready to engage in discussion.",
                "YES! Take 127 with Professor Hammer, he will make it an enjoyable, not overly-taxing and incredibly insightful experience. He's done this course so many times he has it organized to perfection, he knows the texts back to front, he gives excellent feedback, and he truly cared about his students growth and well-being.",
                "I would only take this course if it is a requirement for your major. Otherwise, there are much more interesting courses with much much syllabi out there."
