                "This course has developed my ability to analyze music significantly. The listening quizzes have really trained my ears to catch some subtle elements of the pieces we are listening to. The papers are good exercises on writing about music from both the technical perspective and from the social and historical perspectives. I have also learned more about art in general as a reflection of many other aspects of the human society and how to make such observations in synthesis.",
                "I LOVED this class!! Trevor is a phenomenal professor who guides you through the steps and process of analyzing a piece of music as closely as you a piece of literature. You really learn to \"hear\" in a more concrete sense as well as a more imaginative\/creative journey that the music takes you on. I came into this class not knowing too much about contemporary classical music, and at first it was a bit of a shock listening to the pieces, but I grew to love and appreciate the history --particularly the sociopolitical influences-- that shape each piece and can be heard distinctively as long as you listen closely with an open ear and open mind. The essays we wrote in this class were fun to write and pull together the fragments of particular musical moments into a complete piece and see how pieces reflected history. The score-copying exercise was super intricate but really helpful in seeing how much work goes into composing a piece.",

The works, however, just take more time to get situated with, digest, and appreciate."

            "comments": [
                "Trevor is extremely passionate about music and also a terrific instructor. He gives us so many insights on each of the pieces on the syllabus. He is able to dissect them both from a technical standpoint (which is good if you know music theory or play the instrument that the piece is composed for) and from a social\/historical\/intellectual standpoint (which is accessible even to non-musicians), which I think is one of the biggest strengths of this course. The assignments (listening quizzes, papers, score-copying exercise) are very fair and helpful. I can't think of any major points of improvement other than probably more opportunity for the students to discuss the material instead of him lecturing. But since I really love listening to him talking about music this isn't much of a weakness in my opinion.",
                "Strengths: Trevor is an amazing and incredible professor who is truly passionate about music which it really shows in how he teaches the course: with zeal and patience and lots of support for his students. The musical selections were distinct and each had a purpose in showcasing different facets of 20th-21st century music. The listening quizzes help you hone in on particular details which then fosters robust discussion and analysis in class. The score-copying exercise illuminated the complexity of composing a piece which at first seems a bit tedious, but seeing the final copied score is such a thrill and gives an immense feeling of achievement. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses. This course is perfect as is.",
                "I thought the structured listening, listening quizzes and papers were a great way to structure class in a way that both held us accountable for the material without creating too much pressure around a humungous workload!",
                "The strength of the course was that the workload was relatively easy, and that it was very enjoyable at the same time. We had listening quizzes, which made us listen smartly, but at the same time it made me appreciate the interesting elements of each composition we studied.",
                "The primary strength of this course (other than the quality of Professor Baca's teaching) is its structure. The pieces we study communicate contrasting aspects of 20th century classical music yet collectively illuminate the underlying themes of the period. The order of the pieces we learn (roughly chronological if my memory is correct) makes studying the development of 20th century music a stimulating exercise. Finally, the placement of listening quizzes and essays makes this course stimulating without being overwhelming. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly how this course can be improved. The only thing I can think of is to vary the structure of listening quizzes- maybe to focus more deeply on the unique aspects of each piece.",
                "The small classroom created a relaxed environment in which you get to form meaningful relationships with other students and the professor despite being completely online. Everyone taking the course was passionate about music, making it a very engaging course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Baca, and music. \r\nWeaknesses: there are none.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-The selection of music provided a condensed, yet thorough introduction to the various schools of musical thought. I appreciated the variety of works, ranging from the serene and beautiful (e.g. Copland's Appalachian Spring and Takemitsu's And then I knew 'twas Wind) to frenetic and shocking (e.g. Varese's Ionisation and Xenakis' Jonchaies). Even for those familiar with some works, as I was, the course will revolutionize the way you understand the music.\r\n-The seminar format allowed a comfortable and engaging environment in which to talk about music with like-minded peers. Professor Trevor did a wonderful job of facilitating discussions and providing encouragement. \r\n-The workload of this course was fairly light (preparing for listening quizzes did not eat up a huge portion of study time and minimal other work). Paper for this class felt more like a meditation on music and space to self-reflect rather than espouse a grand thesis of sorts, compared to other classes. \r\n-Professor Trevor is a phenomenal teacher. His introductions, and even discussions, of each piece were elegant poetry. I never knew talking about music could be so fascinating, truly. He's engaging, humorous, compassionate, and understanding. I couldn't ask for a better first year seminar experience due to his vision for the course. \r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNone whatsoever."

I appreciated Prof. Baca allowing us to just casually talk in breakout rooms for the first few minutes of class with other peers and to discuss works; that little bit of time helped me to form bonds with peers. Otherwise, listening to music and then discussing was quite comfortable and easy."

                "Definitely! This course is a perfect fifth class for any first-year students. Although the workload is extremely low (listening quizzes on a more or less weekly basis, two papers, one score-copying exercise during the break), I've learned so much in this class. As a musician myself, this class has completely changed my opinion on the twentieth century music which I absolutely despised before Trevor enlightened me. I even used the musical analysis skill I learned in this class on writing a literature paper in another class. Even if you are not that much of a musician, this class can still introduce you to listening to music like a pro without a steep learning curve as Trevor is very nice and considerate of people's background in music. Write about harmonies in your paper if that's your thing, or you can write about history\/philosophy\/virtually anything as long as you can tie it to the piece in question. Again, a highly recommended fifth class to anyone regardless of background.",
                "YES!!!!! A million times yes. I cannot recommend this course enough!! I can not emphasize enough how incredible of a person, a professor, Trevor is. He is super knowledgable about course material and stuff beyond it. Anything to do with music, and I mean, anything at all, you could have a fun and exciting and insightful conversation with him. Even if you do not have a music background, this course is really fun to take; you will learn a lot and appreciate music more for its sonic qualities but the deeper implications of it! For people with a music background, this course is equally beneficial to take since you learn to see the music in radically different ways than you likely have been taught before.",
                "Yes! I feel that I learned and grew so much throughout the class!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I gained many new insights about modern classical music in this class. The workload was not stressful whatsoever and the professor is very understanding and extremely knowledge about the subject. It is fascinating to hear about his take on different pieces and composer throughout the 20th and 21st century.",
                "Absolutely. If you have ever listened to music you will get something out of this course.",
                "Yes! As long as you are passionate about music, and it's very helpful that you already play an instrument. Professor Baca's course expands your ideas of what music is and changes the way you listen to music.",
                "Definitely. This course is aimed at students with no musical background (even though I was the only one in my class with no formal musical training). In the class, you listen to various compositions from the 20th century and analyze them. There are also essays and music quizzes each week. The essays are fairly short and require you to analyze certain musical compositions you listened to up to that point in the class. The quizzes are not difficult, as long as you give a good effort at listening to them. By the end of this class, you will have a greater appreciation for music.",
                "Most certainly, a resounding yes! For any lover of classical music, this course is an absolute must. It's a fascinating dive into the soundscapes of contemporary music. The works I've listened to and the discussions in class throughout the semester have revolutionized my understanding of music, and I think the same will apply to any other student. Most of all, Professor Trevor is an extraordinary guide through all the crazy works and brought tremendous enthusiasm and insight into each and every discussion."
