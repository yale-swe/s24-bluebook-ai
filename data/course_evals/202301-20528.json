                "Peer Grading and the insane curve was a huge weakness of the course.",
                "This course is great - I think sometimes the office hours can be concentrated towards the beginning of the week which can be difficult since psets are due at the end of the week.",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed the homework assignments, well structured course, requires a lot of self discipline and time management\r\nWeaknesses: office hours were usually not super productive and took way too long to ask questions, need more TAs and in person office hours",
                "Strength: It's quite easy.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I learned nothing of value.",
                "Perhaps a bigger incentive to go to class would make it more engaging and educational",
                "Strengths were the organization of the course as well as the asynchronous model. There was also an incredible amount of support and office hours.",
                "Strengths: Easy to follow along and learn even without a Stats background\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Peer grading of the final report is kinda lame. Your entire grade feels like its determined by other students who read your final project you've spent weeks on for like 5 minutes. Kinda feels like JDRS's solution to grade inflation is to do a boxcox transformation and just hope the grade distribution becomes normal no matter who it affects.",
                "I like JDRS's teaching style and everything was extremely well taught. But honestly, the class is just too easy. Homeworks are just straight copy-paste from the lectures notes and exams are take-home copies of the homeworks. There is very little conceptual challenge.",
                "Well Organized",
                "A huge strength is its remote availability for students and its excellent organization of modules, deadlines, office hours, and overall assistance for whatever one would need for support.",
                "The ability to take the class asynchronously is a definite strength and allows freedom with the material. It is easy to watch the lectures and get through the material in a timely manner on your own schedule.",
                "This course taught practical skills well and I enjoyed the asynchronous format.",
                "format of the course was definitely a strength. i appreciated the flexible ways that the course could be taken.",
                "It's really awesome that this course is offered both synchronously and asynchronously. I liked going to lectures because I felt more engaged, but it was nice to have the flexibility of doing the classes on my own time during challenging weeks. The hours and hours of office hours were also helpful!",
                "The course was easy to follow and straightforward.",
                "Final project is not designed well and peer grading is a poor way to do grades. Also, open book take home exams were unfair to those of us who follow the rules",
                "I think the asynchronous option for this class is a major strength, allowing students to take time with the content and understand it on their own schedule. There are also tons of office hours and resources available to help if you have questions. I can't think of a weakness of the course that wouldn't seem like nitpicking.",
                "It is incredibly atomized and really difficult to get an A since the curve is incredibly high.",
                "It was very frustrating how almost every day I would receive multiple emails that a TF had rescheduled their office hours. There were also times when I didn't receive and email, showed up to office hours, and the TF never showed up. I think that TFs have to be held more accountable; if they are going to consistently have conflicts with their scheduled OH, they need to choose a different time.",
                "Strengths: asynchronous lectures, manageable workload \r\nWeaknesses: TAs moved their office hours last minute a lot",
                "Just know, because nobody told me, that the curve is absolutely terrible and that the final project is peer-graded, meaning you have no control over your grade. Also, while I have not received my grade back, I have been told that in years past people will receive different grades in the group despite having submitted the same project. For this course to improve, it should be curved less harshly and the peer-graded project should be better organized to avoid errors like this. Also, the curves are not made available, so we have no way of knowing our grade until after the course is completed and the grade is logged on SIS. I wish this were not the case and there were more transparency.",
                "Strengths: lots of resources about course topics (lectures, lecture recordings, prerecorded videos, notes, prewritten code, etc.), plenty of office hours, problem sets/exams were relevant and fair.\r\nWeaknesses: asynchronous nature made it so few people showed up to lecture, making it less engaging. Final project was handled poorly - spec was vague, and peer review is not a good method of grading at all.",
                "The strength is definitely the asynchronous format. Having 5 classes already, it was very refreshing to not have to go to class for this one and just take all the lectures at my own time. JDRS is a great synchronous and asynchronous lecturer. He explains concepts well and also adds his own humorous touch which is very welcome for the material which can sometimes be a bit dry.",
                "If you have no (or very little) prior background in Stats, you are not going to learn anything from this course (and it is not an easy A either because the curve is intense). Even though JDRS posts all the lectures from his intro stats class and everything is recorded, this class is not accessible whatsoever to someone with no stats knowledge (this is coming from someone who tried watching his intro stats vids and was still confused). JDRS means well but he is not a clear lecturer. You can cheat on all the PSets but the exams and projects will be tough if you don't know someone who has already taken the class.",
                "Good intro to r but not much engagement with material",
                "strengths - content well organized through lectures and homework, lots of office hours\r\nweaknesses - final project is peer graded",
                "can help me enhance the data exploration and analysis part in r\r\n\r\nweekly homework workload sometimes can be high",
                "Strengths: you don't actually have to do this course to take it. Weaknesses: you are in the dark on so much information, to get an A you have to get above a 98.5 or something, and the professor is supposedly obsessed with lowering your grade in the end without you knowing. Like you can get a 92 on every single assignment then earn a B+ or B in the class. Everything is not about grades, I understand, but you will not know if you are doing bad in the class until the very end. That is messed up.",
                "It's really great that JDRS has adapted the course so it can be completed completely asynchronously.  The instructional videos are helpful and a great resource.  I think that instructions on homework and exams were sometimes written in a confusing way that could be clarified.",
                "weaknesses: all online, so it feels optional and is not very engaging",
                "I think the class notes and recordings were structured in a way that made it easy and accessible to understand the material, especially if you could not attend in-person lectures. I also feel that the teaching assistants were very helpful, however, there were some instances when the TAs would end their office hours early or not be as responsive to student questions on our Ed discussion board as well.",
                "Strengths: JDRS is a super passionate educator who does an amazing job teaching students how to use R to code from the ground up. The class is very low-key, and you can definitely get by (despite what it says on the syllabus) without taking any statistics before this.\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly can't think of much. I think the only weakness I can think of is that the final project should not be peer-graded.",
                "It is so good. Could not love it more.",
                "The lectures, notes, and office hours all provide a strong support system for learning. However, the grading system (especially for the final project) seems too geared to meeting a curve instead of rewarding good work",
                "I enjoyed the asynchronous format of this class as it meant that I could do my work right before the week began and adjust according to my schedule of the week. I also liked that there were videos + html + the r code itself, as I had several methods of accessing class notes. I also think that the PSETs were very well created to reflect the skills of the week that I had learned. My only suggestion is that the last project should not be based off peer grading as I have found them to be inaccurate.",
                "Accessible to anyone and the course can be taken however you like",
                "I really loved how this course was asynchronous but had ample office hours to get live help. Overall I think it is a great introductory course, and good for people who want to learn a bit of statistics and programming. We dont go super in depth on any one thing, but I think this is a great model and format for an intro course. And there are ample resources to go more in depth on things if you want. There werent really any weaknesses other than a couple points in the semester where grading was a little slow, but the psets are straightforward so there shouldnt be many huge grade surprises.",
                "Strengths: the recorded lectures are easy to follow, the homework assignments are a good length and are helpful in developing understanding of the content, and the exams were fair and good tests of knowledge. Weaknesses: the class can sometimes be very poorly organized, and because of how asynchronous it is, it can be very frustrating to get help. Office hours were frequently canceled or moved with just a few minutes' notice, assignments had instructions which were clearly a few years out of date, grading errors were frequent, etc.",
                "I like that this course is fully online, as it definitely did not need to be in-person lectures. In fact, that would have been really hard to follow, given so much of it is coding. Also, having so many office hours available made the course really accessible!",
                "The office hours and the recorded lectures were a major strength. The final project peer grade structure was a bit unclear and stressful.",
                "As I'm sure others have pointed out, the grading system feels very arbitrary and doesn't reward hard work. Frankly, it's more about who you know than what you know. Many people I know relied completely on skeleton psets, exams, and even projects from last year which they got from their upperclassmen friends. As someone from a low-income high school who came into Yale without these connections, this made the class feel somewhat discouraging at times. While I learned a lot, I think it would have been nice to incorporate an in-person exam into the class alongside the other material so as to better test our knowledge.",
                "Strengths: a lot of opportunities for outside help from a billion office hours each week\r\nWeakness: people tend to do nearly perfect in psets and on the exams so you need to be really on top of your work to make sure you get a good grade. ULAs will be picky so you need to give yourself a lot of time to check over your work to make sure you don't lose tons of points",
                "This course was extremely strong in providing students with the tools necessary to understand concepts at hand.",
                "Strengths \r\n-Taught online so allows for flexibility \r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n-Reusing a lot of the code we saw in class",
                "online format meant you could rewatch all lectures.",
                "I feel that the course is really accessible - lots of TAs and office hours, homework follows lectures decently well (gives students a chance to really consolidate skills), and having both recorded and live lectures was helpful. I do feel, however that the close is too big -- maybe splitting into smaller sections could be helpful? I don't feel that the grading for the final project should be left to students in the class -- if the purpose of this exercise is to add to students' understanding of the material, I feel that peer feedback on a first draft of the project could be helpful as opposed to the final version. I feel grades on the projects themselves should be determined by TAs/the professor instead -- potentially having a smaller class size with multiple sections will make this possible?",
                "The strengths of the course was that you could move at your own pace, whether it be ahead. However, a weakness was that there wasn't much engagement.",
                "Strengths: Well-organized to facilitate student learning, even asynchronously\r\nWeaknesses: Too many people have connections in this classwhether its students who know the ULAs or people whose friends have taken the class beforethey are able to get PSET/Exam answers fairly easily as they do not change much year-over-year. This makes the class curve incredibly high, which is detrimental to students who are actually hoping to have a constructive class experience (i.e., you learn through mistakes but can't afford to make mistakes in a class where most people don't care about the content and use other people's work/answer keys to get ahead)",
                "Weaknesses: ULAs elect skipping office hours. Class was extremely competitive and cutthroat and not a good learning environment sometimes.",
                "Strengths- Asynchronous nature, can go at own pace\r\nWeaknesses- Homeworks were mostly a reiteration of lecture code",
                "strengths: learning R\r\nweaknesses: developing strong understanding of underlying concepts",
                "Strengths was that it taught me how to code in R and the Psets were just like the lecture. \r\nWeakness was that the final project was graded by peers",
                "Ye",
                "The TA's and professor sometimes did not respond to emails. \r\nThe overall structure of the course was well organized, especially the asynchronous option.",
                "Strength : the class lea tires are organized and helps with homework. Weaknesses : a little bit unorganized.",
                "The asynchronous nature made it manageable, and constant office hours were helpful. However, guidelines for the final project were unclear.",
                "Strengths  accessible, well taught, easy to learn from the material and psets\r\nWeaknesses  pace varied",
                "The class seems well equipped and managed. The turnover time for homework grades should be looked into. Also, proper training should be given to the ULAs; the way they grade is so bizarre, always making mistakes here and there.",
                "Easy format in that everything can be asynchronous, but I found my engagement very low as a result. Grading seems based largely on ability to meet rubric guidelines rather than think originally.",
                "- Exams and HW were very stressful as you trying not to lose points. Since everyone does well, and bascially gets a near 100 on the exams and problem sets, if you want an A in the class you need to make sure you are perfect. So most of the time I was stress about not losing points rather than learning statistics.\r\n- Overall, homework was very well designed though and exams were extremely fair testing you on what you learned on the homework.",
                "Strengths: Straightforward assignments and weekly sets, high quantity of office hours Weaknesses: Many! Low quality of office hours, many TAs will purportedly hold office hours, only to not show up or cancel them last minute. Cheating is widespread in this class, causing grades to be ridiculously inflated and causing grade deflation. Professor JDRS, despite his charisma onstage, is often unresponsive or reluctant to help - I emailed him several times to ask for extensions among other things, only for him not to reply to a single one of them. Weekly psets can become a nuisance, with little room for error. Also, office hours can bring out the worse out of people, both peers and TAs. TAs are often incentivized to be unhelpful and hold their office hours only after pets were due, and classmates often rudely cut the line, specially on zoom. Sometimes I tried to be courteous and let my peers who came to the office hour first ask their questions first, only to be taken advantage of and have other classmates skip me, despite me coming beforehand. And the group project at the end is very brutal. It seems quite unfair to have our peers grade our final project, as it incentivizes harsh grading. Moreover, even if your do an excellent job on your section of the project, if the rest of your group doesnt put in their fair share or do their portions of the project with as much vigilance, you can be hosed.",
                "I liked the asynchronous nature of the course and the zoom office hours. One weakness is that a lot of times, questions on Ed Discussion go answered.",
                "Strengths  very resourceful with many many options to participate in the course. \r\n\r\nHowever, I dont think some undergraduates should be TAs, they sometimes guided me incorrectly.",
                "Strengths: that the class could be taken in a number of ways, extensions were easy to get, ULAs were helpful\r\nWeaknesses: office hours kept changing, it didnt feel as consistent as it needed to be.",
                "Strengths: multiple ways to complete material. many office hours. many ways to succeed in course.\r\n\r\nWeakness: TAs frequently move their office hours last minute",
                "Strengths are that it's all remote and it's sort of what you want to get out of it. Weaknesses: hard to stay accountable for the work.",
                "Async format was very very strong and I think it was very easy to access information from the course in relation to other stats course.",
                "Since its a course thats been taught for many years, I liked how structured and organized the syllabus was. You can go to class if you want to in person, or you can watch recordings in advance and proceed at your own flow.",
                "The asynchronous format of the class was amazing, the video modules and r files were so clear and helpful, and all the ULAs were so great. My goal was to learn how to code in r, and I achieved it! However, the final project peer grading system was absolutely ridiculous and I hope JDRS changes it going forward. My group lost points due to multiple careless graders forgetting to fill out rubric sections, and JDRS dinged everyone's grade two points, indiscriminately, because project grades were \"too high.\"",
                "Strengths: Learning how to program in R. Being more confident in stats.\r\nWeaknesses: The way the final project is graded seems a little disorganized. It would be nice to have the project due a week earlier to give us more time to grade.",
                "I love that this course was taught asynchronously. One weakness was how the final project is graded. because it is peer graded. For one of my peer grades, they forgot to fill out sections of the rubric causing us to lose points where we didnt have to",
                "Class is designed very well to facilitate learning, asynchronous style also lets you learn at your own pace.",
                "Take it at your own pace, lots of office hours offered",
                "This course has an outstanding instructor who really makes the lectures engaging. There are many different ways to get the lecture material, either in-person or on Canvas. This flexibility helps you out when you are busy. Lastly, the final project grading turned out to work okay, despite everyones concerns about peer grading. It seems much improved from previous years. I really loved the course and learned how to program in R. It had no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: can be taken asynchronously, lectures are very entertaining (JDRS is upbeat), many office hours. Weaknesses: psets and work is passed around, class curve can be brutal, TAs are always cancelling or postponing office hours with little notice.",
                "Love that it is online and you can go at your own pace. Also love how accesible TAs are.",
                "I like how flexible class is, with the asynchronous and synchronous content. There are a lot of resources offered to students to do well, like extra content on Canvas and plenty of office hours.",
                "The assignments are quite hands-on and maximize learning, and multiple options for taking the course asynchronously make it possible to fit it into an already busy schedule. One drawback, however, is that there isnt much interaction with other students or the professor and in-person class attendance is very low. The many hours of office hours each week are great.",
                "Strengths - very organized, all materials laid out in the beginning of the semester, clear lectures\r\nWeaknesses - ED discussion not responded to frequently, so many questions go unanswered",
                "I thought the online video format was outstanding. Normally, I really dislike pre-recorded lectures, but JDRS clearly put a lot of time and effort into making the video modules clear and concise. Watching the lectures online was hugely compatible with viewing R-scripts on my computer at the same time, and I really enjoyed the extra flexibility to watch lectures when I wanted or to rewatch them to clarify a confusing point while completing the homework. I think this course could be improved by spending a little more time working with ggplot2.",
                "Strengths: Course organization. Knowing which modules should be completed in what weeks, which modules were required to be used in each homework, and having resources for support on coding (although I did not make the best use of this resource). Pre-recorded lectures made this course a very flexible one to take in addition to other courses at Yale which arent as flexible. As an intro stats course, it was very helpful to have it in such a format (as Im sure is the reason why many take the course!)\r\nImprovements: The fact that the problem sets are all strikingly similar to past iterations of the course and thus all the scores are ridiculously high is not great as it punishes those who dont compare answers or seek past resources for advice on how to get all the marks on every pset or midterm.",
                "Strengths: Good for busy schedules\r\nWeakness: quick",
                "I liked the flexibility of the course. I attended most lectures in person, and I thought professor Reuning-Scherer was a great lecturer, but I also appreciated having the option to work ahead or to watch a recording of the lecture after the fact if I had to miss the live lecture for some reason. The TFs were all incredibly helpful and I appreciated the flexibility of having so many different office hours and ways to get help. Some aspects of the class that I might change were the pace of the first few units (I had never coded before and I found it a really steep learning curve, with some basic coding procedures never explicitly explained) and the structure of the homework assignments. Because the homework assignments paralleled the lectures so closely, it became relatively easy to copy and paste code from the r markdowns from lectures without really learning the material. While I appreciated being able to do that in the midst of a busy schedule, in retrospect I think I would have learned more if forced to do more thinking myself.",
                "the grading was inconsistent across tas",
                "The approach to teaching is strong but the final project could work better",
                "This course is a great way to learn R and is very thorough in terms of the concepts that are taught. There is also a lot of support from the professor, TFs, and peer tutors each week. The biggest weakness of this course is the grading. It often seems like the course is built against us as students and they do not want us to do well. TFs will deduct points from homeworks (which is 50% of the final grade) in very arbitrary ways, so you may get a lot of points off for something where as other students got no points off for the same mistake. A lot of the deductions are also for small things that are unrelated to how well you understand R (such as the color you chose for your plots or the size of your graph titles). The worst part of this course is the final project, which is peer graded and therefore very arbitary. You may have fulfilled every requirement on the rubric but still get a C just because it was not graded carefully by the student who it was assigned to. Overall, it seemed that the focus was more on deducting points from anything less than perfect rather than promoting student learning. I found myself spending hours on assignments even after they were completed just making sure there were no small mistakes.",
                "Online and could rewatch the lectures. Lot of assignments but very helpful. Lots of TA.",
                "Strengths is that the class is very organized, but weakness is that having a hybrid system can make it easy to fall behind.",
                "This is a course where you get out whatever you put into it. If you watch all the lectures, take time to digest the class notes, and spend time perfecting your homework, you can come out with a pretty good understanding of R. This is a very well-designed course, and if you put in the effort, you can learn a lot. That said, there is little accountability to actually do those things, so you need to be self-motivated throughout the class. One additional weakness is that the class focuses a lot more on perfection and attention to detail than on understanding the material and the statistics behind what we are doing. Also, the grading of the final project is absurd, and I really disliked the peer grading/comparative nature of the grading.",
                "The only improvement I would suggest are optional simpler coding exercises in addition to the weekly home works. I felt that the instruction in the course was very effective and that I learned a lot from the assignments, I would have liked additional reinforcement of the material to the homework that was not as time intensive or difficult in order to master the syntax.",
                "I really love all of the office hours and resources provided; however, I did not like how many of the ULAs often cancelled office hours last minute.",
                "The class is organized okay for its size, but definitely need more ULAs or having ULAs be more on top of their grading. Have had many mis-graded PSETS and unanswered questions in ed discussion",
                "This course really facilitated student learning. There were multiple formats in which we could take the course, and there were office hours all throughout the week. The homeworks were designed to really help us practice the material.",
                "The Canvas page has lots of resources. JDRS is a great professor.\r\nSince I took the class asynchronously, I attended to online lectures instead. The lectures are not painfully long, so the workload for this class was manageable. This was good since I was taking five credits this semester.",
                "Strength: The pre-recorded lectures were very well made and I found that resource incredibly helpful as I could always go back to them if I didn't understand part of the problem set. I also appreciated the team aspect of the final project.\r\nWeakness: I would appreciate the addition of a document that includes many of the most important R functions used across the semester. I know that Oracle has a document with many R functions, but having a sheet to use to remember syntax would be helpful.",
                "strengths: interactive problem sets and lectures, great professor, and flexible schedule.",
                "The course is difficult since it is online but the office hours were amazing.",
                "A strength of the course was the amount of clear instructions given in office hours and helpful videos. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was the abrupt cancellations of office hours.",
                "the course is very flexible in the way that there are several formats to attend the class, but they are all very effective ways to help and support us in the learning processes. Thank you!",
                "One thing I like is that the course can be accessed online.",
                "Strengths: the 'hands-on' learning by using real datasets from the beginning; the variety of datasets/examples which can appeal to students with very different interests; the engaging way in which JDRS delivers the class; the option of attending the live lecture or checking the pre-recorded videos if you are unable to attend live at some point or you want to review some of the content.\r\n\r\nWeakness: there is a lot to cover in this course, so sometimes it went too fast, but I guess it is a trade-off between going fast and covering all important things vs. going slower and not getting such depth in the content. Also, it is good to have lots of office hours but sometimes they were all clustered around certain times of the day, and then there would be a whole chunk of the day when no one was holding office hours, so it would be better if they were more spread out, as it was with the Intro Stats class.\r\n\r\nTo improve: although I understand there were many students taking this class, it would be good to get grades and feedback on homeworks before taking our exams, as it is always good to see exactly what we got wrong and why, rather than just checking the solutions once they are made available. Another thing would be if the TAs could provide more prompt responses to the questions in the Ed discussion forum, as most questions were about homeworks and exams and there was a deadline."

                "No, not if they have any background in either statistics or computer science. Most of the course can unfortunately be completed by only briefly modifying the lecture code and there is pressure to do assignments this way rather than to treat them as learning opportunities because ultimately the class is curved down.",

If you don't know programming and math, you will probably learn a lot but get screwed over by the curve - if you don't care about getting a B, then I would reccomend.",

If you have 0 stats experience, but have some time (i.e. not taking 5 classes at once), I recommend for anyone!",

It also serves well as a second course in statistics (after an intro/AP course) for those in any field who want to gain the technical experience in R. It is a very practical and accessible course.",
                "If you're interested in not only learning more about statistics but also developing a working knowledge of R, I'd highly recommend this course. It is also one of those \"Yale course\" that you have to take if you want the full Yale experience. I'd say this course is a must for anyone who wants to delve deeper into statistical computing in the future especially transitioning into other languages such as Python. Highly recommended!",

JDRS is a wonderful, passionate professor who take a lot of care to streamline the largest course at Yale. The grading is definitely left-skewed which can make final grades a bit unclear, so beware of that. I've never taken a statistics class, nor a coding, until this, and did not have any issues. The class is a wonderful 5th or even 6th class to take!",

                "If you are interested in stats and want to get better at R, then yes, But you also have to be diligent and keep up as it can be a lot. And you should not worry about your grade, which is easier said than done",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was not life changing but I think it is a super effective and practical course and I am so glad I took it. Theres a decent amount of work, but if you keep up with it its not too bad, and JDRS is a great instructor. I think the expectations are very clearly laid out in the syllabus and the class is very true to that. If you want to learn stats and learn a bit of coding too this class is great. I took intro stats and I had a tiny bit of coding before this, which I do think were helpful. Would definitely recommend intro stats before this but you dont NEED coding experience, just need to be willing to learn. Theres some patience for trial and error needed, but again, everything is so clearly laid out in the lectures that its not the same level of trial and error and debugging that I would assume other CS classes to have.",
                "The class is decent, and you will learn a lot, but prepare to be extremely frustrated by how the class is organized. Instructions for homework and exams are frequently unclear, and trying to get answers to your questions is very difficult: a number of questions posted to Ed Discussion were just never answered, office hours were frequently canceled or moved with just a few minutes' notice (or even better, the ULAs would just not show up and not send any sort of announcement), different ULAs would give conflicting answers about project requirements, etc. I learned a lot and I'm glad I took the course, but I was also extremely frustrated throughout the semester.",
                "Yes! I think if you enjoy any form of problem-solving or coding you will love this course. However, if that isn't something you have found yourself enjoying previously (e.g., if you would choose to write an essay over complete a p-set), this course might not be for you.",

                "The material you learn in class is no doubt very useful. Over a semester, I went from a complete coding beginner to understanding the fundamentals of R. That said, the class can be frustrating at times not because of its difficulty but rather because of how it's structured. Cheating is rampant and the final project is peer-graded giving students the incentive to screw other people over for their own gain. Overall, it's probably worth the headache if you want the quantitative skills but I personally didn't have a good time.",
                "If you're EPE I really suggest taking this for the pre requisite rather than an econometrics class. Also if you are interested in stats in general this tends to be a better (and slower) introduction to stats than JDRS's intro stats class from what I have heard",
                "I would recommend this course to other students for its large amount of learning and tools available.",
                "Yes! Great way to learn to code in R",
                "If you have taken intro stats first, though it is doable without, just much more confusing",
                "yes if you need a qr",
                "If you are interested in doing research, I think the stats and coding skills this class teaches would be really helpful!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because you learn R. If you want to do research in STEM, R is a very useful language to know.",
                "Noyou can learn everything online with far less stress associated with your grade. Unless serious changes are made to the integrity of this course, I can't recommend it to anyone who wouldn't Credit/D/Fail it. Please do something better with your time here.",
                "Yes if you want to learn R",
                "if you want to learn R",
                "Yes I would because this course teaches you how to grade in R",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I think it teaches a useful skill and it is asynchronous.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, it is not a lot of work and you learn R",
                "Yes it teaches a good sense of R programming",
                "Yes. The course is helpful to those with zero knowledge of R.",
                "If you are looking to get the S&DS certificate, then this is a fine course. Otherwise, it is very frustrating at times (as it feels like the work you put in doesn't necessarily translate to learning or good grades), and the final project grading is stressful and upsetting enough to put anybody into a coma.",
                "If you want to learn R, yes. Otherwise I would take a dedicated stats class. With that said, JDRS was enthusiastic and engaged so that helped.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course when JDRS is teaching it. The exams were fair and the homework did not take too long. The only downside to this class is everyone gets a near 100 on the exams and problem sets, if you want an A in the class you need to make sure you are perfect. So most of the time it was stress about not losing points rather than learning statistics. Other than that, I felt like it was a good introduction to R and I came out knowing a lot more about statistics and R in general.",
                "I would probably recommend this course to someone either wanting to complete the stats certificate, or for those who believe they would benefit taking the class for research. Its not difficult but a very annoying class.",
                "Yes, I think you will learn about the basics in R but it does requires some work on your own part.",
                "Yes, if they want to learn R. No, if they want to learn actual statistics.",
                "Yes. I think its important to get this kind of quantitative exposure",
                "yes if they want to learn data analysis in R",
                "Yes! A good and easy to follow/understand statistics course that provides skills that are useful and can be used outside of class.",
                "Yes, but that it would be necessary to really make sure that your engagement with the course is high so that you understand and are able to articulate your understandings of the course.",
                "Yes I would; its a good course to improve your data analysis skills through R.",
                "Yes, if you stay on top of the assignments and are able to self motivate yourself to work hard. I truly learned so much about r this semester.",
                "Yes, it is a good course to take if you feel you need to brush up on either programming with R or need a stats review.",
                "I would because I feel that this class is taught well and its a great last credit if you are taking a heavy course load that semester.",
                "Yes, I think the applications for this class are endless and people should take it regardless of major/professional aspirations.",
                "Yes, good basic knowledge to learn",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. You learn how to use R in this course which is a very useful skill to have. The material is not overwhelmingly challenging, and the office hours are very helpful. The grade distribution turned out to be quite fair, and I really liked the professor. The final project is a lot of work, but the workload up to that point is not overwhelming. Overall, the course is a great time.",
                "Hmmm. Yes if you want to learn R basics in a chill class. You have to be okay with getting less than an A even if you have a very high grade bc of the curve.",
                "Yes because it is a great introduction to R if you have never had one.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed learning in this class. I took this for fun and it was interesting.",
                "Highly recommend taking this with JDRS, you will learn data analysis skills in R that are very useful for most majors in todays data-driven world. There is a prerequisite of having taken one stats class before, but most of the stats material is reviewed at least briefly. Also, you do *not* need to know any R before taking this class! Grading can be a little unfair at times especially when the exams are take-home and many students get answers off of friends who have previously taken the course, so there is an aspect of getting out of the course what you put in.",
                "Yes, it's very possible to be successful in the course, and there's many availabilities for help and support. I know some people were worried about it getting curve down, but this year the letter grades were A: 94 and up, A-: 91 and up, B+ 88 and up, B  84 and up, B- 81 and up.",
                "I would. This course gave me a great introduction to working with R, and taught me some basic statistics to boot. You DON'T need to take an introductory stats class before taking this course - I had never taken stats before, but was easily able to learn the necessary basic statistics along the way.",
                "Yes. It is a good introduction to coding with statistics and using R. Especially with the flexibility and asynchronous course format, combined with the fact that so many other students that you know will likely be taking the course, it is definitely one of those courses to try out to see if interests you.",
                "Yes, quick Qr course, engaging prof",
                "I would recommend if if a student needs experience in R in particular and has no background coding experience.",
                "Sure but Id encourage them to credit d f if they are behind going into the project",
                "I would recommend this course to any students who are looking to learn R. If you are just trying to fulfill a data science pre-requisite, it might be better to take an intro stats class such as S&DS 100-108. This class is too much work for just a pre-requisite. But if you are specifically looking to learn R this is a great course to take.",
                "Yes I would if you are interested in learning effective and basic R coding",
                "Yes! Will learn necessary skills.",
                "If you are a self-motivated student and want to learn R, this is an excellent class to take. If you require more structure or do not have a statistics background, then do not.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as I think it was taught effectively and coding in R is a useful skill.",
                "I would recommend it to another student if they are interested in statistics and coding.",
                "The course has definitely improved from previous semesters in terms of curve and accessibility to learning support.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This was my first S&DS course at Yale, but I found that the class provided us all of the tools we needed.",
                "yeah I think for someone like me who wanted an introduction to statistics and R it's a great course to take",
                "I would recommend it as data science is an incredibly valuable skill to have and knowing R at a basic level is also widely useful across many disciplines to understanding data and statistics more fully.",
                "Yes. It made me become much more interested in stats and data science. The professor was very interactive and fun.",
                "Yes, it is a good class to learn R.",
                "Yes, I think this is a great introductory course to statistics.",
                "Yes, the professor is really nice and helpful--the way he explained concepts are very easily understandable.",
                "Yes, it's useful and well-organized.",
                "Yes! This course is well-structured and organized, and the datasets included both in the lectures and homeworks are very helpful to get an understanding of how the statistical tests and analysis works 'in real life'. The homeworks and take-home exams add to the workload, but they are really good to make sure you actually understand the concepts and retain what is discussed in the lectures. Also, there are lots of office hours available, so if you are interested in the content and/or have questions, there is always help available. As a student without previous stats knowledge before coming to grad school, this course was a good continuation from the Intro Stats one."
