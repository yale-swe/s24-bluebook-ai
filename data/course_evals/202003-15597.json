Later, however, I was interrupted at the beginning of my answer to one of the questions: the instructor thanked me for my contribution and said I should let the others answer. I know my answer wasnt perfect, but if I had been given a chance to finish what I was saying, it would have been right.\r\n\r\nThis left me wondering what I did wrong and feeling anxious about me possibly grabbing the spotlight and not letting credit students speak. \r\n\r\nThe way I see it, the instructor should have established the participation mode that she feels is right from the outset. I would understand it if she let me as an auditor know that Im expected to only listen to and perhaps ask questions. However, by directing some of the questions right to me on previous classes, the instructor set the pace in which I felt I could share my answers just like other students. Thats why I didnt expect to be interrupted at all, which was indeed discouraging.\r\n\r\nAfter that my participation mode got down to very low because I didnt want my answers to spoil what the instructor was creating in class.",
