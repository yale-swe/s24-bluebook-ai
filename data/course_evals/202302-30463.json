The teaching staff did a great job of explaning the philosophical contents of the course, including those found in the readings and other ideas that might be brought up during class discussion. However, the course is extremely short, being just 5 weeks. This circumstance forced the professor to go through the contents of the course rather quickly, no doubt missing interesting information, which they have no fault of. The course would be greatly improved if the session was elongated to six or possibly seven weeks.",

                "Yes, I definitely would! \r\n\r\nAs an intro course, this course has really accomplished its goal as a guide to the professional field of philosophy.\r\nAnd for those who simply want to learn a thing or two about philosophy and don't plan to stay in the field, they will most certainly gain a lot as well. I think knowing something about the greatest philosophers that have ever lived is an essential part of our education. Much of the knowledge I get from this course is also applicable to other disciplines, for example, the definition of knowledge, propositional logic, logic fallacies, etc.\r\nFurthermore, at least for me, discussing (or even arguing about) philosophical ideas with classmates is such an intellectually pleasant and fulfilling activity. It is a kind of happiness that you don't get in any other activity.\r\nLastly, this course has definitely improved my capacity for thinking clearly and writing clearly. \r\n\r\nOverall, good vibes all around!",

                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in philosophy and rhetoric in particular. This is because the course covers these to fields very thoroughly, whether through essays and readings or class discussion. The course does have a heavy workload however, specifically there is a lot of reading and as such the student looking to enroll on the course must not have a problem with that.",
                "I definitely recommend this course to newcomers to philosophy. Its very beginner-friendly and I didnt feel overwhelmed by the material. At times the readings were a little heavier than Im used to, but the lecturer will fill those gaps in class.",
                "Absolutely, I would highly recommend this course to another student. The course's approach of introducing philosophy through foundational texts from various time periods provides an excellent opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject. The readings are thoughtfully selected and cover a wide range of philosophical concerns, allowing for a well-rounded exploration of different perspectives.",

Much of the knowledge I get from this course is applicable to other disciplines, such as the definition of knowledge as justified true belief, propositional logic, logic fallacies, etc. I know that I will always come back to these fundamental concepts whenever I think about things and argue with people in the future.\r\n\r\nIn terms of skills, I've improved a lot on my academic reading and writing skills. Reading philosophy passages is hard in its own way. Lots of thinking, note-taking, and re-reading are required. I think that during the course of these few weeks, I have gradually gotten the hang of reading such passages, although I still have a long way to go. \r\nPhilosophy paper writing is also unique. I always believe that thinking and writing go hand in hand. As I was writing the three short papers, I really came to terms with the fact that clear writing gives poor thinking nowhere to hide. Also, I feel that this course has made me get more fond of writing.\r\nAll in all, I know I will use the knowledge and skills I gained in this course for many years to come.",
