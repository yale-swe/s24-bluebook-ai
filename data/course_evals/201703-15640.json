    "This course was awesome because I was able to finally formally learn some music theory. The course did what it was meant to - I learned about elementary, relatively basic music theory concepts, ranging from simply reading music (beginning of the class material, something I could already do) to knowledge of scales, intervals, chords, chord progressions, harmonies, etc. I am in a singing group, and I had fairly good knowledge of music already, but I had never taken a course in theory or formally learned anything that I knew, so there was a great deal of new information for me - truly a great experience.",
    "Learn chords and basics of music theory",
    "I learned how to read music and analyze songs, patterns, motifs, and learned other key terms in music.",
    "Abilities to read music, understand scales, and other musical elements for beginners.",
    "I learned a lot about the foundational elements of music. The bulk of my learning was concentrated on chords of all forms: major, minor, diminished and augmented. I then learned how to use chord progression to write a cohesive melody.",
    "This class greatly improved my understanding of music as a whole (since I had absolutely no musical background prior to taking this course).",
    "I've played various instruments for several years but I'd never really gotten a hang of music theory until this class. I also loved the chance to write my own music, something I'll pursue in the future."

    "The course was awesome. The weekly quizzes, while the idea sounds brutal, were very beneficial in encouraging you to learn the material and stay engaged in the course. They were never impossibly difficult either, so it wasn't as if they were forcing you to spend insane amounts of time studying. No, they did as they were meant to - encourage you to simply at least look at the reading and understand key concepts  Class was good - between listening to music, analyzing it, keyboard playing, and simple classical teaching and learning, class was well run. No suggestions in particular",
    "Super fun and pretty light class",
    "Strength: the material is manageable and fun to learn!",
    "Professor Lalli is wonderful.  Knowledgeable and entertaining, he makes his classes entertaining and informative.  The main weakness of this course is that it involves a lot of memorization and rote practice (although this is hard to avoid in an intro music theory course)."

    "Absolutely. Professor Lalli was great, the course was fully successful in teaching material and helping me to learn music. It was super chill, workload wasn't anything crazy - truly just a course that I enjoyed and learned a lot from.",
    "Absolutely, take it with Lalli if you can, he is a gem",
    "I have already recommended this class to other students because I thought the class was very interesting and fun so it made it easy to learn and stay engaged.",
    "Yes!  It is a fun and engaging class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others;  it does a great job of teaching the fundamentals of music theory, regardless of your musical background.",
    "Take this course with Professor Lalli. He will provide you with a great basis to appreciate music."
