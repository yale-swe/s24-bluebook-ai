                "The course overall feels quite disorganized.\r\n1. Discussions sections often weren't posted until 5-7 days after, which wasn't very helpful.\r\n2. I wish there was more material available to help us study for the exams, such as past exams and p-set solutions so we can compare.\r\n3. The formula sheets are very messy and difficult to follow\r\n4. P-sets also were not posted until 3 days after class, meaning we had less than the full week to complete them. This felt unfair, and it was often inconsistent timing to what the professor said.\r\n5. There are only 2 TAs, and not enough office hours for them as well as the professor.",
                "Strengths: JT is funny, good overview on basic stats. Weaknesses: problem sets way too convoluted and expectations for them are unclear, super disorganized internally (month behind on grading and lectures), not engaging, slow moving, pretty much everything to be quite honest. I wish I had this semester back.",
                "The strengths are that JT is a likable person and engaging professor. The weaknesses are that the course is poorly organized, you do not receive feedback on PSETS in a timely manner (they each build on each other, but didn't get them all graded with feedback until a few days before the final), and limited office hours.",
                "Strengths: charismatic teacher that encourages engagement, life and times of Justin Thomas, Material taught thoroughly\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture Notes a little messy, section is redundant and unnecessary, stata not used enough in class, dry material meant class was boring at times",
                "A weakness of the class is the pace of lecture. Often, JT had to postpone problem sets because we didn't get through the necessary material. This became frustrating, especially while preparing for the final as I did not receive feedback on the last problem set before the exam. Another weakness is the professor's unavailability; tracking him down for a meeting or getting a response via email was challenging. However, the teaching assistants made up for this and are the course's strength. Nicole was incredible. She was always available to meet and walk me through the material, as well as review problem sets and answer last-minute review sessions before exams.",
                "The strength of the course was that the practical application of the material taught in class is very apparent. The material is challenging but gratifying once learned. The personality of Professor Thomas was a major strength of the class as well. His lectures were very engaging, and I don't imagine the lessons would sink in nearly as well were it not for his lecture style. Also, the workload was decent but never overwhelming, which I appreciated.",
                "Strengths: JT is a great teacher, and discussion section really does help you. Weaknesses: very poorly organized, last three weeks of class gets insanely rushed, a couple of the psets drag on for really more than they should (Who in gods name asks someone to perform linear regression by hand???), and frankly there isn't enough resources to actually help you. No ULAs, TFs are busy, and you can meet with JT...for 15 minutes once a week... Good luck getting a response from him via email...",
                "Professor JT was by far the best thing about this course. The class format is highly organized with a pset due every other week, and exams exactly follow the materials reviewed in the lecture. Reading is not mandatory but can greatly help.",
                "Lecture was very slow and at times unnecessarily repetitive. This at times even caused some confusion in the material and could shroud important content in between some less crucial information.\r\n\r\nSection was efficient for this reason.\r\n\r\nA study guide of content offering all theoretical explanations and reasoning behind quantitative methods as discussed in lecture would be supremely helpful.\r\n\r\nPsets at times were not graded consistently. If there is going to be such a rigorous criteria for what constitutes a fully correct answer, it might be worth spending some more time to correct this difference.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING:\r\nGrading was fair(ish). Very possible to succeed if you attend lecture and pay attention to the psets but at the same time given the very high standard and at times unforgiving level of detail they hold you to you gotta really make sure you got things down on lock. It is a bit unfortunate tho how high stakes things can seem and that detracted a bit from my class experience but so long as a reasonable number of people get an A I think its probably fine",
                "Strengths: JT is funny, engaging, and kind. I found Stata to be very easy to learn and use. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very slow speed of class. Often we would spend 2 or even 3 days on the same lecture. We only had two problem sets before the midterm. The material is somewhat dry.",
                "STRENGTHS: focus on understanding \"why\" rather than just \"what\" or \"how\", straightforward exams that the lectures\/psets\/discussion sections prepare you very well for, JT is an engaging person. I think this is a fantastic intro statistics course. WEAKNESSES: This course had very weird pacing. We would spend a very long time hammering down one detail in lecture that didn't seem all that complicated, and very little time on actually important conceptual understandings. Also, I understand that JT doesn't include theory in slides because he wants you to come to lecture and pay attention, but it made studying for exams and doing psets very uncertain because you had to rely on your notes of JT's (sometimes inconsistent) wording from lecture. Psets were also incredibly tedious and repetitive, often asking the same questions over and over again rather than testing different angles or different kinds of concepts. Grading seemed inconsistent across friends in the class and I was often confused as to why I had points deducted from psets.",
                "Strengths: the professor is a great lecturer. \r\nWeaknesses: before the midterm we did not get really far or nearly as far as we should have gotten. Therefore after the midterm we were on times 2 speed and had long psets due every week. Furthermore, the class needs like an extra TA. But the only office hours available to meet with TA's were during my class times. Furthermore, the professor holds Zoom office hours but they are 15 minutes and he is usually 5-10 minutes late to them. Another weakness, that stems from not having enough TA's is not getting work back in a timely manner. There was one pset that we did not get back\/did not have solutions to that the next PSET was related. If I had gotten the first pset back on time, I would not have made those mistakes on the second one. Furthermore, things he barely covers are on exams, in lecture he never gives concrete answers and it is all wishy washy. He always tries to have a class in which the students engage\/guess answers, but that is so confusing and especially when he is introducing new material he needs to be concise and precise. The course is extremely disorganized.",
                "It was a little less straightforward than it could have been. I also think that more visualizations of the material (as we filled in the map of what we knew) would be really useful given the way that all these topics are related. This would highlight those relationships instead of explaining them as if they are each their own thing.",
                "This course objectively seems like a really important class, and I know I will use the content in the future. However, the method through which it was taught was not conducive to my learning, and made it hard for me to see that big picture. I think this could be improved by a better pace from the outset of the class. I was very bored by the first few weeks, so I thought I knew what was going on and started to zone out right when important information started being introduced. I think this class tricked a lot of people with its pace\/content at first. I also think this class is too big to have only 2 TFs. The problem sets took forever to get graded (the few we had), and with so few grades in the class, this also made it hard to know how I was doing with the material. There are way too few grades for this class too. I feel like I put a lot of hard work into this class, but my grades did not show it.",
                "Although this course makes the best of a fairly dry topic, enhancing student engagement could be achieved by revising the problem sets. Reducing the amount of manual calculations and focusing more on conceptual understanding would make the material more accessible and engaging.",
                "Strengths: The prof does a good job of explaining concepts and being thorough. Lectures would be very boring without the prof's humor here and there, so he does a good job of helping students stay engaged. \r\nWeaknesses: P-Sets were long and tedious, and the course had virtually no resources or additional help for students. Office hours for both the prof and TFs were VERY limited. The prof rushes you to ask all of your questions within a 15-minute time slot but takes a long time to answer each question, sometimes unnecessarily so, and is sometimes very unhelpful and ambiguous. The prof is also a bit disorganized and unresponsive. He does not answer emails, sometimes pushes psets back because of not being able to get through enough content in lectures, and emails about upcoming events (i.e. surveys, make up lecture, review session, etc.) only a few days before it happens, which doesn't give students a lot of time to plan ahead. The formula sheet for the midterm and the final was also VERY unnecessarily disorganized and disorienting.",
                "The course was a great introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics, and was extremely accessible to all skill levels. As someone who has never before taken a statistics course, I was able to learn the material wit. I deeply appreciated the opportunity to ask questions during lecture, which kept me much more engaged throughout the duration of the course. However, the course was disorganized in that we often fell behind in the pacing of lectures, which meant we did have to have a Saturday lecture. One way to improve the physical and health-related accessibility of this course would be to record lectures and release the recordings to students who have a Dean's Excuse. I missed several lectures for medical appointments, and since some of the content is discussed and explained beyond the slides, had difficulty in catching up. Problem sets were also returned very late, which made exam preparation difficult.",
                "JT is great, the course needs more structure. The PSets were not timed out (we only had 2 before the midterm) and were not available until the last minute for final studying as hard as the TFs tried. We moved slow in some parts but buzzed through others, especially in the last few weeks of class.",
                "Strengths: the professor. He is really great as are the TFs. I like the structure of this class with a large lecture and a discussion section. Weaknesses: the timing of the discussion section compared to when the psets were due. I had section on Thursday, and psets were often due Wednesday, but some of the info we learned\/reviewed in section would have been extremely helpful on the pset I had turned in the day before. This was quite frustrating. I liked it much better when psets were due Friday, because we had a chance to compile our questions and go to section to get them answered. Although there is always office hours, sometimes you don't know what you don't know, so office hours wasn't always the best option. Additionally, I wish section notes were posted BEFORE section, as were the lecture notes, because I had a Thursday section and the section notes were not posted until after the section on Friday, which slowed me down in reviewing\/working on psets. It would be fair for everyone if they were posted before all discussion sections for that week began. Additionally, I would like psets to be graded before the next pset is due. In this class, concepts build on one another, so it is extremely important to know what one is doing wrong so that we can improve. However, grading was quite slow, so every week I wasn't sure that I was doing it correctly. Is feels unfair that half of our psets were graded in the last two weeks before our exams.",
                "I think the strengths are the time taken to go over complicated concepts in class. The weaknesses of the course were that the assignments often took a while to get feedback or grades on them.",
                "We always ended up a bit behind schedule so towards the end I felt like the material was a bit rushed and I wasn't fully ready\/prepared for the exam.",
                "Strengths: JT! He is awesome and truly the key part of this course. He is really committed to getting students through the thick of the statistical theory. I was touched by how he learned everyone's name and really tried to keep the course engaging. He really pushes you to understand the theory & methods deeply, and I found myself favoring true understanding over memorization in this course (a nice feeling!) \r\n\r\nWeakness: Office hours schedule, help with problem sets. The problem sets are really dense and often took me ~10 hours of work each week. Coupled with the fact that the Psets were very much unevenly distributed across the term (skew towards November&December), I found the Psets to be unusually grueling.",
                "Strengths: JT is a nice instructor who keeps the class engaged. Weaknesses: The TF's grade very poorly, the class material is very boring, and the grading is so harsh to the point where it's so hard to get an A on the exam and even on the PSETS.",
                "Strengths: Fair exams, practical knowledge, provided with everything necessary to succeed, engaging lectures and dialogue, relevant to its (generally) non-STEM student body.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Inconsistent grading on problem sets, tedious work on occasion, office hours parroting lecture.",
                "Soo much disorganization in the fact that the expectations for the PSets and Tests were soo immensely high. More examples should've been given to what is explicitly expected of students to accomplish during the course. Points would be taken off for the smallest \"mistakes\", and JT leaves it up to each student to figure out how exactly he wants your statistical analyses to be. This proves to be extremely difficult in a Q&A environment where explicit examples are solemnly given, and the right questions are not asked. The PSets not even being graded until like 3 weeks later makes it worse. This course could be improved by changing the teaching to reflect specific examples of expectations in addition to the theory, guided visuals in the lecture notes (not by hand) of what JT wishes to teach to the students in understanding the meaning of statistical analysis, and much more lower-stakes practice with frequent feedback.",
                "I think there should be less time for students to guess how we do some of the learning in lecture. I think it wastes time and I would rather learn from the professor. Also calling on people is not the best way for us to learn.",
                "Strengths: JT is super engaging, great at explaining things in a way that's relevant to our lives, and gives completely reasonable assignments and tests. The psets, although long (!), were straightforward and helped to drill in the information of the course. \r\nWeaknesses: We fell behind and had considerably more content in the second half of the course - but, since the second half builds upon the solid foundation created in the first half, this wasn't actually a huge issue. JT is busy and his office hours fill up quickly, and he's not great at responding to emails, so go to your TAs for help - Nicole was great.",
                "Hard psets and tests",
                "It was strong in terms of content, but the pacing of work was confused.\r\nWe did not have enough Psets in the beginning of the term, and too many later on. \r\n\r\nI would also strongly suggest 2 midterms for this course, since many students were not sufficiently prepared for the format, rather than the content, of the first midterm. Theyd be happy to do more work, if its more evenly spaced out.",
                "The strength of this course was Professor Thomas' engagement and enthusiasm surrounding the material. He talked and explained each topic thoroughly to help us students understand. He also began each class with a fun story about him and his family to grab our attention every day. One weakness within this course was its organization. The timeline for problem sets felt a bit inconsistent. At one point we went a month with no problem sets and then immediately after had problem sets every week for four problem sets straight. We also had to skip a problem set one week.",
                "Course goes slow enough to truly grasp the theoretical material but the lecture sometimes goes too slow. Course syllabus and order of material presented is very well organized and efficient to the learning process.",
                "The professor makes the class very engaging and interesting. However, I heard many students feel that the course was disorganized and very slow-paced. We would spend a lot of time discussing the basics of the concepts but I would still have trouble answering conceptual questions on the problem sets or exams. The TA's office hours for this semester were very inconvenient because they would often overlap with other class times or be after a problem set was due. The discussion sections were a lot of help when it came to reviewing concepts but they would often run through very quickly. The grading was also very specific but they accept regrade requests for specific problems which I think was very useful. The format of the exam is pretty straightforward, but I would not necessarily say that the exam itself is easy. I thought that the exams were significantly harder than the problem sets. They would mostly ask about concepts that we discussed, but not in the way that we learned them. From my experience in this class, lectures and discussion sections are not enough for you to be confident in the concepts asked on the exams. Prior experience in statistics or further learning is required.",
                "The TF grading was very hard and not super transparent. Before the final exam, we did not have enough time to review the penultimate and final pset, and this contributed to the confusion of many students. On the flip side, the TF's were amazing regarding their teaching. A special shout-out to Walid for how incredible he was. Without Walid, we would be nowhere. \r\n\r\nJT is also one of the best professor\/teacher\/educators I have ever had! He is so funny, and engaging, and brilliant.",
                "Very interesting and highly applicable information and examples. Theoretical aspects were hard to grasp and more time could have been spent on those topics.",
                "Lectures go by very slowly, hard to stay engaged with the material. Discussion section was fantastic",
                "This course seems disorganized, including the release and grading of problem sets. In addition, I did not find the discussion sections very engaging or supplemental to my learning.",
                "This professor needs more TFs to help with timely grading. My emails with questions were never responded to by the professor and I received only one delayed response from a TF (I included the professor and both TFs in every email I sent).",
                "I think a lot of the content didn't feel relevant to what I want to do, which is working in the state department. I'd rather understand research than conduct it. I also know that many of the techniques we learned for conducting statistical tests are already being conducted by AI in many places. I think for me a better skill would have been learning to identify flaws in research and research design and working out how to fix them and what you can or can't infer about particular results.",
                "Problem sets were definitely long, but were really good prep for tests. JT is an awesome professor and guy, and he was always there to help and answer questions. TFs were great too.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures, problem sets with reasonable length and reasonably spaced out, very helpful sections, strong explanations of the reasoning behind statistical methods; office hours are readily available and the professor is very helpful \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes organized, would have to schedule makeup lecture dates when the professor missed one, which was inconvenient; fell behind in lectures because prof takes too many questions in class; psets and exams were often handed back late, which makes it hard to learn from your work for the next assessment",
                "Some content had to be revised or skipped over due to the time constraints of the term, so perhaps some restructuring to better ensure that all necessary topics can be covered with the required depth would be beneficial. A strength of this course, however, was the easy-to-follow structure of the information flow, which helped me to stay on top of my work in the course and always know what was required of me.",
                "The weaknesses of this course was its pacing. I felt that the course progressed at a very slow pace initially and then sped up disproportionately as the course neared its end. I also felt that the course name was misleading. I did not feel that I \"applied\" the subjects taught to broader issues or learned about public policy and global affairs research.",
                "The strengths of this course are its seminar feel in a lecture setting, its applicable content\/material, and its assignments that help students succeed academically in the class. \r\nA weakness of the course is its limited office hours; however, Professor Thomas is willing to meet with students outside of his allotted office hours if they were not able to get an appointment on time. Another weakness of the course is the textbook assigned problems that do not help students understand the content on the level they should. Problem set questions that resemble the midterm and final questions are beneficial to the students' learning and understanding of the material, and it would be better to provide more of these questions rather than the elementary problems from the textbook.",
                "strengths: increidble professor that is kind and engaging.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: this class has 6 PSETS which is already quite low for an intro class. all six were due with no late days, ability to drop one, or even accepting submissions post the deadline. this made it very inflexible especially when there is so only six a semester. Furthermore, 2 of the PSETS were before fall break, 4 after  making the division of workload rather imbalanced for midterm vs final. Finally, we got our midterm grades back after the drop period."

                "If you don't have to take this class for global affairs I would not. The work is tedious and the p-sets are structured in a way that doesn't facilitate learning, they just take so much time and are brutal to get through. JT is an amazing lecturer but the content is not fun.",
                "I would take a different stats class e.g. S&DS 100",
                "No, I'm only taking it because it's required",
                "No, no, no!!! This is by far the most disorganized class I have ever taken or heard about at Yale. You might think I'm exaggerating, but we were literally a month behind in lectures and problem sets, grading took forever (we didn't have half of our problem sets back before the deadline for Credit\/D), and JT was consistently inconsistent in his announcements and putting things on Canvas. Furthermore, it is way, way too much of a focus on theory and being scientifically exact for an intro stats course for the GLBL major. Grading is a crapshoot based on whether you use the specific wording that they want to see, so good luck with that. JT is funny for sure, but he definitely needs to do some introspection on how his class runs. Like dude, there's probably a reason that no one in your 100 person class is jumping at the opportunity to answer the question you asked about a topic that we've been talking about for half an hour. It's so mind-numbingly tedious that the entire class would be counting down each minute to lunch. Absolutely laughable that this is the best Yale can do. Me and several others are dropping the GLBL major because of this class, so I guess it's a good weed-out class. Only take it if you are fine with learning the most meticulous statistical theory over and over without really applying it except on problem sets. Oh, it's also crazy that they are still using Stata and forcing us to get a subscription to a software program that I'm pretty sure was created in the 1980s. Absolutely ridiculous waste of tuition money.",
                "I would not recommend this class unless you are required to take it for the Global Affairs major.",
                "Only if required",
                "I am not considering Global Affairs students in this response as GLBL 121 is a requirement for the major. I would not recommend this course to another student. If students are interested in learning more about statistics, I suggest they take Introduction to Statistics: Political Science, Social Science, et cetera.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I had never taken a statistics class before this, but by the end I had a genuine interest in the subject. So I would recommend it to any student who has an interest in research statistics, regardless of prior experience. And, again, I would recommend this course because the professor was excellent and the workload was not overwhelming.",
                "No, but it's required for global. Get it out of the way.",
                "Absolutely not. Before you read other reviews please hear my diatribe. \r\nWhen you think you have a really nice professor who makes every effort to appear that they care, but they advertently or inadvertently sabotage your ability to perform in the class, you have a case of Stockholm Syndrome. That is the case with GLBL 121 with Justin Thomas. \r\nThis is the most useless class I have ever seen. First of all, Justin Thomas was completely and utterly useless. The man goes the speed of molasses through lecture. Its perhaps worse than watching paint dry, because at least when the paint dries you have a product you are proud of. With Justin Thomas, you stare in confusion at the board attempting to crack a smile so as to match his enthusiasm, wondering what is for lunch and questioning when you will ever need to use any of what you learn in this class in your life. Justin Thomas goes so slowly, in fact, that I wrote a number of poems throughout my time in the classthis was a newly discovered ability of mine. I think the mind can really wander when there is 0 substance to actually take in and when you so badly want to be somewhere else.\r\nNow you could just say wow, but isnt stats just boring - thats exactly what Justin Thomas says. His solution? Not to power through material and to show us actual cool real world examples, but rather to spend 10 minutes at the beginning of class telling a seemingly funny, unrelated story to keep people engaged. The class is so boring, in fact, that he has implemented policies such that if two or more students are sleeping in class, everyone has to stand up and recite a cult like speech telling him that they will never again fall asleep in class. \r\nNext, lets talk about the Justin Thomas give you a zero on the assignment if it is a second late policy. This is the nail in the coffin for Justin Thomas lovers. I struggle to process the mental gymnastics required to love your professor and say he is so fun and to simultaneously accept their policy to give you a zero on the assignment if it is a second late. Justin Thomas may claim to have his justifications for how late work becomes even later work, but it is difficult to reconcile his insistence on assignments being turned in on time with his a) repeatedly moving back psets because he went more slowly, and b) TAs failing to grade PSETS for close to a month after they are turned in. Why have a give you a zero if your PSET is a second late policy if it will not be graded for a month? \r\nNot to mention, the PSET and exam grading is horrendous. Some of the questions are all or nothing - i.e. if ONE word in your explanation is wrong, you get 0 credit. On my midterm, I got full credit on everything until the last three questions which asked us to describe terms\/concepts - in each, the TAs thought something was slightly off and no cap deducted 15 points. \r\nTo make matters even worse, all of the problem sets are completely and utterly useless. Ive done Math 120 and intro econ courses - my experience is that those PSETS are actually intelligent even if occasionally annoying - you actually learn from them. Oh no, not here. Justin Thomas will have you do the same problem no cap 3 or four times BY HAND, specifically stating that you CANNOT use a statistical software to do the calculations, and if you miss even the slightest part of an explanation, POINTS OFF. It makes you wonder how mickey mouse the class is that Justin Thomas acts all laddy da during lecture and proceeds to have his TAs destroy you on grading and hell give you the most useless PSETS to complete. Its almost like he hates his students but Justin Thomas couldnt hate his students?!\r\nReally, then lets talk about how he literally has you learn STATA and not R, which everyone tells me is far more powerful and useful. No one uses STATA. So much for his speech at the beginning of the of the year where he says this class will actually be useful in your real life. \r\nSave yourself, don't",
                "Take it if you need it for your major (global). If you are just looking for a stats course I would consider other options, simply because of the workload of the class.",
                "Excellent first course in statistics. Ive taken the others and this was the best",
                "I would take this class if you are considering majoring in Global Affairs. Otherwise, I would take a regular statistics class.",
                "It's a really good intro stats course for what it's worth. I know GLBL students are required to take it, but it provides a very good foundational understanding of statistics that I am confident will be helpful in future courses and work. If you do take it, SHOW UP TO CLASS and PAY ATTENTION in class. JT says a lot of important things that are NOT on the slides that you will need to know to succeed in this class.",
                "Unless they were needing it for the Global affairs major or EPE, no. Students would be better off taking Stats 101 or 230 with JRS. It is much more straight forward and you use statistical methods that are actually gonna get you a job and be used in the real world. Furthermore, the course is really outdated making us do everything by hand when there are things like STATA, R, and Minitab that do it??",
                "I think if it is for your major, yes. However, I felt like the content was easy, just overwhelming. In addition to the amount of content accumulated by the end, the organization of the class really threw me off and had me concerned about my grade or even my standing as a student in the class. This made it harder to retain the information because I was doubting myself without much reassurance from teachers of the class.",
                "Take it if you're a Global Affairs major. JT is a fun instructor but lectures move very slowly and this class is poorly organized  no practice exams, recorded lectures uploaded last-minute with incredibly important material, p-sets canceled or moved around without clear communication  it's not hard, but it is occasionally frustrating.",
                "No. If you're not a Global major, take another course. For ECON 117 kids, you'll learn much more relevant content in ECON 117 than in this class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to students interested in studying any social science, especially because of the practical and occupational applications (ex. Stata). The introduction to statistical methods is gradual, but the pace picks up rapidly. It's an accessible yet intellectually challenging course.",
                "If you need it for the major, take it as early as you can and start in 121 -- don't take a substitute.",
                "I would recommend this course, but only if they do not have a heavy course load. I learned a lot, but the psets consistently took me upwards of 10 hours to complete, and I think part of that was the fact that I was not getting clear feedback on what I was doing right or wrong, so I overthought every question.",
                "If you are a global major, you probably have to, but JT makes it worth it. He is the best lecture professor I have had at Yale. As someone with no statistical background, I was so proud of myself by the end of the term for how much I had soaked up. He really pushes you to understand the theory & methodology behind what the math that we do mostly on computer programs, and this makes me feel really prepared for the real world. Everything you do in this course feels purposeful and useful.",
                "I would definitely not recommend this course to another student. If you need this as a pre-req, then take it. But if you're not and you're taking this class because it's \"useful,\" don't take this class. Spare yourself the time and stress and take an easier stats class. I was an EPE major before taking this class and this class is the reason why I dropped EP&E. It was so hard and stressful and I don't want to take another stats class after this.",
                "Absolutely! The course is the perfect introduction to the real methods and ideas behind social science research relevant to any student interested in Global Affairs, Economics, Sociology, or other adjacent fields.",
                "Would not recommend unless a Global Affairs Major. Intro Stats courses are better alternatives even when the course is supposedly better for GA analysis, because the material and organization of this course is severely lacking, and examples of proper analysis are solemnly given.",
                "Yes for Global Affairs but no for others because there are other stats courses.",
                "Yes, especially Global majors - JT provides a great foundational understanding that actually feels relevant to other classes\/studies as well as our lives. It's engaging, easy to organize, and not too much work (though the psets are long!).",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, but I would try to prepare this student for the format of the first midterm.",
                "I would probably recommend this course to a student who already had a working background in statistics. Thus, they could do a bit of independent studying at home in order to keep up.",
                "Yes! It is a great course to understand the value and procedures of statistics in the social sciences. Great for learning how to read statistical material with comprehension of its collection. The instructor is so great!!! JT might actually be the coolest teacher and has a phenomenal sense of when to slow things down. Has a really great way of breaking things down in simple terms.",
                "I would not recommend this course to a student if they have the option to take different statistic classes.",
                "Definitely. I would tell them that this class demands that you work no matter how much experience you have under your belt, but that the growth is worth it. That being said, I would mention that where the midterm exam is fair, the final is brutal.",
                "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in the quantitative analysis and those hoping to pursue the Global Affairs major.",
                "If it is a requirement for the major then yes",
                "Overall, I enjoyed the content of the course and I would recommend it to another student.",
                "Yes. The professor made the class very engaging.",
                "Yes, but only if you want to be a researcher or if you have to take it for a requirement. Other than that, no - but JT is so kind and really a great communicator.",
                "For anyone interested in stats or being a critical consumer of research, this class is definitely a good one.",
                "Yes! JT is an amazing professor and the class has a lot of great, interesting, and extremely useful content to learn from. It's important to pay careful attention to his lectures and the psets to do well in the class.",
                "If a student was seeking to major in the social sciences, I would recommend the class because it is geared towards relevant experiences they might have at internships and the like before entering the workforce, so it could be a useful starting point in the field of statistics.",
                "No, never. it was much too theoretic, we were way behind, and the test was much more difficult than the psets.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they are required to take the course for their major.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that is interested in statistical analysis and social science research. The class delves into theory and analysis that makes students better consumers of research and more ready for the professional world. The atmosphere of the class is fun and engaging with a personable professor and collaboration amongst peers. It is not an easy class, but it is definitely one that is worth taking."
