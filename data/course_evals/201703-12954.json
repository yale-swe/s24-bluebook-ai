    "I learned about the history of neuroscience methods and how they work together with neuroanatomy, chemical and electrical gradients, and model systems. Also conquered my fear of dissection!",
    "Important research techniques and skills.",
    "This class was essentially a semester spent on learning action potentials. While it was interesting and engaging at first with the dissection of the sheep brain, the labs continued to be a bit repetitive and dull. Although presented in slightly different manners, it seemed as if there could be other areas of neuroscience that could be explored in the second half of the semester. I can confidently say I know a lot about action potentials, but I don't think I've really gained much besides that.",
    "Through this class I gained an increased understanding of brain structures, action potentials, and the methods used in research."

   "comments": [
    "All of the sections of the course work together. There's a short lecture one day of the week and a lab the other day. However, it's sometimes unclear that the sections work together and play off of each other until the very end of the course.",
    "Full comprehension of all concepts.",
    "Labs were interesting for the most part. I didn't really see the lectures on Monday being that helpful. Yes, it's nice to have background material, but I didn't feel it was sufficient to really prep for labs in the way it was intended. Also, labs focusing on other range of topics would have been nice too.",
    "The strength of this course was the brain dissections, neuron labs, and invertebrate labs. The class could be improved with more detailed slides, including slides with more descriptions of the figures after they are presented to aid in studying. Also more discussion about how the information learned on Mondays during lecture are being applied to the labs could further aid in understanding of the methods in neuroscience research."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend if you're interested in neuroscience methods and you're ready to get a little out of your comfort zone. Get ready to spend time doing dissections and analyzing graphs of action potentials.",
    "Yes",
    "It's a requirement for Psych\/Neuro, so you have to take it if that's your major. Otherwise, no would not recommend. I believe there are other psych or neuro classes where you can learn much more, while still covering the details learned in this class about action potentials.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it improved my understanding of brain structures and the neural response to a stimulus."
