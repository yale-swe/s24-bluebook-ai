                "I continued to expand my knowledge of Old English as a language from the foundation I had developed in Dr. Thornbury's more introductory Old English class. I also gained a working knowledge of a wide variety of literary theories (e.g. New Criticism, queery theory, ecocriticism, postcolonial theory) that have emerged in the past 100 years. Dr. Thornbury also commented on each of the theories and their connections to the Yale English department (fascinating information!).",
                "Literary Criticism: Professor Thornbury brilliantly wove in different critical approaches to this course  from New Criticism and Historicism to Queer Studies and Marxism  and so this class felt like much more than a class about medieval literature. It was really wonderful to get a range of critical perspectives that I hadn't encountered before in my English education. \r\n\r\nResearch: Professor Thornbury structured the class so that we were thinking about our final projects for about 2/3 of the term, which helped so much when it came time to actually write! I was so grateful for the instruction and guidance she offered in choosing a topic, looking for sources, using footnotes, and more.",
                "This class focused on the Exeter Book poetry. You could take either of two tracks: Old English translation, or non-translation. If you took the OE translation track, you had the opportunity to practice your reading but it was expected you already knew the grammar."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the dual focus on literary theory/criticism and Old English literature. Weaknesses: the amount of reading was vaguely insane. I had been planning to take 3 English classes this semester, but I dropped one as soon as I realized how much reading this class would be. I should mention that I was doing the readings in the original Old English. The class is probably less intense if you are doing the readings in translation.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Learning more about literary criticism and an array of approaches\r\n- Discussing both critical approaches and text in each class\r\n- Professor Thornbury's leadership of each class session\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- None that I can think of!",
                "This was a wonderful course that I really enjoyed. Professor Thornbury is the best of the best. Her classes are very organized and it is always very clear where you stand and what her feedback is."

                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Old English (or old English) literature as a foundational and integral part of the evolution of the English literary tradition. If you know Old English, then doing the readings in Old English will require a level of consistent work, but it is worthwhile.",
                "I'd absolutely recommend The Exeter Book to another student! It was wonderful to learn more about different literary critical approaches (e.g. historicism, ecocriticism, race & postcolonial studies) through the lens of medieval literature, and the class is structured so well  students sign up for presentations and thus take ownership of a specific text and critical approach for a given week, but that responsibility rotates so that there are always a few people who have deeply engaged with the material to help lead class discussion. I also appreciated the way that Professor Thornbury led our class discussions and structured the assignments that built toward our final project. By the time I got to writing, I felt like I'd laid a great foundation. This class is an excellent entry point into medieval literature and to literary criticism.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class, but people should know if they take the translation track it will be many hours of work per week. Otherwise, it was a great time--but it was definitely my biggest workload. I would not take it with another heavy-load class."
