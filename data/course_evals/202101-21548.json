                "The material in this course is a wide survey of complex analysis and high level maths in general. Topics include meromorphic functions, gamma and zeta functions and analogs of these functions, harmonic functions, conformal maps, and a lot of geometrical material including reflection principles, elliptical functions, Riemann Surfaces, and topology.",
                "A whirlwind tour of many topics related to complex analysis - we started with the Mittag-Leffler theorem and the Weierstrass product formula. Then, we learned about the gamma function and the zeta function. Followed by a discussion of harmonic functions and the Schwarz reflection principle. A bit about Riemannian surfaces. A bit about elementary conformal mappings (including the Christoffel-Schwarz formula). After the midterm, we talked a lot more about connections with other areas of math, like topology and differential geometry. We also learned about the hypergeometric function, the Schwarzian derivative, and conformal mappings to circular arc polygons.",

                "I learnt not only so much about complex analysis, but also its connections to other parts of mathematics, namely, partial differential equations, Riemann surfaces, hyperbolic geometry, and classical algebraic geometry. The course material itself was treated very solidly. Prof. Goncharov often gave his own proofs and perspectives of the discussed material, such as using distributions to discuss the convergence of Poisson integrals. He drew a straight line from the study of harmonic functions to conformal mappings, passing by hyperbolic geometry and contour integration. There was also a beautiful section on hyperbolic plane tilings, another on automorphism groups, it's all very much and very beautiful. We did not get to elliptic functions/curves this year, though I think it was on the syllabus."

                "Strengths: This is a beautiful course, and Goncharov is a great and passionate teacher. The lectures were very engaging. One gains a deeper understanding of mathematics through this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Goncharov is brilliant to a point where it is a bit hard for him to correctly asses what an undergraduate might know coming in to this course. In addition, the problem sets and midterms are graded rather inconsistently, and there is a little bit of a disconnect between these and the material taught in class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Goncharov is a great lecturer - he explains things very clearly and geometrically (he draws lots and lots of pictures). He also constantly pauses for questions, which was very helpful especially when there is so much material to digest. Professor Goncharov really highlights the connections between complex analysis and other areas of math, which I think is crucial for us students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, the class felt a little disorganized and became a bit hard to follow. Perhaps following a textbook at times might have been helpful.",
                "The only small weakness of the course was that sometimes Professor Goncharov would assume that we knew some things that we didn't. Yet he is extremely receptive to questions - more so than any other professor I've had - if you take this class you MUST be willing to interrupt when something does not make sense! But everything is truly excellent, , everything else is excellent - the lectures are engaging and the material is interesting.",
                "This class is of very good taste. Prof. Goncharov gave us a very global view of complex analysis, and was also very philosophical about how all of mathematics was connected. The problem sets were fun and not tedious (in general). The class is small, so he encouraged lots of questions. It's really the variety of material and personalization of it that made this class so much better than other math classes I've taken at Yale and elsewhere."

                "This is an amazing subject, and every math major should take it before graduating. I will say that this is the last math course that you should take at Yale. Math 310 is listed as the only prerequisite, but this is not accurate. If you do not want to take Math 310 at Yale because it is generally poorly taught, then you can still take this class if you study up a little bit on complex analysis on your own; I would encourage you to do so. However, you should also know a fair bit of differential geometry, topology, Lie Theory, Group Theory, differential equations, advanced linear algebra, functional analysis, differential forms, and the Beta Function before attempting this class. Professor Goncharov is a bit out of touch when it comes to what an undergraduate might know, so he will assume this to be general knowledge for those taking his course. Also, most of the population of this class consists of \"Math God\"-level students; I am closer to average in the math major, so I was a bit outclassed. Again, though, this is a beautiful course, and you should definitely see the material in it, which is why I recommend taking this as your final math course - so that you will be as prepared as possible before attempting it.",
                "Yes!",
                "If you are a math major, you have take this course with Goncharov. The course is called intermediate complex analysis, but it's really about mathematics as a whole (of course with a heavy emphasis on complex analysis) - we touched on number theory, algebraic geometry, etc. People have always said that everything in mathematics is connected, and it's in this course where I really realized that. There was just so much stuff that I didn't know that I didn't know. That alone makes the course worth taking. There's also random bits of math history sprinkled in - you really get to see why certain constructions were made.",
                "Absolutely! This is one of the best math courses I have taken at Yale. I learned so much about complex analysis, and it's relation to other branches of modern mathematics: from number theory, to differential geometry and complex manifolds, and more. Prof. Goncharov really tried to emphasize how topics in mathematics all link together to form a single connected discipline. I learned so much about modern mathematics, and also about the history of math, all while learning some really beautiful complex analysis. Fantastic course overall  I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
                "Yes! Obviously, this class is more or less unavoidable for undergrads after the dual MS/BSc. I think complex analysis is one of the more beautiful things there are, as soon as the geometric elements are introduced in full. If you liked the conformal map stuff in 310, or the topological flavour of the Cauchy integral formula, you'll love this class. Also, \"complex analysis\" is sort of a misnomer, because in most grad complex ana classes you always see things from other parts of mathematics, which makes this course all the more valuable."
