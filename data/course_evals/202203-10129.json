                "I enjoyed the practicum, the hands on prompts allows for a better understanding of how what we learn in lecture actually works. I thought the problem sets and problem sessions was a good amount of homework and easy access to professors if we had questions. \r\n\r\nTo improve the course I would try and contain the practicum within the designated class time. I would also encourage it to be in person, as we are not interactive over zoom. Even with the second session on Thursdays, often we wouldn't have started by that time to ask questions. If it was held in person I feel it would be a better use of everyones time. The outline of the schedule could also be improved. It was confusing to know the deadlines of different assignments.",
                "Homework was always confusing and hints and clarification was always needed. The lectures were too much material and higher level then what was needed to answer homework and exams. \r\n\r\nPracticums did help with understanding but sometimes didn't align with the lectures. Sometimes felt like an extra class and help session was too soon from the practicum lecture."
