                "I really enjoyed Ben Polak's flipped classroom where he guided students on the answer to one of the questions on the psets. Really help deepen our knowledge while cutting back on workload.",

                "The lectures get a little difficult to follow especially after the midterm which is why the recordings were so helpful. The problem sets are challenging but ultimately rewarding.",
                "This course was made all the more engaging through the use of in-class games that directly involved students' participation. These would have been much more fun in person, but they were fair enough online.",
                "Strengths: they understood game theory to take advantage of students\r\nWeaknesses: they understood game theory to take advantage of students",
                "Strengths: I learned a LOT. Professor Polak always pulled up interesting examples and we played intellectual games to explain challenging concepts. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: STRESS. EXAMS. THE GRADING CURVE. Everyone did the same on the midterm and psets, so the final was the entire basis of our grades.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Polak is very patient and explains concepts really clearly. There were plenty of opportunities for us to learn, from office hours to discussions sections. The in-class games were very exciting, especially considering how difficult it must be to do these things virtually.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:",
                "Strengths: Lots of office hours, class was very engaging and I think it would be even more so in person, Professor Polak is very helpful and wants you to succeed (records answer to problem set every week)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Pset answers weren't posted but rather you had to go to section to hear the answers. Working and being in a different time zone made this very difficult so I was never able to correct my psets and see what I did wrong.",
                "I loved the engagement in lecture classes and overall. I wish there was more feedback on p-sets and exams. We reviewed those in section but we couldn't always get to every problem and it took away from just reviewing confusing topics. We had to decide to do one or the other.",
                "Strengths: Professor Polak is a truly wonderful teacher, and made the material accessible and fun. Course is very well organized on the part of both the professor and the TAs. The weekly flipped classroom was a lifesaver. No real weaknesses, except that some of the problem sets take quite a while, so be prepared to set aside a good chunk of time to grind through them!",
                "I think some more varied practice problems to begin with can be helpful for practice before doing the difficult problem-set questions.",
                "A big strength of the course is Ben himself. He is super passionate and does everything he can to ensure student success. There is definite room for improvement when it comes to course structure (having to go to optional sections for the pset answers).",

                "The flipped classroom sessions were very helpful and the lectures were well organized and engaging. Expectations were very clear throughout the course. Most office hours were well organized and helpful as well. More detailed feedback on problem sets may have been beneficial, or at least posted answer keys.",
                "Strengths: Good professors and TAs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is a real grind. Weekly psets, no drops of any of them. Also most of the OH are on the day before the psets are due which causes for a lot of last minute work.",
                "Very good course, extremely well organized.",
                "The class is very well-organized: each topic builds on the last. The use of examples and games in class also helps to clarify concepts which can be very hard to grasp. One of the weaknesses of the class is how the sections are organized. Instead of using section to go over the material from the week, the sections are used to go over the answers to the problem set from that week. It would be more helpful if there was an answer sheet for checking problem sets and the section time was dedicated to understanding the new material that is necessary for the next problem set. Without sections that covered the material I felt like I was constantly playing catch up.",
                "Strengths - fun, interactive and the ample office hours gave students a strong support network despite the large lecture format. Aslo, British accent\r\nWeaknesses - you will may have to double take when Professor Polak mentions 'football', but seriously I thought this was a splendid class all around, not notable complaints.",
                "The course was well-organized, and lectures were well-taught. However, sometimes the pacing of the lectures was a little too fast. Moreover, the problem sets sometimes reflected a difficulty level that was greater than was taught during class.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were always very interesting; problem sets are well-designed and enjoyable to work on; exams were fair; Professor Polak is very experienced, knowledgeable, engaging, and all around amazing.",

                "The professor has clear mastery over the material. Lectures were very smooth, easy to understand, and very funny at times. My only complaint is that the professor doesn't post the answers to the problem sets once they are due... Every other class I had taken at Yale had released answers to their problem sets so that students could check back on their answers and use them to prepare for the midterm/final.",
                "The class was well taught, from lectures to office hours. There was ample support for the course and I had a lot of help getting through the material and comprehending all the information.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are comprehensive, especially given their form of presentation (PowerPoint Slides). Proper resources are provided and are themselves highly satisfactory for the material that is required of this course. I did not have to spend a penny on resources and still felt that I had a very, very adequate and immersive experience with all that was taught. \r\n\r\nPotential improvements: I HIGHLY encourage that professors teaching this course use the discussion board website \"ed\". I have used this in other courses and it greatly increased incentives to interact and interaction overall.",

                "Professor Polak was very articulate in his teachings, taking great care in providing examples and walking through them carefully. No complaints or improvements.",
                "Great games would be better in person so difficult woth covid",
                "Strengths: Professor Polak's lectures made me laugh and kept me engaged. No one at Yale does lectures quite like him. Another plus is that his lecture slides are so well-designed. I'd take any class at Yale that Ben Polak teaches. The TF team is also incredible and very patient. The course sort of schools your mind into thinking a certain way, and I'm so glad that I've learned this mental framework. The psets are very manageable.\r\nWeaknesses: The midterm exam felt almost too easy (rare complaint) in the sense that it didn't generate a broad grade distribution. So while I felt that the midterm was a decently tough exam, I would have much rather had a more difficult midterm to ease any pressure to studying for the final. I'm not one who self-identifies as \"caring a lot about their grades\" but knowing that one sub-question on the final could determine my grade relative to the rest of the class was really stressful. I also wish that PSet solutions were posted on Canvas. There was one week that I couldn't attend section, and I just never got to know what I had done wrong on that pset and what the correct answers were.",
                "No weaknesses, strengths were TFs and Ben polak",
                "Strengths: clear instruction, engaging professor, interesting real-world applications\r\nImprovements: more check-ins besides the midterm and final, more feedback on problem sets",
                "Strengths: Prof Polaks sense of humor, fun and engaging games in class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: basically no feedback on PSets (although there are tons of opportunities for office hours and review sessions if you put in the effort)",
                "One strength is the games that are played; I think they demonstrated the material very well and apply to real-life situations. One weakness is sometimes units are covered too quickly and I had to do some extra work on my own to catch up.",
                "This course was very good. The lectures were well organized and taught and the problem sets challenged me and prepared me adequately for exams.",
                "Polak is a nice lecturer and the material is good. The slides are absolutely terrible. Please put the information on one single slide rather than using a new slide every time theres a new bullet point on the slide.",
                "i really liked the professor and the way he taught the lectures.",
                "Loved the content and the professor. The discussion sections were less useful for me as we just went through the problem set answers, which I already knew from going to office hours and working hard on the problem set. Would have loved to review course content during discussion section.",
                "Good amount of examples and support.",
                "Strengths - the material being taught was interesting, and the actual games we played in class helped!\r\nWeaknesses - the second half of the course moved really fast and was hard to keep up with",
                "Strengths: Professor Polak is an amazing lecturer, and the material of the course was always extremely engaging, especially with the use of games to demonstrate and apply lessons. Weaknesses: The course felt rather disorganized with only ten problem sets and a singular midterm exam to actually apply the lessons learned from class. The course would have benefited from greater structure, more consistent opportunities to practice problems, and an emphasis on providing ample feedback. I also felt that the weighting of 70% of our grades on two exams, as opposed to the hours and hours-long problem sets, was quite discouraging for a student genuinely interested in the subject.",
                "Very good, no need to change anything",
                "Strengths: Ben is a great lecturer who's taught this class dozens of times before, problem sets really helped understand the material. \r\nWeaknesses: sections happened after the problem sets were, not all TAs had a high level of knowledge of course material, class is unnecessarily curved.",
                "Strengths of this course were the several office hours, sections, and the flipped classroom. It gave a lot of support and opportunities to ask questions.",
                "Game Theory did an excellent job of using specific games and situations to teach broader lessons about Game Theory. I found the problem sets just hard enough to extend my learning, but not hard enough that I ever failed to answer a question. As a person who is not strong with math, I found the math in this course manageable. \r\n\r\nThe course's only weakness was that problem set solutions were never posted, so I was sometimes unsure if I answered some questions correctly on my problem sets. Having problem set solutions would have been very helpful when I was studying for the midterm and final exams.",
                "The course was well taught. The presentations for lectures were well made and easy to understand. The TAs and ULAs were very helpful and patient. I would have like to see more spread out office hours.",
                "This was a great course! It was taught wonderfully",
                "The office hours were very helpful in completing the psets and understanding all of the games. One weakness is that we did not get any feedback on our psets directly, but the pset answers were posted so it was ok.",
                "It was a very engaging course, and Professor Polak was definitely the main reason for that! He tried to include as much applications as possible and to keep dry theoretics to the minimum.",
                "Strenghts: the abundance of examples to help us understand theoretical concepts. Professor Polak's humor made lectures much more enjoyable.\r\nMinor weaknesses: the exams had very compressed grade distribution and the psets weren't graded in detail either, so it was difficult to gauge how well we were doing in the course. I wish detailed pset solutions were provided.",
                "Strengths: Polak is a wonderful professor, and I truly enjoyed being in his class. He teaches concepts very thoroughly starting from a basic level, so the class never felt too fast. All the TAs were also especially wonderful. The class was extremely well-organized, and an effort to make lecture interactive and fun was very appreciated. \r\nWeaknesses: I felt like certain concepts could have been taught more by intuition and reasoning rather than by mathematical derivations. Sometimes he would come to a real-life intuition/lesson using arbitrary numbers he made up, so it didnt seem totally credible. Coming out of this class, I feel I know how to use math with arbitrary numbers given in a problem to solve questions, but I am not sure how to apply game theory concepts in a more intuitive sense outside of this class.",
                "Great course, improvements would have been in person learning, but sadly that wasnt possible",
                "Strengths: a really fundamental understanding of Game Theory which is applicable to many disciplines. I feel like I now use those concepts in every day life and feel much more confident about approaching decisions/understanding phenomena\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Both the midterm and the final (major components of the grade) were curved and the curve was really tough. This made it hard to do well in the exams. Further, some PSETs were much harder than others and definitely required going to multiple office hours.",
                "This was my favorite class taught at Yale so far because of how fun and challenging it was. While problems can get quite confusing Professor Polak is an awesome lecturer and keeps the class every engaging.",
                "Strengths: teaching!! and material",
                "Love Ben, such a fun and engaging prof, even over Zoom.",
                "Flipped classrooms hosted by Ben were great, the peer tutor was good, but the TA's were pretty weak on the whole.",
                "Ben Polak was this course's greatest strength. If he's teaching it again, don't think. Just take it.",
                "Strengths: Prof Polack is a great teacher and explains the concepts very well even in an online setting. There were also great TAs and peer tutors and the flipped classroom every week was a great help to the weekly problem sets. \r\nWeaknesses: Online class made it a little bit more difficult because the games had to be played online in a zoom room where they were less engaging.",
                "Learned how to think in a new way.",
                "Would have loved to do this in person",
                "Very well structured, class is organized well, and content flows through the entire semester",
                "Thought it was good at being an intro game theory course. Pretty standard and fun and what you would expect. I wish it was not graded on the curve because all the tests were not hard and now the curve is hurting and not helping. It did not feel like there was anything particuarily challenging",
                "This course was the best I've taken online, all due to the professor's extra effort to make it so. I cannot recommend it any higher.",
                "Strengths: Amazingly diverse curriculum and taught with applications.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not very math heavy. Some of the applications felt like they could be much more expanded upon using more complicated game theory ideas.",
                "Great lectures, but sections could be more productive if we could go over practice problems to considerate new material rather than going over past Pset problems.",
                "You can tell this course has been taught for a long time. Prof. Polak has it down to a science, and I think his teaching style is excellent for this class.",
                "Strengths: engaging Lecturer. \r\nWeaknesses: way too many assignments, even if easy.",
                "Some earlier office hours for students who want to complete psets earlier.",
                "Prof Polak is definitely a strength of the course. He is organized and handled the transition to virtual learning very well. The biggest weakness is that it can be a dry course at times.",
                "Strengths would be the lecturing and how interesting the problem sets were, a weakness would be since the class ended up scoring so close to one another on both the midterm and the final that grades were decided on a couple questions on either test.",
                "The games we played were very fun, but a virtual environment allows for better games that can be played online",
                "Lectures covered interesting material in a very engaging way. Psets were challenging but not impossible; flipped classroom sessions were a big help. As long as you keep up with the material you will do well and learn a lot.",
                "Strong in the teaching of concepts, but the weakness of it course was that problem set problems were often doable in a collaborative setting or with materials from class that left me a little unsure on exams.",
                "The biggest strength of the class is the professor by far. The class was also well organised and engaging throughout the semester.",
                "It was taught very well, especially with the many examples in-class to better practice the lessons."

                "Think this course took advantage of a group of stressed, depressed, and isolated students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Professor Polak constantly put down the American people with his view that Europeans are superior. I found his banter to be distasteful, inconsiderate, and rude.",
                "Professor Polak did the best he could to keep the lectures engaging with the games we played in lecture, but they were not nearly as fun as they would be in person. The conceptual difficulty also created a lot of stress for me to learn this online, even though the peer mentors and TAs were as helpful as they could've been.",
                "Prof. Polak provided a lot of virtual support. Especially considering that this is a virtual semester, the plethora of resources is really helpful.",
                "Lecture was good I think it was very engaging, the recorded problem for the pset was extremely helpful. I think that posting the pset answers especially during covid would be helpful because it's hard to get to zooms during covid. Every lecture was recorded and that's how I conducted the class because I was in a different time zone so that was great.",
                "I appreciated that the course was recorded and I think virtual learning was handled pretty well.",
                "Polls were great for playing games, didn't feel like virtual setting impeded learning at all",

                "The format of live virtual lectures and flipped classrooms translated well to the online format. The exams had an open-book format, so even though it was timed it was not proctored like other classes are (which can be incredibly stressful and invasive).",
                "Despite the online format we still got to play many games and see the theories we were learning about in action... The only notable thing was that the uploaded power-point slides were excessively long because there were separate slides for each appearing sentence on a slide (ie: if a complete slide had 6 lines, on the unloaded file that slide would be split into 6 slides with each adding another line instead of just the complete slide) As a result the slides were all like 200 pages long and difficult to navigate.",
                "I think there could have been more compassion shown towards students, especially during the hard parts of this semester. When one of our classmates passed away earlier this year, Professor Polak didn't acknowledge the situation. Problem sets were due as usual. Nothing about the pace of the class changed. I felt like during difficult moments like these, showing support and understanding towards students goes a long way. I would have liked to see more signals of what support was available to students at times like these.",

                "Virtual games like poll.ev did not work as well as I'd initially hoped. Not sure what else could have been done, though. Professor Polak did his best to engage students but it's challenging with such a large class and on Zoom.",

                "The course allowed natural engagement through playing games so that still worked for the most part over recorded lecture.",
                "Professor Polak's lectures are unmatched!! I've never been in a lecture that felt so engaging. Polak would often request that many of us turn on our video cameras for the duration of the meeting, and sometimes people got cold-called on but that made it feel more like a real lecture.",

                "Professor Polak virtually called on students to participate in the smaller games we played in lecture, used the software PollEv to encourage participation in the larger games we played, and held weekly homework review sessions where he showed us how to do one of the harder problems on that week's problem set.

Moreover, I think he really had no ability to read the room over zoom, and thus he only saw the few students that found his banter to be funny, and not the number of students that found him to be offensive and rude.",

If you're a first year, I would recommend you do this course sophomore yearthere are a lot of upperclassmen and econ majors in this course, so it would be easier to do this course with more experience with Yale econ courses.",

I did find it challenging, but it is not impossible to do well as you can get a lot of help on psets in office hours and with the curve you may not get an A but most kids will get and A- or a B+ without stressing too much.",

                "Yes, provided you're prepared to put in a fair amount of work.",
                "Yes, I think the lessons you learn from this class is not only applicable for economics but in decision-making generally. Although it can become difficult, the real-life application problems are very insightful and overall interesting.",

                "Yes, the class is a great introduction to game theory. But there are students from a lot of different disciplines and I sometimes felt that I was struggling more than students with a stronger background in economics, which is only an issue because the class grades on a curve.",
                "Absolutely! It's a fun class, the workload is perfectly reasonable and you literally get to play games in class. The only reason not to take this class is if you hate basic calculus so much that you'd rather eat rocks before you ever took another derivative.",

                "I'd definitely recommend to anyone slightly interested in game theory. Be sure to know what you're getting into though, I didn't expect game theory to involve so much modelling/math (my fault). Fairly interesting material, nonetheless.",

                "Yes",
                "Yeah, take it! Even if you're not an ECON major, this is such a fun course because of Professor Polak. The games make it so much more interactive than any other lecture course I've taken. Know that the final will mainly determine your grade since everyone does roughly the same on the midterm (I studied for SO many hours on the midterm and did above average... even then, missing one more sub-question on the final would have reversed all the positive grade distribution benefit I tried to gain in the midterm). But the psets are super manageable and it's such a satisfying feeling to figure out the Nash equilibria or SPE of a game! The second half of the course is a lot harder than the first half though.",

                "Its a required class, but if youre interested in the subject Id take it",
                "Yes!! Very stimulating, challenging, and interesting!",
                "Definitely! It's an engaging course (imaginably even better in-person), and you'll develop a new approach to solving problems in your everyday life. Although the course suffered from certain organizational and technical weaknesses, the lessons that you learn will be invaluable to shaping your mindset.",
                "100%. It's fun and interesting, and I am sure that the lectures in person are a great time as well. There are a lot of different cases in which strategic thinking can be implied, and this course will certainly refine whatever intuitions you might have.",
                "Yes, Polak is very good and lectures are informative and engaging.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to gain an understanding of strategic thinking and how to break down seemingly complex problems they encounter. It was a prerequisite for my major, but I would recommend it even if it isn't.",
                "Yes! Great content and a great professor.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in economics, political science or any field where these two subjects might intersect, as well as anyone interested in strategy games of any kind.",
                "I would recommend the course. The course material was interesting and engaging. The class also contained material for those who are into applied economics or theoretical economics. The course was well-paced as well.",
                "No",
                "Yes! It was a great course that taught you how to think. 10/10 recommend",
                "Highly.",
                "I would recommend this course. The subject matter was really interesting and the problem sets allow you to practice different games.",
                "Yes! It's very engaging and applicable to real life! Prof Polak and the TAs are also just great.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. The examples covered in this course are relevant in many contexts, and it's important to learn to think strategically. The amount of examples and applicable conclusions in the course help make it informative but not dry.",
                "I would recommend this course if they are interesting in economics from a micro- and mathematical perspective.",
                "Yes !! The course is super interesting and engaging. Also playing games in class was great fun",
                "If you are ready to put in the work, please take this course! Prof Polak is a great professor and Game Theory is so broadly applicable- it truly applies to everyday life. Overall, this course is a great Credit/D because the material is important and at least this year, the curve was hard. Be ready to work on the PSETs and study hard for the Final and the Midterm but it is definitely doable and very interesting.",
                "100% yes, especially if you are interesting in learning about problem solving strategies and how they are applied in different fields.",
                "yes! such a cool way of thinking, really interesting, amazing professor!",
                "Yes, so fun and learn so much.",
                "Yes, wonderful Professor and great class",
                "I think it's a great econ course and makes far more sense to a layperson than micro or macro. I think it should be required for the econ major. It's a great method of thinking and I would recommend it to any yale student, maybe as a good Credit/D/Fail course.",
                "I absolutely would. I managed to do well without having taken intro to econ. Lectures and PSets were fun. The professor really tried to challenge us and was generous with grading because of it.",
                "Yes, it is an excellent course about game theory.",
                "Yes, it was a lot of fun. Take it (especially if it is in person next semester). Ben Polak is one of the econ greats at Yale. Although the exams were difficult enough to not make it a walk in the park.",
                "Yes great class.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Great econ elective and you learn a lot",
                "Yes! If you are interested in logic stuff or game theory definitely do.",
                "I would recommend it in a heartbeat to anybody interested in an engaging and fun class!",
                "It is a good class to take, but it is not an easy one. Always interesting but you must put in the work.",
                "I would recommend it to any student. I think it is a great experience in that it helps you see the world and how people make decisions in a totally new light.",
                "Very disappointing class.",
                "Definitely. Game Theory is something that people should have intuition for regardless of their career path. Professor Polak is amazing and has so much passion for teaching this course.",
                "Take it. Useful for life. You will enjoy Ben's accent. It's great.",
                "If you need a QR and hate algebra, or if you're interested in the quantitative side of the social sciences, definitely.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, if you like games, or feel that you like analyzing games and many real-life game situations.",
                "Yes, if you have an interest in business or economics. It was a fun course to take and was not time consuming.",
                "Would recommend this course to anyone who wants a class which is intellectually challenging and stimulating while not having a very heavy workload in terms of week to week work. Be aware that since everyone pretty much gets perfect scores on every problem set, the entirety of your grade will essentially be determined by the midterm and final.",
                "Yes. The course was excellently structured and always engaging. Also, the material did a good job building off of and reinforcing ideas learned earlier.",
                "Absolutely! Material was very interesting and I feel that a lot of the lessons can be applied to almost every sort of interaction/relationship you can have.",
                "Yes! It is so interesting and useful to know game theory, and I would take it again given the chance.",
                "Absolutely! This is the only economics course I would recommend to non-econ majors so far.",
                "I would recommend the course as it teaches skills that are necessary in any type of work, especially with predicting behavior."
