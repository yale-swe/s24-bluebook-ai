                "The strengths of this course are the frequent meeting times and the interactive format of the live class sessions. Furthermore, the weekly individual session with our teacher was very helpful. However, the primary weakness was the rather unusual grading. Many percentages - some of which were comically small (3%, 1%, etc) - and extra points that never seemed to factor into our grade. More transparent grading is only fair. I just wanted to know what my grade is in the class.",
                "Really well conducted course although the workload is really high. Teacher was really on students about homework. Cant really miss assignments as you are expected to turn it in late anyways. Brutal, but very very effective"

Whatever I crammed for the exam i I have already lost. \r\n\r\nQuizzes and exams. Format for the final was not very Friendly for those with weak internet connections and still left a lot of room for cheating but I felt like was the only format that came close to not allowing students to cheat on an exam. Chapter tests where we were just on video while taking the exam makes it very easy to cheat. Felt like that was the case given the really high averages for the cheaper tests unless I am mistaken and that is the average haven ven in previous years"

The content is organized well. I am shocked at the amount I retained. The teachers put time into giving you commentary and fixing your pronunciation. Yes, it was a large time commitment, but I looked forward to the daily lectures more than my lighter courses. Great intro course. Still, only take if you are truly interested in the language and willing to work to improve.",
