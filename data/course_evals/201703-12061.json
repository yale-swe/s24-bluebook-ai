   "comments": [
    "How to think about attraction and relationships both from the persoective of an ideal relationship and thinking about how relationships go wrong",
    "I learned a lot about how to properly initiate and maintain relationships and many interesting psychological phenomena that I never even thought of before.",
    "I learned a lot about interpersonal relationships and how they are formed, their benefits, attachment theory, belonging, etc.",
    "I learned a large volume of information in this course and could have learned more if I applied myself more within the course. During this course, students learn about attraction theory and theory of relationships- what makes them work and how they begin. You don't just learn about romantic relationships during this course, you also learn about familial relationships and friendships but the main focus is on romantic relationships.",
    "I learned a lot more about the way relationships work in terms of initial attraction and the subsequent formation, maintaining of, and end of relationships. Because our papers required us to delve into psychological research about relationships, I also got much better at reading psychological journal articles.",
    "I learned a lot of invaluable information about relationships and attraction. It's helped me to evaluate my own relationships with others and has helped me adjust my actions\/behavior so that I am projecting the right image. I have used a lot of the information from class in other settings and will definitely find more uses going forward.",
    "I developed many insights into my own relationships and attraction in general.",
    "Psychological theory and research behind relationship maintenance and initiation.",
    "The textbook was so interesting (and very useful in my own relationship...) but the lecture was very boring. You don't need to go to class.",
    "I really did learn about the psychology behind different aspects of attraction and relationships.",
    "Good course, the material is definitely worth knowing and you learn a lot about relationships and their dynamics",
    "This course really helped sharpen up skills that I've learned in previous relationships as well as learning new ones. It also opened my eyes to new statistics, therapies, and ways to keep a relationship healthy and strong.",
    "I learned a lot about relationships, specifically how far reaching the studies are, and how deep they go into the minutia of emotion.",
    "I learned a lot about relationships and how to improve the relationships I have. The material in this course facilitated a lot of introspection!",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of how the field of psychology works. I also understood people and interpersonal relationships a lot better. It made me think more deeply about myself and the people around me.",
    "I learned a lot about relationships and how attraction works.",
    "This class is similar to social psychology. I learned a lot about relationships and attraction forming. Some of it and the statistics was very interesting and kind of bind blowing at times.",
    "I learned about how attraction develops into relationships and learned about some research on this topic.",
    "i learned about the biological bases of attraction, the formation of relationships, and how to sustain them. a lot of this knowledge was not intuitive, especially stuff covered in the book, and is important takeaway that will serve me well in my own relationships",
    "I learned about a lot of interesting empirical research on close relationships. Although the course was not a self-help course, it did make me think a lot about my own relationships and how to work through conflict.",
    "This class focused a lot on the importance of relationships and relationship initiation.",
    "I learned about how attraction works and can potentially lead to different types of relationships depending on different variables. I learned how to read and decipher psychology articles, and I also learned how to write and APA style paper because I previously had never had to write any sort of psychology paper.",
    "This is an incredibly practical course that taught me things I hope to employ in all of my relationships from here on out.",
    "A lot of practical knowledge on relationships!",
    "I learned a lot about the interpersonal relationships that we have with other people, as well as the studies that proved this.",
    "Learned a lot about the nature of relationships and what attracts us to others, and why people would be attracted to us",
    "I actually learned some pretty interesting bits of knowledge that feel relevant to my life. For example, what makes us like some people more than others, what makes relationships fail versus work out, etc. I hadn't considered many of these ideas before but they made sense and I think helped me in my own life and relationships",
    "I learned a lot of very interesting psychological concepts that I can actually apply to my daily life",
    "Understanding of what social psychology is, ability to write a psychology paper",
    "I learned the different types of relationships, how different social interactions work, how relationships are formed an dissolved, and how we act in relationships.",
    "This class is amazing! I learned so much about attractions and relationships, whether romantic, friendly, familial, you name it! The lectures were very clear, and the guest lectures were fun to listen to. I learned how to read and understand different studies and their findings, and how to extrapolate the data to apply to real life situations. The class is made up of 3 midterms and 2 papers, all 20% each. Fairly manageable class. Would take it again if I could!",
    "Through this course, I learned to evaluate \/ interpret social studies and understand the significance of their findings. I also learned how to study more in detail, remembering not only facts but real-life evidence to back up these facts.",
    "Interesting material but the course isnt super well taught. You dont need to go to class to do well on the exams so take that for what its worth. Perfect credit D but kind of a lot of work to take for a grade",
    "This class allowed me to focus on more intricate parts of relationships and friendships that I had not considered before.",
    "Interesting stuff about relationships",
    "Throughout this course I developed a solid understanding of relationship initiation, the value of relationships, and important information to maintain relationships. I also developed my research paper writing skills.",
    "Even though this class was not a self-help course, I learned a lot about the nature of relationships that I can apply to help both myself and others in managing interactions. I gained insight into the relatively new field of relationship science and how an everyday thing like relationships can be looked at through an analytical and psychological point of view.",
    "This course introduced me to the idea of psychology in relationships and how there is a science to the world around us. My notes will serve me for the rest of my life and I feel I learned valuable life skills and facts.",
    "I learned introductory ideas about social psychology. Very applicable to real college life.",
    "I think this class did a great job of providing a good overview of the psychology of relationships. I feel that I have a good idea of what the current literature on relationships and divorce is and an ongoing interest in learning more.",
    "I learned the foundations of social psychology, spanning a wide variety of topics. We covered a lot more breadth than I was anticipating, which was a positive surprise. I had previously taken another class titled 'social psychology' at Yale and actually only the first few weeks overlapped but I learned a lot of new stuff.",
    "I learned about the different components of attraction and how those components can contribute to a successful relationship.",
    "I learned how impactful some things can be such as early childhood experiences and that human behaviors is often dictated by less obvious motives.",
    "This class was helpful in learning new ways to think about relationships, for both romantic and platonic partners. It also demonstrated the effect that community has on how people relate to each other.",
    "You really learn a lot about social psychology in this course.",
    "This course teaches you about the basics of attraction and relationship initiation.",
    "Fantastic course that discusses research (old and new) regarding relationships and attraction, and dispels some popular self help myths along the way.",
    "Most of this class is practical advice about how to go about relationships with other people, which I enjoyed and have found useful.",
    "I learned so much in this class  more than I have in any other class  about the nature of relationships and attraction. How relationships work, why people act in certain ways in relationships, who is most likely to become jealous, who is most likely to have the strongest relationships, etc.",
    "I learned about how to foster and create productive relationships."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "She divides the information of tests between book and lecture meaning she will intentionally not go over information in class so she can weed out those who dont do the readings.",
    "So so so so so so so so so boring. Impossible to sit through lecture.",
    "I really like this course but I would have found it slightly easier to learn the material from the Miller textbook we were tested on during the exams if we had discussed the readings from that textbook in class and during the lectures. I also think this class could benefit from a section but altogether I thought it was well taught and the theory was fairly clearly explained.",
    "The course is designed really well for the semester. The pace is really good and the workload is manageable: three midterms, two papers, and no final exam. The lectures and textbook compliment each other and the textbook is actually an engaging and interesting read. Exams could be a little bit fairer; there would be a few questions on each exam that would be oddly specific that you'd only remember by chance.",
    "The course was interesting because it was very applicable to life. However, I thought it was really disorganized. I didn't know when the papers would be due during shopping period, and if I had I would have chosen a different course to balance out my workload. Also, I like to do readings when I have time over the weekend, but that was difficult when the reading schedule was not prepared or updated.",
    "A weakness of this course were the lectures. They were unnecessary to attend, as the professor read straight from the slides and then posted them online. In order to succeed all you had to do was read the textbook.",
    "strengths: great lectures, great readings, great experiments \r\nweaknesses: tests were either easy or impossible and there was not way in between",
    "Good focus on academic literature. Can feel a bit slow in the middle of the course but starts and ends strong.",
    "Overall really good course. The lectures tended to get pretty repetitive at the end, which was annoying. Also, some of the content we had to read in the textbook was never addressed in class. I think it would have been beneficial to have lectures going along with the readings (ie conflict, violence etc.). This would also eliminate some of the redundancy. \r\n\r\nI also felt that the exams were WAY too specific. Some of the questions asked about a specific term\/idea that was covered in about one sentence in the textbook. I also felt like the exams just required us to regurgitate information, not make connections\/focus on bigger picture stuff.",
    "Strength was the textbook. So fascinating! Weakness was how dull the lecture was.",
    "The tests were so annoying and had questions that were based on individual pages of the textbook so I always felt as though I were being tested on my memorization skills and not my understanding of the material. Lecture could be dry sometimes",
    "Weaknesses: Tests did not always assess knowledge of the material in a way that makes it seem like they care about learning. Some test questions would be stupid (i.e. what was this one study from this one textbox in this one chapter in the book that didn't really matter for this purposes of this topic?). Tests need to have more reasonable questions that assess knowledge and understanding instead of memory for a specific thing.",
    "The lectures and the textbook readings were very interesting, however the exams seemed to be testing on whether or not we read the textbook or were there for lectures rather than if we had learned the important pieces from this course. For example, a question would ask \"Did the author of your textbook take a stance on issue X?\" rather than asking if we knew the important pieces or even the details of issue X. The content was very applicable though, and interesting to learn about. The textbook also was enjoyable and easy to read.",
    "Professor Clark did well to incorporate her own studies as well as use the students in the class to create new statistics as well as reinforce old statistics and experiments. One of the weaknesses, however, was the class's undemanding attendance or workload. That might seem hypocritical from a student who wouldn't mind doing nothing, but I think the fact that there were no sections, or that there were no worksheets made it really easy for students to slack or not do anything relating to class until the exams or papers came up.",
    "I like the clicker questions because it allowed us to see what our classmates thought. I think the paper instructions need to be clearer.",
    "Strengths: it was pretty clear what was expected from essays and exams. The textbook is really good and actually pretty interesting to read. The content itself is very interesting (if you're someone who's interested in people and how they behave). \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lectures felt disorganized as things that appeared in one lecture would pop up later again.",
    "Strengths - very comprehensive, taught well, easy to understand!\r\nWeaknesses - the lectures can be a bit repetitive",
    "Its strength is how interesting the content is, but sometimes it feels like a lot of it is common sense. Otherwise, the course is pretty simple. The exams were very manageable, as were the papers.",
    "This class was good in how it was divided, and gave plenty of time to write the papers which was nice. One issue was on the first test, the questions were very very specific asking for information from one sentence in the textbook.",
    "The course content is interesting, however the way it was taught undermined its potential. What was taught felt like basic common sense, and I felt that there were many ways the course could be improved if topics were delved into more deeply and perhaps philosophically. The way the professor described things also felt a bit dry sometimes.",
    "Professor Clark really knows what she is talking about, but she is extremely unengaging and it makes this class difficult to sit through. Also, the fact that the readings are emphasized so heavily on exams but are never discussed in class seemed really unfair. I did read the textbook, but the fact that concepts were never discussed was not fair, especially since I didn't understand them all.",
    "this course covered a lot of psychological studies relating to relationship studies. this is fine, but i felt that a lot of lecture turned into jumping from study to study without much analysis of why this is important. i feel that we learn so much about how correlation isn't causation, but a lot of the theories from psychological studies require us to make inferences that imply causation from correlation. a lot of this information was really useful, though, and will help me in my relationships. a lot of the time i didn't really see the purpose of the clickers",
    "I think the information is good to know, but it can seem a little repetitive and redundant. Sometimes the lectures can get a little monotonous, even though the content is interesting-- maybe some form of interactivity would help.",
    "The material was really interesting but lecture wasn't the most engaging.",
    "Very very interesting and relatable topic. Exams were very difficult, with questions that seems highly specific and random, many people seemed to struggle. Lectures were engaging and integrated student input with clickers.",
    "This course is interesting by the nature of the subject material, and I found that it was fairly fun and not over-taxing. However, I do feel like the lectures could have been a tad more engaging.",
    "Good balance of depth in lecture and breadth in the readings. Truly, the textbook was one of my favorite aspects of the course- modern, informative and somehow funny. I would say the biggest weakness was that the lectures tended to be somewhat repetitive. They also did not follow in an order that I found particularly useful- I think it would make more sense to start with attraction, move into initiation, maintenance and then dissolution.",
    "Lectures were sometimes repetitive, but overall good, and the textbook was very interesting",
    "Professor Clark is a good lecturer and inputs enough information to keep the class interesting.",
    "Strengths are Margaret Clark, who is really nice. However, this class is not as easy as you would think; there is a lot of reading, 3 challenging tests, and 2 papers.\r\nWeaknesses are the grading on the papers, at least for me. My grader was pretty strict both times and kind of ruined my grade.",
    "Strengths: Interesting, applicable and relevant, manageable workload, textbook was very enjoyable, interesting, and easy to read, engaging clicker questions\r\nWeaknesses: pretty impersonal lecture. Maybe that's my fault as I didn't go to office hours ever. On the other hand, this was also a strength of the class as I was able to not feel obligated to put in a huge amount of work, but rather blend into the class and let the interesting information seep into my brain when I felt like absorbing it.",
    "The information itself was very interesting, but the lectures seemed a bit redundant and drawn out. Additionally, the exams were quite difficult compared to the difficulty-level of the lectures.",
    "The lectures are not always engaging and filled with a lot of unnecessary information--when there is something interesting, it's glossed over too quickly! A lot more on the exams comes from the book than previously stated. However, the actual content of the class, both lectures and the textbooks, was so interesting. The class should be called \"Relationship Science\" instead.",
    "The technical difficulties an disorganisation of the power points distract a little from the content, but overall a very good class.",
    "The lectures were very clear, and the guest lectures were fun to listen to. You learn about different studies and their findings, and apply the results to real life. The class is made up of 3 midterms and 2 papers, all 20% each. Clickers are used in class to answer questions relevant to the material. Fairly manageable class. Would take it again if I could!",
    "The strengths of this course would be the wonderful professor and TAs. They were very helpful and always ready to guide us in the right direction. The difficulty with the course came when studying for examinations, because I had trouble managing the large loads of information to memorize from both slides and the textbook.",
    "Interesting material but the course isnt super well taught. You dont need to go to class to do well on the exams so take that for what its worth. Perfect credit D but kind of a lot of work to take for a grade",
    "Lectures could be boring and I found that they didn't involve too much else I couldn't get from the slides or readings.",
    "I liked everything about this course. The assignment structure (3 exams and 2 papers) was great; I was engaged from beginning to end and was tested on my knowledge of the material at points during the course that I thought very appropriate.",
    "The strength of this course definitely stems from Professor Clark. She was passionate and extremely knowledgeable about her field. She was a great lecturer who was easy to listen to and effortless to follow along. I think she really made this course worthwhile and I definitely wouldn't have enjoyed the course as much as I did without her. A weakness of this course may be that we were not assigned TFs. This created a lack of consistency when it came to the grading of papers because I had separate TFs who graded my paper and I think just having the same TF grade the two different papers will be better for rubric consistency.",
    "The strengths were the amount and quality of the assessments and the cons were the lack of information given as to what exactly would be covered on the tests.",
    "I love the professor but did not find her incredibly engaging. Interesting material but it needs more interactive classes.",
    "I think that the course had a lot of recap each session. This wasn't a bad thing but sometimes it was unclear in lecture what was recap and what was new information.",
    "I found the content very interesting. Very immediately relevant to everyday life. The professor was clearly knowledgeable and the TAs were helpful.  The readings complemented lectures well. I did think that a lot of information was repeated from one lecture the next in a 'recap' that was too lengthy in my opinion, but perhaps going over the content many times helped solidify my understanding more than I'm assuming.",
    "The course was very straightforward: lectures and textbook readings. However, I felt like the course was unorganized. The syllabus was a bit unclear at times and the lectures did not present the material in the most effective way. There were a lot of technology problems. Although these problems are minor, they do act up and detract from the learning environment.",
    "Strengths include easy to follow lectures. An area of improvement would be sometimes it is difficult to hear the lecturer and the technical difficulties that were encountered.",
    "The course overall is a very good survey course of the field. It's interesting, insightful, and left me very surprised. I felt the biggest issues in the course lay in the exams and the papers. The exams did not feel that they were evenly distributed in difficulty level, and there were often questions that were very unclear and needed clarification. The paper, while not too difficult, had very few guidelines of exactly what the professor and TFs were looking for, and it left many people floundering.",
    "Overall, I thought the course was well organized. However, some of the lectures were not very engaging.",
    "This was a good course if you are interested in social psychology. The three exams were a little challenging, but the papers you get to choose what to write about. I thought that this required some general knowledge about psychology before you took the course, however.",
    "Interesting topic, but the lectures can be dry and a bit disorganized. The textbook is really interesting. Tests always seemed to be a bit hard and based purely on memory.",
    "Loved the course! Lecturers were engaging, and the material itself is super interesting!",
    "The readings had almost nothing to do with the lectures, so it felt like I was learning two entirely separate curriculums. I also felt like the organization of topics throughout the semester was haphazardly put together. This was likely exacerbated by the fact that the syllabus wasn't released in full at the beginning of the semester and\/or plans changed so it was hard to exactly know what larger ideas we were supposed to be learning. In the future, please release the syllabus with all the readings at the beginning of the semester so people can get an idea of what the course is like and how much reading there will be. I found it incredibly frustrating to not know how many chapters I would have to read for the next month until the test for the current unit was over.",
    "Strengths - we read the whole textbook so I learned a lot of information from that, Margaret was the best, felt very relaxed and low-key, so much information relevant to everyone's daily lives\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes I felt that the lectures focused too much on research studies that were done. Every slide would be another study",
    "This was an amazing course. I see no weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "Its a pretty easy psych course with a pretty low workload, and its about an interesting subject, so yeah its worth taking",
    "nope, there ends up being a lot of work and its hard to do well on the exams even though the information is very basic.",
    "YES! It's very insightful, the professor is amazing and you get to apply the knowledge you learned in the class into your own life.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student with an interest in social psychology and\/or the study of relationships.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if the subject matter of this course material really fascinates said student. Much of the readings are dedicated to detailed aspects of attraction and especially relationships.",
    "YES! Great class and having three midterms and two papers might be a lot but it is not exceptionally hard and what you learn is interesting",
    "Most of the information is pretty interesting. It became apparent later in the course that Professor Clark is sort of presenting her own view of attraction and relationships rather than necessarily the wider view of the academic community, but she pulls in recent studies which makes things interesting. Honestly a decent amount of work with the two papers on top of the exams, I credit D'ed and it was a bit of a pain. You also actually need to do the readings to be able to do well on the tests. Take it if you're interested in learning about this part of psychology, but know that you're going to have to work a little.",
    "I'd recommend this course regardless of whether you're a psych major or not. The material is interesting and if you choose a topic for the papers that you're actually interested in, doing the research can be enlightening and an interesting process. It's more work than I initially thought, but not by too much. If you do the readings and take reasonably good notes, it's easy to do well on the exams. I'd recommend starting out credit D, and if you do well on the first exam and paper, switch to a letter grade.",
    "I didn't actively dislike this course but I didn't particularly like it either. The work is pretty straightforward--two essays, three exams, and a small amount of reading--but the amount of large assignments makes it kind of stressful so it doesn't really feel like a low workload but it kind of is. Like, you don't have a ton of reading every week, but then you usually have a major assignment coming up in the middle of midterms and during the last week of classes, and during finals period, etc.",
    "Yes. I think this information is crucial for forming healthy relationships in life and provided invaluable information and knowledge.",
    "I would not recommend this course to others as it was mainly a waste of time and mostly common sense. Instead I would just recommend that students read the textbook on their own time because it is very informative about your own personal relationships and can help a lot.",
    "Not a bad class, and is very interesting. However, Margaret Clark is soooo boring. Extremely nice professor but it is hard to listen to her for an hour and 15 minutes. Also a very sneaky hard class. If you don't go to lecture and listen the test will be difficult. Even then, the test was challenging. Only take it if you are majoring in psych. Im glad I Credit\/D it.",
    "Yes! I thought this course was very interesting and I would recommend to any student wanting to take an interesting psychology class.",
    "Yes -- Clark is a wonderful lecturer and the lectures are (mostly) quite interesting; she also goes out of her way to make herself available for help with papers and exam study. Exams are very straightforward and you have a lot of options for your papers.",
    "This was a good credit\/D fifth class.",
    "Yes! It was a really cool class and I felt like the content has enriched my life. Workload is also really low: readings (you only really need to do them for the exam), 2 five page papers that are basically just summarizing studies, and three non-cumulative exams. Be warned, though, the exams can be kind of tricky asking for super specific content that was barely covered in class\/reading.",
    "If you are only reading the responses here to know how much work you'll have to do, or if you'll have to show up, take this class.",
    "Yes, just because a lot of the readings are applicable to every day life and your own relationships.",
    "Honestly, not really. Unless you're a psych major, I probably wouldn't take it",
    "Good class to credit-d, sometimes exams were a struggle because answers were so specific. 3 exams, 2 papers, no final or homework.",
    "Super chill class, not much work, definitely good 5th credit",
    "I would recommend this class to a friend. However, I would warn him\/her of some of the mistakes I made that put me behind in the beginning. At first, I thought this class would be one of my easier ones. I went to most of the lectures at first but didn't read the textbook. After the first exam, however, I found that reading the textbook would've been more helpful than going to class. After that point, I started going to class less and reading the textbook fully. In the end, going to class, paying attention, and reading the textbook (although cumbersome) is the best way to excel in the class.",
    "Take this as a social science credit. Professor Clark is very interesting!",
    "YES! I'm really interested in the subject material, so I really enjoyed this class. Take it if you think you'll be interested too. The class itself is in a \"gut\" in the sense that there's not a lot of day to day work. However, you NEED to study before the exams. The first midterm had an extremely low average because people probably didn't study. You need to review all the readings and lectures before the exams, because they do ask some very detailed questions from readings & lecture. However the good thing is that the exam is non-cumulative, and essays are pretty short (5 pages) and can be about pretty much whatever interests you. The grading on essays is pretty chill too. Professor Clark is super nice and a leading researcher in the field. She clearly has a deep understanding on psychology, which is amazing.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in how maintaining relationships work!",
    "Take it! Even after breaking up with my BF, it was interesting enough to continue going to lecture.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the subject. Because the scope is really just what the course description says, if you find the psychology behind attraction and relationships uninteresting you might not enjoy it.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a class that is not very engaging but will teach you about attraction and relationships.",
    "Interesting class, mostly things that are common sense backed up with studies",
    "I would not recommend this course to someone else; I did not feel that it was a good use of my time or that I learned as much about the content as I would like to.",
    "It is interesting material, but not conducive to learning nor is it especially engaging. Plus the fact that there are 3 exams and 2 essays was a lot on my plate.",
    "a very fair course. a lot of information covered is really useful to know in the contexts of your own relationships. that being said, if you aren't interested in the methodology of psychological experiments, this isn't the course for you. a lot of this course is jumping from experiment to survey to experiment and making inferences from findings. the book is actually really useful and interesting to read and is essential to read if you want to succeed in the exams, as it covers material that doens't collide with lecture.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in social psychology because intimate relationships are important and not studied that frequently. It also might be cool just to learn about even if you're not a psych student. If you're a clinical student though, or looking for something really challenging and engaging, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Would recommend, but probably as a credit\/d course",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class because it is fun and easy. It definitely won't stress you out, but you will learn some interesting things about attraction and relationships that can apply to your own life.",
    "I found this class to be interesting in how useful the knowledge is, whether or not it claims to be a self-help course. It was not, however, the most inspiring or surprising course I have taken. Good, easy psychology credit that will probably help you to sustain better relationships in the future.",
    "Yes! It is fun and not too difficult.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is very interesting and applicable to their lives. Professor Clark is also one of the most helpful Professors I have ever had the experience of learning from.",
    "I think everyone should take this course!",
    "Definitely! Interesting, content is relevant and helpful in our own personal lives. Not stressful. Good social studies credit if you need one",
    "Took this class credit\/d and as I soon found out, it is not one of those classes where you can't study for the test and expect to pass. The first and third tests were extremely difficult and required that you read most of the outside readings. Clark's slideshows often contradict what she had said earlier, so it is sometimes hard to figure out which one will be tested on. Lecture is also pretty dry.",
    "I do but only if you're willing to do all of the reading and proactively communicate with your TA about your papers' feedback. Lecture alone will not suffice for the exams or for gaining a thorough understanding of the course's key takeaways, and besides, the is incredibly well written and fun to read!",
    "Yes! The information is super interesting and relevant and everyone should take this class",
    "If you're going to take this class, take it for the content. It's not exactly a gut; the exams are challenging but definitely doable if you study. The papers are also good.",
    "Yes; I found the content very interesting",
    "I would recommend this course as an interesting elective or for those who struggle with their own relationships.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to any student at Yale. Any student, whether freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior, can take this class. You don't have to be a psychology major either. This lecture is phenomenal! The class is made up of 3 midterms and 2 papers, all 20% each. You also use clickers in class to ask questions. Really fun! TAKE IT!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it provides not only interesting information on relationships, but also a comprehensive understanding of social science.",
    "Interesting material but the course isnt super well taught. You dont need to go to class to do well on the exams so take that for what its worth. Perfect credit D but kind of a lot of work to take for a grade",
    "It's an okay class. If you're really interested in the subject matter then it is easier to engage with the material. I found the grading to be extremely subjective which was frustrating. But if you go to class and take decent notes, and skim the readings before the exam I was typically okay. Prof Clark was great making herself available to the whole class if they wished to meet about anything, I just wish I took advantage of that offer earlier in the semester.",
    "Great credit d class for non psych majors",
    "Absolutely! The interpersonal knowledge  I have gained from this class has Been highly influential in the ways I interact with others. I really loved this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning about relationship science and wanting to explore an exciting new field of research in psychology. The professor is really great and the topic of the course is extremely interesting. The coursework is acceptable and will definitely have you asking some interesting questions about relationships. Lucy was a great TF as well who was really helpful and open to answering questions.",
    "Yes. It is not mind-blowing but it is interesting and provides some insight on human relations. Other times it's pretty much common sense.",
    "Yes I think this class is interesting, informative, and important. It gives a clear background on the history and current research in the relationship science Field.",
    "Yes, interesting material.",
    "Yes - it was super interesting.",
    "The course was super interesting and a very relevant topic to daily life of the average Yale student. I think the lectures were a little boring and the professor tended to read directly off the slide, but I would definitely recommend it as a fifth credit for someone looking for a lighter load and an interesting coarse.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. Very practically relevant to your everyday life. The course title is a little misleading because 'relationships' doesn't exclusively mean romantic relationships in this context - we studied a whole range of types of relationships and there isn't a single person to whom the content would be irrelevant. This class could be a great credit D. Very few readings (fast to skim) and lecture slides are self-explanatory. That being said, I found the first midterm harder than expecting. It was fun being able to choose my own topics for the two short papers.",
    "Yes",
    "I thought it would be a gut and an easy course, but it is not as easy as it seems. I guess the learning and testing styles were just different to what I was used to.",
    "YES",
    "I would definitely recommend the class, but be warned, the exams aren't always clear. Make sure you meet with the TF about your paper so you know what they are looking for.",
    "This class is interesting, but not particularly engaging. I thought there would be more information on different types of relationships, but we mainly focused on heterosexual couples and their family dynamics. If you do all the readings, it's not difficult to do well on exams, but I don't know if it's worth it to take a boring class just for the ease of passing.",
    "Yes, but only to a psychology major or someone really interested in this topic. I thought it required some background knowledge of psychology.",
    "Extremely interesting topic, but not thrilling lectures. A good course to take credit D because the tests are purely memory based of random facts.",
    "Absolutely! A great course with a basic courseload (3 exams, 2 short papers), with great lectures and easy to follow slides.",
    "Unless you're a psych major in need of an easy elective to fulfill the requirements, this class isn't worth taking. It's poorly organized, both over the whole semester and within lectures. Sitting through this kind of 75 minute lecture twice a week was painful, and I found I could get through the lectures on my own (they're posted on Canvas) in 30 minutes tops. Tests are a combination of both lectures and readings, but are pretty easy as long as you actually prepare for them. It felt like I was teaching myself most of the material because I never went to class but it's super easy to digest so I wasn't too concerned about missing lectures (clicker questions weren't mandatory, but I'm not sure if she'll change that). On the bright side, Professor Clark is sweet and you'll learn a lot of practical advice for how to go about your own relationships. Though, I don't think these pros are enough to justify taking the class if you don't have to.",
    "overall a good class and pretty gutty - sometimes professor clark was really unclear on what she'd want and grades for papers were suddenly lower than expected without much feedback... but nice structure: 3 exams 2 papers throughout the semester and no final",
    "I loved this course. I don't think I've ever learned more in a class. You really get to know EVERYTHING about how relationships and people within relationships work. All the information is extremely relevant to everyday life and can be applied. \r\n\r\nThe workload isn't bad. Homework for each week is reading two chapters from the textbook. There are 3 exams and 2 essays  the essays aren't graded to harshly and the exams aren't more difficult than other psyc courses. \r\n\r\nMargaret Clark is so sweet and super accommodating. You also get to learn about her studies and she's a relationship expert!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This was an amazing course taught by a wonderful professor."
