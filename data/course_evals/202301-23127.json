                "I would! The course was well taught and Kostas Zivas was a great TF. Lectures were clear, interesting, and informative. You get what's on the tin, a great survey of Russian history from the 9th century to 1801.",
                "I would definitely recommend be this course to anybody interested in Slavic studies or world history generally. I learned so much, even specifics, over such a broad period range.",
                "Yes, it gives a lot of insight into Russia as a country and even gives you an interesting perspective on world/European politics. I really enjoyed it!",
                "I would, but only if you're very interested in this time in history. I personally liked the class, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea. The lectures were engaging (although not at all interactive), the grading was fair, and the TA (Kostas) was great. But the professor doesn't always acts like he cares about the class, and can be sneeringly dismissive toward students. Like when he spent five minutes during the last class telling us that if we stress out about our future jobs in marketing the same way we stress out about our grades, we'll cause fractures in our families. Or about the final exam: \"As long as you dont go to sleep or spend the next week stone-cold drunk or on drugs, you should be fine.\" Honestly I thought it was kind of entertaining, but I can see how it could grate on people.",
                "Yes, if you would like to learn about Russian history and are interested in a history course without a paper. Professor Bushkovitch's fifty-minute lectures are informative and entertaining."
