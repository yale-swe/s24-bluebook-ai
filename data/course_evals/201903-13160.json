   "comments": [
    "The strength is Dr. Bennett: here handouts are very organized, and she explains things really clearly. Also, she just puts so much effort into teaching: there are numerous office hours, she responds to emails quickly and helpfully, and she's always willing to meet to discuss course topics or whatever else.\r\n\r\nThere are a few concrete suggestions I would make for improvement:                                                \r\n(1) Graphing was REALLY a pain if you weren't using Matlab--it usually added at least an hour to my work each week. So, I would recommend either saying everyone has to use Matlab (and dropping C++ and Fortran), or providing graphing packages to go with C++ and Fortran.                                                \r\n(2) The exams required a pretty substantial amount of memorization, which is not really a useful 21st-century skill for this type of material: in whatever context we end up using this, we'll surely have reference guides available. I know Dr. Bennett doesn't want to change the assessment and grading at all because she knows so well what the curve will be in advance, but it would be really nice if the exams became open-note and didn't require so much memorization, since I don't feel like my success in the course should be tied to how well I can produce the algorithm for a certain method from memory. Another option would be to make the final project-based: in S&DS 230 with Reuning-Scherer (which is a pretty similar course in that it teaches a variety of coding techniques to apply to different statistical problems), the final is a project in which we have to use a number of the techniques taught in a certain application. Something similar to that would be cool, because it would let us try our hand at real-world application, which will resemble much closer how we'll actually use this material in \"real life.\"                   \r\n(3) I felt there was a slightly excessive burden regarding the psets. This is partially my difficulty with graphing from above, but also, the psets were a lot of work, which was often a lot of busy work (like writing really long multidimensional Taylor series and trying not to make an arithmetic error). I would recommend lightening this work up a bit--I feel like it would've been better for my enjoyment of the course and mental health. Another option is to drop one pset--since there are 11 psets, make each one out of 100, and then drop the lowest score for everyone at the end of the term. This would give us some leeway during really busy weeks. I understand again that that would change what the curve would look like, but I think it would be worth it. Also, I don't know why the psets started being worth fewer points as the course went on, because the level of insight and difficulty certainly increased as the course went on, and I felt like I was spending many more hours on the psets later in the term. 6 and 7 were definitely the most work, whereas 1-4 didn't seem nearly as bad, mostly because they had much easier material and more trivial codes.                       \r\n(4) it would've been nice if there had been a way to access material presented in lecture later. If you miss a class, it's very difficult to catch up, because you can see the handouts, but the lecture notes are not available anywhere. I know it would be a substantial undertaking to make all of the lecture notes accessible in print, but I do think it would help for studying purposes, especially due to the degree of memorization required.",
    "This course is fantastic! I loved every aspect of it, although I wish the notes and handouts, and problem sets werent too mutually exclusive.",
    "The course is amazingly well-organized.  The material is well formulated and lectures are clear.  The handouts provide a lot of extra information and are instrumental in completing the homework.  If I had to give one complaint, it would be the lack of access to online help, but I understand that Prof. Bennett prefers to help students in person, so this is manageable.",
    "Beth is a phenominal teacher. The course was incredibly well organized so students could focus solely on the material, and she was very clear in her expectations while still being sensitive to the fact that the students are human and sometimes they needed extra office hours or an extra day on a pset.",
    "This course is amazing! It's so clearly taught, well organized, the material is interesting and challenging but not overwhelming, and it really builds a thorough understanding of the theory and practice of numerical methods for diff eqs. The psets were often long and detailed, but usually not unnecessarily so, and the tests were fair. Honestly this is one of the best STEM courses I've taken at Yale. And Professor Bennett is the best!!",
    "This is a pretty great course--Beth has been teaching it for 20 years and she knows what she's doing. Very clearly organized and explained for ease of learning. Reasonable amount of work",
    "The strengths of this course may mainly be traced back to Dr. Bennetts meticulous organization and deep passion for \/ experience with the subject. \r\n\r\nThe strengths are that students will learn a TON if they dedicate the necessary time to the course.\r\n\r\nI can see no major weaknesses that this course has to offer.",
    "**Strengths:** The organization of this course was excellent. Professor Bennett has been teaching this course for forever and it really shows. She was always well prepared for lectures, and every lecture she would pass out a few sheets of Latex handout notes explaining in detail what we were going over during lecture so it was easy to look back and review. We covered a lot of material in one semester, and Professor Bennett made everything very engaging and everything was always clearly explained and easily accessible. The problem sets were a lot of work, but they were interesting questions and overall enjoyable to work through. I feel like I learned a lot doing the problem sets and developed coding and math skills that are applicable beyond just this course. Professor Bennett is also extremely kind and helpful and genuinely wants everyone to succeed. Everything was graded extremely fairly and transparently, and she would hold office hours at convenient times and went out of her way to be available outside of class if necessary. Grading was also startlingly fast. I don't think I've seen any other professors more dedicated to student success.\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses:** Some minor things are that sometimes writing out the multidimensional taylor series near the end of the course, especially multiple times on some of the psets was somewhat soulcrushing. Also it seemed like there were a few places more emphasis on linear algebra could have simplified notation greatly, however 440 was dropped as a prereq for the course so I understand avoiding that."

    "Yes, this is a good AMTH or MENG elective. The teaching quality is top-notch, which is a rarity in those departments, and I really do think I've learned quite a bit about a field that I never would have otherwise. I wish it had been a bit less headache for what it was--I'm certainly glad not to have to do any more psets or studying for exams for this course. And I think the learning outcomes could've been achieved without quite as much labor going into it. But Dr. Bennett is a gem, and I would recommend taking whatever classes you can from her. Do note that the course will increase sharply in difficulty starting around the second month, so if you're struggling to understand during shopping period, that might be a red flag that this course isn't for you.",
    "Yes! This is Dr. Bennett's brainchild and it is an absolutely phenomenal experience! The workload is hard but not too extreme, especially towards the second half of the semester. You will learn so much!",
    "Yes.  The course is very well organized, and provides a good understanding of the topics covered.  If you are interested in practical applications of coding to solve Engineering problems, I would highly recommend the course.",
    "Not to the average student, but for someone who loves math and has been frustrated when in other classes you get to a point of \"oh we can't solve that type of problem\" because this is the answer to that.",
    "Yes! I mean it's not for everyone because it is intense and very technical in coding and math, but it's great for stemmy people of many stripes. Just be prepared to spend a big chunk of time on it, and try your best to find friends to work on psets with.",
    "Yes, even if just for Beth Anne Bennett. You will get much better at mathematical programming and analyzing cost and accuracy of your program, and also learn how to use Taylor series in a practical context (crazy!). Beth is one of the best and most caring professors I've had at Yale, and she's been teaching this class for 20 years. The lectures are clear, the handouts are impeccable, and the exams are challenging but fair. Be aware that the psets take 8-10 hours per week, but they're super doable if you don't start them the night before. A good class for combining math and CS.",
    "If youre someone with a relatively good background in differential equations and some programming knowledge who sees themself possibly using complicated, un-hand-solvable IVP or BVP problems in some future study, TAKE THIS COURSE. Its quite time consuming, but Dr. Bennett is a fantastic instructor. (Her notes and lectures, though dry, are fantastically well-done and comprehensive, and among those who take her classes its widely agreed that shes perhaps the best applied math \/ applied science instructor Yale has to offer). Youll learn a ton about math and programming thats relevant for almost any field that uses computational simulations.",
    "Yes! This is an excellent course to learn more about numerical methods, and Professor Bennett is the perfect instructor for this course, hands down"
