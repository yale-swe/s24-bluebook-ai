I learned a lot about approaches to thinking about rights and moral obligations.",

It really challenged my existing views and changed the way I view my relationship with nature.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I could ascribe to this class would be that at times the balance it struck between philosophy and environmental issues seemed to be a bit unstable. This fluctuated a lot and certainly wasn't an issue for me but others may not like that. Still take the class though !",

                "Lectures were engaging and content was interesting, although it was abstract and a little hard to follow at times. But then, this was a philosophy class.",
                "This was the first time the class was taught a lecture and so there were sometimes lectures that seemed not as well connected but I think that will be solved quickly. I think the amount of work the course asked for was appropriate and I also think the grading was very fair. Prof. Latham was also very captivating in lecture I enjoyed every class.",
                "I feel that I have a solid foundation of different fields within environmental ethics from which to go off and explore and still enjoy thinking about some of the debates. I love classes which prompt great discussion at lunch and this class always sparked some good debates. \r\nI would have liked to look at rewilding in more depth.",
                "Strengths are the topics we covered but weaknesses are the fact that section isnt part of your grade",
                "I really liked how Professor Latham lectured without slides and at a very good pace for keeping up. He also did a good job engaging the class despite the course being a lecture. I think that the course could be better organized by having better clarity about which readings are due when (the reading responses each week didn't match up with the readings due for that week, and professor Latham sometimes posted two folders of readings each week but the timing changed so it was hard to keep up). That being said, professor Latham also spent a lot of time going over the readings each class, which could get repetitive for those who did the reading. Also, I really wish that he brought in guest speakers to bring a non-white, western perspective on the very important topics we were discussing (for example in the Indigenous environmental knowledge lecture).",
                "Strengths: Latham is a really nice guy, and he's a classic just-says-what-he-thinks Yale professor. He covers pretty much exactly what's in the readings, so a lot of them are effectively optional. The exam questions were fair, and the leniency on section attendance/participation was nice (no grade, just deduction if you miss too many).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1h15 lecture + 50m section is a lot of class time, and I definitely lost focus at the end of lectures.",
                "Course was great. Professor Latham was a good instructor, engaging, funny, and knowledgeable. I would recommend that in the future it would be nice that instead of 3 exams making up the majority of your grade, the option to write a philosophical paper/response would have been more enjoyable and would have solicited more meaningful engagement with the course material.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lectures, student participation in lecture was a welcome change\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Towards the end of the class things got very repetitive (e.g. after spending 3-4 classes in the beginning of the semester on animal rights, we ended up talking about moral vegetarianism through the exact same lens at the end of the semester). \r\n- Class",
                "One weakness of this course is the grading structure. Our course grade was completely dependent upon exams. The exams were quite fast-paced and I am not sure we were able to truly exercise our critical thinking and develop our own opinions which I think the contents of the course provide an opportunity for us to do. The exam format gave hand more to memorizing readings and regurgitating them onto a bluebook and favored taking the easy way out in answering the questions (i.e. arguing what was easiest to argue based on the readings we were assigned and what the lectures were based on rather than what we actually believe).",
                "loved the course but only thing was the grading was very difficult towards the beginning of the semester and I did not feel prepared for that",
                "This course is weak due to the fact that it does not truly dive deep enough into most ideas. There are also poor presentations of environmental ideas, as the focus is more on philosophy in an environmental lens.",
                "The content is interesting, but I think the course might work better as a seminar rather than a lecture.",
                "The course was great. I liked the format of Professor Latham lecturing but always reserving time to ask the class what we think and to have a back and forth. I thought he organized a really interesting syllabus and broad syllabus that gave us insight into many different topics. I did however feel like sometimes we covered the same things a few times; especially by the end of class, I felt like we had talked about animal rights and moral vegetarianism a little exhaustively. I completely understand that this was the first time Prof Latham had ever taught this course, and overall it was really thought-provoking and I learned a lot.",
                "I think that Professor Latham should be the president of the United States. I think he is great professor. I did though this course was bad. I think the premise of the class is a little irreverent given the state of climate change. I imagined that we would be discussed more realistic ethical environmental issues like should we put a floating windmill in the ocean if it disrupts a habitat, but instead we spent so much time learning what different ethical thinkers thought about animal rights.",
                "I think the strengths of this course were that we got to cover a lot of different topics and learn about philosophy in a very interdisciplinary way with a lot of historical and environmental content mixed in. As someone who is not well-versed in philosophical reading or writing, the course was pretty accessible to me which I appreciated.  I do think that the wide variety of topics did also contribute to a weakness of this class because it felt like some topics we spent too much time on while others we did not give enough time to. For example, we discussed animal rights and moral vegetarianism twice in the course, once at the beginning and again at the end, and I did not feel like much nuance at all was added when we came back to the topic so I was unsure why we came back to it. On the other hand, our unit on Indigenous Knowledge felt very lacking and rushed. I think the class could have benefitted from a guest speaker for this unit and perhaps for Environmental Justice as well.  At times, lectures from week to week felt scattered and it felt difficult to study for the midterms because there was not always a common thread between all the things we talked about, or one topic would stand out as very different from the majority. \r\nAlso, sometimes our discussion section felt slightly pointless and not helpful. I think making section either a more robust part of the class and maybe having only one midterm, might make it more meaningful. I also think that if this class had a component that gave more space for student exploration it would make it more enriching. Since the midterms were largely prescriptive there was not a lot of space to explore any certain topic more in-depth.",
                "Lecture was engaging. Readings were interesting and by no means did we need to read every word of every reading. Section was interesting and provided an appreciated added level of discussion to some challenging/thought-provoking topics. 2 midterms meant that none of the exams ever covered so much material to make them very stressful and this makes the final very manageable. Very interesting class and doesnt provide a ton of work at all in a way that might detract from the material. Overall, very positive experience in this class!",
                "The course was a bit repetitive, and I found myself trying to figure out the significance of the seemingly small debates we often discussed, though this may be because of my lack of philosophy knowledge.",
                "I think this course was difficult as a lecture, I think that there seemed to be mixed criteria for the essay and I think some students were confused whether they should focus more on Phil structure or knowledge of topics I think that if the class is to be graded more as a philosophy class with structured arguments the papers should be take home and if not the ethics class can stay as is but it is a lot to ask students to write full philosophy papers in timed midterms and finals those take time to develop and I havent had that structure of all PHIL classes Ive taken.",
                "I think I could have done without some of the readings (particularly Peter Singer), but otherwise the course material was really interesting and Professor Latham is a really engaging lecturer. I think the last part of the class (the activism module and the procreative ethics one to a lesser extent) was not as interesting as the other modules, which felt more organized and more compelling. I think inviting guest lecturers, for instance for the indigenous ecology module, would be helpful. Overall, I really enjoyed the course and would highly recommend it to others. Section was also really helpful for gaining a better understanding of the material.",
                "i wish the course focused more on arguments. Latham often lays out the positions of authors in lecture, but it takes a lot of work from the students to bring up possible counter-arguments and Latham doesn't spend much time on them. Section was even less argument focused. Section seems like our chance to work through arguments and think about how compelling they were. However, our section almost never focused on anything in detail.",
                "Strengths: Content of the course, how it was taught, teacher and TF were great. Clear thoughts and had a sense of humor. \r\nweaknesses: Nothing",
                "strengths: interesting and diverse course material\r\nweaknesses: minimal preparation for the exams, professor at times diverged from the syllabus schedule, midterm grades took a while to receive",
                "more ISSUES focused rather than theory - more similar format to latham's iconic bioethics class. more explicit references to authors )literally just shouting out by name) in lectures. amazing dialogue in lecture i havent seen in classes of this size",
                "strengths -- reading selection was pretty interesting and prof latham did a good job clarifying the readings\r\n\r\nweaknesses -- an overall uncritical / undisciplined approach to the readings. to me, there seemed to be  very little attention paid to close, precise readings of the texts.",
                "Very interesting topics and lectures, could benefit from a bit more structure",
                "I dont have anything negative to say about this course. I truly loved this class and thought the exams were very fair and lectures were engaging!"

                "Yes, although I don't think as a first year in your first semester. Given that it covered two areas that I am very interested in, it was definitely worth taking but the course is tested exams which I didn't like as much.",
                "I would if the final isnt still 50%",

                "Yes",
                "Yes. Before this class, I vaguely knew environmental issues were ethical problems, but I got an appreciation for the breadth of opinion on them after taking it. The class is also pretty easy. Latham keeps coming back to the same themes over the course of the semester, so I felt like I learned a lot without really trying. The exams are more about showing understanding than constructing a new argument, so just remembering key points is enough to get a good grade in the class. It's a great Credit/D if you're a little interested in ethics.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Professor Latham is great, the topics are very interesting, and I was introduced to a fascinating new field of philosophy. Would highly recommend the course.",
                "If you have not taken other ethics courses and are interested in ethics through the lens of environmentalism, I think this is definitely a good class to take. if you have a strong background in ethics I think you might be a little bored. Also, if you have a very strong background in environmentalism (particularly critical environmentalism/environmental anthropology) you might also find the content a bit repetitive. That said, for me this was a very good way to learn about both ethics and environmentalism from the background of someone who is curious and reads about it in their own time but has never taken classes on the subject.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I think the thinking skills that this course helps develop are extremely foundational and applicable in nearly every aspect of life, both inside of the classroom and out. I think that it really challenges everyone to be the best people they can be and provides the knowledge to back up and understand why we believe the things that we do, especially about the environment. Given the climate crisis we are currently facing, I think that the topics of the course are very relevant and important for everyone to be exposed to. However, if a lecture-style class isn't the way you learn best, this course may not be for you, especially if you require some sort of presentation aid (like a PowerPoint) while a professor is lecturing.",
                "yes",
                "Not if it is taught the way it was this semester. Lectures were not recorded and the professor at points went on long rants with no purpose. Many topics, like environmental justice, were not expanded upon and looked more at from a philosophical perspective, ignoring the reality of what environmental justice entails and the ethics behind unjust decisions.",
                "Yes definitely.  Professor Latham is a really engaging lecturer, and the course covers a wide range of topics that are relevant to everyone, not just people especially interested in environmental studies or science.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student because I thought the premise of the course was uninteresting and unrealistic.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who wants a surface level overview of many topics in environmental ethics or a soft introduction to philosophy from an environmental standpoint. I think if there are one or two specific topics that stand out, it is probably better to take a class that is specifically about that topic if it is offered (which many are). I don't think this class would be a good fit for someone who likes to go super in depth into certain topics and do extensive individually guided learning. Additionally, for someone who may be unfamiliar with the history of environmentalism in the US this class provides a pretty solid framework (from a philosophy/ethics perspective). However, it does not go too in depth in any issue, and generally takes a western focus of environmentalism, so if these are not topics you are interested in then it might not be the best fit.",
                "Yes absolutely. I really liked this class. Professor Latham is an incredible lecturer and I was honored to take class from him. I thought the topics were engaging and I could tell he was thinking along with the students which I appreciate. There was not a ton of work at all - the midterms were fair and very manageable. I liked the material and found it engaging throughout.",
                "Maybe. Depends what they're looking for. I appreciated it as a different class than those that I typically take, and was definitely a good use of a Cr/D.",
                "Not really, maybe if it is taught as a seminar",
                "definitely!! the course materials are really interesting and important and Professor Latham is a really engaging professor!",
                "Yes. I think this is a very light course that introduces you to some interesting topics in environmental philosophy. You can do well in the course if you dedicate some time to sketch and memorize the arguments of the different authors in the few nights leading up to the tests (even if this is your first time reading them). But don't expect to get a ton of depth out of the course. You will basically learn the arguments of the papers on the syllabus (in class and for the tests).",
                "Yes I recommend this course because it looks in all directions of environmental perspective on the struggles of our past and future. Makes you question your own ethics, and the philosophy makes you really think. The reading were great and the tf were awesome.",
                "Probably, the material was interesting and expanded my understanding of environmental issues and how to think through them, but the course \r\ncould use some reorganization and will likely get better the more the professor teaches it as a lecture.",
                "i think itll be better organized second time around. latham a great lecturer but got a bit disorganized towards end of class",
                "i would recommend this course if you are someone who doesn't really care about/become frustrated by a lack of close reading. I mistakenly thought that because this was listed as a philosophy course, it would really enhance my ability to think/process analytically. unfortunately, most of the teaching team slanted towards EVST, and not PHIL. also, i found that prof. latham really reiterates most of the readings in class, and that contributed to a class culture in which a large majority of the students did not do the readings -- or only did them immediately before the mditerms.",
                "Yes if you're interested in the topic it is a really great course",
                "YES! I really loved it and cannot recommend it highly enough"
