                "Strong class that I learned a lot from. Very interesting look into the world of letterpress--labour-intensive and often frustrating but very rewarding and at times fruitful. Jesse is super passionate and engaging. I was frustrated that the curriculum didn't include a full letterpress tour, with safety and logistical guidelines and a more centralised learning process - it felt like I was constantly making mistakes that had to be corrected by the student press managers that I could have otherwise avoided from the outside. Class periods are very long so it's hard to keep focus especially during the more \"lecture\" portions, though they're really interesting! Wish we didn't have to write a final paper on top of the 35+ hours I spent on my final book project.",
                "I think that the strengths of the course were the small class size, the dedication of the professor and pressroom managers, and the education about this space on campus that I can continue to use for the rest of my time at Yale. I'm not sure of many weaknesses. I think that this semester there was a conflict that meant we were unable to use a seminar room with a table and chairs for more than an hour. It was helpful to have that space for critiques or lectures because it was easier than trying to look at work standing up in the more cramped pressroom, so having better access to the seminar room for those types of classes may be helpful.",
                "I love that this course is very small. The one-on-one time with the professor was extremely valuable, and it was one of the only classes where I felt like the teacher truly had a vested interest in the quality and heart of your work. This was a huge motivator and I believe it pushed me to become far better than I could have become with a different teacher or a different class."

                "Absolutely. Jesse was an incredible teacher. He is so passionate and dedicated to his work and I feel so privileged to have had the opportunity to be his student.",
                "Absolutely. More than learning about letterpress, this course teaches engineers art and it teaches artists some engineering. The craft is deeply fulfilling and its value far reaching."
