The course starts with explaining teaching about intelligence generally, then basically once we do that we just go topic by topic and look at the intelligence and national security lens for it. Topics include 9/11, Pearl Harbor, Iraq, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Russia, China, drone use, torture, NSA surveillance, cybersecurity, disinformation, white nationalism, etc. There's SO much thought provoking and relevant material that you learn about.",

I learned SO much about the IC, its functions, structure, history, etc. This course also touched on modern topics and issues that are worth reflecting on for national security. Professor Wittenstein also brought in a lot of cool experts who were able to provide us with a rounded perspective of things relating to the IC/national security.",

You learn everything intelligence in recent history: The Trojan Horse, Pearl Harbor, WMDs in Iraq, 9/11, North Korea, Russia + election interference, the Mueller Report, the rise of AI. And then you learn a lot about how the CIA, FBI, and other bodies of the intelligence community operate and analyze past intelligence failures, with a plethora of really cool guest speakers and the first-hand accounts from Professor Wittenstein's own experience.",

                "Strengths: very interesting lectures, engaging \r\n\r\nSometimes I wish I had more background on what we were learning since I had no foundation in the material and got lost easily",
                "Strengths: Professor Wittenstein is an expert in the field and brought in amazing speakers (if only they could have been in person!) and I appreciated that the lectures were recorded. We covered a wide variety of topics and the readings were very current. I liked that Professor Wittenstein included breaking news/new developments in his lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: My discussion section was not very engaging, and the key word exercise we did at the beginning of each class did not contribute much to the general conversation. Sometimes I felt like we grazed over topics and didn't really get to fully understand them, but this makes sense given the immense amount of material/world events that the course covers.",
                "The strengths of this course is that the material is engaging. The professor does a great job of connecting the readings to the content covered in lecture. Every reading and assignment has a purpose.",
                "Nothing!",
                "Outstanding course. There are no weaknesses. Professor Wittenstein cares so much about each student and the material and it is clear in every single lecture. I loved going to class each day.",
                "I don't have a single weakness to speak of. The course was well-organized, had a thoughtfully conceptualized syllabus, brought in amazing guest speakers via Zoom to address the class, and related all of the themes to current events going on in the world. Every lecture was engaging, every assignment felt purposeful, and I left every class excited to learn!",
                "-Strengths: course readings, discussion sections, guest speakers, course layout (i.e. the chronology of topics/readings), use of multimedia in lectures\r\n-Weaknesses: size (too large in my opinion), would be better if there were two courses, one for undergrads, one for grads/PhDs in my opinion, lecture slides could be a bit more engaging at times",
                "Strengths: Defined syllabus, each topic led into the next seamlessly, and Professor Wittenstein was a really great lecturer who made an effort to connect with everyone despite the size of the class.\r\nWeaknesses: N/A- Thought this was a really great, well-organized class",
                "The course content was excellent. The topics were very well-organized, with each session building on the previous ones, to give an excellent overall picture of a very big topic. I also appreciated the many distinguished guest speakers that Prof. Wittenstein invited to the class. I was amazed at the level of access that we had. \r\n\r\nThe only drawback of the course was its large size; Prof. Wittenstein did a great job of engaging his audience during his twice-weekly lectures, and in reviewing our exams and memos (with the help of the TFs)... but it must have been exhausting for him!",
                "Strength: super engaging lectures, interactive element to discussion sections (policy memo assignment), material feels incredibly relevant\r\nWeaknesses: the take home final (3 essays in 48 hours, before the extension) was honestly really overwhelming and I would have preferred a closed book 3 hour exam",
                "Weakness - too many readings; would've been easier to dive deeper into the readings if there were less",
                "A strength was Professor Wittenstein, whose genuine enthusiasm for the topic, willingness to meet with and help students, and overall positivity were a real draw to show up to lecture each time. A weakness was the irregularity of reading assignment lengths  some weeks would be a few articles or a chapter, another would be a whole book. Frankly, I don't know anyone who read the books as a result it's just not feasible and I wish we would have been told a few chapters within the longer readings to focus on so we could have gotten something out of it (instead of just skipping it whole).",
                "Very interesting lecture and workload is so manageable",
                "The strength of the course was the lectures, the professor and all of the material. It was just super interesting and we had many amazing guest speakers. The exams were super fair and sections were just an extension of lecture",
                "Strengths: lectures are interactive and encourage participation despite the large number of students, excellent Professor with a career background in intelligence, relevant and important questions posed in the content\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: horribly structured discussion section that did not prioritize student engagement and allowed no time to participate",
                "Really interesting course, great guest speakers, Prof Wittenstein is great - no complaints.",
                "Strengths: Wittenstein is a great teacher and an even better person. He invited us all to a Harvard/Yale celebratory bbq in his yard. So fun! He's also passionate about the material and clearly loves what he does. The only weakness is that this class is a lecture so most of your engagement is in section. I loved my section so this wasn't a big deal but I wish we got to interact with Wittenstein more.",
                "Strengths: breadth of topics considered; focus on key dilemmas and questions that prompted interesting conversations in section; very well-structured lectures with lots of questions to the class, various forms of media, and even conversations with experts in the field (Chris Whipple, James Clapper, Yll Bajraktari, Fiona Hill)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes felt like we were rushing through topics in an effort to cover everything, which could leave you without a strong base in any of the specific topics and instead relying on logic to get through the class; lecture slides often had too much text to copy down / summarize while trying to listen to the valuable additions from the professor - made note-taking difficult unless you can write really fast",
                "Very interactive \r\nHighly structured \r\nguests lectures \r\n\r\nsuggestion: \r\nmay be some visits to Langley or DNI Offices.",
                "The material was really interesting, and effectively communicated. The assignments were fair and there weren't too many of them. Section really backed up what we discussed in class.",
                "The course has an excellent instructor, engaging lectures, and interesting readings. Also, the assignments (essays and memo) are well made and actually force you to integrate all the knowledge you learned. I can't think of an improvement to this course.",
                "The lectures were the strength of the course--very interesting and on engaging subjects. We also had some phenomenal guest speakers.\r\n\r\n I wish we would've had more time to spend on the latter half subjects, such as China. The readings were quite long at times, although they were interesting and useful for the final (which was quite long--perhaps shortening the word count for each essay would be helpful, as the well-intentioned 48hr style did disadvantage students who had other exams in the meantime)",
                "The course made good use of guest speakers and lectures were enjoyable overall. I appreciate the lecture slides being posted online.",
                "All around a very interesting course!! Not too much work, yet you learn a lot. The readings are really interesting and easy to understand even if you don't have a solid foundation of IC history or current events.",
                "Strengths: PROF. WITTENSTEIN and an awesome crew of TFs.  Course material is incredibly interesting.  Lectures go by so fast because they are engaging.  Amazing guest lecturers.  Just an awesome class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "The course was highly engaging content and the readings were applicable to class and greatly aided in the full understanding of the concepts. The assignments were also helpful in allowing us more rooms to explore the material in a way relevant to the intelligence community,",
                "Section was very helpful in this class as it was a way to contextualize and engage with the course material. Discussions were good for bringing up various issues that were not always discussed in lecture. Lecture for this class was very strong, and provided ways for engagement there as well.",
                "Lectures are engaging and it was nice to see a variety of guest speakers included. No changes are necessary!",
                "Strengths: Professor Wittenstein is an amazing lecturer--you should definitely go to class and if you don't, they're recorded",
                "Strengths: the professor is great, the material covered is very interesting, and there are great guest brought to the class. I do not see any significant weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Wittenstein is a great lecturer and the material is so fascinating. Guest lecturers were generally great too but maybe less engaging because they were Zooming in. My section was particularly well-run and classmates were very engaged with the material. The diverse mixture of students who take this class makes discussions super interesting and fruitful. I think the workload is appropriate and I received incredibly detailed feedback on my midterm exam. Lectures are recorded which is very helpful for rewatching/taking notes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The take-home final sounds like you have a lot of time but is genuinely very tough to complete well if you have other exams during the period that the exam is open, so maybe consider this if you are a slower writer (you could also do the essay option if that's the case). Prof.'s lecture material didn't always line up with the syllabus due to running out of time which made going back to look for material in lectures more difficult/confusing.",
                "This course is mega organized and MEGA interesting. The readings are all posted on the syllabus in advance, and Professor Wittenstein follows them to a T. You can totally get by without doing the readings because Professor W's lecture slides are so comprehensive and he's just a really good lecturer, but the material is so interesting and relevant that you might as well. It's *mostly* isn't that much anyways. I can honestly say I do not think there are many weaknesses of this course. It would've been cool to have the guests in person rather than have them zoom into the lecture hall, but I guess that's just the way the COVID cookie crumbles.",
                "Super interesting class! Wish it was a seminar but then i likely wouldn't have gotten into it.",
                "Weakness was that it covered a lot of a topics. This was also a strength in some sense because it introduced me to a lot of new things.",
                "This is a great class but the final was an extreme amount of work",
                "Very interesting material. However, the final exam was a bit over the top in my opinion: had 48 hours (in the middle of finals period) to write three ~5 page papers with prompts that were given to us at the start of the 48 hour time frame.",
                "Great class",
                "This course really only has strengths. The content and readings were fascinating and the assignments and exams were great for reinforcing the content.",
                "Strengths: amazing content, lectures were fascinating, great professor who explained each topic with such great yet accessible analysis, overall favorite class this semester\r\nWeaknesses: readings were definitely excessive at times (teacher covers the needed parts in class), some lectures on the IC's structure were a little boring, sections were not always useful, having only 24-48 hours for the midterm and final essays was not great",
                "Really interesting and friendly. Made it easy to stay engaged",
                "Professor Wittenstein was amazing.",
                "This course was excellent, I learned a ton in class and in section and the class overall was extremely well organized.",
                "The course hit on a wide variety of topics and was a good survey of US Intelligence Efforts. I wish we could have spent more time at the end of the course, facing current challenges, than the historical aspects.",
                "Strengths - unique topic, engaging/interesting professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Section can be a little boring sometimes",
                "Strengths: Excellent professor, TAs, and interesting course content\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "The strengths of this course are the richness of the syllabus and the lectures. The readings are excellently curated, and the professor is a fantastic lecturer. He brings both scholarly knowledge and experience as a practitioner in the intelligence community to develop a very insightful course on the process and policy of intelligence in the United States. The lectures are all very interesting and informative, and the sections provide additional opportunities to discuss relevant questions and issues that arise in the course of the class. I really appreciated the opportunity to write a final paper instead of take a final exam, and I look forward to continuing to work on the topic I wrote about in my final paper.\r\n\r\nI can't think of many weaknesses of the course except that additional writing assignments might be useful throughout the course. I really liked the assignment of producing an intelligence memo, and it would be great to practice it more than once.",
                "The course was very well planned out and the lectures were engaging.\r\nA potential weakness is that following the midterm, I personally found the first few lectures a little less engaging due to some legal jargon. I also wish more time had been devoted to US-China instead of leaving it for the last lecture.",
                "Strengths: definitely Professor Wittenstein who is incredibly helpful and an engaging lecturer",
                "Strengths: lectures are interesting, Prof. Wittenstein is great and the slides/content is engaging\r\nWeaknesses: final was too long, 3 essays is a bit excessive. Wish this class had focused more on US foreign policy though"

                "Yes!!!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student regardless of their major if they are interested in learning more about global events through a national security perspective. I especially enjoyed learning about cybersecurity and hearing form the amazing speakers that Professor Wittenstein brought in.",
                "Yes, this course is a great way to learn about the governmental intelligence systems and frames many historical events through different lenses, providing a much different perspective on things.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student at Yale.",
                "YES I LEARNED SO MUCH!",
                "YES!!! Incredible class. Extremely interesting material each lecture from a former intelligence analyst (CIA, DoD, etc.) with really cool personal anecdotes (when we discussed the Iraq WMD scandal, he showed a picture of him in Iraq inspecting the nuclear facilities; when discussing North Korea he told us a story of his hotel experience there, etc.). My absolute favorite class at Yale. Very low workload and extremely interesting",
                "Absolutely. Everyone should take Professor Wittenstein's lecture! It is incredibly interesting, not overly onerous, and provides you with a great baseline understanding of the U.S. intelligence community and its role in our country.",
                "Absolutely. The course is relatively accessible--with most readings from news articles or government reports--and one can learn so much about intelligence from taking it. The evaluation was also very reasonable; having take-home, 48-hour exams was an excellent way of accessing real knowledge and skills, while also not being as stressful as a sit-down exam.",
                "Absolutely, you can find ways to apply the concepts you learn regardless of whether or not you intend to have a career related to intelligence",
                "Definitely take it",
                "Yes, absolutely. You'll learn a lot about intelligence (yes, including espionage!), the intel community, and foreign policy. The course content was fascinating, the lectures were taught well, and the Section discussions were interesting and interactive.",
                "Absolutely! This is a really really interesting course with a super supportive prof who clearly cares a great deal about the subject matter and his students.",
                "Absolutely, favorite course Ive taken at Yale",
                "This is a class you should absolutely take if you are interested in foreign policy or intelligence work even in the smallest amount or even if you have read a spy novel once and liked it. Its the perfect class not a lot of work, a fascinating topic, and a great professor. I am not sure I will ever go into intelligence work, but this class has absolutely been one of my favorite at Yale. At the end of the day, you get to learn about spies and relax, and what could be better than that? Take it.",
                "yes!! loved the class and prof Wittenstein",
                "Absolutely!",
                "A must take",
                "Yes I definitely would. Read over the syllabus and if it interests you right of the bat then definitely take it. If you're hesitant about the material itself, don't, because this is a material and content driven course that requires students to be inherently interested in the material.",
                "Yes, especially if you're a Global major - it gives you a lot of content that is great to know when discussing different topics in other Global classes, and it's just very interesting generally. The guest speakers were great and the readings were also interesting (although admittedly too long at times). I also enjoyed the freedom we had with choosing our memo assignments and final essay topics - the assignments give you a great chance to delve deeper into an aspect of the course you are particularly interested in, which I appreciated.",
                "Absolutely! If you are interested in the intelligence behind historical events like Pearl Harbor, the Cuban Missile Crisis, 9/11, the assassination of bin Laden, etc. this is the class for you. Prof. Wittenstein made this one of absolute favorite classes at Yale--truly can't recommend it enough.",
                "Yes! It's super interesting material, there are very interesting questions brought up, and it's generally well structured. I would recommend taking it with other classes covering non-American perspectives, as this is definitely from an American foreign policy view.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn what actual work of the IC rather than believing its all about car chases and gun fights. You will learn how to think on your feet in quick seconds. Weekly Intelligence Memos helped me to think like an analyst and present key material in most effective way.",
                "I would recommend this course. The material is mostly stuff you won't ever have a chance to be exposed to otherwise. It's an important topic for anyone who wants to understand the world better.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they have an interest in intelligence-making or foreign policy.",
                "Definitely recommend taking this course with Prof. Wittenstein! Hes a gem and really cares about the material and the students.",
                "I'd recommend this course to any student, regardless of major or prior interest in intelligence. \r\n\r\n\r\nProbably my favorite course of the term-thanks!",
                "I would highly recommend this course, even for people not specifically interested in this field, the class is a good way to gain valuable knowledge about the development of American Intelligence and National Security programs, especially in relation to current events.",
                "Yes! Absolutely take this course if you are even marginally interested. The content is super interesting and easy to grasp even if you don't have much background in the topic. Lectures and readings are both great and interactive.",
                "Yes, I would HIGHLY recommend this course.  Just an incredibly interesting topic, great professor, light and interesting readings, and an awesome subject.  What's cooler than learning about spies?  If you want to take a course from a professor who casually drops lines such as, \"When I met Putin in 2008,\" or \"I've been waterboarded,\" this course is for you.  Top 5 in my favorite classes at Yale (from a senior).",
                "Yes, absolutely. Professor Wittenstein is a great lecturer and makes the content relevant to todays events, ensuring that all lectures are engaging and timely.",
                "I would recommend this class for students who want to learn more about what intelligence looks like in the United States. Recent intelligence failures are analyzed, which are familiar topics for most, but it provides a lot of context for where fault lies in these issues. It was really interesting to learn about these issues from a new lens.",
                "Yes! It is extremely interesting, especially for those who want to get involved in the field or think about Global Affairs from a different perspective.",
                "I definitely recommend! Professor Wittenstein is a great lecturer, and he takes the time to read through everyone's assignments (both exams and memo). The thing is that the 48-hour take-home exams took foreverrrrr (two 1200 word essays for the midterm and three 1200 word essays for the final). Cranking those out when you have other exams during the same time hurt. All the questions are extremely fair, however, and it's open note, so you're chilling (side note: I never went to a lecture after the midterm but got an A on the final because Professor Wittenstein's notes were very thorough and I did the readings of the examples I chose to highlight in my essays). \r\n\r\nHe does say in the syllabus that you won't get an A in this class if you don't participate in section, so if you're taking this class for credit and you're A-or-bust, make sure you do! Participating was rough for me, because everyone in section was a crazy tryhard and I was shocked (I'm a STEM major who usually doesn't have participation as a requirement for classes lmfaoooo).",
                "Yes! If you are interested in foreign policy or domestic politics you should definitely take this class.",
                "Yes! I didn't have much of a connection to the material beforehand and my major is not even remotely GLBL-related, but I loved this class and I'm so glad I took it. I learned a ton about international relations and feel like a better citizen because of it. Prof. Wittenstein is great and I have to assume he chooses his teaching team thoughtfully because my TA was also wonderful.",
                "Yes -- if you're interested in learning about the functions of the American intelligence community from a practitioner's perspective.",
                "Absolutely, the lecture was very engaging if you have any interest in intelligence/foreign policy and the material was designed to allow you to think about real world events and applications.",
                "Yes, this course is amazing. I would especially recommend it to students who may be interested in pursuing a career in government.",
                "one thousand percent yes. low-stress. tremendously interesting. great professor. clear grading. clear structure. 100% awesomeness",
                "Yes! great class and super interesting. definitely take it.",
                "Absolutely. This is 100% the best class I've taken at Yale. TW is a kind professor who cares about the well-being of his students. He just wants to see everyone engage with course material.",
                "yes",
                "Yes it was a very well taught and relevant course",
                "Interesting gut",
                "Yes.",
                "100%! One of the best courses I've taken at Yale!",
                "Professor was fantastic and the subject material was interesting and relevant to current events. TAs, especially mine, were chosen very well.",
                "Absolutely, I gained a much deeper understanding of the intelligence community and US national security. This class was a factor that shifted my career plans towards national security and potentially even intelligence analysis.",
                "Yes",
                "Definitely take this course if you have the chance to! Workload is essentially memo and the exams and you learn a lot from both.",
                "Yes! It was a good survey course and introduction to foreign affairs as a non-major.",
                "Absolutely. Prof Wittenstein was a great lecturer, the content is interesting and very useful for any Yale student curious about how the American intelligence community works.",
                "Yes. Professor Wittenstein is great and the topic is interesting. As a global affairs student, it was fascinating to get a window into how intelligence collection is performed and what impacts that has on foreign policy capabilities and decision-making.",
                "Yes: The course was engaging and had a manageable workload",
                "Absolutely. The class is an excellent introduction to issues in the intelligence process and oversight and policymaking related to intelligence community activities. The class is well-balanced in terms of its presentation of content and opportunities for discussion and engagement among students.",
                "I would definitely recommend to another student who is interested in how american foreign policy is shaped by intelligence, and how intelligence works to collect and analyze information.",
                "Yes!! This is a fascinating course and I looked forward to going to class every day. It also interweaves history and politics into the discussion of the IC which I found very interesting.",
                "Yes, definitely if you are interested in domestic intelligence systems."
