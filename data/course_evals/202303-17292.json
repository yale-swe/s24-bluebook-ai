                "I learned a lot about education policy and teaching practices, as well as Yale's history and educational discrimination in America.",
                "This course taught me to consider a broader picture of education, both inside and outside the classroom. Ive wanted to work in education policy for a while but have not been interested in teaching. This class made me reconsider my qualifications to do policy work without having spent time in a classroom.",
                "Alternative pedagogies and school choice",
                "I have a broader understanding of education policy and teaching globally and in the United States.",
                "As an international student, I gained insight into and knowledge of the American education system and associated debates\/policy issues. The first half of the class focused on the purposes of education, sociology of education and education policy - all in relatively good detail. The next part focused on teaching and student learning, as well as some other smaller topics. These knowledge areas were extremely engaging and relevant. In terms of skills, the classroom observation paper taught me how to observe, make field notes and write an observation paper. The literature review paper taught me how to approach such writing, since it was my first time doing so.",
                "Got a great introduction to a variety of concepts in education policy and practice. I don't expect to be a teacher in my career, but I feel this content is valuable for anyone to gain a good understanding of to be an informed citizen.",
                "I learn so much from this course, including knowledge about education purpose, education policy and how it gets made, the landscape of education in America, an introduction to teaching pedagogy, and so much more. I have come to realized how much more there was to education as a whole, and there were definite many moments that piqued my interest and made me want to learn more.",
                "This introduction to education studies course was fantastic in that it exposed me to different theories on the purposes of education. I also learned about different pedagogies which I could apply in the future.",
                "Learned a lot about the history of education and how this history contributed to the wide variety of schooling systems we see in the present day. We also got to compare the education system in the United States to the education system in other countries and by doing this I learned about practices that foreign countries contribute to the differences seen between their student performance and the performance of students in the United States. Overall, I learned about the goals and structure of a variety of schooling systems and the disparities between schools in low-income areas and high-income areas.",
                "I gained a brief overview on a variety of topics within education studies.",
                "Definitely how to skim readings and write longer papers\/literature reviews",
                "I learned so much in-depth content about the education system, primarily in the United States but touching on certain comparative systems as well. I learned how to write a large literature review at the end of the semester. Generally, I learned about the purposes of education, different school systems and models, and quite a broad umbrella culminating on education as applicable to a student interested in education studies.",
                "How to write a literature review",
                "I learned about educations role in society. Topics included the purposes of education, education politics in the United States, student and teacher evaluations, the education debt, alternative schools, anti-racist pedagogies, issues in special education, and issues in higher education. Skills that I learned include taking for sociological observation, writing literature reviews, and viewing education through a critical lens.",
                "I learned a ton about the history and contemporary landscape of education globally, but with a strong emphasis on America.  I also learned a bit about conducting observational fieldwork and writing a lit review. A large portion of my knowledge was built from discussion with peers.",
                "Current topics in education studies, including purposes of education, policy, history, and international education. In terms of skills, how to write a lit review, conducting an observation for a classroom and reporting the results.",
                "I learned about the history of US education, and current policies and pedagogues.",
                "By taking this course, I was able to learn more about the education policies and origins that have led the different modes of education to be the way they are today. It was really interesting to learn more about higher education policies and the history of higher education.",
                "I learned about the purpose of education, education in New Haven, and how to do a classroom observation. This class helps to teach students how to crank out college papers while having a good buffer in the grade. Specifically, I learned that there are so many factors to education and that it is tough to decide on a single curriculum.",
                "EDST 110 exposed me to various issues in education studies, from pedagogy to education policy to Yales admissions process and more. The course also gave me a new language of sociology to speak about education policy.",
                "Learnt a lot of different teaching styles and ongoing issues and debates in education.",
                "I learned a lot about the education system and how it works and the issues with it",
                "I learnt about the educational system in the US, with a big emphasis on inequalities in US classrooms",
                "This class taught me so much about education and the purpose of it. I was positively surprised by the amount of substantive content this class contained. I learned about the philosophy of education, education history, segregation in schooling, educational policy, educational curriculum, alternative pedagogies for education, higher education, and several other fascinating topics! I also gained observational and reflecting skills, improved my writing skills, and was able to easily tie together concepts.",
                "Become informed about the education systems around the world.",
                "I learned about many aspects of the US education system, but I also learned about the education systems in other countries as points of comparison. We talked about the history and implications of things like high-stakes testing, the purposes of education, and alternative pedagogies, and barriers to education for racial and ethnic minorities and rural education",
                "Broad overview of education systems not only in the US but globally, as well",
                "the current landscape of education in the US, and some from international countries too.",
                "Learned a ton about education and education practices around the world.",
                "This course gave me a broad understanding of topics and important scholars in education studies. I learned how to think critically about educational systems and I developed greater insight into things I may have noticed as a student but never fully recognized. I also got more familiar with using APA citations.",
                "Learned about the purposes of education and different systems that are at play in the USA, Finland, South Korea, and Singapore. The most informative experience was attending the classroom observation and speaking with the teacher there!",
                "I learned a lot about how much prejudice influences the American education system at all stages. It wasn't something I was actively thinking about before this class, but now it's really evident how suffused it is into nearly every aspect of policy.",
                "I got a foundational overview of some of the core questions in education studies. We didnt go too deep into any topics, but I know what topics are on the table!",
                "Learned a lot about the education systems in American and international countries like Singapore and Korea. I learned about the purpose of education, different pedagogies, the costs and benefits of standardized testing, the impacts of affirmative action, how to make education more inclusive and how it has been used to oppress specific groups, and so much more. It is a very informative course.",
                "I gained a better understanding of the history of education in the US and current state of \/tensions within the education field. I also learned quite a bit about international educational models. We learned about the issues of trying to implement policy in real life and how education reflects societal values in general.",
                "Introduction to education theory\/policy in the US. Learn about different types of schools, the history of various policy decisions, and current debates in the educational sphere.",
                "Like the title of the course, you learn core foundations in education. Everyone comes in with some knowledge of education, and this knowledge is validated, enhanced, and added with contexts and backgrounds of their histories.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of the US education system in light of our peer international systems. I am walking away with a better grasp on the history of education in the US, and how other nations have systemic differences that comparatively strengthen their teaching and learning communities.",
                "A high level knowledge of the context of education studies, policy, research, and systems both in the United States and internationally. Learned about different methods of learning and how to do field research by participating in a classroom observation in a New Haven high school.",
                "I learned a lot about the basic of education. I also learned how to write a literature review.",
                "I learned a lot about many different types of education and also learned how to critique educational systems.",
                "Knowledge: a survey of different topics related to education both domestically and abroad. Skills: how to write a literature review. Insights: So many problems within our educational system.",
                "Understanding of the education system and its relation to class, race, ethnicity. Along with learning about education abroad and what the American education system can learn from it.",
                "By taking this course, I learned that I definitely do not want to take any more Education classes at Yale. I learned that education may be complicated and changing it may be even harder, but nothing will certainly change if anyone remotely interested in Education takes this course. If the head of the department teaches so poorly and is so close-minded, what does this say about Yales Education program as a whole? I learned relatively little about education and felt frustrated every day of class. She aimed to cover a range of topics, including the history of education, Brown v. Board of Education, types of schools (e.g., charter, magnet, Montessori), measures of accountability (e.g. standardized testing, state testing), rural education, and higher admissions. The lecture on bilingual education was coupled with special education, which led to both of them being skimmed over. She also intentionally excluded one lecture on the School-to-Prison Pipeline, which felt like a slap in the face to the Brown and Black community.",
                "The course provided me with a broad overview of the most relevant theories, policies, and concepts in the field of education, with a particular focus on structures within the US education system but additional analysis of international systems and the lessons we can learn from them. Most meaningfully, I feel that I developed a more comprehensive understanding of the different theories behind and pedagogies within education systems as well as a greater appreciation for everything that goes into teaching.",
                "I learned a great deal about education policy, history, and practices. This course covers a lot of ground.",
                "I learned about how the educational system in America and how it stands internationally. I learned how to critically think about the weight we give to certain educational systems and why an understanding of historical context is necessary for understanding current educational structures."

            "comments": [
                "This course is great in that it covers a wide range of topics within the field of education studies. Even though it is in lecture format, I felt like I got something out of each class. However, I questioned the use of an exam as the form of midterm evaluation, particularly as we had just learned about alternative forms of evaluation and some of the drawbacks of using assessments as the one we had taken. Another drawback is the fact that we had to purchase the textbook, which felt more like a side piece to the rest of the course, and it only made up a small fraction of all the readings we did, and was almost never referenced directly in lecture.",
                "This is a very engaging courseit is easy to participate and learn even if you havent done all the readings. They make an effort to help students connect with each other through social hours, time to talk during class, and collaborative spaces. Dr. Debs makes a cognizant effort to have students participate in lecture which makes it engaging. Lecture moves quickly and is not boringit highlights relevant and current issues and aspects of education that are easy to observe in the world around you. There is a heavy reading load, but you dont have to do them all to benefit from the class.",
                "It could be improved having discussion posts within lecture rather than outside so that the discussion posts relate to both the lectures and readings.",
                "Too many readings",
                "Strengths: The classroom observation assignment was very engaging. Being in a New Haven school was very interesting.",
                "Strengths - great community through office hour lunches and other events, committed professor who is extremely approachable and engaging in ed-discussions. Also, flexible deadlines and 40% completion graded.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - as with any survey course, the course covers a variety of topics in a short period of time. Each lecture feels slightly rushed since they are only 50 minutes long. I strongly believe a 1:15 lecture would be more effective in covering the topics in depth while still maintaining levels of engagement.",
                "No weaknesses! Readings and topics we discussed were engaging (although there was a LOT of reading for each class). Section was well organized and fun. Classroom observations were a fascinating opportunity to do something that one usually can't.",
                "Strengths: There was definitely a wide range of topics covered, which to me was a strength because my interests are broad (but some may find this a weakness if they already know what they are interested in). The course was structured so that it focuses more on the learning and de-emphasizes grading (compared to other courses Ive taken, mainly STEM).  There are also so many opportunities to engage with this course and the community, like lunch office hours with Dr. Debs. Weakness: Sometimes the reading became overwhelming. There is just so much to cover because education is a huge field, so lectures sometimes feel rushed towards the end.",
                "All strengths! Wonderful professor, great starter course to Education Studies. Couldn't recommend enough!!",
                "This course was really strong and offered a great introduction to the field of education and the various components that comprise it. Also, the two day writing extension was extremely helpful for turning in assignments. If I were to find one weakness it would be that I wish we received more feedback on how to improve our writing. Going into the final paper I felt kind of lost as I wasnt sure what level my writing was on, so receiving more feedback on previous papers would definitely be helpful.",
                "Strengths: interesting topic\r\nWeaknesses: poorly organized, too many assigned readings",
                "It was good that there was a midterm and no final. The topics were interesting and the class feels like a good community.  However, I feel like the 3 participation check points felt very repetitive. Maybe the middle one could be shorter.",
                "As an intro survey course, the class sacrifices depth I often wished I could have explored for the sake of breadth. This isn't necessarily something I would change, as it is necessary to cover lots of topics in a foundations class",
                "Strengths: 2 day extension, no final\r\nWeaknesses: lots of readings",
                "This class creates so many pathways to support that I felt engaged and curious the whole time. It encourages asking questions, drawing upon personal experiences, and learning about others in the process. My only complaint of this course was that because there was so much material to cover, some topics (that traditionally get skimmed over in education) got the short end of the stick, such as special education and rural education. This was disheartening, but I don't believe it to be intentional. I just wish we could have explored these conversations in more depth.",
                "Strengths: catered to student interests and needs, inclusive\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures often felt like repeats of the pre-class readings, I wished there was more in-depth analysis of each of the main topics rather than rushing through more topics",
                "An incredible strength of this lecture was participation. Dr. Debs created space for students to contribute in lecture, and there were plenty of opportunities to approach her outside of class. She seems to engage in continual reflection on her teaching, and I appreciate her flexibility and creativity in lecture. One highlight was when we learned about Montessori pedagogy through a class of Montessori activities. I really enjoyed doing activities with my hands, and it was admirable that Dr. Debs was willing to try something nontraditional. \r\n\r\nSince I went to an American public high school, I was really interested in education's role in US society. However, I know that some peers wanted the class to either focus more on international education .",
                "Strengths: Everyone is incredibly passionate, from Dr. Debs to the TAs to the students. The assignments were very relevant to research methods -- observations, lit reviews, research papers, and exams. There is ample opportunity for community building if you take advantage of the opportunities presented.\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture format was kind of counterintuitive to the course material. Lectures are too short to get through all of the content. A lot of lecture is just reviewing key themes from the reading, with moderate time for discussion.",
                "Strengths: coursework is very intentionally designed to enhance learning, especially with the classroom observation and literature review. You receive plenty of feedback and help on assignments before you must submit the graded version of it. Lectures included insightful student testimonies and polls, and sections were a great opportunity to discuss what was most meaningful to you from that week's content. Weaknesses: Readings were engaging, though sometimes too long for what we were expected to learn from them. Lectures could feel like a watered-down version of the readings.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Debs is super sweet and lecture is enjoyable, especially given how large it is. I also like the two day grace period on all assignments. Further, big assignments were broken up into smaller deadlines so there was less room for procrastination. \r\nWeaknesses: maybe mention the grace period less so that students don't automatically turn that into the deadline. Other than that there are none that I can think of!",
                "The strengths of this course were being able to give students a broad overview of the history and policies of education in one semester. I appreciated the digestibility of all the information while getting the sense that I was able to learn the different roles of education. The main weakness of this course is again how broadly every topic is covered and the selectivity that comes with what topics to delve deeper in and which not to. However, I think that the sections are helpful in allowing this deeper understanding to happen.",
                "The strength of this course was how it was set up. This class is perfect to introduce someone to college and I recommend people to take it. This class has a ton of reading assigned. It does teach how to skim, but you learn as you go. Additionally, each paper prompt gives you an example of past papers. Following this was extremely helpful to producing a good paper. I would recommend the rubrics be easier to follow and more information about why your grade was your grade.",
                "Like many introductory lecture courses, EDST 110s strength is also its weakness. While I was exposed to many different issues in education policy, I felt like we rarely discussed these in depth. At the beginning of the semester, I was frustrated by this seemingly lack of balance, though I now understand why Dr. Debs has to structure the course this way. If you are interested in any of these subjects, I encourage you to reach out to Dr. Debs or the TAs and find some additional reading. A LOT of people write about education, but its important to read the good stuff!",
                "I really liked having varied assignments, and really enjoyed the classroom observation. \r\nI did not like the reflections and participation goal assignments, it felt repetitive do reflect so many times, one shorter paper, and then a second check in would have sufficed.",
                "I think this course is super well done and you can tell the Professor Debs has listened to feedback from the past to make it the way it is. I would say the one weakness is that it rushes through some content especially at the end that deserves more class time. But this course has great readings and lectures to facilitate learning and conversation. It is not too much work but it is engaging work so you want to do it.",
                "Strengths: Assignments are nicely spread out, lecture is very interactive, professor and TFs are very understanding and care about your learning. Weaknesses: This is not an introduction to the field of education studies. The focus lies heavily on US Education and inequalities. This should be more clear in the course description and syllabus.",
                "This course's biggest strength is the content and how interactive the lectures were. Students shared personal experiences in class and that elevated the learning. I really enjoyed talking about education twice a week. I also appreciated that it was accessible with lecture captions, slides, and lectures posted on Canvas, shared notes doc for the class encouraged by the professor, and an automatic two-day extension on every assignment- no questions asked!! Lastly, the readings and the assignments were overall quite interesting! I especially LOVED the classroom observation! It was the BEST part of the course:)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didnt like how office hours were done. It was implied that if I wanted to talk to the professor 1:1 itd have to be because you had some kind of problem. I also felt like this course was disorganized. Most lectures only covered about 30-%40% of the intended slides because half the time was spent engaging with the class (which was great) but it took away from the format. I think this class would have therefore worked best as a twice-weekly seminar. I really recommend that there be four sections of this class in a smaller format so a similar number of people can take it but it would allow for more integrated conversations. The sections felt unhelpful without the TFs actually sharing the same knowledge as the prof. I think Dr. Debs or whoever would hypothetically be teaching the proposed Foundations in Ed Studies Seminar should be the person to engage us in conversation, just like in lecture, in a way that would feel a lot more beneficial to our learning.",
                "Readings can be redundant at times.",
                "This is an intro course that is meant to give you a wide range of topics, which I think is a strength because you get to see a lot of different topics and how they intersect with one another. You dont get to really go in depth into anything but I dont see that as a weakness because it just made me want to take more Ed Studies classes.",
                "Strengths, teaching staff is super kind, weaknesses - doesnt go in depth really",
                "Strength: Professor Debs was super kind, and the TFs were all helpful and supportive. The workload for the class was very manageable\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the topics in the lecture felt redundant. Also, the midterm felt contradictory to what we learned in class.",
                "The strength of this course is that it was very engaging and we were able to give a lot of feedback and collaborate even in a lecture setting. This class was so memorable. I wish the lecture slides were posted before class so I could do those notes beforehand and just add Dr. Debs commentary during class.",
                "This course does a great job of providing a broad overview of topics and making students aware of the major issues in educational spaces. The reading material was often engaging and the discussion sections provided a nice space for refreshing knowledge on the material. The classroom observation was a great way to put our knowledge into practice and was a highlight of the class. My least favorite part of the course was the lit review assignment, but I think it does a good job of introducing students to the format of a lit review.",
                "Strengths: assignments graded for completion, the sections and the section leaders (Ava is amazing). Weaknesses: the lectures are seemingly unorganized. The last assignment is a literature review but the only guidance we got on how to actually write a literature review was from Ava, one of the section leaders.",
                "Strengths: I liked how the course tied education into wider discussions about societal inequities, and how New Haven was often used as a case study for much wider trends in American education. The readings are generally very good and getting a variety of perspectives is wonderful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course has semi-regular \"participation reflection\" assignments, for students to discuss how they participate and engage with material both in and out of the classroom. Although I understand how this can be a useful tool, they felt mostly repetitive and I didn't feel like I was really learning anything from the assignment; but this might just be because the course was geared for underclassmen.",
                "Dr. Debs is a great lecturer and I loved listening to her speak about a subject she is clearly so passionate about. Most of this class is overview\/foundational, so a lot of the material we cover is material we know or could reasonably infer. However, I did enjoy the parts of the class where we went a little deeper into case studies or readings.I wish we could have slowed down and just picked 3-4 core topics to focus on, instead of going through a different topic in almost every class. Or perhaps my section just wasnt very productive?",
                "Strengths:\r\n-Lecture is recorded and very interactive\r\n- Discussion sections allow you to reflect on the readings and tie it into your own life in a safe space\r\n- The observation assignment allows you to get hands on by visiting a real New Haven classroom\r\n-I appreciated the credit assignments so I could get feedback without stressing about my grade but also have a chance to learn and express my findings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I wish this class had a purely seminar version because I personally just do not find lecture formats to be engaging as it is hard to get personalized information to your particular learning style. However, with that in mind considering the class is a lecture Prof Debs everything possible to make lectures accessible and interactive by passing around a mic for students to speak into and doing activities in class",
                "Strengths: very focused on collaboration with an expansive definition of participation. Very equitable grading. \r\nWeakness: sometimes lectures could have a bit more content since we spend a lot of time sharing personal anecdotes, but I also see the value in community building!",
                "Strengths: very engaging course, amazing + understanding teacher, automatic 2 day extension, great and relevant assignments, recorded lectures if you can't make it, occassional classes where things are mixed up a bit for fun, also asks for active feedback and implements them.\r\nWeaknesses: Midterm was opposite of the pedagogy of the course but if still implemented, would love more autonomous questions and less questions in general.",
                "Lectures are so fast. Sometimes it felt difficult to get a lot out of attending lecture and that they were just summaries of the readings. I wonder how Dr. Debs can better structure lecture to generate conversation of the readings instead of just regurgitating what we already did in preparation for class. The readings were also quite long. The chapters from the Ed & Society textbook were quite iterative and unnecessarily long to be assigning a whole chapter. For a course as broad as 110, I didnt think that the readings encouraged a better understanding and rather deterred students from even completing them because of the length.",
                "Strengths: Jonathan. Epps. He was a wonderful TF and I cannot overstate how important he was to my experience in the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Debs is great, but most of the content covered in the lectures felt unnecessary. I think this course would be better in seminar format with TFs, since that's where I actually felt I learned things in the course.",
                "The best part of the course is the teaching staff. Both Dr. Debs and the TAs are so responsive and clearly care about the well-being of each and every student as an individual. Biggest drawback was how big both the lecture and discussion sections arewhole group discussions eat up so much time so quickly since there are so many people.",
                "I think the lectures could have been slightly more engaging.",
                "The strengths of this course were in the assignments and in class time. I have never seen a large lecture be so engaging and inclusive to many different perspectives before. The assignments were also well thought out and had flexible deadlines to allow me to time manage better in regards to other coursework.",
                "Strengths: Topics, and TA (Jonathan Epps is the best). Weaknesses: no glaring weaknesses.",
                "The assigned reading was way too much and poorly chosen. I would not mind the reading, except that it was never mentioned in class aside from 2-3 sentences nor in discussion. Thus, I stopped doing the readings after the Midterm exam and suddenly had more free time in my life and faced no repercussions grade-wise. Most students in class dont do the readings. I recommend assigning ONE (1) reading of a reasonable amount (< 10 pages) prior to lecture that everyone in class is expected to do. For example, assign a lecture-wide discussion post that everyone responds to. Have everyone write 1-2 replies on someone elses post to get students thinking about lecture content BEFORE class. This would be infinitely more beneficial than assigning some 50-100 pages of heavy educational theory reading that almost NO ONE does just to boost the ego of the professor and her colleagues. Still, the most frustrating part about this course was that not one single lecture focused on HOW to teach. The format of participation grades was also horrendous. Students were asked to complete not one, not two, but three separate participation reflections. These were basically writing assignments that asked students to self-evaluate their own participation (i.e., lie about personal growth). You could write anything on there, true or false, and no one would care. There was no incentive to be truthful besides ones personal integrity. As a result, participation was absent across the board except for a couple of loud-spoken individuals during lecture. Furthermore, no assignment asked students to design a lesson or teach a lesson. In my opinion, students should take what they learned and apply it in designing a how-to lesson of their choice. They should have to teach their lesson to their peers in discussion. What is the point of learning all this educational theory without practical application? Its no wonder that many public school teachers cant teach. The one lecture on Montessori education that was designed by a student was borderline ridiculous. There were Montessori activities for CHILDREN (e.g., scooping beans, mending a sock, reading childrens books). The suggested activities for ADULTS were checking your email, organizing your backpack, and making a to-do list. As someone familiar with Montessori education, this lecture was insulting. Real adult-level Montessori activities would be like building a chair, reading and comparing cooking recipes, and scrapbooking. Additionally, the literature review assignment was not a literature review. It specifically told students not to comment on the state of their chosen field and to instead only praise the fields published scholars. The whole assignment felt like a Google Scholar scheme that Dr. Debs set up with her colleagues to boost all of their citation counts (in fact, the lecture before she assigned the paper was about the importance of a high citation count). As a STEM major, I can affirm that real reviews include independent thought of the author and actually include something meaningful about the limitations in current understanding of the field. I also did not care for the structure of the literature review that forced me to find five sources and then write my introduction and outline. This is a writing form that was forced upon me in middle and high school. I would hope that my university professor of education would trust me to make my own decisions about how to write a paper. Providing a suggested strategy is completely alright. Making me follow it over the course of three weeks when I have already determined that this is not how I best write my papers is not. This ties into the central theme of the course that the students are naive and have much to learn about education. The only parts I liked about this course were the Classroom Observation, Dean Quinlans talk, and the Discussion Section Coffee Chat.",
                "I think the greatest strength of the course is definitely section. Students interested in ed studies are a fairly self-selective group within the Yale community, and that means that people are bringing a range of diverse and interesting backgrounds and perspectives with them into the classroom. Its been really interesting to gain a further appreciation for each of the topics weve discussed in class by hearing how people relate them to their respective backgrounds. Another strength of the course was definitely the classroom observation project, as it was definitely a valuable and unique experience to be able to sit in on and learn from observing the class of a New Haven teacher. In terms of weaknesses, I think there probably should be some sort of mechanism for holding students accountable for more of the material after the midterm because the level of seriousness and buy-in definitely dips off after that.",
                "The largest strength of this course are definitely the assignments. Some low-stakes graded by completing assignments mixed in with some real substantive essays and even opportunities to visit local New Haven classrooms! While most readings were certainly interesting, sometimes the sheer amount could be overwhelming. Learning to skim\/read strategically is a must. Overall a fantastic course!",
                "Strengths - The readings were engaging, the lectures were informative and interwove current topics that kept engagement high. We were granted the opportunity to go into a New Haven Public School and conduct a field work study there. The midterm instead of a final was a great idea because the \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The final (the literature review paper) should have been due on the last day to turn in work for Yale College during the final period instead of an arbitrary due date."

                "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student. Not only is it an important topic to understand as educational inequalities lead to so many of the inequities we see later in life, but it is fun, engaging, and community-based. I enjoyed lecture and section, and met multiple people who I plan to keep in touch with.",
                "I do not love this course, but I am happy to take it because I really want to take upper-level EDST courses. I think it is an interesting course, but it feels very in the establishment of teaching as opposed to considering how meaningful reform could happen for education.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Yes! Yes! Truly a life-changing experience that has gotten me even more excited about ed-studies than I already was. Everyone in the class WANTS to be there, rare for lectures.",
                "Yes, it was a great experience.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Whether you are interested in education or want a nice introduction to what social science is like on campus, you should take this course (just make sure to register early because there is a limit on enrollment). Also, this is required for the EDST certificate or scholars program!",
                "Absolutely!!! Professor Debs is wonderful and this is a wonderful class to take.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, regardless of whether they plan to pursue a path in education in the future. A came away with a lot of knowledge about how our education system was built and how it functions today that I wouldn't have known if I haven't taken this course. You also meet a great community of people and hearing about other student's educational experience was really one of the main highlights of this course.",
                "Yes, it is a good introduction class. However, it is not the best organized course and the practices\/assignments often go against what you learn. I wish the class was more experimental with the methods you read about.",
                "I think this course is good for anyone interested in education policy.",
                "Perhaps helpful to take, but if you are not an EDST major or certificate, would recommend just taking one of the other EDST seminars that goes more into depth on a topic you are interested in.",
                "Yes if you need a SO credit or if you're interested.",
                "Yes! I think any student can come out of this course with a better understanding of how education works through them. Everyone can find something applicable to walk away with, and I think the broad diversity of disciplines reflected in this course is what makes it special.",
                "I would recommend this only as a pre-requisite to other EDST courses.",
                "Absolutely! I think reflecting on our own educational experiences is paramount understanding the spaces we occupy at Yale. Everyone has different knowledge sets that they bring to the course, which makes discussion incredibly rich and layered. Additionally, EDST is so much more than just a class. Dr. Debs and co make a concerted effort to foster community, and I have left the lecture with so many new friends and connections.",
                "Yes, it's a great learning experience with a tight community and strong support systems.",
                "Id recommend this to anyone interested in education. If you're looking for a gut, make sure you still care about the material so that youre engaged :)",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about education, education policy, schools, and higher education. The workload was also manageable.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is willing to do the work for this class. Some decided to never do the reading and it made it more difficult for them to do the projects and paper. This class is perfect for anyone who always procrastinates :)!",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are generally interested in education or those who need a social science credit. This course provides a great foundation for students who want to specialize in a certain area of education studies. By the end of the semester, students begin to understand the web of education policy and how tricky it is to balance the goals of students, parents, teachers, school districts, and the country at large!",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to other Yale students. I think everyone should take this course. It is super interesting and opens your eyes about education and think about it in new ways.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. This is not an introduction to the field of education studies. There is not much discussion about international education, pedagogy...If you are interested in learning about US education and inequalities, there are courses that focus specifically on this topic and do a deeper dive. I found that this course was a very generic survey of a very limited range of topics.",
                "I recommend this class to everyone at Yale! However, its current format could be frustrating to some students, because it feels like it could work better as a seminar. If learning about the issues of education with a focus on education policy alongside 100 other Yale students, then by all means take the course! It is great as an introductory span of knowledge of education. Yet, if you can get into any of the ed studies seminars, I'd recommend them over this class! They're just harder to get into.\r\nThat being said, it was very interesting! I really appreciated all the opportunities to engage with the department outside this class! Also, I love love chill atmosphere and the moments of calm at the beginning of lecture:):)",
                "1000% it teaches you about the U.S education system",
                "I would recommend it because this course gives a good perspective on education, which we all received before coming to Yale. Youll see parallels to your own educational background, but youll also see and get to hear about other peoples experiences in education and widen your worldview a little bit.",
                "Yes! Made friends and leaving with a greater understanding of how I can contribute to improving the education system",
                "Yes, it was an interesting class and everyone you met was passionate about education. The professor and the TFs were all super sweet",
                "Yes! Its a tad gutty, except for a few hundred pages of readings a week, but they are really fun reads.",
                "Yes, absolutely! I think it does a great job of introducing some really interesting and important topics related to education and it is a great course to take to gage potential interest in pursuing education classes or professions in the future. This course made me value my teachers more than I already did and I felt that everything we learned was extremely important for everyone to know.",
                "Yes! If you want to pursue an Education Certificate, for sure take this course to get an understanding of the broader topics at play. And it is an easy class to take so I wouldn't hesitate to just try it if you're interested in the field just a little bit.",
                "You'll really enjoy this class if you enjoy learning about policy, legislation, and philosophy of education. I would recommend it if the societal and cultural background behind education policy interests you. If youre interested in methods of education \/ being an effective educator, this class does give some attention to that subject, but it's minimal. The class is also very much geared towards first year, first semester studentsan introduction to how to write academically. This is great if you are a first year student (as most who take the class are), but if youre an upperclassman you probably already have some experience with academic writing.",
                "Only if that student is pursuing an Education Studies certificate. Otherwise, I feel as though the class goes through a lot of material that we already know or might seem obvious. If you get lucky and land an incredible TF, the class might be engaging, but from my experience it wasnt worth the time. Its a shame because Dr. Debs is awesome and does her best to make the class more enjoyable and engaging.",
                "Yes. It is a great course that shares insightful and important information in a very organized and student-friendly way.",
                "Great introductory class! You learn a lot and the readings are very interesting.",
                "Yes, everyone should learn about education and this is a low-stakes but still engaging way to go about it.",
                "Yes! It's a great class to expand your horizons and understand the state of education in the US, particularly how much peoples' educational expreineces vary and how that can affect future prospects.",
                "Yes! Regardless of major, this class appeals to every student as it concerns learning about one and their peers' education. It's also not too difficult of a class and great for a beginner\/someone who knows nothing about education except their own educational journey.",
                "Yes! I think 110, as the name implies, provides students with a great foundation for education studies. I would definitely advise incoming students to not seek this course as a means for thinking of solutions to existing problems, because you will get discouraged quickly. A real strength of this course is how expansive\/broad the material is so as to encourage a skeleton of an understanding of existing issues in the education sphere.",
                "Yes! Easy and interesting - the perfect 4th\/5th class!",
                "Yes, especially if this is one of your first semesters at Yale! The course is a great introduction to larger educational topics dived into in other Ed Studies courses. Its also a great way to ease into the academic expectations and assignments at a university level. Had I known about it my first semester, I definitely would have taken it then.",
                "Yes!!! It is a great intro to Ed Studies class.",
                "If you're interested in education, I think it provides a great foundation.",
                "I would 1000% recommend this course to anyone interested in education or teaching. This class made me fall in love with the Ed. Studies department and want to pursue more courses in it.",
                "Sure, if you're interested in education. It's a cool course.",
                "Yes, its a great introductory class at Yale. I learned a lot and Im sure others would too.",
                "Absolutely not! Do not take this course unless you are just looking for a Social Science gut or are a delusional Education Studies major who needs it for the certificate. Also note that this class is on education, not teaching. All you will be taught is educational theory, almost none of which directly translates to teaching others. For those that received good reviews about and recommendations for this course, seriously question the academic ideals of those individuals. This course teaches you nothing. This professor doesnt understand what is actually needed in the field of education. You are wasting your time. Take any other Social Science course. Dont say I didnt warn you. Having nearly all the assignments for a participation grade would also have been fine if we actually got substantial feedback on our work. Unfortunately, however, I never got more than a couple of sentences from my TA. It was usually all good. I felt like I made no improvement in my writing from this class and had no understanding of whether I was actually producing good work. As a result, there is no real incentive to work hard on ANY of the assignments. You basically just need to study hard for the midterm to get a good grade in the class. Lastly, the discussion section posts felt like a waste of time. Most people wrote them AFTER section. Plus, the discussion often went nowhere and felt superficial, likely because no one did the readings.",
                "I would. I think the subject matter is interesting and useful if you want to go into ed policy or teaching. It is also an exceedingly chill class, so you can really put in as much time and energy as you choose.",
                "Absolutely! This course offers a great introduction to education in all facets. Definitely be prepared to read, but contextualizing past educational experiences of yours can be really interesting and rewarding.",
                "Yes, absolutely!!!"
