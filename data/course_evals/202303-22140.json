The class helped me form a new perspective about the texts we were reading and closely analyze them to effectively retain information.",

                "Strengths: Excellent selection of material; small class format; clear effort to broaden the scope of the course by reading Gilgamesh and medieval Arabic and Hebrew poetry\r\nWeaknesses: Cost of buying books (also, asking students to purchase Purgatorio and Paradiso despite not covering them in the course)",
                "Good. Very broad overview of literary works in Western canon.",
                "I think that our class had strong student participation and that we constantly discovered new aspects about the texts through our discussions with one another. Sometimes I felt a bit intimidated by my peers and how knowledgeable they were, so I refrained from participating as much as I would have liked to. However, that has less to do with the class and more so to do with me.",
                "I enjoyed the range of writing and how it paralleled the other tracks. I wish we read more of the books in full, however.",
                "Limited instruction on essays.  I also think having student led discussions is a poor idea.  I did Directed Studies to have an expert PhD lead me through the text, not a student.  I believe DS lit is supposed to teach literary analysis, not public speaking.",
                "In general, there isn't much I would change about Directed Studies except that I'm in the camp that prefers more books but less time for each over less books but more time for each. In regards to Dr. Stoner's specific course, I appreciated her section's emphasis on student involvement with the texts and fellow students. I greatly preferred discussion leading to Canvas discussions that other professors prefer as I think it targets a different (but greatly important) skill set. I also think that her giving students the ability to direct questions to each other allowed for greater agency with the texts. I don't have much to add in regards to weaknesses except that I would have appreciated more diversity with essay prompts (such as analyzing themes throughout multiple books, for example, or perhaps an occasional creative prompt) though I understand that this would target slightly different skills."

                "I would. The reading was lovely, I really enjoyed the lectures, and I gained a solid foundation for moving forward in literature at Yale.",

                "Yes. Dr. Stoner cares about her students and wants to help them succeed as best she can. Her comments are detailed and her questions are provocative. Students are pushed to think critically but with grace to differing views and ideas. Students feel agency in the seminar whether through guiding discussion or with broad prompts for essays."
