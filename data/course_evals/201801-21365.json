   "comments": [
    "This was a good class. Luca shared information about key aspects of Italian cinematography and history. The historical commentaries to the periods of the films we were looking at really helped. Luca was also very welcoming to feedback and spent about 20 minutes in the last class asking for ways to improve the class. This is the first time Luca is teaching a course at Yale and I think he did very well.",
    "My Italian speaking and writing improved as did my knowledge of Italian culture and cinema.",
    "It was great to get a broader picture of the history of Italy in the context of cinema. We also got to see a lot of films I wouldn't have otherwise chosen.",
    "I was able to acquire a better understanding of not only Italian cinema, but also of Italian culture and the different fragments that constitute European culture.",
    "This course was fantastic in giving an insightful view into the advancements of cinema in Italy. I got to watch so many amazing, timeless Italian movies whilst also seeing how they fit into Italian culture as a whole. Overall, however, the greatest strength of this course was keeping up with my learning of the Italian language in a meaningful and enjoyable way.",
    "This class offered an overview of the history of Italian cinema and film production in a variety of different genres and techniques, developing alongside Italian and European history in general. We learned how to analyze films for cinematic techniques, symbolism and themes and how to write academically in Italian on these subjects.",
    "I improved my Italian writing and speaking skills. I learned to watch and discuss movies critically.",
    "I learned a great deal about Italian history, which was my main goal for this course.",
    "My Italian language skills definitely improved. I also gained a deeper understanding of Italian culture and film."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked the course and watched movies that I had not watched about relevant periods of Italian histories.",
    "The course could focus more on highlights of italian cinema - rather than organization by theme. The workload of the course was quite high for an L5 language course.",
    "Strengths are the format and encouraging atmosphere. The course could have demanded more writing and reading",
    "Strength: Professor always available and very knowledgeable and engaging.\r\nWeakness: Sometimes too much unstructured time spent broken up into groups.",
    "The main strengths were: depth of teaching, dedication of professor, engaging class structure.\r\nThere weren't many apparent weaknesses.",
    "This course had a fantastic balance in what was expected of students. I never felt stressed or overwhelmed about the assignments or presentations. At the same time, however, I always felt engaged. The flexibility\/changing of the syllabus throughout the semester showed that Luca was able to go with the flow of the class and assign tasks\/papers accordingly. This class balanced assignments better than any other class I've had in my two years at Yale. The screenings were a little difficult to always show up to (although I did manage to show up to most), but the use of WHC and 212 York was very much appreciated! The presence of native Italian speakers was, at the very beginning, extremely daunting. However it ended up being very valuable by the end in forcing me to engage in discussion. Luca definitely facilitated the class so that everyone could participate and he spoke at a pace and level that was very accessible to all levels.",
    "The presentation of material was extremely thorough and engaging, and the setup of having a lecture and a seminar every week helped with both speaking and comprehending Italian. Having both native Italians and non-native learners made the discussions a little bit unbalanced, but this could be helped by informing students of planned questions to discuss in advance of the class.",
    "This was a very enjoyable class. I liked the structure of the class: one day of lecture and one day of discussion. There were weekly viewings, but it was convenient that the movies were often available online.",
    "I found the course overall very strong.",
    "Strengths: great for language speaking skills and knowledge of Italian cinema through the ages, fun and engaging class\r\nWeaknesses: more guiding questions for films"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to all students who are considering taking an L5 Italian course. I found Luca very welcoming to students of all levels of English.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely. It is a wonderful L5 between grammar and literature. It is very cool to have a class completely conducted in Italian.",
    "Yes",
    "I definitely would. It allowed me to develop my skills in Italian, and to learn about the most important movements of cinema.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course should it be taught again!! It's a generally low-stress but enjoyable insight into an enjoyable (but very important) aspect of Italian culture. Even if Italian cinema post-WWII isn't your raison d'tre, this course is still worth taking if you're interested in Italy in any way or if you want to keep up with learning the language! It won't be overwhelming, there is a ton of flexibility and, for a STEM major, a very welcoming, different class than anything else I was taking.",
    "Yes, this class was sometimes challenging because of the language component, but the material was interesting and the work was very doable. I learned a lot about Italian culture in general.",
    "Absolutely! The Professor is really good at adapting to your English level and will only judge you based on your own progress and commitment to the course. If you are at all interested in film and\/or Italy, you should take a class with Luca.",
    "Yes, would definitely recommend for as it's fun and engaging. Great place to practice language skills!"
