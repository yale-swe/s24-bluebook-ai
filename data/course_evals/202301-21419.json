I think the course needs just a bit better time management within class discussions.",
                "Good content and interesting topics\r\n\r\nI think there were no true flaws",
                "weaknesses:\r\non a whole, the seminars were quite boring, and only the glee people seemed enthusiastic, but only when it was about the musical parts of the text.  there are only ever about two medieval era courses offered a semester, which is a requirement for the English major to graduate. which many majors already don't think there should be a medieval requirement. or at least diversify and add more classes. there was nothing really in content that I haven't already gotten from english foundational courses. \r\n\r\nthe essay prompts were not prompts. they were \"suggestions\" like \"what does medieval lyric say about lyric? about song? about rhythm? about repetition? about women? about Mary?\" just super amorphous and not very helpful. and then the feedback on the essay felt like she had expected a more pinpointed argument when she hadn't given us a pinpointed area of focus.\r\n\r\nwe'd spend all of class saying nothing about the songlines. just translating them and reading them aloud. not adding anything of note to them or our understanding of them. it felt very pointless and two other students I talked to also had no idea what we were supposed to be doing or why it mattered. \r\n\r\nstrengths:\r\ndespite all this, it was not hard at all to pass the class with a good grade. you don't have to devote a lot of time to it at all. you'll be fine. you just won't be engaged in the material and around holidays/the end of class, if you are still attending it in person? you'll be part of the minority. a couple of times there was truly just a handful of us.\r\n\r\ni think the only thing specific to this class was middle english and manuscripts coming up in non-english major class that I was able to give more context on, and then being able to go into the Beinecke and touch some really manuscripts, prayer books, and scrolls. \r\n\r\ni'd maybe read the poems/songlines that were assigned for the day once through an hour before the class and that would be more than enough to get through the class and be thanked for participation. i did maybe one or two of the additional readings and that was enough to draw on for the essays."

                "hello english majors and weird strains of theater and/or music majors. if you're an English major and this is one of the 1-2 medieval courses offered this semester, go ahead and take it. you'll be very bored and complain to your other english major friends about how you have no idea what this course is supposed to accomplish, but you'll pass it and be fine. \r\n\r\nto the theater and/or music people, idk if this is your jam or whatever, go ahead and enjoy your niche? I'm sure you have other options that will be more engaging. if not, the previous english major message applies.",
                "No. This course strongly focuses on lyricization of poetic Middle English texts, which is to my understanding, taking them at face value and removing them from their original contexts, but the class would have benefitted from more lecture-style sessions in which we learn how to conceive of religion, culture, and language in England at the time these texts were written. I came into this course with interests in linguistics and music and this course was not well-developed in either of these areas. I was disappointed that there was not any instruction on pronunciation of Middle English, and as a result when we read poetry out loud it involved a lot of guesswork. Prof. Butterfield provided modern glosses for difficult Middle English words, but we never learned about Middle Englishs grammatical differences that are so important in parsing the unfamiliar poetry that we read. The musical aspect of this course was extremely minimal - twice we attempted to read from (rather difficult) sheet music which was fun for some of the class but impossible for others. If you do not understand basic Christian imagery you will also struggle."
