    "Anthropological theory, and this class in particular, offers a rare chance to think through and about culture. I learned the incomplete nature of most academic work, and the woes of all post modernist approaches to theory.",
    "I learned some of the canon in Western Anthropology. I also learned how to write short papers concisely and very quickly.",
    "That by studying other culture and eventually our own social construct, we have gained insights on our shortcomings; and with that our society reflects and transforms.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as objectivity in culture under the guise of power and biases.",
    "I learnt so much about anthropology: its academic nature, its history, its schools of thought, its canon etc.\r\nAnd it's a good basis in anthro for anyone who wants to draw from the discipline in their work that is non-anthropological!"

   "comments": [
    "This class was truly perfect. The readings were on point, the instructor was top-class, and the classmates truly engaged.",
    "I think this course was promising in its teaching of major western anthropologists. It could be improved if we actually really dove into the readings -- we often pushed the readings  to the side after the first 20 minutes or so of class, and instead talked more broadly about what anthropology means and how to do it. It didn't feel grounded in any real text, often.",
    "Strengths: Fantastic instructor; reading that was largely doable and not overwhelming; a small number of students from different academic and personal backgrounds; chronological order of the writing; the papers were short but that also forced us to develop rigid arguments!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Would have been nice to read primary sources AND their critiques. Sometimes taking these texts at face-value was dangerous. Nonetheless, I enjoyed that we as a class became responsible for critiquing."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! BUT Dr. von Baeyer is leaving Yale so I can't be sure of anything. But if the syllabus doesn't change a lot, it is worth to look into it.",
    "It really depends who is teaching it and what the syllabus is.",
    "Yes, the knowledge from anthropology has expanded my worldview to be more inclusive to the Others. In addition, the course materials as well as class discussion had strengthen my understanding over some of the key thoughts in the last century.",
    "This should be useful to anyone considering anthropology. If you take it early enough in your undergrad career, it might even dissuade you from doing the discipline - which isn't a bad thing but instead proof of how well the class was arranged to think critically about anthropology."
