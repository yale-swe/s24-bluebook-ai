They're all great reads, and even if you don't love them, she's so excited about them that it makes them exciting. Great discussions: Roffman knows how to lead a discussion, and even when you don't know what you're trying to say, she'll figure out what you're trying to say and say it better and make it profound. Awesome, individualized assignments: The big research project for this class is endlessly flexible, so you can really make it your own. \r\nWeaknesses: None.",

                "Yes. Without hesitation, I would take any class that Karin Roffman teaches. This class in particular is no exception. It demands a lot of reading and a lot of research effort, but all of the books were fascinating reads and led to great discussions, and the research project can be personalized into really any form. If you love poetry and/or biography, this is an especially great class for you.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in writing at all this course will make you a better writer.",
                "Yes!!",
                "Absolutely. This class was transformative and essential, but it was also really fun to take. I enjoyed every single one of the books we read, and we were given a lot of creative latitude in the assignments.",
                "Yes 100%- one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I had never thought about the biographical genre before this class and now I think about it all the time. All of the book were great and read in sequence you really get a sense of possibility for all the ways in which you can talk about another person's life. Most of them are unconventional biographies, so not boring at all. Professor Roffman is great and facilitates a really wonderful intellectual environment / conversation in class."
