This is one of the few courses that lives up to its title because you literally learn about everything in the domain of comparative constitutional law.",

                "Professor Calabresi is one of the most wonderful professors I have ever encountered. Calabresi is extremely knowledgeable in the field of law and provides an incredible insight as to the academic dialogue surrounding key issues. He is the strength of this class. The reading material is not overbearing, however, Calabresi's casebook provides so much substance that you walk away feeling like you have learned the material of three classes combined. There are no weaknesses to this class. Calabresi is open to the opinions of students and always differentiates between his personal philosophy and facts, which is super helpful.",
                "Overall, fantastic course. Prof. Calabresi is very knowledgeable and happy to talk with students outside of class. Perhaps the course tries covering a bit too much materials sometimes, to the point where certain interesting topics feel a bit rushed.",
                "I think the main strengths of this course are Professor Calabresi's incredible wealth of knowledge on the topic. Since he wrote the textbook we use, he is able to go very in-depth into all of the concepts and cases we talk about. I also think this class is unique in that it's comparative in nature. A lot of the law classes at Yale are very US-centric, and while US cases probably take up 60% of the class, the other 40% is spent talking about cases in a whole host of other countries. I think one improvement could be to spend less time on Professor Calabresi's presentations during lectures (since they mostly go over the readings), and spend more time on discussion.",
                "This course exposed students to constitutions and constitutional case law from other democracies, which we compared against the U.S. Constitution and several Supreme Court cases since the founding. At the end of the semester, I had a broader understanding of Constitutional law in both the United States and several G-20 democracies.",
                "Professor Calabresi did a good job of keeping seminars busy over zoom in the sense that there was no awkward silence. He would cold call students which helped drive conversation and also have his own interpretations in addition to provided slides with background information on the topic.",
                "Strengths: class discussions were very interesting, readings were useful for understanding material, and Professor Calabresi did a great job of summarizing lengthy and complex readings in class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: nothing that I can think of! It was a great class",
                "The lecture component is super interesting and useful!",
                "Professor Calabresi is engaged with his students and facilitates a lively debate in class. He covers a lot of legal issues in many countries, so the course can only go into so much depth on each, but you get a great breadth of information."

                "Overall, seminars do not work as well virtually as they do in person. But I think Prof. Calabresi did a good job balancing his lecturing and trying to involve students.

                "The seminar could be long and exhausting because it was over zoom, but Professor Calabresi included slides in the beginning of each seminar to help provide further background information and as a base on which to jump off of for discussion. He also cold called students to keep the discussion moving instead of letting awkward silence sit over zoom.",
                "Online learning worked well this semester in this course, and we were able to have very informative discussions as a group together despite the virtual format. It felt a lot like a normal seminar, so I have only positive things to say about the class!"

What an incredible opportunity to learn from such a knowledgeable individual who truly cares about his students and the class. It is rare that someone of Calabresi's stature is so humble, yet insightful in his classes. Even though the class was only once a week, I have learned so much in the topic of constitutional law, and I could not recommend this class enough.",

The papers are manageable, but they do take a fair amount of time to research and write. Overall, I enjoyed the class a lot. If you're considering law school, I think it's worth taking.",

Although the class does have a decently heavy. workload (lots of readings on a weekly basis), it is very informative, interesting, and worth taking if you are interested in law.",
