   "comments": [
    "I gained more conversational skills, increased my fluidity, and grew my knowledge of Deaf culture and identity.",
    "Level 3 grammar and story telling skills",
    "I thought I was going to learn much more applicable and helpful conversational ASL skills but instead we focused on irrelevant things like describing car crashes and being on horses. Didn't learn much more from L2.",
    "Classifier types, how to talk about horse incidents, bicycle incidents, explain card games, and talk about ASL 'literature'",
    "We learned a lot about ASL literature and storytelling and tactics within it - like such as role shifting and personification. We also improved our vocabulary and fluency, and worked on specific skills like directional agreement verbs and register-switching. Additionally we learned a lot about how to discuss history and biographies.",
    "This course helped to refine my ASL skills. The class offered lots of opportunities for practicing the skills I already had, as well as adding some background and new abilities with storytelling. I would say the takeaways for this class were minimal, but I am not sure if that is just par for the course for upper level language classes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some strengths are the good structure, organization, and ample opportunities for practice in assignments and projects. Weakness is the limited in-class discussion.",
    "The weakness was the over reactive emotional affect of the professor",
    "The content covered in this course deepened my understanding of ASL, however the professor was not very communicative or engaging.",
    "It was graded very ambiguously and no student feedback was incorporated to improve our learning. When Professor Tanner taught ASL, it was one of my favorite courses, but this semester made it miserable to go to class everyday.",
    "One of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. The subject matter was boring and irrelevant, with very little real world application, and was essentially taught straight out of the text book. Course relied almost entirely on just repeating things the professor signed and wrote on the board or from textbook videos.  Very little emphasis on generating sign ourselves or practicing conversation or any other skills that might actually be helpful outside of a classroom context. Could be improved with more engaging\/interesting\/useful topics and projects and, more importantly, a better professor.",
    "Strengths: n\/a\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was little to no clear feedback. We never received tests back, and there were no opportunities to understand how we could improve in the future on assignments. We were discouraged from engaging with the instructor, who valued his time very much, and made that very clear. As a whole, our class was made very uncomfortable by the instructor. The course was not well organized, and activities were often confusing and did not prepare us for upcoming tests. The course did not give us valuable information.",
    "Strength: Mikey posts a lot online - video lectures for every class! \r\nWeakness: you can't really take notes during class.",
    "The course required multiple expensive investments (textbook, goReact, True Way) that were entirely uneccessary (other than maybe GoReact) and made me very uncertain about taking the class.",
    "The main strength of the course is its organization. It was easy to follow the syllabus to keep up during the semester and classes followed a predictable pattern. The main weakness is the uncomfortable class atmosphere created by the instructor. Unless you are a fan of fits of anger and a lack of empathy towards students, the class will feel very hostile and not conducive to learning."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if ASL is something they want to learn",
    "I would recommend the language but not this specific course.",
    "No.",
    "No never.",
    "Absolutely not. The class was boring, unproductive, and frustrating. I've loved taking ASL for the past two semesters but this class made me hate it. This class singlehandedly made me go from being enamored with ASL to counting down the days until the end of the semester. Unless you have to take this class for language credit, don't do it.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this course to another student out of respect for their time, well-being, and general health. This course was an unfortunate occurrence in my academic career. While the course was previously taught by Jessica Tanner (the reason the course was previously rated a perfect 5 stars), the new instructor (Mikey Barrett) has a very different style (the reason that the course now has a much lower rating). His style included ostracizing students by selectively choosing who to engage with in a classroom setting, creating difficult and unattainable learning targets, refusing to alter teaching style to meet requests from students with registered disabilities, and creating a generally uncomfortable environment for the classroom. The ways that he engaged with students showed a clear lack of respect. If this course was taught by a different instructor, I would highly recommend because the language itself is incredible to learn and rich with history. However, if Mikey Barrett is the professor teaching this course, I do not recommend it.",
    "I hate having to say this because I am a huge fan of the ASL program at Yale and want it to blossom, but from my experience in this course I would only recommend it to those who need to take it for their language requirement because it was just wholly unpleasant."
