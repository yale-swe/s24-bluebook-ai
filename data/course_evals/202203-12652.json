Through discussions in class and reading responses, I was able to learn to better understand the texts with my classmates.",

                "The main strength was Professor Wilford! She is an excellent teacher, and I feel very fortunate to have taken a class with her. The material in the class is very interesting, and it is great to engage with famous texts by Plato and Aristotle in such a nuanced and in-depth way. One weakness I can think of is that the format of and assignments for each class were consistent throughout the semester, and it would be nice to have a different assignment in class (i.e in-class debate) once or twice. The only other weakness I would mention is not really a fault of the teacher or the design of the course, but there were a few students who tended to take up a large majority of class discussions with points that werent always to the benefit of the entire class. Professor Wilford was aware of this though, which I appreciated, and she made more efforts towards the second half of the semester to get everyone to contribute.",
                "This class focuses a lot on small pieces of text. Because the reading was excessive if you stay on top of it, it allows you to spend more time understanding and interacting with the reading. Since it is a seminar based class, there can be a few students who dominate conversation. Also occasionally these heavy participators will call on outside knowledge that isn't necessarily common knowledge and would require other students to have engaged heavily in philosophy prior to the class which can make it intimidating to speak.",
                "This course was very interesting and engaging. There was ample time to discuss and ask questions about the readings. However, if someone were to not do the readings and were lost, it would be up to them to seek help in class or in office hours.",
                "I think a strength of the course was that each class's reading assignment wasn't very long, so we were able to closely analyze and discuss each passage without needing to rush. I think a weakness of the course was that our class felt a little bit big, so we would need to pull up extra chairs to fit everyone and there was always more people wanting to participate than there was time."

I was under the impression the class at first would be more about classics\/ancient history, so I didn't enjoy it as much, but the political philosophy was also new and interesting, and many of my classmates were certainly very interested in the topic."
