                "I learned about how shape, color, composition, visual hierarchy, and typography work together to visually communicate your design goals. Although you learn some indesign, I thought the most valuable parts of this course was the non-indesign projects, as it forced me to be very intentional about everything I did.",
                "I learned how to reframe my thinking and mediate visual messages throughout the duration of this course. Precision and universality were both incredibly important concepts about which I developed a deeper understanding in the context of design.",
                "By taking ART 132 (Intro to Graphic Design), I gained an incredible amount of skills to use for future design projects. The course taught me to think in a different manner and visualize the world around me through a more design-centered approach to achieve effective messages and design presentations. From learning technical skills in InDesign to developing personal styles through class critiques and discussions for visual thinking, I really enjoyed the course in its ability to teach me skills that I would not be able to develop anywhere else.",
                "Understand how to critique and observe design. Learning Indesign, some copy techniques, bookbinding, and in general, just learning about how to iterate on your own creativity.",

                "strengths: yeju is fantastic, gives honest and very helpful feedback\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the tuesday to thursday turnaround time was very short and sometimes stressful, very high workload, learning curve with adobe software",
                "Strengths: constant and clear feedback, visible growth, Yeju is INCREDIBLE, gained a lot of knowledge and food for thought \r\nWeaknesses: a lot of work, needing to print all the time, a project due every class",
                "You are taught how to see things and how to translate feelings into a visual vocabulary. I sometimes wish there was more time in class to learn about the professor's work and their reasoning for their design decisions, or to gain more exposure to designers and collectives.",
                "There is almost no in-class instruction on digital design tools in this course. While learning by doing is incredibly important, it is inequitable to expect students to have a foundational knowledge of the major platforms we use throughout the course (InDesign, PhotoShop) when some will have to struggle greatly without that established foundation. Also, establishing more direction at the beginning of the course for the full class crits would have been helpful to allow students to get the most out of the sessions.",
                "The course is really well structured in its ability to learn from your peers' design projects and gain insight into your own design practice to become a better designer. I really enjoyed the course in that it really only had strengths because it allowed me to challenge myself in ways I have never done before. I would say there are no weaknesses in this course!",
                "Amazingly structured, very well organized. Very engaging and supporting in personal growth.",
                "This class is amazing, everything is a strength. The group crits, the projects, the assigned readings and videos, and of course looking at Yeju's work are all lovely. The workload, especially the Tuesday to Thursday turnaround, is (mostly) manageable, but I think the class might benefit from being structured so that new assignments are due on Tuesdays and their revisions are due on the following Thursdays.",
                "Yeju Choi was an amazing professor and such a cool person to learn from. I also thought our assignments were fun. I would say that sometimes the deadlines were a bit stressful and information is solely through email or paper not canvas, which could be hard. But overall enjoyed course.",
                "S: Very fun and engaging, lots of hands on work.\r\nW: Time consuming",
                "doing peer critique every class did get a little monotonous--maybe break it up with some other activities. I wish we had more guided instruction with the tools we were using (InDesign). otherwise great class with difficult but interesting projects"

                "yes, if you are prepared to put in lots of work for it",
                "Yes because you learn about the basics of design but also how to see what design is, where it is, and how it is effective. If you are willing to put in the work, you will get a lot out of this course.",
                "Yes!!!",
                "Yes, but only if you are willing to put in the work every day to improve. You can't get by the entire course if you do the bare minimum, and you don't feel proud of yourself, especially when your peers put up their work next to yours. If you have the time to focus on the course, then it is definitely worth it. I feel like I grew a lot as a person and as a designer in this course.",
                "Absolutely! This course is a wonderful class to take in order to learn about how messages in our world are carefully designed and executed to flawlessly enter our consciousness and unconsciousness. Professor Yeju, through this course, has taught me so much that I really recommend that every student take this course to discover the world of visual thinking because it has truly changed the way I approach everything I see.",
                "Yes totally, only if you are actually interested in graphic design and ready to invest a lot of time in this course.",
                "Absolutely. This is a sublime class. Id say there are a few things that make a good class. Is it engaging? Do you gain new perspective on the world? Do you make friends in the class? Do you gain a new skill? Do you feel like you walk away with something? Graphic Design with Yeju is yes to every one of these questions. Every assignment is fun and challenging and you can clearly understand the purpose behind each one and how it forwards your own creative thinking. If youre looking through the reviews right now wondering if you should take this class, just do it.",
                "I definitely would. Yeju is AMAZING, and you'll learn so much.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes! Very great class.",
                "It's a grind--you have to work and rework the same project while taking criticism on it--but it's worth it if you try on the projects and come up with ideas you like."
