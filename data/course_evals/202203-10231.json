I learned that playwriting differs dramatically from writing for the screen because of the physical limitations and considerations of the stage. I (hopefully) learned to leave plot details in the subtext rather than explaining my plot to the audience through dialogue.",

                "This course has a surprisingly high reading load for a creative writing class. The workshops were sometimes useful, but often circular. However, I believe the three hour class time was simply too long; I think two 1.5 hour classes a week would lead to more engagement throughout each session. A strength of this course is the opportunity to gain feedback on our writing. Another strength was that Margulies makes himself very available during office hours.",
                "I really enjoyed the class discussions and workshopping we did, although I do think I would have benefitted from a more structured approach to teaching us how to write our plays. I think some class time spent on how to outline a longer play and exercises focusing on specific aspects of writing like dialogue, split scenes, subtext, etc. would have made the process of writing the final play feel more manageable."

                "Yes! It's a great introductory playwriting class. Professor Margulies is a joy to learn from and he exposes you to wonderful plays from a variety of playwrights. The weekly assignments are fun and the workshop environment is so helpful.",
                "Yes! This is my favorite class I've taken at Yale so far.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Margulies is an incredible resource and a great mentor. He will push you to write to the best of your abilities. That being said, you very much get out of this course what you put into it. If you don't go to office hours consistently and work on your play on your own time, your experience will be greatly diminished. Given the amount of reading and writing which this course necessitates, I caution against taking this course in a five-credit semester.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. You'll get to read a lot great plays and Professor Margulies is really good at teaching them. The class is a fair bit of work but if you're up for that definitely do it.",
                "I would recommend this class to a first time playwright hoping to gain exposure to dramatic writing. Truthfully, I did not find the workshops that useful and found them occasionally frustratingly repetitive or too gentle. I also felt that Margulies allowed the class to offer far more feedback than he himself offered.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in playwriting. I came in with no playwriting experience except a desire to learn, and I found it to be a great environment to explore in and a pretty strong introductory course, although it did at times feel slightly more catered towards students with considerable creative writing experience. The workload can be a bit heavy though, especially when you have a writing exercise or play pages due on the same day as several play readings."
