   "comments": [
    "It's absolutely crazy how much I've learned about hematological diseases and cancers from this course. This course definitely teaches you to think outside the lines and it challenges you to design experiments and then write about them.",
    "How to read and analyze scientific papers, write a grant proposal, and design valid research experiments. The mechanisms of normal and abnormal hematopoiesis.",
    "This course was very work intensive and required that students do a lot of heavy lifting to fully understand the class material. The course is taught in a way that approaches disease from biological levels that are far beyond an AP biology curriculum. This class taught me so much, moved incredibly fast, and was an experience that I am very grateful for. This class helped with my scientific writing, experiment designing, and comprehension of scientific articles.",
    "I learned how to really challenge myself and how to read primary scientific journals. I also learned how to write a grant proposal.",
    "The molecular basis of a variety of hematological disorders as well as how to write a research grant.",
    "To think about biochemical problems and assess clinical situations. This class also developed my biological intuitions and gave me the skills and knowledge to tackle current problems in the areas we discussed. Some topics were invaluable to the progress of my research project.",
    "I learned a great deal about a variety of hematological disorders during this course.  I also learned to effectively read scientific research papers and medical papers, as well as learning how to write a grant proposal of my own.",
    "How to write a grant and analyze scientific literature",
    "Working in groups, asking questions in class, reading papers effectively and time management",
    "- Reading and analyzing scientific publications\r\n- Writing grant proposals",
    "You learn how to read scientific papers. I think that's pretty much the course."

   "comments": [
    "The greatest thing about this course is Dean Chang as a professor. He cares so much for his students and about his lectures. The only weakness about this course was that the in class review sessions for upcoming exams didn't cover very much.",
    "Strengths: workload is manageable, especially if you collaborate. Professors are accessible and good lecturers. There is plenty of time to complete psets. Content is relevant and interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class jumps right into content, so if you don't have a strong background in bio, chem, and research you may need to do some catching up on topics and techniques.",
    "This course was really engaging and challenging. The lectures were taught really well and were always engaging. I liked how we were always able to ask questions and reinforce our learnings with the psets.",
    "The course was primarily lecture based followed with problem sets related to the disease that was lecture about that week of class. I don't find anything particularly strong or weak of the course that could be improved.",
    "The course is excellent. Allowing us to have such close contact with two professors with such experience in their areas was enriching. The challenging settings that the professors created for us were stimulating and pushed everyone in the class to excel. The only negative aspect of the course is that sometimes the professors were not as accessible as would be expected for a course of this density taught to first-years. However, this is the price to pay to have people of this caliber teaching us, so its not even bad in that sense.",
    "A strength of the course is that the professors are very skilled in the topics taught during the course and are very capable of breaking down and explaining difficult concepts.  The weakness of the course is that the concepts can be difficult to grasp since most students do not have a background in the material.",
    "Tests didnt test the skills that we learned, instead tested concepts that will likely be forgotten in the months following the course. If this class is taught again, perhaps it would be valuable to consider providing NEW papers on test day, and testing students on analysis of said paper.",
    "PSETs were really helpful in getting accustomed to college",
    "Its difficult to have psets due on Monday and have office hours that are not set in stone. Having two teachers also added variability to grades and assignments which makes it unfair to some students who are graded by different standards"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you want to be challenged. If you're looking for an easy A, this is not it. This class forces you to work hard and it challenges you to think like a scientist or doctor.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in heme disorders and the mechanisms behind clonal diseases. I would also recommend this class to students who plan on doing research and writing grant proposals in the future.",
    "I would recommend this class, if you truly care about molecular medicine\/biology\/medicine in general. The course material is extremely difficult, unless you have a deep understanding of the biological processes that keep us alive and the ways that disease works on a molecular level and the different ways of attacking a disease. It is a highly complex course, but everyone in the class bonds over it, because truly no one understands the material fully. It is quite an experience and I would recommend, if you are devoted and want to be doing problem sets for a first year seminar.",
    "Yes, I definitely would. This is a pretty challenging course, but I think it was really rewarding. I remember the first lecture being so hard, and I was scared that I wouldn't be able to understand anything in this course. But, towards the end, I actually was able to write a grant proposal and really understand the scientific journals we read. This course really changed the way I think, and helped me become a better scientist overall.",
    "If you feel like you have the sufficient preparation and would like to be challenged, yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.  Even though it it much tougher than most first year classes, it's taught in a very unique manner and gives an interesting introduction into scientific writing and research.",
    "Absolutely. Learned a ton. Prob not the best for premeds trying to keep up that GPA but incredibly valuable regardless",
    "Yes but be prepared to be challenged and criticized by someone in a very straightforward way.",
    "Yes",
    "If you're up for a really heavy workload, then sure you can gain a lot of experience reading scientific papers."
