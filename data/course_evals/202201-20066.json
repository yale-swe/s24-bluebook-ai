                "The course went over a lot of interesting content, and I received a lot of direct, precise comments on my writing and ideas. The amount of collaboration between students for giving and receiving feedback was definitely a big strength of the course, as were the topics of each class. The most valuable insight strength of the course was the guidance on research proposals! Eduardo has a LOT of experience helping students with research proposals, and it was very evident in the way he structured the meetings. \r\nThe material got a bit weird near the end of the semester, almost every paper we read was written or cowritten by the professor about his study system, so the class kinda became a preparatory seminar for students working with him over the summer (about half the class). The \"seminar\" portion of lectures also often didn't work very well, with the professor taking up most of the conversation. I feel like this course could be improved upon by adding a diversity of readings and authors, plus more dedicated time for students to talk and collaborate.",
                "I liked the combined lecture and discussion format. The course was extremely personal and Eduardo and David got to know each of us very personally, down to our learning styles. I thought the assignments were very thoughtful and well-spaced."

                "Yes because I learned so much about the study design which was very helpful for someone who hasnt had experience",
                "Yes if they are interested in studying animal behavior.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student actively planning to design a behavioral study at some point in their college experience - for their thesis, for a summer project, etc.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Eduardo is a fabulous teacher, and taking this class is the best way to learn about study design at Yale. Being interested in behavior is a huge plus, but Eduardo will also help you develop the tools to critique any kind of scientific study and will tailor the class to suit your needs and interests."
