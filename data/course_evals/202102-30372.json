                "I learned how to identify, classify, conserve, and manage wetlands. Our readings were a really nice blend of content-based textbook readings and scientific articles, so we received good practice in reading professional publications. Our \"Wetland in the News\" presentations, in which each student would choose a news article about wetlands and present to the class, also provided a chance to apply what we learned to newsworthy discussions about the science of climate change, climate governance, and new conservation strategies.",
                "I learned a great deal about how wetlands form, function, resist changes, and help humans.",
                "I have a great working knowledge of wetlands and their environmental and cultural importance now. I learned so much in this course.",
                "understanding of wetland classification and the ways wetlands are important to our ecosystem and human health\r\nhow to read scientific papers on wetlands and glean the most important information",
                "How to delineate wetlands, restoration policies, current news surrounding wetlands",
                "I learned SO much about wetlands and the complex ways they affect our environment and society. They are such a crucial part of our ecosystem and something I definitely did not know enough about before.",
                "I learned so much about all the different types of wetlands, their different classifications, the flora and fauna life that resides in each type, policies in each state (also federally and even some global policies) that govern wetlands, the scientific processes that govern them, etc. I feel confident in delineating a wetland and would also feel comfortable advising people on how they should treat wetlands based on my newfound knowledge.",
                "I learned a lot about wetlands, how to conserve them, why we should conserve them, and what methods people are already using to conserve them right now. I also learned about the history of wetlands and wetland conservation in the USA. I developed presentation-making and presenting skills, and gained insight into what makes wetlands so unique.",
                "I developed an understanding of how to delineate wetlands, what is included in wetland ecosystem services, how wetlands are formed, and why it is important to protect wetlands.",
                "I learned so much about wetlands and their importance during this course! I went into the course knowing absolutely nothing, and I now am seriously considering majoring in Environmental Studies. We learned some technical information, such as how to delineate a wetland, as well as critical topics such as the impacts of climate change and how issues such as racism play into environmental justice."

            "comments": [
                "I thought the course was a perfect summer course: Professor Freidenburg did a great job of mixing up each class with her PowerPoints, student presentations, small group work, and a guest lecture. The readings were interesting, relevant, and very reasonable in length. The assignments were varied (problem sets, a presentation, and a final exam) and spread out so that you could build toward your grade over the five weeks. I can't think of any weaknesses!",
                "The class-wide discussion of the papers and the concepts covered during lecture was the biggest strength of this class. It allowed me to engage with the material and develop my own ideas about it.",
                "I loved the wetlands in the news portion of the class-- they helped me contextualize the course material. One weakness of the course would be the problem sets: the questions were quite vague, and the feedback was not helpful at times. Also, the exam was very long given the time frame.",
                "strengths - wetlands in the news was very informative, powerpoints were useful in prepping for the exam\r\nweaknesses - there were not study sessions or group times to work on psets or ask questions to prof as a group",
                "Strengths is def the prof she's really kind and knows a lot about wetlands!! Also the class presentations were really cool.",
                "Strengths: engaging material, reasonable workload, lots of help from professor and TA when necessary\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes a little slow, wetlands in the news presentations take up a lot of time so there is less time to talk about readings",
                "The individual presentations were really neat because it allowed me to learn even more than what we learned that was on the syllabus. Everything was very interesting.",
                "A strength of this course is that is covers everything you would want to know about wetlands - what they are, why they are important, and how we can protect/restore them. A weakness of this course is that some of the papers - specifically the wetland soil papers - are a little bit difficult to read as they are full of scientific jargon.",
                "Strengths of the course: professor is SO nice, readings were very interesting and relevant, every student got to present on a wetlands topic of their choice. Weaknesses: course was online for 2 hours three times a week (of course, this was because it was a summer course during Covid-19), exam was much more difficult than anticipated"

                "Yes! It was a great science credit for someone who enjoys the content and learning more about the environment but is a non-STEM major. We discussed some biochemistry in soils, but it was very approachable and just enough to feel like I really learned something new. This is an especially good course for people who enjoy reading scientific articles even if not personally interested in pursuing scientific research.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially when it is in person and students get to go on field trips. This course was super interesting and I learned a lot of very niche facts and concepts.",
                "As a humanities student I have struggled to find science credits to my liking. To a fellow humanities student looking for a science credit I would recommend the class, as it combined a good level of reasonably in-depth scientific learning with questions of law and politics.",
                "Yes! Definitely if you plan on studying environmental science or have an interest in conservation",
                "Yes, especially if you're not really a science person. I think it's a cool way to learn about something that's really important",
                "YES! It is a great science credit, Professor Freidenburg is great, and the material is interesting.",
                "If you need a science credit, this course is doable, be sure to form some sort of study group however, it will make it easier to work though and understand all of the readings.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this class. It was more focused on the social aspect of wetlands instead of focusing solely on the scientific side, but it did teach a lot about the science and so overall ended up being a good mixture.",
                "I absolutely would! The instructor and TA were fantastic, the material was in-depth and well-organized, and I came out of the course with a deep appreciation for and fascination with wetlands. No matter your major, you can get something out of this course. And with the acceleration of climate change, I highly recommend everyone to take a course related to ecology sometime in their college career.",
                "If the student is interested in learning about wetlands, I would definitely recommend this course! Although it is a niche topic, it is a very interesting course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. The workload was manageable and interesting, the professor was great, and the subject matter is much more interesting than it even sounds! I now am a wetlands enthusiast."
