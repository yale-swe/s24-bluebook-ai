   "comments": [
    "Ive been learning to think more thoroughly through math problems. Usually I get Stuck when the answer or the method isnt obvious. Im learning to work through that.",
    "I received a good amount of knowledge on single variable calculus. Learning everything from what a function is, to how to use chain rule, and everything in between.",
    "By taking this course, I gained a skill set that will help me in a plethora of stem classes that I will take here at Yale. Despite getting through AP Calculus, my school had a somewhat mediocre math program and so math has never been my strongest subject. However, after taking this course, I am much more confident in my skills!",
    "By taking this course I better understood the calculus course and the real world applications that it has.",
    "Very helpful course, as I came into it not having an pre-calculus or calculus knowledge. I learned a lot.",
    "I had previously taken Calculus but this course was a very helpful reminder of all subjects so far.",
    "How to think",
    "I learned half of calculus and I learned problem solving and critical thinking",
    "I developed my problem solving skills and learned new concepts.  I",
    "This really helped me work on my algebra\/preCalc skills, and furthered my understanding of derivatives.",
    "Built a stronger precalc base for calculus.",
    "I was able to gain a steady introduction to calculus through first reviewing functions and algebraic skills.",

   "comments": [
    "the strength is the professor. Professor Hall is a great teacher and really explains concepts so that I could understand. \r\n\r\nweakness is that the problem sets were difficult and I did not like the textbook we used.",
    "The course does well in proving why certain math techniques are used, making the intermixing of math concepts easier because you can understand the application more. I think That the transition from using simple numbers and concepts to harder numbers was a little rocky. It seemed like things got more difficult very abruptly.",
    "The material is taught at a good pace. The homework had helpful problems that students benefit heavily from.",
    "I think that a weakness of this course was that we tried to fit too much material in one semester. It would have been nice to have expanded on some of the topics in greater depth.",
    "the course could be improved by doing more practice questions in class.",
    "It would help if it were more interesting, but there's not much someone can do because it is math.",
    "I had John Hall and he was absolutely awesome but I went to a review with the TA and it was not helpful and left after 10 minutes. It would be nice to do more problems in class and not just lecture style.",
    "Tests were hard",
    "I also like how the workshops challenge us to use the concepts in creative ways with the problems being pretty difficult.  This course is better than 112 because even tho it's made for two semesters,  it will give you a deeper understanding of calculus and pre calc and provides you with a good foundation for the rest of your qr courses. Taking this along with microeconomics was a great move because since I had such a deep understanding of the basic math stuff- functions, derivatives, inverses etc I was able to easily apply it in Econ",
    "This course and instructor were well suited to help students become more proficient in mathematics.",
    "Weaknesses are that it sometimes progresses too slowly. Otherwise, I think it's a good course.",
    "This course doesn't have many weaknesses. It moves at a good pace and the professors are great.",
    "I really enjoyed how the course is broken up into two semesters because I feel like it is easier to grasp the concepts when we go more in depth. Also, Professor Hall's teaching style is very engaging and creates a great learning environment.",
    "The course workshops were helpful, but I think there should be more correlation between what we learned in class and what the problem set questions are asking. Sometimes there was a disconnect between the two and we hadn't learned what several of the problem sets were asking."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. I am so happy I was able to take this course and have a solid background in calculus. Math 112 moves too fast and would have been too challenging so I am happy they made this new course.",
    "I definitely would. The amount of explanation and the variation of examples works well no matter your math background. Coming from taking calculus AB in high school and making a 4 on the AP exam, i still learned way more in this class because i knew why things were being done. In high school I just Knew how to do math techniques, but I couldn't Apply them.",
    "Yes. This was a great math course to take my first semester at Yale. It eases the transition into a college level math course. It teaches all of the material in Math 112, but broken up into two semesters. The pace of the material taught was perfect for me. Homework is helpful going into tests.",
    "Yes, very comprehensive review of Calculus that is not offered in MATH 112. Much better course to take if you are not confident in calculus.",
    "I would 110% recommend Dr. Hall! He was definitely one of my favorite professors of the semester. He makes it quite obvious that he cares about your success in the class and is always willing to help.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to a student because it is similar to other calculus courses but goes at a pace that you are able to keep up with.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to anyone who feels like they don't have a very good math background in general. While this course focuses on calculus, there are several algebra concepts that it helps reinforce, which I found to be extremely helpful for some of my other classes. If you've taken calculus before, this course might not be the best fit for you, but I think it really depends on your calculus background and how confident you are that you have a solid foundation. My high school math instruction was based on memorization, so my conceptual of understanding of math was weak before taking this course. Professor Hall is an engaging instructor who never makes you feel bad for asking a question in class. He's super patient with everyone and very approachable. Definitely recommend you take his section.  Also, most of the TAs are great people and extremely helpful, especially Jason. The one drawback was the weekly workshops; sometimes they were helpful, other times they weren't. Maybe altering the frequency of those would be a good idea or reconsidering the material covered. Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a deeper understanding of calculus and wouldn't mind taking the subject for a whole year.",
    "Yes, good for students who didn't take calculus in high school.",
    "Yes it is a good intro to Yale so far and keeps kids involved in math if they hate it.",
    "Yes David was good LA",
    "Yes, especially if you forgot a lot of pre calc stuff. It will give you a good deep foundation of calc. I took calc in high school so it was not difficult for me, but I thought it still learned new things because of the different way we approached certain concepts. I think it is worth the two semesters",
    "Yes.  It was a good introductory math course.",
    "I would recommend it if the student has never taken calculus before.",
    "Yes, I would 100% recommend this course to anyone that has not yet taken Calculus. It is a great way to learn it and apply it to other classes that utilize derivatives, etc.",
    "Yes"
