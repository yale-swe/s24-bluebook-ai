                "This course was incredible! Prof. Zadeh and Lillian really opened my mind to understanding the ways in which knowledge has been categorized and discounted as \"magic\" throughout history. I loved this course!",
                "I learned so much about Religious theory and the occult in this class! It was genuinely the most engaging and exciting class I have had at Yale ever. The essays are wonderful and the sections are amazing.",
                "A wonderful overview of the history of magic and its relationship to religion and science. What started as a history course gradually evolved into something like a course on social theory, especially in the final weeks, which I really valued. I'd spent time in previous courses learning about the history of the science/religion divide, and thinking about how magic also factors into the equation greatly expanded my understanding.",
                "This course was amazing. I learned so much terminology and and gained so much fluency regarding antiquity and occult practices. It also prompted my own thoughts about faith and my experiences/practices with spirituality.",
                "I learned a lot about the what early forms of magic looked like and how the religion/science/magic divide has changed throughout history.",
                "I learned much about the history of the occult in relation to religion, magic, and cultural traditions of people all over the world and throughout many periods of world history. I also gained experience analyzing and talking about academic articles in a group setting, as well as writing about said academic literature."

                "This course thrives on the seminar setting. The discussions with other classmates and the professor/TF really helped me engage with the material and truly understand the concepts being taught. I liked how section was incorporated into class time, but I would have liked to have a little bit more time to talk in the small setting!",
                "No weaknesses, only strengths! The course was well organized for learning and Prof. Zadeh connected the material we learned in class to the present-day and popular culture. I loved it!",
                "There are genuinely no weaknesses to this course. Professor Zadeh and Lillian McCabe were so helpful and engaging. They would edit the course to help us in so many ways. They made it easy to succeed.",
                "The low stakes environment in this course made it so much easier to learn and engage with. Professor Zadeh encouraged us to explore our interests in the midterm and final papers, inviting us to take academic risks in a way that really paid off; I was able to approach content from angles that I'm usually too intimidated to do, and in doing so I engaged much more deeply with the material. Also, I think the structure of a guided lecture/seminar/reading group plus an additional discussion section worked well. In class, Professor Zadeh pointed at key themes in the readings and suggested connections between them, and then in section, we were able to really sink our teeth into the material and feel like we actually knew what we were talking about. That said, I honestly would have liked section to be a bit longer, as it felt we never totally had time to discuss everything we wanted to. But in all, I felt this course was really well structured for student learning and, most importantly, it encouraged us to create academic work we cared about.",
                "All the content was really great so thats a strength. I think the only weakness was never discussing the book and movie reviews as a class. Maybe rather than everyone doing one on their own, we choose two or three to do as a class so we can discuss it. Or we just dedicate more time to share our thoughts about our movie and book reviews.",
                "I thought the course was structured pretty well in general, the readings were really interesting. I think that having the first lecture of each new topic be more lecture like with informational slides about the history could help improve engagement and understanding of how each topic blends together and is connected.",
                "This course was strong in terms of the material being extremely fascinating; I think that a lot of the material is stuff I would read outside of an academic setting, so I was never bored or unmotivated in terms of material. The course was weak in the sense that sometimes the course of a given seminar session was a bit unorganized or, for example, I didn't understand exactly how the slides in the background meshed together or how all of them related to the readings. I think the course could be improved by making the background slides in class more relevant to the readings or explain and emphasize how they are relevant to the readings."

                "YES!!!!! TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN, AND MAKE ROOM TO TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU DON'T HAVE SPACE. The absolute best course I have taken at Yale. The assignments are extremely easy. The discussions are fun and the readings are fun.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this to anyone, whether you're mildly curious about religious studies or you're a senior in the major. I took this class late in my Yale career, but I think that if I'd taken it as a first year, it would have completely changed my academic trajectory.",
                "Absolutely. Youll only learn and grow so much. And the prof and TA are great",
                "I thought this was a pretty interesting course overall so I think I would probably reccomend this course if I knew someone was interested in the topic.",
                "Yes, I think that if you are interested in secret societies, magic, or anything of the occult nature you will find this class interesting. Moreover, it exposed me to a lot of natural philosophy, logic, literature posed by historically eminent religious scholars, and inquiry about things that seem more modern like capitalism and atheism, which was nice because everything tied together well and seemed relevant to the present."
