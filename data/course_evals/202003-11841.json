                "One of the strengths of the course was that each experiment often flowed into the next in some respect so you got a sense of how thorough genetic experimentation might work. \r\n\r\nA weakness was that canvas was vastly underutilized and instead, we received a deluge of emails that were often hard to parse with various bits of crucial course information. A weakness of the course was also a complete lack of transparency in terms of how our grade was determined or calculated. Each lab seemed to be graded on a rubric created post-facto. We also never received any of our quiz grade or worksheet grades back. He also added a quiz after telling us that we had already had our last quiz of the semester. The sum total of these actions is that I truly do not have any idea how I'm doing in the class (especially since he is curving the course despite there only being 15 students).",
                "I liked how course is very structured and streamlined. Although it was confusing at times, performing steps from multiple labs in one class was very efficient. We could have had more time in between when a lab report was assigned and when it was due, because it was often a time crunch. I didn't like the quizzes, particularly because we never received feedback on them so we didn't know what to address in our lab reports.",
                "A strength of the course was its content, the relationship between the lab exercises and subsequent lab reports, and the learning value of the reports themselves, but the later reports take very long because of the need to perform and document recombination analysis, Chi-squared tests, etc.",
                "Super interesting material, great supplement to lecture course material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - TAs were not very accessible for questions\/help with lab reports (which I recognize was partially due to the online format and not being able to see them in person, however a set schedule of office hours should have been set up each week, which did not happen), not exactly a weakness but lab reports took a veryyyy long time, and sometimes random quizzes and lab assignments were announced with very little notice."

The class itself can be quite fun and the experiments are relatively elegant and straightforward. However, the obscure guidelines for written work necessitate a maximalist approach to the lab reports even if you have a clean understanding of the material.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Not only do you gain experience with basic lab techniques, but taking the lab was very helpful in understanding the contents of the lecture course (that's like the opposite of most lecture-lab courses). Although the lab reports were a little long, they helped prepare me for writing actual scientific papers. This class should definitely be worth 1 credit though--you should be prepared to do some work, including pre-labs questions, prepping for quizzes, and the lab reports.",
