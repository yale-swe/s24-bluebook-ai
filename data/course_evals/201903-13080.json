   "comments": [
    "I entered French 140 with a basic understanding of most of the grammatical topics covered, but now I feel like I have a really solid grasp on all the grammar that I have to use to speak and write French with ease. I also just feel that French 140 has improved my ability to speak and understand French immensely.",
    "I developed a lot of skills in reading books in French that I was previously unable to do. I also learned a lot about grammar points and understanding movies in French.",
    "I felt my conversational skills greatly improved and my grammar benefitted from the concise reinforcement built into the class.",
    "Understanding of French grammar, general speaking fluency, exposure to Francophone cultures other than metropolitan France, history of WWII, exposure to French literature and writing styles.",
    "I feel that this course greatly improved my oral and listening skills in French, as well as my knowledge of important grammatical structures and vocabulary. This was my first French class that had a heavy focus on literature, and besides developing my reading skills I also gained a better understanding of French culture and history. Taking this course, I really felt that all my previous French learning had been well worth itthis was a class that put all of it to use and made me feel much more confident in my own abilities.",
    "We learned more advanced French grammar and vocab, and improved listening, speaking, and reading",
    "I developed my French reading, writing, and grammmar.",
    "I improved my French grammar tremendously. I also grew a lot with vocabulary and can now much better speak, understand, write and read in French.",
    "Improved ability to read and comprehend French literature. Improved ability to speak the French language. Better understanding of many French grammar structures."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course does a great job of using texts and media to help explain and intersplice grammar lessons. A few times, our conversation of texts would drag on a bit (but that also probably had to do with minimal level of engagement and preparation).",
    "I thought overall it was a very good course! Potentially I would connect the listening homework to something that was going to be tested on more often.",
    "The course's size is perhaps its greatest strength. We built a community and a good relationship with out professor. The course could be improved by allowing more time to discuss the literature in class.",
    "The audio\/listening modules in the course pack felt extraneous. Grammar integration was efficient with class time and the course packet modules. Tests felt fair and at a good frequency. I liked the integration of stories from Diversite - it was well-paced and I liked reading shorter stories about other cultures. Symphonie Pastorale wasn't a great read; the language was incredibly complicated and I didn't enjoy the story, and it was a lot of work. I thought discussions in class were enjoyable and my teacher moderated well. I liked oral presentations and the depth of what we did discuss!",
    "The strengths of this course are ultimately found in the classroom. Taking the topics and ideas we worked on at home and putting them into practice in class discussions, especially small group work, really made the course. Additionally, the well-thought through organization of the class is apparent from the first day you open the syllabus, and helped ensure that what we were learning made sense. The course is also well integrated with media from films to oral programs that helped to make it more engaging and improved listening comprehension. One weakness of the course was that larger in class discussions could often be dominated by a few voices. A lesser weakness is that the sheer amount of material and activities included in the course packets can initially feel overwhelming for a daily class, though one soon discovers strategies of managing the work.",
    "The readings were interesting for this course and I felt like my reading comprehension improved a lot. I don't feel like my listening comprehension improved as much, but I liked the small classroom environment for speaking purposes -- there was a good balance of talking as a class and speaking with a partner.",
    "This course is strong in the readings selected and the wide breadth of materials and concepts studied. Its weakness is that it sometimes over concerns itself with minute details which detract from greater progress in other areas of language instruction.",
    "Strengths included the readings and daily class discussions about the readings. Weaknesses included the grammar lessons. Most of the grammar explanations came from course packet and were often discussed briefly in class."

   "comments": [
    "Would absolutely recommend this course to anyone trying to bring their French to a level of high proficiency in speaking and writing. For anyone passionate about French, this is a great course.",
    "I would recommend it! I thought my French improved greatly in terms of grammar and reading comprehension. My French speaking did not improve but that was to be expected since it was not a course that focused on oral abilities.",
    "Only if you have the time to put in. It's a deceivingly high amount of work, and if you don't do your work on time, you'll be lost in class discussions and fall behind very easily. The professors are wonderful and the exams aren't extremely difficult - however, I still have no idea what my grades are. I got bored with some of the readings and didn't really connect with some of the other students, but at the end of class I had learned a lot of french and finally got some exposure to the history of colonized francophone countries.",
    "I would fully recommend this course to any student at Yale with enough experience in French, but especially for those who see themselves wanting to continue with or maintain the language. Having a daily, and rather intensive language course is certainly not without its challenges, but I think that for any committed student it is well worth the effort. French 140 is a great example of a course where you will get out what you put into it; though there were certainly times when I dreaded a consecutive workload, all in all French was one of my favorite classes this semester.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are willing to put in a lot of time to do well -- the class does meet every day and has a significant amount of reading. If you want to do well, a lot of extra time\/self-teaching is required.",
    "I would recommend this course if they wish to not lose their french but would not recommend it as a course which will develop their french by a significant amount. Specifically, I would warn students who took AP French that a lot of this course will be revision.",
    "Yes! You will improve your French so much in just one semester. Definitely worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have a strong background in French and you are either looking to fulfull the language distributional requirement or are looking to continue learning French in the future."
