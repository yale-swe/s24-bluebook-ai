                "The small class size (under 10) created an almost seminar-like environment. We were all able to ask questions of the instructor in real time and explain concepts to each other. We got to know each other quickly which helped us form study groups right away  a very important part of math at Yale. \r\nWhile we had each other to lean on, the course had very few peer tutors and peer tutor hours (which were all scheduled for very late at night too). It was disappointing to come to office hours for help with a problem set or to study for an exam and there would be 1 tutor for 30 students. \r\nThis course can be improved dramatically by offering walk-in/by-appointment math tutoring in the Poor-vu Center. It is rare to find a college that does not have a math tutoring center. Why is Yale gatekeeping success, when there are so many students who would be willing to tutor each other and lift each other up? I transferred to Yale for its strong resources and emphasis on collaboration, and I am disappointed in the apparent lack of those values when it comes to mathematics.",
