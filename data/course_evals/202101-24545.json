                "Like the title suggests, you learn about the American death penalty from historical and political perspectives. Specifically, you learn about how the U.S. Supreme Court has regulated (or failed to properly regulate) the death penalty. I learned a lot about an issue I thought I already knew about, which was incredibly rewarding.",
                "I learned how to analyze and read complex works of writing, such as law reviews, studies, and justice opinions. I was able to discuss complex topics relating to the death penalty with my peers, and even debate on the issue in class. I also learned how to write arguments relating to my state and specific topics surrounding the death penalty.",

                "I learned about the history of capital punishment in the U.S., and how its politics have changed over time. I gained experience in reading court opinions and dissents; law reviews; and other academic papers regarding the death penalty. I learned about the various arguments for and against the death penalty.",
                "Writing, reading, analysis, research, also learned about the death penalty & Supreme Court",

We looked at the topic through many different lenses, such as the financial costs, adequate vs inadequate counsel, and the purpose of criminal punishment. The course also helped my writing become more precise.",

                "The readings were very engaging but could sometimes be too much",
                "Strengths - interesting readings, well-divided course plan, knowledgable and approachable professor, seminar setting, papers have a draft and revision that are both seen by professor\r\nWeaknesses - you won't see much of a pro-death penalty fight in this class because people who self-select into it are abolitionists.  a LOT of reading (would not suggest this class unless law\/political science\/policy-making is an interests of yours), professor's response to proposals\/drafts can be confusing (this was usually remediable by a one-on-one meeting with Professor Caplan)",
                "Strengths: Professor Caplan is an incredible professor who is very well-versed in and passionate about the topic. He is also just a great guy who is very understanding. There were was never a dull class, he always knew how to keep the discussion moving and relevant. \r\nWeaknesses: A little bit more clarity with the writing prompts and the feedback on our essays would have been useful. Other than that, no other weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Professor Caplan is great! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I enjoyed the format of our essays, but the one thing that could be improved is the intention of only looking at one's home state vs. all states -- that wasn't clear to me.",
                "I think it might help if we know some questions a few days in advance to be better prepared, though I understand why this is not the case. Not knowing what to expect, and being able to come up with an answer on the spot, is a very useful skill that I appreciated from this course.",
                "Professor Caplan is very deliberate with the way he structures the curriculum so that all the readings tie together and gives a strong foundational background. However, this class was a bit more like a leminar where he would call on individuals and then interject and go on a tangent.",
                "The class discussions were interesting, but could have been better if a more open, diverse, intellectual environment was fostered. Most people had the same opinions as the professor; the questions asked by the professor usually had one answer or was about the reading. I wish that there was more student-to-student dialog.",
                "I think this course was challenging in a good way, the timeline between the draft feedback and the revisions was a bit short to me at first I think that the two weeks for the third paper was good although I don't know if that's feasible for all the other papers. I liked that we researched the death penalty in our state and definitely learned from both the readings and the discussions we had in class.",
                "Strengths were interesting readings, great professor, and the seminar discussion format.",
                "Definitely take this class with Caplan. He is so willing to teach you and share his years of insights about the death penalty."

                "Could be improved: I wish there were dedicated times for us to get to know our classmates (maybe arranging to come 15 minutes early or late to class one day). I also felt that it was harder to speak up in class with the Zoom format. However, both of these things can't be helped much with the restrictions that COVID 19 places on us.",
                "Maybe we could have used the breakout room features a little more to get to know other people, but those can be a little awkward to engage with so Im not sure how effective they might have been. I appreciate Professor Caplan being fine with students not taking part in the discussion if they did not feel comfortable, but also encouraging us to say whats on our mind, regardless of how well-thought out it may or may not be.",

There is a lot of reading for this course (including some Supreme Court briefs and law review articles that are pretty dense) but the class discussion is fantastic and Professor Caplan isn't the kind of guy to cold call.  I also strongly urge people who are on the fence about capital punishment or decidedly pro-capital punishment to consider this class.  It isn't very helpful to any group of students to know everyone in the classroom agrees with you.  But yes, take this class if you have specific interest in this topic.  I would probably stay away from it if you are a non-major or non- pre-law track though.",
                "Absolutely. Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in the topic, the American criminal justice system in general, or even if you don't know much about or think you know everything about  the death penalty already. You will definitely learn something new in this course!",
                "Yes! I learned so much in this class, and even though the workload is hard, the readings were all very interesting and I enjoyed our in-class discussions. If you're interested in politics, law, or even no interests in these things in the first place, I would still recommend it.",
                "The death penalty is a topic that we should take the time to educate ourselves on. Not only does it reveal the injustices that exist within our criminal justice system, but also motivates students to forge their own opinions towards the death penalty and decide what they want to do to either combat it or endorse it.",
                "Honestly, this class is really interesting and I am grateful for the knowledge I gained from taking this seminar, but if you're looking for a class that will ease you into Yale courses or teaches you how to write, this course is not it.  You won't get the clear direction you want and it'll be frustrating (for both you and your writing tutor).",
