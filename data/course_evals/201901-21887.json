    "Learned all about privacy and privacy law",
    "A better way to think about the fundamentals of privacy and technology",
    "I learned so much about the law of privacy and how it is impacted by changes in technology. It forced me to reconsider what privacy is and how communities should protect it.",

   "comments": [
    "This is an amazing course. No improvements necessary.",
    "Probably quicker turnaround on grading would be good. Also class should be kept to 18.",
    "Super interesting course material and great seminar discussions. Cant think of any weaknesses",
    "Strengths: Phenomenal lectures, great readings. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes too long readings",
    "Most of the time was spent with Brad talking - I think it could be improved by fostering more direct debate and discussion between the students with Brad acting more as a moderator who guides the discussion and brings up important points along the way.",
    "N\/A",
    "I wish we didn't skip so many classes.",
    "The course material is interesting and relevant to current issues and Brad is a great instructor, but discussions tended to converge on the same basic themes every time. While this is the mark of a good course structure (that the material is structured in such a way to present numerous examples of similar themes), it could feel overly repetitive at times."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the law at all, this class is for you.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but maybe with a couple of reservations. I personally really enjoyed class when it happened (got cancelled a number of times) but there were definitely some students who did not get as much out of the way the course was organized. I didn't take 183 so I didn't super know what I was in for and I think most people who take this class do, but for me that worked out fine. I thought the material was extremely interesting and I think Brad is very intelligent and really pushes students on what they think and why in a way that is really useful. Overall, I got a lot out of this class, but it is definitely kind of a kooky experience.",
    "You know what you're getting into. The class really depends on who else is in it - if you like the people, take the class, otherwise don't.",
    "Would recommend. However: the reviews for this class overwhelmingly positive, but please have reasonable expectations going in EVEN IF you loved 183. Brad is great and cares about the topic and his students a lot, but if you're looking for a super-organized seminar where you'll get lots of individual attention and timely feedback, this isn't it. Also, two page single-spaced reading responses will take up a lot of your time and may feel like a chore. Each Friday class meeting was definitely still a highlight of my week and I learned a ton about privacy and the law, but there were times when I was frustrated just because of who I am as a student.",
    "Yes, this class is great if you like Brad. An awesome opportunity.",
    "I would totally recommend this class if you want to get into really interesting contentious debates. If you are interested in law or technology definitely a good course.",
    "This is one of the most legendary courses at Yale College. Brad Rosen is one of the most incredible professors, and will give you such a unique classroom experience. You will have so many thought-provoking discussions, and will get a lot of Brad's personal insight. This was honestly my favorite two-hours of the week; when you are in class, time stops because you are having so much fun. This was the highlight of my semester, and has changed my life forever. If you get in, please please please take the class. You will come out a different person.",
    "Definitely! Brad Rosen's classes are a must take!",
    "Awesome, chill class. 183 on steroids in a seminar setting.",
    "Yes but only if you're strongly interested in privacy or law.",
    "The classes are incredibly interesting and low-stakes. It's fun and if you've taken 183, you'll know if you like Brad or not.",
    "This is a good follow-up course to CPSC 183 for students looking for further exploration of privacy law specifically, without much of the intellectual property\/copyright material from 183"
