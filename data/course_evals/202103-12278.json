You really have to practice every single day for the quizzes\r\nWeeaknesses: not enough opportunities for students to practice speaking to each other and to the teacher. Class is mainly listening to the lecture with some practice in between. The tutoring program is also unnecessary. I felt like I needed to sit there for 30 minutes with the tutor and try to fill in the time with small talk.",
