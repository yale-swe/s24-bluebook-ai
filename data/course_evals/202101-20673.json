                "The class had a very manageable workload this semester, which is greatly appreciated after last semester. The one way in which this course could be improved would be if there were a set of vocabulary accessible for each unit. The online textbook had this, but often our learning would go beyond these words and it would be helpful to know them in taking the test at the end of the unit.",
                "The main complaint I have is that if you're taking this class to learn German to use in real life, you probably don't need to know words from fairy tales. Most of the units were on things that were more relevant to everyday life though, and even the fairy tale unit allowed for the reading of some fairy tales, which is nice for getting better at reading in German.",
                "There are virtually no weaknesses to this course. I would state that the workload is a little bit too much, but even that would not be honest, since it is a 1.5 credit class. This course has plenty of strengths: most of the time, the topics are arranged in a logical sequence, feedback is abundant and incredibly quickeven though Germans complain about inefficiencies in their country, this course certainly operates with German efficiency, the instructor is absolutely fantastic and the workload is most manageable. Testing is also very reasonable and I didn't feel stressed about the biweekly tests, a situation that I believe helped me learn the language better than if I had had a final exam, for example.",
                "Strengths: the pen pal writing was really fun, and I appreciated the modifications from last semester in terms of the asynchronous work/frequency of the textbook assignments. Well taught and Herr Pal was helpful in explaining unclear concepts. Immersed in culture as well as the language."

Saurabh did an excellent job at ensuring that all of us in the class were keeping up and understanding the things we were reading or speaking about. There were times where I was very lost in the conversation and Saurabh was able to lead me into the meaning of the questions I was being asked all in German.",

They would never regret taking this course if it is being taught by an instructor like Saurabh, who is so invested in his students and in German culture. I feel that the German department really wants students to enjoy their journey, so they don't force them to leave the language courses through unreasonable testing standards. Additionally, grading is fair and adequate for students aiming to achieve A2 level, which I think cannot be said of other language classes at Yale.",
