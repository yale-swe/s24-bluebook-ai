We learn a lot, but it's not super difficult (if you didn't find ECON 159 so hard; I've been told I have a skewed perception of the difficulty). Clear lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only six weeks. Meets during reading week. I refuse to accept the results of one lecture on conditional thinking and common knowledge. (THE MESSENGER GAME IS A LIE!!!) But overall, not a lot."
