                "As my first anthropology class here at Yale, this class offered excellent insight into different fieldwork ethnographical techniques. Weekly discussions on the book were structured like a book club in which a pair of students lead a seminar. This made it all the more engaging and forced me to really get familiar with the pieces I was reading.",
                "This class was useful in allowing me to read some important works in medical anthropology and gleening more about ethnographic methodology but it largely did not meet my expectations for the kind of knowledge I would learn. I expected discussions of topics within the books to connect to broader ideas about how societies operate and how humans live inside them, but the discussions largely became centered on the books as objects rather than as starting points to show something larger. To me, this misses many important aspects of medical anthropology and big opportunities for learning more about the world as a whole."

                "This course provides incredible breadth but no depth. At one book a week, with each book 300+ pages, there is no way to actually dig into the ideas covered. Instead, the discussions are all surface level and turn into people trying to prove that they read rather than engaging with the material. The graded work is the sameit is so structured that it doesnt allow you to actually say anything new. You just have to follow the format and regurgitate the book into a short paper rather than engaging with it. The professor also barely says anything the whole class, which is better than a seminar professor who lectures but worse than properly steering the discussion and adding her expertise as a seminar professor should.",
                "the course is relatively strong in that some of the books it selects are truly groundbreaking from a methodological and intellectual perspective. Likewise, some books fall short of this mark and are uninteresting and unimportant to the class as a whole. There is also very little connection between the books in the class beyond the rare mention of a term from one that is applicable in the discussion of another. The discussions were also poorly structured and facilitated. There were entirely too many questions to genuinely discuss anything in the given time, and the discussions devolved into performative efforts to say anything so that everyone knows you read the book and you get your participation points. As for assignments, The book reviews were difficult to write because it was not clear how to balance ethnographic breadth and depth within the assignment constraints. In my opinion, the class needs to replace some books (for me, Petryna, Inhorn, and Kleinman stand out), restructure the discussions to focus more deeply on what the books show us about society rather than how they came to be and a cursory overview of the ideas without really analyzing them, and longer assignments (though I understand the utility of learning how to be brief and, honestly, this can stay).",
                "I was exposed to many wonderful ethnographies! I wouldnt say in class we had groundbreaking discussions everything went very fast."

                "Yes, I would highly recommend this class; if you are going in anthropology, medical fields, or public health, this class is a great exploration of different field intersectionalities. Class discussions were particularly insightful and rotation of seminar leaders made it possible to hear every perspective in the class.",
                "Yes",
                "If you want a heavy workload class where you dont actually learn or discuss anything, then this is the class for you.",
                "If it's not necessary for a university requirement, I would not. The books that are worth reading can be read outside the class, and the class adds little in addition to warrant sitting through the rest of it. The best thing I got from the class was being able to say I read some of the important books, but I could have looked at the syllabus and read them on my own time for the same effect.",
                "Yes and no. It is a book club but not a discussion based one if you are interested in that take this course!"
