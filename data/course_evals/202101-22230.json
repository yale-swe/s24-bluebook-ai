I also gained television-analysis terminology.",

As a result, I learned about the cultural impact of the works we studied and grappled with ideas of representation. Some of our most interesting discussions centered around questions of authenticity and \"quality\" in reference to the film and television studied."

                "The course was very good in cultivating engagement and prompting interesting, thought provoking questions.",
                "The weekly blog posts were a great way of engaging with the course without being overwhelming, however I'm not sure that I felt completely prepared to write the final paper as it was the first paper we had written in the class.",
                "I think the course's syllabus was very strong, as were the blog post assignments--which demanded engagement with the content. I often wished, though, for a bit more lecture\/driving context for the classroom conversations. Sometimes, I found these conversations wandered and didn't feel as guided or focused as they might have been. I yearned for a prompt or two to guide each day, so that the conversation felt more specified. While I felt I took away a lot from the readings, blog posts, and viewings, I didn't feel the class discussion significantly enhanced my understanding of the class materials.",
                "Watching TV shows (new series as well as pop-culture favorites) each week alongside readings was such a cool experience! I had never treated TV as something to be academically discussed or scrutinized, so this class was eye-opening and incredibly rewarding. The workload (screenings and multiple accompanying readings) felt large at times, yet it is worth it because you learn so much.",
                "The strengths were the content and the discussions we had. The weaknesses are that blogs werent incorporated too much into class and I wouldve liked getting more feedback\/grades through the semester.",
                "Strength: Very flexible syllabus that changed to meet the needs of the semester and students. Weaknesses: Little discussion about assignments beforehand and what is expected.",
                "Weaknesses: Professor was too concerned about minutia to the point where it was so uncomfortable to make a point because he would always attack you on it. It made me not engaged in the class and made me not want to participate at all. Additionally, the professor was just overly intense but then would also say to reach out? But it's hard to do that when the professor writes things in the syllabus saying that he will take off points for lateness even if it's by a few hours. That makes the professor seem not approachable, understanding, or compassionate. I felt like the professor was trying to make the classroom a comfortable space but his desire to be respected (and feared almost) often won out. The professor frequently pushed back on points about racism and\/or colorism, which did not feel appropriate for a white professor teaching AFAM to do. Also way too much watching of People vs. OJ when none of the other better shows had that much time spent on them.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Material. I was really hoping that I would love this class because I love television and its history, but it sadly did not turn out that way.",
                "This course covers an impressive time span and explores each of the times it covers deeply. Some of the readings, particularly those from earlier in the semester are really long.",
                "The course syllabus is organized very well and I think the selection of television shows and readings are interesting and compliment each other nicely. I would say that sometimes the readings could be too lengthy or too dense but Prof. Forster was generally able to make accommodations. In the future, it might be better to cut down the syllabus from the start. I enjoyed the blog posts because I think they allowed for room to experiment with my writing style. However, the 12-16 page final was quite difficult to complete (partially because the semester itself was really hectic) and, in the future, I think it would be worthwhile to assign a final paper more in the 8-12 page range."

I found the more open-ended conversations to be less successful on Zoom because Zoom is a strange platform for organic conversation, which this class heavily relied on.",

Like there is no need to do all of this in the middle of a pandemic. There never seemed to be an understanding of how difficult it was to be a student in this time. Or like he would thank us for our contributions and acknowledge how hard it was but neglected to actually lessen the workload or actually listen to student feedback as much as he suggested. There was no need for 400-word blog posts every week (due at 10 pm no less like what is the reason....).",

                "If you are interested in the Golden Age of Television, then yes. However, I do not think there was as big of a focus on black characters\/shows as I expected (there was an okay amount though). Therefore, if that is the sole reason you wanted to take this class, it will probably not live up to that exact expectation. However, due to lesser intellectual challenge, I would recommend if your schedule is packed like mine was.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. The professor clearly favored men and non-black people which was ironic in an AFAM course. I also just feel like even though the material was wonderful, if you don't get along with the professor, it will not be worth it. I just feel like because of the professor's relative youth to other professors he was scared of not being taken seriously, which turned into overcompensating with an intensity that made it difficult to actually enjoy the class.",
                "Yes! The subject matter is super interesting, and over the course of this class you will gain exposure to lots of different types of shows.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is really interested in the theoretical, methodological, and political aspects of film and television. To a non-film major, or to someone without a large, vested interest in film, a lot of the readings are kind of dense and the final paper\/project is quite long. That being said, I think the course material is very interesting and well organized."
