                "The course was good in the sense that we got a fair amount of conversational practice, however, we barely received any feedback all semester. This was frustrating because we would not know if we were signing correctly or how to improve. Further, we never knew where our grades stood in the course. We communicated this with the instructors multiple times, but it was never heard and we were left in the dark.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- super hands-on learning, with a lot of practice and exercises during class time\r\n- class was easy to follow, while still promoting intellectual stimulation and challenge\r\n- assignments were reasonable and sometimes fun!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I wish the class was better organized on Canvas to help keep track of assignments and guidelines\r\n- I wouldve liked to receive feedback more often, to feel confident about my abilities as well as correct whatever needs to be corrected.\r\n- I think more guidance on the service project would help us to succeed greater in the execution",
                "Strengths: great instruction! Professor Silvestri is very engaging in class, invested in our learning, and creates a fun classroom environment. I learned a lot in this class about ASL and Deaf culture and history. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class organization. The class didnt really follow the original syllabus and each week I wasnt sure what exactly the assignments were. The weekly schedule and assignments lacked clarity usually until right before they were due, and there were several assignments we werent really sure if we had to do at all but remained on the syllabus/canvas.",
                "This course was great for working on conversational skills in ASL, as well as learning about poetry, film, and Deaf culture, but I wish we had spent more time working on vocabulary acquisition and grammar than on those more-advanced topics.",
                "Strengths: fun class, interactive, got to practice having conversations\r\nWeaknesses: no feedback throughout the semester, at the end of the semester we only have one grade in, project guidelines were a bit all over the place, there was no organization",
                "This course really emphasized conversational skills and project based learning. However, there was little feedback from the professor throughout the semester.",
                "strengths: a lot of conversational practice, great instructors\r\nweaknesses: not very much feedback on grades",
                "This course would be improved by clearer instructions/communication from the instructor to the students. We always felt a lack of clarity in assignments and didnt receive feedback/grades until the end of the course."

Further, even after noting frustrating with the lack of organization and communication, instructors failed to meet student needs.",

                "Yes! ASL is an incredible language, and the professors are absolutely fantastic. You really become a member of a community by taking this language, and L3 is even more fun than L1 or L2 were!",
                "If it is required then yes. The course was pretty disorganized this year. Maybe it will get better since it was all of the professors first years teaching at Yale. If the organization gets better then I think the course will be better",
