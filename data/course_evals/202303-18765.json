                "In terms of strength, the course had a lot of ways to seek extra help such as office hours and peer tutoring. This made the weekly p-sets very manageable. The fact that we could have a cheat sheet also made the midterms\/final a lot less intimidating. In terms of weaknesses, the class was a little fast paced at times.",
                "I liked how the course was taught where there was a lot of practice problems because that was very helpful when I had to review\/study for the midterms\/finals. I think a weakness may be how the homework problems can sometimes be a lot harder compared to what the class covered, so maybe going over more challenging problems in class will be helpful.",

I found myself and my peers under lots of pressure in the last few weeks to learn what felt like a greater amount of content than we usually covered in 2-3 weeks. The strength of this course comes mainly from the instructor I had.",
                "This course was well taught, but at times I felt the pace was a bit slow.",
                "Claxx material was very engaging but oftentimes the problem sets felt like busy work instead too measures of knowledge and familiarity with the material.",
                "Exams were way to hard and felt like the professors did not even try to prepare us in any way for them. The content felt very distant from the units we learned in class. Also, classes felt more dependent than ever on the professor, and I didn't hear of a single good professor.",
                "Recordings of lectures",
                "I thought this course provided me a solid understanding of Calc 2 but much of that came with my own practice. The lectures were fine but I often came out confused and ended up teaching myself the content. I also find that the grading system is unfair. So much time is spent on PSETs for them to count so minimally and the first midterm should be able to have more weight than the second."
