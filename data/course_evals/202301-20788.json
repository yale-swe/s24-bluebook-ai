If you use them or try to learn them, you'll get better at them after taking this class, understanding what each tool is and how it works underneath.

                "The strengths were that it was taught well, and the assignments were very clear. Although, a weakness would be the minimal support when it came to debugging assignments which could prove to be tedious at times.",
                "Professor Dorsey is encouraging and willing to answer students' questions. She is also very understanding and willing to record the lecture when a student had to miss class for a family reasons. The TA Alvin is very supportive and patient and willing to explain anything students are struggling with. Lectures are very interesting because they show the real-life applications of concepts and the professor and TA are willing to stay after class to clarify stuff. The class is well-organized, instructions are detailed and well-communicated. Collaboration with a partner was encouraged for some assignments, which was very helpful. The time allotted for each assignment was reasonable, 1-2 weeks, so not too stressful. Each assignment has an extra credit art contest, it's exciting and creative and makes the pset more enjoyable, and you can look at other students' entries in the art gallery. Professor Dorsey provided a study guide for each exam, which corresponded pretty well to the actual exam content, so you know what is important to study.",
                "The course content is very interesting, and I was engaged throughout the class. However, the difficulty across different weeks feels a bit ineven, and the assignments were frustrating. Frustrating not because it's conceptually hard, but because the assignment itself is vaguely worded and the provided code unclear, meaning that I spent most of my time trying to understand what exactly the assignment is asking for instead of actually applying concepts learned  in class.",
                "The class was basically off the princeton course. The psets are also the exact same, but still pretty enjoyable. I think graphics coding in javascript is nice, but definitely not industry standard, and using c++ would be align better with yale cs.",
                "Too much crammed into one semester, all really interesting but too fast paced. The psets took forever to complete but were only worthy 5% of the grade.",
                "A lot of range (a good taste of everything)",
                "Great class in terms of content. The PSETs are the main way through which students learn, and it shows with how much time they take. That said, they are worth far too little for how much time we put into them, as compared to the \"quizzes\" which are 50% of the class (2x 25%) and take 50 minutes each.",
                "The pacing of the course is quite good. It's manageable to keep up with each concept as it's introduced.\r\nThe slides can be improved. May times when reviewing a lecture it's not clear from the slides what different terms mean.\r\nAlso, the programming assignments can have better code comments for the skeleton code, to understand what the arguments for each function are."

You'll have a lot of FUN taking this class. Plus the class codes in js so it's much easier than C. Plus plus plus, all projects are partner projects starting from assignment 3, and the final project is a group projects where you work together and make a video game of your imagination! Plus the class structure is immensely beneficial as stated earlier. etc etc. Please please please take this class if you are a gamer into game design, an artist into movie making, or much more.",
                "If you are interested in Computer Graphics, this is the only course that will teach you about it. So in that sense, yes you should take it. I think the experience could be a lot better with a little more administrative help, such as hiring ULAs (there was only 1.5 hours of office hours per week for ~25 people), and more consistent Ed responses (about half of people's posts on there were never responded to, which was really disappointing). As it stands, the course this semester basically amounted to a lot of self-teaching to get through the assignments. Prof. Dorsey is very kind and helpful when you speak to her individually, but she just seemed a little bit lethargic or perhaps overwhelmed as an administrator of the course.",

The class does not go into great depth on any one topic in computer graphics, but gives a good bird's eye view of the world of computer graphics as a whole. But whoever takes this class should know that the assignments are very much time sinks.",

                "Yes - it covers a lot of anything you might be interested in when it comes to graphics. It is a good place to start and will help you figure out which topics you'd be interested in exploring further",
