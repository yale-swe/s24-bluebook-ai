At its core, this course helped me refine my critical thinking skills; regardless of the topic, I learned how to pull facts from a number of different sources, connect them, and present an argument. In particular, I learned how to think beyond the surface answer and scratch beneath the surface of the topics we were discussing about. I also learned how to respectfully argue and support the arguments of my classmates. While this course left me with many questions about the topics we delved into, it most importantly taught me how to approach them.",

Throughout high school, I had a hard time with political theory because I found it irrelevant and useless; however, this class proved that it can be useful.

            "comments": [
                "There is a reasonable amount of readings, sometimes more than others. Some of the texts are confusing however the discussions always clear them up. It is a smaller class and there is very lively discussion and debate. The professor is amazing and always there to support.",
                "Strengths: Rosas, diversity of readings, seminar format, thorough feedback on papers, topics covered were very interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very little, maybe the density of the readings",
                "I think that the major strength of this course was that it was a first year seminar; one was really able to see how all the students grew and developed in their knowledge and abilities over the semester. I also think the seminar format was excellent; a class on ethics such as this really benefits from conversation, rather than lectures. I think the reading selection was well-done, and most, if not all of the readings, developed my understanding of the topic that we were studying in a nuanced way. Professor Rosas really brought the course together and was superb, I don't think the course could have been as good without him. His great strength is guiding the conversation, by not really inputting his own comments, but facilitating dialogue between the students. He also makes sure that every student who wants to speak is able to, which is very nice for more introverted students. I would say that one way for this course to be improved would be to add in another essay or two (there are 3 essay assignments currently). Now, one may complain that this creates more work, which it would, but I think the benefits would far outweigh the negatives. First of all, my writing definitely improved (especially in structure) from the first essay to the last, but I imagine I could see even more improvements with one more essay. I also think that if there were more essays, then this course could fulfill a writing requirement. Also more essays would make the course grading easier, since less weight would be put on each essay. I understand there would be logistical complications to this though, since Professor Rosas is the Dean of Murray, and is extremely busy, so adding more essays to his schedule may not be feasible; Professor Rosas also spends a lot of time grading each essay and gives extensive feedback which is a huge strength. Excellent course!",
                "Perhaps the only thing I did not like was the division of the readings (it felt like the reading to do between Tuesday and Thursday was the same amount as between Thursday and Tuesday). Other than that I really enjoyed this course.",
                "It was a very engaging course that encouraged me to think a lot through our seminar discussions",
                "Strengths: great selection of readings, course covers engaging topics; Weaknesses: discussions sometimes became a bit boring",
                "The strengths of this course are that it fostered dialogue among students, it pushed us to think critically about what we were arguing/saying (backing it with facts/evidence), and it gave me an opportunity to hone my college writing and reading skills. I can't think of any significant weaknesses; the readings at times were a bit challenging but that was a good opportunity to grow.",
                "strength: discussions are relevant and applicable, Dean Rosas is a great Professor with a lot of insight and knowledge to offer \r\nweakness: can be intimidating",
                "Strengths: very engaging, every class was structured as a conversation, interesting readings, clear feedback about papers, Professor Rosas encouraged one-on-one meetings, got close with classmates due to small class size\r\nWeakness: none!",

                "YES! 10 out of 10! This course is incredible, especially in today's environment. Professor Rosas is an absolute gem of a professor, and person in general. His seminar is incredibly engaging, and it really provides deep insight into what seems like nonsensical political decisions in Washington. Regardless of your major, take this, this is so worth your time!!!",
                "Definitely recommend this course to anyone!! It opens up your mindset and pushes you to think harder and better. Even if political science is not your thing, it will become your thing. There are such interesting topics that is discussed, so many cases you may have never heard of before. The stimulating discussions are worth every minute of reading.",
                "Yes I would. Phenomenal course to take especially as a first year with no foundation to political theory.",
                "Absolutely, this is a must take first-year seminar if you are even remotely interested in law. You'll leave this course with more questions than answers, but it will make you appreciate the complexity that goes into making laws and will likely change your views on issues such as prostitution, what decisions parents should be able to make for their children, privacy, and more. The readings can be quite dense and lengthy, but they're a good preparation for a college-level workload. The papers are not too long, but they can be a bit difficult to write with how theoretical they can be. Grading is pretty generous as well, Rosas takes into account upward trend across the semester and it seemed like most papers were scored quite highly.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to any Yale student. I am an Economics and Mathematics double major, and I feel like this course greatly expanded my ability to critically think in all areas of my life, not just with ethics and political science. Professor Rosas is excellent to get to know, and the course is also very fun as well. We debate about whether public nudity should be illegal, and talk about the ethical basis of convicting German consensual cannibals, among other less stimulating topics such as privacy and affirmative action.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. The way that you think about different issues and the way you are forced to examine the fundamental basis of law is very interesting and gives you a better understanding of the challenges faced by legal theorists and law makers.",
                "Yes - great overview of the topic at hand, \"Law and the Limits of Freedom\". Wide variety of theoreticians covered with reference to interesting case studies. Helpful office hours.",
                "Yes, even if you don't plan on pursuing political science as a major it is a very engaging course",
                "If you're trying to see if political science is for you, this is a great way to find out. I'd generally recommend it.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student: the lessons were engaging and incorporated humor, allowing me to retain concepts better. The seminar leaves you with more questions than the ones you began with which is always indicative of productive, thought-provoking conversations. I found myself thoroughly interested in many of the readings as they explored new, intriguing topics and made me reconsider how I develop opinions on them.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. We dived into a number of very interesting (and relevant) issues and having this class as an opportunity to explore them and their nuances alongside classmates from across the world was a unique and enlightening experience. I appreciate the opportunity to grow as a reader, writer, and thinker (all of which, I believe will set me well up for the rest of my Yale College years). It was also very interesting to see how the law was applied to these issues; while I was left with more questions at the end, I do believe that is a good thing. It was a very engaging class and the instructor did an excellent job at facilitating discussion and integrating his own knowledge.",
                "YESSSS. This class was my favorite this semester. Throughout high school, I had a hard time with political theory because I found it irrelevant and useless; however, this class proved that it can be useful. It's LITERARY the foundation of the law and court cases that are argued. This class gave me a greater appreciation for theory. And Dean Rosas is a perfect example of how a great instructor can be instrumental to the learning in a class.",
                "Yes! This was my favorite class this semester and my favorite class ever by far. While this class challenged me and I do wish I participated more, I feel like I grew so much as a thinker and writer through this class. I met such amazing classmates and the conversations we engaged in really challenged my pre-existing opinions. This class made me want to be a political science major and raised even more questions about law and freedom that I am excited to explore during the rest of my time at Yale.",
