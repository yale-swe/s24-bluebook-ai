In terms of skills, I also learned how to think about the mesmerizing things that our brain is able to do through a molecular lens.

                "The course was pretty well-organized, and covered a lot of material that was also well-taught.",
                "One thing I absolutely did not like about the course was that I was confused half the time because I did not know how different topics were related to each other and it seemed like we were just jumping around a lot. It was only after studying for the final that I somewhat understood how things were interconnected. In my opinion, the exams (especially exam 1) were way too time crunched, and was basically testing how fast we could type instead of what we actually understood. A lot my answers (and I'm sure of others) were rushed and not very specific because of this.",
                "There is a lot of content, but it is unclear how to prioritize what to learn. I felt that the exams tested on certain things that were less relevant or required knowing a small detail, which didn't seem to be the best thing to test. I also think the teaching styles of each professor is pretty different so that is somewhat of a harsh switch midway through the semester.",
                "Some of this course's strengths were the incredibly fascinating material\/content, the TF's (who were incredibly kind and helpful), and the Professors (who were extremely knowledgeable and accessible). The entire teaching staff was immensely supportive and provided us with many resources to not only understand the material (which was definitely challenging), but also succeed in the course.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I would say that this course has is the fact that it has no assignments in between the exams. I felt like sometimes I only realized that I didn't fully understand a concept when I came across it in an exam. While the Professors did provide us with optional PSets that we could do for practice  which were really helpful and had questions that were definitely similar to what we saw in tests!  I almost wish that we had PSets more often so that we could practice more questions based on the content.",
                "A strength I think is the availability of resources, including all of the review worksheets and the review sessions with the TAs.",
                "Make sure you go to section!!!!! The course is very interesting and you learn a lot in class, but without section it is very difficult to turn all of the ideas into concrete information that you should study for the tests.",
                "I was (and am) nervous about my grade the entire semester because there are no weekly problem sets and the average on the first exam was in the 60s. I did really enjoy the content, though.",
                "I think that this course had extremely interesting content and covered more ground than I was expecting--which I appreciated. I think that the weak point of this course was its exam structure, relying entirely on two midterms and a final. Other MCDB courses with high content volume utilize additional teaching methods (e.g. a weekly quiz system) to facilitate greater interaction with each lecture and parcel the content in to manageable amounts. Student performance on the first exam had an extremely wide range, and I was puzzled why this wasn't acknowledged or used to guide changes to the teaching of the remaining units of this course. Given how interesting this course material was, I felt like consternation over the exams ended up being an unnecessary impediment to engaging with the content.",
                "the first half of this course is extremely difficult and I still don't understand it, despite studying it harder than the second half. Thant might just be me, though, I'd like a more organized lesson plan if possible with the key points highlighted that way if I don't understand the explanation in lecture, i can search secondary resources on myown."

The Professors and TF's recorded everything so that the lectures\/sections would be accessible for everyone who couldn't make the times of the live lectures or wanted to be able to rewatch some videos while studying. They were also always extremely open and vigilant of the chat on Zoom to make sure that any questions that anyone had were addressed.",

Almost every aspect of the course was painful--the lectures were very fast-paced, the material was very dense, the exams were difficult and on a time crunch. However, looking back on it, I really learned a lot about neurobiology. Whether or not I use this knowledge in my research or later in life, I think this course built my neuro knowledge foundation.

However, I would caution students who are not STEM\/neuro majors that it is not an easy course, and that you should probably go in with a solid background in biology, some background in physics and having taken The Human Brain. It is an extremely interesting course though, and the material really is fascinating. Sometimes you read the handouts and have to take a minute to digest the information, but when you step back you can't help but be in awe of the amazing things that our brain is able to do.",
