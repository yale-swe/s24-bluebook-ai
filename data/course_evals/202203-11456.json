Elbousty is amazing at making sure everyone gets speaking, reading, and writing practice in Arabic and that everyone learns about Arab cultures\r\nWeakness: the amount of work you'll be expected to do in and outside of class, could be difficult to get used to and you might have to do a little more independent study if you want to catch up"

If you have a drive to learn this beautiful language, you will likely find joy in the everyday work and conversations that take place in this course. This course is a step up from beginner level to intermediate, and it feels that way as well. Handling longer texts and more vocabulary may present as challenging at first, but I found my skills improving as the weeks went on.",
                "I'd recommend this to anyone who really (emphasis on really) wants practice in conversational/academic modern standard Arabic. Otherwise, the time commitment would really be a struggle."
