    "I have definitely learned more Chinese than I ever thought I would know. With daily quizzes and biweekly exams,  the workload was high but you learn your stuff!",
    "I can now communicate with other human beings on this planet that I wouldn't have been able to communicate with before! I also live in a very Chinese-heavy neighborhood, and it is empowering that I can now engage with this community on a deeper level of understanding.",
    "Basic Chinese characters, speaking, tones, reading",
    "Strong introductory language skills.",
    "I developed my ability to think about another language with a new mindset. I was able to approach the language with a prepared understanding of both the vocabulary and the grammar.",
    "Better grasp of tones, sentence structure, and grammar. New vocabulary and methods to study Chinese.",
    "Hardcore memorization. Tested my ability to stay engaged the entire class period.",
    "Basic Chinese conversations; grammar structure, Vocabulary",
    "Before taking this course, I had no knowledge whatsoever of the Chinese language or culture. Now, I can understand and speak basic dialogue, which has empowered me to learn more about both the language and China."

   "comments": [
    "It was honestly structured very well and had few weaknesses. I love how class sizes are small, so everyone could have direct engagement with the content, although sometimes it can feel like a pressure-heavy environment, since everyone else is listening intensely as you speak a new language.",
    "Taught very well and made a lot of sense in the way we were supposed to prepare for class and how class was set up.",
    "Great course. Good pacing, although lots of work. Biggest downside is that you don't really know your grade throughout the semester. There should be an online system where you can check on your grade, rather than having to keep track yourself of every score on your daily quizzes, tests...",
    "This course was very well designed and planned out with a great path of building upon itself as the semester moved on.",
    "Strengths: Lots of material taught in a manageable way\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of assessments like daily quizzes.",
    "The best way to learn Chinese is through repetition. We did quite a bit of this in class, but facilitating more conversational experiences would be very helpful. I didn't know exactly what was happening with tests and quizzes a lot of the time, being more clear about the schedule and expectations would be helpful.",
    "A little too much focus on writing, I feel like for how important oral communication is, we were too infrequently tested on it to make sure that we really are improving. There is a lot of weight given to writing, which is both more tedious to perfect and (in my opinion) less important.\r\n\r\nThe pacing of the course is very high, but this means that you feel like you have accomplished a lot by the end of the term.",
    "I would have loved more frequent oral tests that do not have as great of weight in the final grade. I understand that written tests are efficient and important, but I would have loved a greater emphasis on speaking and pronunciation."

   "comments": [
    "YES!!!! But hopefully match it up with classes that have a lighter workload.",
    "I've been recommending it to everyone I know",
    "Yes, this is a great course and I learned a lot from it. I took Chinese for 3 years in high school but somehow managed to learn just as much in one semester here.",
    "Yes. Strong foundation in elementary Chinese.",
    "Definitely. This is the best way to learn a language and the teachers are very supportive throughout.",
    "Yes! I think this course does a really good job at teaching early level Chinese!",
    "Yes. You have to be very invested in the language or else you will get distracted and fall behind. Otherwise, it is very challenging and fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but the student should be made wary of the level of commitment this course requires if he wants to succeed in it. It can be extremely rewarding if enough time is invested into memorising the characters. \r\n\r\nIt might not be the ideal language course to take if a student is simply looking to fulfill their language requirement but if their interest spans beyond simple academic regulations, the teachers and other resources available for this course are amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn a language because it requires a unique perspective on how to approach learning a language but gives an appreciation to those who learn it."
