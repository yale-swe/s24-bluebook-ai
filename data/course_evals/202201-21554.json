                "This course has really clear organization; every session was extremely interactive and engaging. The materials as well as in-class activities were always fun and helped me a lot in improving my speaking and presenting skills. There are also a lot of extra resources.",
                "Strengths are definitely student engagement and the class frequency, this allowed me to learn the material pretty fast.",
                "i think the curriculum will become clearer over time as tobira 2 gets refined, but other than that nishimura sensei has a very strong approach to teaching that is first and foremost, interactive and engaging. she makes sure students all get a chance at speaking and practicing grammar in class, and she makes the lecture material pallatable by using humor and being relatable to student struggles, haha. overall a fun time tanoshikattadesu!",
                "The strength of this course is certainly in its instructor (Hiroyo Nishimura), as well as the material provided for the course (the Tobira series of textbooks). Nishimura provided excellent homework, an amazing environment, and a clear schedule\/outline for the semester. As for weaknesses, I think we actually could have had more focus in the pitch accent (there was more first semester than there was this semester). I also cannot speak for other instructors.",
                "strengths: the level of participation in the classroom was high and the different activities and roleplay scenarios kept the classroom engaged and interested in learning",
                "The daily conversation and homework aspect really helped me continuously think about Japanese and how to use new grammar structures and vocabulary. It also felt rewarding to be able to hold a conversation using new grammar. This constant reinforcement was also helpful especially for assessments and not forgetting past grammar rules. Something that troubled me throughout this was course was that sometimes the amount of course load led me to burning out and not being able to perform my best. Sometimes when there were 3 or more assignments for the next day it felt a little overwhelming depending on what was assigned (multiple recordings or multiple worksheets for one nights homework)."

I would specifically recommend Nishimura, but I think that the curriculum for the Japanese program is great so I would also recommend the course in general to other students. You learn so much, and some of my best friends have been made in this class!",
                "Yes. Although the workload and commitment seems higher than other languages, students are able to improve and learn so much in a short amount of time which is very rewarding.",
                "100% yes. Nishimura sensei is also an amazing teacher that works hard to provide you feedback on time so you are easily able to see what you need to practice when learning new material. The structure of the course reinforces past material and makes students learn new material at a fast rate. This course is fundamental if you want to learn more Japanese!"
