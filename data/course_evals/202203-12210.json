                "The strengths include covering a wide variety of topics and thinking outside the book, insightful class discussions with real-world examples, and carefully going through problem solving steps. Sometimes the material and problem solving felt too empirical (e.g., using empirically derived constants without thinking very much about what the variables mean or where the constants came from.",
                "The assignments and tests are really fair and well designed based on the content of the course.",
                "A field trip would have been a great thing to add",
                "The information in the course is well-structured, and builds logically on itself. The homework assignments were generally fair, took a reasonable amount of time, and helped solidify the concepts. The book and supplementary readings were mostly very helpful (except for a few sections in the book that had minor errors in equations or used variable names that were not the ones we used in class). The exams were difficult, and genuinely took me the entire class time to do, but the information in them was reasonable to expect of us.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's difficult to think of ways to improve the class. Perhaps different placement of TA office hours would be helpful, that were not so close to when previous homeworks were due would help. Maybe a more explicit in-class (or office hours) review session before each exam would be helpful, but that may just depend on the class's preference. There were also a few homework questions that were phrased a little confusingly."
