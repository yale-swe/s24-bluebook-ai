I also learned how to synthesizing an argument across multiple court cases or areas of reading.",

The course allowed me to think on a number of issues and think about how the law and moral arguments from different perspectives. Because of this, I was able to reflect for myself and what I believe in. There are many issues that were illuminating and pushed me to think about what it means for healthcare. We discussed the foundations of the US healthcare system before going into many bioethics issues, which was helpful, as well as key court cases that led to certain policies and rights regarding health in the US. We also sometimes discussed other countries' policies and compare it to the US, which was very important to understand.",

                "This course was a super interesting way to learn about some major bioethical issues in the US and abroad, their histories, and current legal statuses. I learned a tremendous amount of information on how the law functions\/doesn't function when it comes to bioethics, and also how some other areas of law (intellectual property, for example) play into bioethics issues.

                "Before enrolling in this class, I heard nothing but amazing things from my peers. Whether they were future lawyers, doctors, or philosophers, this class appealed to all students. This is by far my favorite class at Yale! This class is structured differently than other classes - mostly due to the unique content of the lectures. Our reading consisted of law briefs, court opinions, contemporary articles, and other academic works consistent with what (I assume) would be found in a law classroom. However, Latham explains the material in a way that is accessible to all students, regardless of background. He takes it from the ground up, explaining foundational history, unfamiliar legal terms, and he includes examples\/analogies that bring great clarity to the very confusing medical infrastructure in our country.",

I learned how to reason legally as it relates to bioethics and how to use previous case law to address future issues in bioethics.",

                "I learned so much! Such an efficient course: per unit of effort it yields the most knowledge of any yale course I have taken! Learned a lot about the medical system in the US, different bioethical questions, and how those questions have been approached by the legal system in the United States.",
                "I learned a lot about issues of bioethics and law in America. Topical issues such as abortion, end of life care, doctor patient relationship and the internsection of these areas",
                "I got to learn about the fundamental principles underlying American regulation of bioethics -- and sometimes the lack of underlying principles! There are a lot of themes that run through the course that are worthwhile to explore: the ways regulation lags behind technological progress, the role of states (who often reign supreme on bioethics issues), and the expanding interpretation of the 14th Amendment through the Due Process Clause come to mind. I think that I actually really enjoyed the course -- the issues discussed are some of the most important to me personally (particularly now) and being able to discuss them in section and lecture was worthwhile.",

                "I learned so much about the American health care system, public health law, and incredibly interesting bioethics topics! We were also able to apply what we learned about bioethics law to more specific topics such as Institutional Review Boards, organ transplants, and more. Overall, I gained so much knowledge about the structure of bioethics law as well as how it is evolving now.",

The course involved a good deal of memorization of court cases and legal details while also requiring analytical thinking and arguments.",

This course was truly eye-opening on how I viewed the overall healthcare system in the U.S. and what precedents have been established. This is one of my favorite courses I've ever taken because of the content and the professor.",
                "I learned a lot about bioethics in America like doctor\/patient relationship, abortion laws, etc. I am now better equipped to speak on many social issues in the United States. I also read about many impactful court cases, so I am better at reading about laws.",
                "This class was my favorite class at Yale by far. Not only was it relevant to current events but I learned the foundation of all health legislation within the US and outside. I am now more aware about the system I am a part of and even have a better understanding on how to navigate my own healthcare path. Finally the most incredible part of this course was the introduction of ethical debates, facilitated by Professor Latham and the TFS, that opened my eyes to the complex nature of creating standardized policy in many matters including new technologies like IVF, CRISPR and more controversial ones like assisted suicide and abortion.",

We also learned much about how the law around bioethics is formed, and gained insight into how the current law was shaped through studies of particular court cases.",

                "I largely came to understand many of the inefficiencies within our health care system and that there is no simple way to change things.

I'm not sure that there really is a weakness of this course, but I guess one thing that is a bit unfortunate is that your entire grade is determined by your performance on the two midterms and one final. That being said, the tests were graded quite nicely so it doesn't require too much work to get a B+ or A- in this class.",
                "professor Latham was such a great lecturer and made class very interesting. very clear that he is passionate in what he is teaching",
                "This class felt quite tedious at times and repetitive (though this may be just my personal bias against legal texts and courses). It feels\r\n\r\nProfessor. Latham is an amazing lecturer though and his lectures were very engaging and easy to follow. It is clear that he is very knowledgeable on the subject area through his constant usage and references of anecdotes and outside material.\r\n\r\nAt times though it is hard to tell what the main ideas that we were supposed to take away were though owing to his refusal to use presentation slides (though I personally did not find this an issue and actually greatly appreciated it). There are many court cases rapidly mentioned that are hard to jot down and get correctly. Luckily every lecture was recorded so it was possible to go back and review any concepts that were confusing.\r\n\r\nMuch of the reading was also very long and unnecessary and involved dry legal texts.",
                "great class to take to learn a lot",
                "Professor Latham is a wonderful lecturer and explains topics very thoroughly",
                "strengths - very informative, comprehensive, interesting, applicable, important \r\nweaknesses - no use of visual notes, simply the professor lecturing and taking notes based off discussions and readings",
                "Strengths - lots of interesting material, amazing professor, great TFs, and a perfect amount of workload that was conducive to learning and understanding without feeling overwhelming\r\nWeaknesses - Marsh lecture hall was far, and I wish that the connections between all the concepts were fleshed out more",
                "I thought this course was very well structured, had great content, and was overall enjoyable. Although I never had to use it, I appreciated having the option to watch recorded lectures during this crazy pandemic time. The only downside of this course was that the feedback was not very clear on exams. I would get a grade and marks on which points were good, but I wasn't sure where I had gotten marks off. The grading seemed a bit arbitrary. It would have been helpful to have a rubric posted afterwards to compare our answers to.",
                "Honestly this course was amazing, all strengths no weaknesses.",
                "One of the strengths is definitely Professor Latham. He is a really engaging lecturer and is very knowledgeable in this field. I also really liked how there were review sessions before midterms\/the final, but I wish they posted the notes from the review sessions or recorded them. That would have been really helpful for studying.",
                "The teacher is a great lecturer, I especially enjoyed his anecdotes. The best part of this course is that it is really interesting content, and so it is easily engagable.",
                "Strengths: really interesting and engaging, well organized\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: Assignments are manageable, exams are fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
                "Strengths: lecture style, Latham is an incredible lecturer and keeps people engaged even without slides.",
                "Strengths: the content is very interesting, and I always enjoyed Professor Latham's lectures. Weaknesses: I would prefer to have a final paper on a topic of our choice rather than a final exam. As much as I appreciated the chance to review the content, it would have been nice to further explore an area of personal interest.",
                "Lectures are very engaging and review sessions are helpful. TAs are nice (although not necessarily super helpful with the material) and the discussion posts help consolidate some of the material and allow you to formulate your own opinions. The assigned textbook reading is ridiculously long and just not realistic. I would recommend looking up the cases in the table of contents if you are interested. The supplemental readings are generally interesting and informative.",
                "The content of this course was interesting; however, the grading is extremely unclear.",
                "I don't have any complaints. Professor Latham is a fantastic lecturer, my TA made section engaging and interesting, and the exams were very fair.",
                "Strengths: Professor Latham is an engaging lecturer, the topics are really interesting, the exams are straightforward so students can focus on learning the material rather than anticipating trick questions, low stakes reading responses\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the reading responses had some weightage in the final grade so that the final exam does not have to be 50%",
                "Prof Latham is an outstanding lecturer who does not use slides, though his skill in speaking renders that fact a non-issue.",
                "The in person lectures are a must go. When you watch Professor Latham lecture in person it is wonderful and captivating, but via video & zoom it is not great. This is a great course!",
                "I don't think there are any weaknesses in this course. The strengths would be as follows: \r\n1. The lecture material is presented in an engaging way. Professor Latham has a dry sense of humor that keeps things interesting. He lectures without slides, which may seem weird at first, but it actually makes it easier to pay attention and focus. \r\n2. The course covers an extensive range of bioethics issues, allowing students to learn a little about everything.  \r\n3. The course is recorded and is able to accommodate students who may have to miss a lecture.",
                "Professor Latham is excellent, and the course materials are really interesting.",
                "I thought the course was taught very well and was very engaging",
                "Strengths: The course provided a very comprehensive overview of bioethics. The content was very interesting and organized in such a way that you learn so much about the US government and healthcare system. Everything is built on top of one another, so it was interesting to see how various issues had different intersections in their arguments. The lectures are very interesting and easy to follow, and the sections were also a time where we had a good discussion.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish our reading responses counted as part of our grade since we already spend quite a bit of time on them. But, otherwise, this course is really well designed.",
                "The course material is super interesting and the TA's are very helpful during sessions. The only thing that could benefit studying for the course were if there were lecture slides.",
                "The content of the course was super interesting. I really enjoyed lectures and sections. Take this class! Not a lot of work but super interesting!",
                "The lectures were extremely engaging. Another strength was the ability to tune in on Canvas live or after the lecture. A weakness of the course was that it did not seem very standardized when it came to discussion sections. Each TA seemed to grade and lead differently.",
                "Really interesting topics. Lots of weekly readings, would not recommending doing all of them. Just enough to answer the weekly discussion section question(s) and whatever Latham mentions in class.",
                "This course was fantastic - not many weaknesses. Only thing I can think of is better feedback on exams.",
                "Strengths include the lecturer and the teaching fellows. The course is about interesting content, but I still think that if someone not as passionate and talented as Latham were teaching it, then I would not be nearly as engaged.",
                "Great course!! Only weakness is that different sections have very different experiences",
                "The strengths are the breadth of information covered that is important to debate and engage with. A weakness is that more active discussion in class and section vs recalling the information could lead to better engagement.",
                "The course is very manageable from a work level standpoint and in many ways, students can engage to the level they would like with each topic. I think the lectures are the main strength, Prof. Latham is a great speaker and holds the classes attention impressively (even on the Zoom lectures at the beginning of the semester). The exams are fair and ask students relatively broad, answerable questions. One potential improvement would be offering choices on the exams for questions, maybe giving 3 and asking students to respond to 2. This way if they feel more confident with one question over another, they can show what they know more effectively.",
                "Strengths: This course was executed really well for a lecture course, and I think it's exactly what a lecture course should be huge professor-based lessons with smaller discussions in sections. I really liked the fact that a lot of the teaching fellows were YLS students, so they had a great foundation of legal information. Also, Prof. Latham did a great job including a wide range of bioethics issues hitting the U.S., and even some of the more current topics of COVID public health, and he's truly a great lecturer. \r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, this course didn't have many weaknesses. I would say that the only thing that I would note would be a low level of feedback, both on participation\/involvement and also on written assignments. While some assignments had some feedback, other would just receive a grade with no comments. Even some of my midterms just had a grade and check marks on certain key terms with no big suggestions. I think unifying this among TFs would be really helpful, especially for a political science course.",
                "Super interesting class, wish there was no section",
                "Lecture is super engaging",
                "recording made it hard to go to lecture rather than just watching",
                "The only improvement would maybe be some more organization via lecture notes - but strength absolutely is Latham and his engaging lectures.",
                "Strengths: lectures were super engaging and the material is really interesting. section was always lively because the topics are great for having productive discourse. the tests were fair and grading is reasonable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings werent super clear\/necessary. you could probably make it through the course without doing the all readings, but some of the readings are necessary so its hard to discern between which ones are necessary and which you can skip",
                "The readings are useful, but I think they could be more tailored. It was unclear which content from the textbook was necessary for us to know and at what level of detail.",
                "overal pretty solid, but exam grading was very arbitrary. If you word vomit and said the right buzz words you got a high score, if you wrote succinctly and answered the question with detail and explanation but didn't word vomit every relevant buss word\/case you got a lower score.",
                "I think it would be have been beneficial to have had slides or some form of other way to understand material from class. Latham just talking was interesting to me because I really liked learning about the topic, but could sometimes be dry or repetitive.",
                "The lecture style was great and the use of section to answer questions and think more critically worked well. Though I think a lot of people ended up Zooming into class, I always found the in person lectures more engaging, so I could see offering the online recording again next semester still working, with people who are more interested in the class still showing up in person to lecture.",
                "A strength of this course was its ability to be interesting an engaging without an unnecessarily large workload.",
                "The course was great.",
                "i really enjoyed all the topics and lectures that were given. no weakness really- although i do wish that the exams weren't weighed as high",
                "N\/A",
                "Strengths: Professor Latham is an awesome lecturer! He presents the material very well, and I always left every lecture pondering deeply on what he covered. From organ transplantation to assisted reproduction, every topic was interesting and remarkably relevant.\r\nWeaknesses: Grading can be harsh. You need to work hard for that A. Not a bad class to take Credit\/D.",
                "I think it would be great if Professor Latham couldve done any review sessions himself. He was such a great professor it was just a shame I couldnt see more of him.",
                "Strengths are the small sections where we break down what we learned. Weaknesses are size of class",
                "Strengths: Clear grading and feedback, engaging and clear teaching (Prof Latham is incredible and a leader in his field), interesting content, mix of philosophical, legal, and medical discussion. I came out of this class learning so so much!",
                "Strengths- extremely interesting and well taught",
                "Strengths: content is extremely interesting and presented in a thorough manner where I have left the class with a plethora of knowledge \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The course was well designed though it was a lot of lecturing. Professor Latham did a wonderful job at that, but incorporating visuals, perhaps through slide presentations as he lectured could prove useful.",
                "This course has no weaknesses.",
                "The live lectures were great, and Professor Latham is an excellent lecturer. It is more stressful though that all of our grade comes from midterm and final grades.",
                "I think the course does a fantastic job with its structure.  Lectures were always filled with plenty of content while sections served as great places to unpack the content covered.  My only complaint would be that some lectures felt a bit repetitive.  It is important to pick up where we left off in the previous lecture, but sometimes I felt like the recap was a bit too long.",
                "strengths\r\n-lectures are super engaging \r\n-exams are straightforward\r\n-material is very interesting\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n-what is expected from answers on exams could be clearer",
                "I think the course's strengths are its content and Prof. Latham's clear knowledge and passion for the material. He was one of the most engaging lecturers I've had at Yale so far, and that made the course so worthwhile to take. As for weaknesses, I think that there was to some extent a lack of engagement this term for a lot of the class, and part of that may be due to COVID-related accommodations that are roughly speaking unavoidable. That said, I also think part of it may have to do with the sheer volume of reading -- there's so much reading some weeks (in the multiple hundreds of pages) that doesn't come up in lectures or in sections that after a few weeks, a lot of students simply can't keep reading the assigned readings. I think truncating some of the readings from the textbook would have increased my engagement with the readings (and thus with the course and my section).",
                "It was awesome",
                "This class was really well structured in order to provide a general understanding of bioethical law",
                "The information was interesting and engaging. Professor Latham was very knowledge and explained info clearly.",
                "strengths: Professor Latham, discussions during section, the book readings are very interesting, the lectures are very engaging, well-structured, and easy to follow along\r\n\r\nweakness: none",
                "Strengths are that Professor Latham is a great professor. I felt constantly engaged during his lectures and was inspired to learn more about bioethics. Weaknesses of the course are that all you have to go off of are his lectures -- there are no lecture notes nor powerpoint slides as supplement.",
                "strengths: content was interesting and i definitely learned something new\r\nweaknesses: professor was super nice but the lectures were not that engaging",
                "Strengths are that I learned a lot of information in a little time. A weakness was that the grading is pretty harsh.",
                "It was great! Very engaging",
                "The strength is Prof. Latham and the pass\/fail weekly responses.",
                "This course had a great lecture, fair assessments, and good TF's. One of the great things about this class was the lack of problem sets or homework for the most part, but I wish there was more opportunity to engage with the material.",
                "Amazing course!!",
                "Strengthsfantastic lecturer, really interesting and relevant to today, well organized\r\nWeaknesses grading on exams is very picky",
                "The course content was well organized and presented well. Exams seemed to effectively cover the content. The reading assignments could have perhaps been more focused and shorter to encourage greater engagement with the most relevant material.",
                "More review and expectations when preparing for an exam.",
                "Professor Latham's lectures are great, engaging, informative; reading the casebook is difficult and not sure what Latham wants us to get out of the casebook what he doesn't already discuss in lecture",
                "more interactions with classmates",
                "The content of this course is super interesting  I would have loved to have seen the exams being less memorization and more application of what we learned to actual scenarios. It was a bit disappointing that the exams really only challenged our ability to regurgitate information as opposed to test our understanding of the material.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is Professor Latham. He conveyed the information in an engaging manner, and everyone could tell that his expertise and enthusiasm for the subject is on another level. It truly was an honor to be his student.\r\n\r\nI did not have any weaknesses in mind.",
                "Professor Latham is a very good lecturer, and that is a major strength of this course. Being that it is a lecture course, it is sometimes hard to keep students engaged. Professor Latham did a great job of making class fun and interesting. I truly enjoyed this course and would not list any weaknesses.",
                "There were two major strengths 1) Professor Lathams vast and deep knowledge on bioethics topics that he teaches so well and 2) the well facilitated sections that let me interest one on one with someone who knew a lot of answers and also gave me a clear picture and preparation of the exam. One weakness was the lack of attendance purely because the lectures were recorded and the hall was far away from most housing. I myself would have attended all of them if it was closer, but I ultimately did watch ALL lectures live and attentively. Also it was annoying having so many people typing on their laptops, when handwritten notes absolutely suffice. That was another reason why I tended to watch the live session.",
                "strengths are interesting material, engaging delivery method. difficult to study for exams but review sessions greatly helpful, sometimes frustratingly vague grading criteria, sometimes dependent upon tf personal criteria.",
                "The strengths of this class include the lecture format: he used no slides which made it actually easier to engage with since I wasnt scrambling to write everything down. Additionally, it was organized well.",
                "I really liked the class and the set up I thought that it was very well organized",
                "I wish that Professor Latham would have provided slides, notes, or even just a brief outline of the important information for each lecture.",
                "This course was amazing! The lectures were very well put-together and although they didn't follow any slideshow, I thought they delivered the information well and allowed for the professor to go in-depth about whatever topic it was that day, often adding bits of information about how current news related to the course content. One issue I have is that your grade is decided by 3 exams (2 midterms and a final). I think some more weight should be given to section participation and\/or your weekly reading responses.",
                "Such a great class. Strengths are Prof Latham. One of the best lecturers I've ever had. Going to class was like attending a Ted Talk twice a week- so engaging. Weakness is the amount of reading that can sometimes feel like an unnecessary addition to the content learned in class. Also, exams were very fair.",
                "This course is very fascinating, very straightforward, and the professor explained things well. However, there could be a bit more organization and there wasnt much opportunity for student engagement.",
                "I highly enjoyed this course and there is no weakness with the course.",
                "Great course, change nothing.",
                "I think the course was very well organized by issue, and it was very easy to follow along with the topics that the professor was discussing. An issue that I had with the course was that it seemed to be focusing on presenting different ethical issues, but not much debate and discussion arises from how to think about such ethical issues. The exams seems to be a regurgitation of material rather than an application of it in order to debate the ethicality of an issue.",
                "weaknesses - i wish there could have been more opportunity to showcase knowledge besides just exams; also, reading responses could have been more engaging and interesting if they were interactive discussion posts",
                "I loved the style of this course. Its facilitated learning and the material was engaging.",
                "This course was taught in a very comprehensive way. The workload was not too high but the lecture material was engaging enough that I spent time on it throughout each week. The lecture material being recorded made it very easy to go back to material that may have been confusing.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is that performance in the course is entirely dependent on which teaching fellow you are assigned. Although it is claimed that grading is standardized amongst teaching fellows, it clearly is not. Upon comparing exam answers with my peers who have different TFs it was clear that our exams were being grades very differently. They are even graded on a different numbering scale (some TFs grade out of 100 some grade out of 20), which makes it clear that grading is not standardized. In addition, the TFs present different information in their discussion sections and students are expected to recall different information depending on who their TF is. For example, a TF in one of the review session said they expected their students to mention \"penumbras\" in the answer to a specific type of question because they had discussed this in heavy detail during their discussion sections. However, I had not discussed this concept in my discussion section and it seemed unfair that we are required to know different information. If each TF is using different standards for grading, it is unclear to me how grading is being standardized as was claimed. This can be improved by having a more quantitative and standardized approach to grading, as well as a more standardized approach to what is being taught during section. \r\n\r\nIt is clear that there is a huge disparity in what is taught between sections by different TFs. I attended some sections led by different TFs as a make-up, and those TFs who are law students often focus heavily on case law (which can be beneficial in providing examples on exams), whereas my TF rarely ever discussed this and focsued on debating moral questions (which was beneficial intellectually but a disadvantage for exams compared to those who learned about many cases to reference)."

                "Totally recommend this course to everyone at Yale! It was one of my favorites. Very rewarding but easy class.",
                "Yes this is literally the best class ever - Prof Latham is the best lecturer I have ever had at Yale, the information is so interesting and relevant and he takes such complicated concepts about American healthcare and makes them so simple and easy to understand. The exams are straightforward, he's not trying to trick you. Absolutely a must-take before you graduate - best class I've taken at Yale.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is genuinely really interesting, Prof. Latham is a fantastic lecturer, and the content can lead to some really interesting conversations in section. Additionally, the workload is quite low which makes it a great choice if you want to take another class on top of an already rigorous worklaod.",
                "yes, even though I had no background in law, I was able to follow along and grasp the material that was being taught. All the concepts were so interesting and I would 100% recommend this course to everyone",
                "Definitely take bioethics!!!! Not only is the course-load manageable, but the material is fascinating and Prof Latham is a great lecturer.",
                "Broadly speaking, I would only recommend this course to someone who knows they're interested in law and legal texts or potentially curious in it. This class does serve as a relatively low intensity welcoming introduction to the intersection of law and public health while also covering many important issues. However, for someone not interested in law, I would not recommend this class as it is ultimately structured around various legal ideas and texts.",

I think many people can benefit from the kinds of discussions we had in this class, and I think this course can facilitate the path of improving the US healthcare system and maintaining justice in bioethics.",
                "Yes, a great learning experience that taught a lot about the most interesting issues in bioethics and health law without ever feeling overwhelming.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I myself was recommended this course, took it, and did not regret it. Especially if you are going into healthcare, this course makes you think critically about the ethics of the things you will be doing. There are so many things that you may not have considered before. Take this course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to every student at Yale. It is the perfect combination of every area of interest, combining science, technology, law, social justice, and so much more.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It's so interesting, the workload is fairly light, and the exams are fair. They do try to standardize the grading across TAs but I do think some TAs are fairer than others, which affects people's grades.",

                "Yes. The content is extremely interesting and useful for anybody who's going to at some point touch the field of medicine, bioethics, or law. For me as a pre-med, it's a side of healthcare you might not see anywhere else. Latham is a great lecturer and the 50-minute lectures ensure you're always captivated. Workload is essentially non-existent. If you need a gut, definitely take it. You can probably Credit\/D, never go to a single lecture, and still pass. If you are looking for an A, you will likely need to put in a decent amount of work, but still manageable.",

                "Absolutely! This is definitely a must-take course at Yale - easily one of my favorite courses I have taken so far. The content is really interesting and it's a relatively low workload class. The reading responses are only 5-6 sentences per week, and you'll be good for the exams if you are up-to-date with lectures (although exams have a fair bit of memorization).",

                "I definitely suggest this course to other students. It combines highly interesting information, a great lecturer, and a low workload! Workload is relative to how much interest you have in the class. You can do well in the class by simply going to the lectures, however your discussions in section will be more rewarding if you read the readings.",
                "YES!! you won't be disappointed",
                "This has been the best class I have taken in all my time at Yale. I would strongly recommend this course because I feel as though the course material is extremely interesting and it is taught well.",
                "Only a gut in terms of workload! Weirdly difficult to get an A, so if you're looking for that kind of course you might want to take something else.",
                "Yes, every person should take this course, regardless of if they are interested in going into healthcare\/law or not. The information taught in this class is extremely important to our society today, and everyone should be educated on these topics.",
                "Yes! It's a really interesting and low-stress course. The material is super interesting and highly topical and Professor Latham is a great lecturer. The workload and exams are not much at all if you keep up with the lectures.",
                "Yes. I felt as though I learned a lot in this course that will later be applicable to my everyday life",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. This was one of the best courses I have ever taken because it touched on so many issues that are relevant to the real world and healthcare. The lectures are phenomenal because the concepts make a lot of sense in the context that they are presented. I learned so much not only about healthcare, but also US and global policy in healthcare, law and various arguments, etc. I feel like I will be using a lot of what I learned in the future.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to any student, but especially if you are a political science major or an aspiring physician. I learned so much about topics that I had never really given much thought about before, and it has definitely changed how I view healthcare in the US.",
                "Yes! Super interesting content, and a really good intro law course.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student regardless of their major. It is gutty in nature up until the final as the final is worth 50% of your semester grade.",
                "Yes - fantastic course. Prof. Latham is an amazing lecturer and the topics are incredibly pertinent.",
                "YES. I loved this course and I have heard from many senior students that this was their favorite course of all 4 years. It's really interesting and the professor, Professor Latham, is really funny and incredibly engaging. I liked going to the lectures during the week and the discussion sections are fun too.",
                "100% would recommend. I loved this course and thought it was so fascinating. I think that it provided a lot of good insight and overview of a lot of bioethical questions.",
                "Yes! So interesting and not much work",
                "Would definitely recommend this course to someone looking to learn more about the most pressing bioethics issues in society. You get a good overview and an opportunity to take it further in section.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. It provides relevant information that give color to many of the ethical issues facing our medical and legal systems today. Professor Latham is a great lecturer who genuinely cares about teaching his students and the group of teaching fellows was well selected from diverse backgrounds.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a low stakes way to get your feet wet with some of the bioethics issues in the United States, as well as how they are handled by the law on mostly state, but also federal levels. The course included a lot of legal information, but also a lot of science-based information as well, so it could fill the buckets of a wide ranges of students. I think it was a little hard, though, to see how you would fare out throughout the semester grade-wise since so much of your final grade was based on the final, but it's overall a great course, and I would highly recommend it to all students, regardless of your academic interests.",
                "Yes its so interesting",
                "Yes, really interest content relevant to so many fields, and Latham is a great lecturer",
                "Yes! Very interesting topic",
                "Yeah. Great, chill class. Lectures are interesting.",
                "yes!",
                "ABSOLUTELY! One of the most engaging and enlightening classes Ive taken in my time at Yale. Im graduating and so grateful I decided to take this class. 100% a must-take. Latham is an incredible lecturer, Ive never been so engaged in a lecture even without visual aids.",
                "Yes, bioethics is relevant in law, society, and medicine; taking this course is a good way to get a worldly understanding.",
                "absolutely yes!! i loved this course!! the material is super interesting, engaging, and important but the workload is very manageable. i learned a lot in this course without having the stress of a burdensome workload. i really really recommend this course!",
                "Absolutely, for a broad overview of the handling of bioethics issues in U.S. law. However, it is definitely more law- than ethics-focused.",
                "This class is a staple class at Yale and all students must take it. The material is relevant and engaging and Professor Latham is great.",
                "I would! Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer and the topics that were touched on were very interesting.",
                "Yes, i feel like i learned a lot",
                "If you're interested in the subject then yes! If not, I think there are better classes to take if you need the social science credit. The fact that the only grades you get are from the 2 midterms (25% each) and 50% for the final is not great.",
                "I would recommend this course! I'm not studying public health or medicine but I thought this course was a great introduction to some of those topics, and is a really useful crash course into concepts which come up all the time outside of school. Prof Latham is a great lecturer and the workload is very managable.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially if that had an interest in health policy or ethics. The class also discussed topcs that were relevant to current day societal issues.",
                "Yes",
                "absolutely. this course was super interesting and very modern. i loved it",
                "Yes, it is a very manageable class and it has really current and interesting topics.",
                "YES! It is so prevelant to today and just super interesting. I loved the professor and my TA.",
                "Yes! A class that every Yale student should take.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The workload is not that high, and the material is interesting and relevant",
                "Yes, I would its super timely and applicable. I used some of what I learned in the class for my African American history final paper.",
                "Yes because it teaches you alot about why laws are out in place",
                "Yes 100%. Regardless of your background or major, this class will be interesting and engaging without feeling like a ton of work.",
                "yes very intellectually stimulating and talks about key current events",
                "I recommend this course to everyone",
                "Yes. I knew nothing about medical and legal systems before this class nor a lot of information about social bioethics issues today in our world. Yet, Im leaving this class much more equipped to engage in discussions.",
                "Yeah! interesting material but pretty chill class",
                "Yes. This is a fascinating course that is well worth the minimal time commitment.",
                "Yes, this class was very interesting for anyone even if completely unfamiliar with the topic.",
                "Absolutely. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Especially given todays political climate, bioethics is an absolute must take.",
                "Yes, as I learned about our legal and health care systems. This is information that has served me well already.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone remotely interested in medicine, law, or current events.  This course is a great mix of those three topics.",
                "Definitely! You learn so much from this class without having to put in so much effort. Great 5th class that is low work and very interesting.",
                "Absolutely, the most engaging and interesting course I have taken at yale.",
                "I would! I think that right now in America (and globally too), the issues discussed in the course are absolutely vital. I could not have thought of a better time to have taken this course. I also think that the amount of graded work and time commitment for the course (barring the readings, which I think may have been too long to feasibly do all of). All that said, I really enjoyed the course, and I think it's one of those \"classic Yale courses\" that people deserve to take.",
                "Yes! Best course Ive taken at Yale. Highly recommend. The content is super interesting and Prof Latham is awesome",
                "Yes absolutely the most engaging course Ive taken at Yale",
                "Absolutely - I loved this class, as a psychology major I was nervous going into it as I have no background in law but I learned a lot and really enjoyed the topics.",
                "Yes! I think everyone should take this class",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in medicine, bioethics, healthcare, and the law behind these issues. The course is very engaging and has been one of my favorite Yale courses!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes absolutely! I think this class is a great class to take just to understand the basics of the American health care system and why we are having the debates we are having now, from public health law during the pandemic to abortion debates. Overall, the class is well structured, the teaching fellows are great, the professor is amazing and I really enjoyed the class.",
                "yes, but you have to put a lot of time into studying for the exams because its a lot of material",
                "Yes, it was a great class that gave me a lot of background information that is necessary for people both in and out of the healthcare field.",
                "Yes!",
                "This course is a Yale classic. I would recommend!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is not a lot of work, yet I learned a lot and enjoyed lecture and section.",
                "Yes! Such an interesting class at the intersection of so many fields.",
                "Yes!!!!!!! This is my favorite course Ive taken at Yale. The course material is both really interesting and really useful.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I felt that it equipped me with more insight about the debates surrounding health-related issues to allow me to create informed opinions about these matters. I think the material was interesting and the class was a pleasure to attend.",
                "Yes! I loved this course for it's combination of medicine and the humanities. I would definitely recommend.",
                "cool class especially if you're not that in tune with public health, disability studies, or history of medicine; if you're HSHM or taking HSHM classes, the information isn't knew, but you get the law perspective to all these issues which can be interesting! exam essay questions aren't difficult especially because Latham and the TAs provide really helpful practice questions; sometimes it's pretty obvious with the main themes of the course what the exam questions will be",
                "Yes, material is very interesting",
                "Yes, 100%. Students of all majors should take this course. It is relevant to everyone and the issues that are discussed are things that people have encountered or will encounter in the future.",
                "Yes, Professor Latham is a great lecturer, and the class was one of the most interesting at Yale.",
                "Yes, absolutely!!! I loved this class so much.",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to another student!! It is fun and interesting and will serve you well in life. This is a course that many regard as one of the courses that Yale offers.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I was inspired and intrigued by every lecture and absolutely adored Professor Latham. Hes incredibly funny and passionate about this topic. I grew a real connection with my TF which I cant say about any other class and can actually remember everything taught. The tests are fair and give enough time and room to analyze in real time extremely complicated issues.",
                "100%. great, interesting, engaging political science class. constitutional law and its consequences in public health law, interesting nuance and consideration during important constitutional moments",
                "It was okay. I don't think the lectures really correlated with the case book readings, yet the midterms\/final are graded on memorization of details from the readings.",
                "Yes!! This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale thus far. I learned SO much and prof latham is an amazing and engaging lecturer. Highly recommend.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is super interesting and unlike any other courses Ive taken before. Professor Latham is also amazing.",
                "Absolutely, its very interesting and useful information",
                "Yes!!",
                "Yes",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Even if you do not have a background in bioethics, which most of us don't, somebody from any discipline could take this course. The content is very interesting and much of it (actually, most of it) is applicable to our own lives.",
                "yes! very interesting and enjoyable lectures to be part of",
                "YES TAKE THIS CLASS. The most engaging lecture I've ever attended. Workload is very light. Exams are fair. If you are looking for an intellectually interesting class with a really light workload, this is the one. However, it is not an easy A. While the exams are fair, they are all essay based, so grading depends on your TA. `If you don't care too much about getting straight A's, this is one of the best classes you can take at Yale.",
                "Yes - the topics covered in this class are fascinating, even if you don't plan on going into anything related to medicine or law.",
                "Yes! Course is exactly as advertised and Prof Latham is amazing",
                "Yes. This course is very interesting, and allows you a good insight into law and controversial topics. Even people who arent majoring in law or in anything related to it could benefit from taking this class.",
                "Yes. If you are looking for an easy and interesting class, then this is the right class. I would say that there is some issues if you get a harsh grading TA but other than that the class is amazing.",
                "Absolutely - favorite class I've taken at Yale so far.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. You truly do get to learn a lot about law in regards to different healthcare issues, and it is a pretty low workload class for those who are considering taking it as a 5th credit.",
                "Yes, this is truly a wonderful course that lives up to its hype! I've taken other popular courses at Yale that I felt I couldn't understand what was so great about the class even after I took it, but this course was amazing from start to finish. The reading load is a bit heavy but you don't need to do all of the readings to understand what is going on in the class (but the readings are very interesting and you do learn from it, so I always try to read as much as I can). The material is presented in a very organized way, and even though the field of bioethics is so vast, the professor does a great job of introducing it so that you don't feel overwhelmed. I was sad that we didn't have more time to go over more material!",
                "yes!",
                "Yes. It is very interesting and allows for learning with relatively low stakes.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the material was very interesting and can be beneficial for anyone to know, but especially for those looking for a career in biological research or medicine. This information also pertains to a lot of real world issues and makest them easier to understand. I also learned a lot about the US legal system which can have a lot of applications in everday life."
