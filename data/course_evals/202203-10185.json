                "I learned so much about how to write, and how to read like a writer, on a technical scale.",
                "Learned a lot about writing at the sentence level, as well as different stylistic moves one can use to share a non-fiction story with an audience in a subtle, yet clear manner. We looked at 5 different types of essays -- personal experience, person, place, cultural critique, satire -- and learned different techniques that model essays used that we can incorporate into our own writing.",

                "Strengths: Professor Shirkhani is the best writing instructor I've ever had. She will undoubtedly improve your writing and enable you to see/appreciate writing techniques and strategies. The word count of her feedback on each essay is almost comparable to the word count of the essay itself. The pieces you read are interesting and relatively short, making them easy to slot into your weekly workload. All of my classmates were so kind, intelligent, and funny, so I always looked forward to discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Probably the only weakness of this class is that it isn't particularly \"useful\" if you're looking for academic writing skills. I think most of the skills developed in ENGL 120 are more applicable to creative writing.",
                "Strength: the length of the assignments. The shortness of the reading assignments and the essays allowed me to dive deep into each and every one of them. Strength: The revision process. Both the workshops and the comments from the prof. were supremely helpful in improving what we had written in the drafts. Weakness: I sometimes felt like I couldn't speak up in class because some people just understand what it takes to be a great writer more than me.",
                "This is a great course! I wish we did a bit more workshopping, and some of the class discussions were not always incredibly engaging, but content wise I grew so much as a writer and wouldn't change much!",
                "Strengths: Prof. Shirkhani, the readings assigned for each class, class discussions, and David Foster Wallace (!!)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: can't think of any! writing can sometimes get difficult to balance with other work as you end up writing 5 essays and drafts/final versions for each one",
                "I thought the main strength was the balance between reading and writing - I would have liked if we had read more essays/workshopped more essays from our own class - I thought that was the most valuable thing we did. Also, my instructor's feedback was invaluable.",
                "Strengths: Essay meetings before final drafts \r\nWeakness: The discussions felt too serious, I didn't feel like I could just speak my mind because it felt like everything I had to say had to lead to some deep conclusion.",
                "Strength: made writing appear very formulaic by pointing out similar techniques used across different writers."

She can explain her thoughts on your writing and the writers you will read in a way that's understandable and helpful to anyone, even those who aren't great at writing. If you enjoy reading creative nonfiction and want to try your hand at producing some yourself, take this course. If you enjoy talking about writing and want to improve your ability to write well, take this course. If you want to better express your thoughts and feelings through words, take this course.",
                "Absolutely. I am not a confident writer by any means. I am a lab rat. I had no interest in english classes in high school. But this class was different. I learned so much, and had fun both reading and writing for this class. I learned about writing as an art, for the sake of writing, rather than writing to convey a message. My paper for the profile unit was the paper i am the most proud of having ever written. Take this class, but only if you will engage with it!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to explore your ability as a writer and take advantage of the seminar format and having your writing be workshopped by other students.",
                "I would recommend to anyone looking to get an introductory start to personal writing on a technical level.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was a really enjoyable way to improve my writing. And I learnt a whole lot and grew in confidence in my essays over the semester.",
                "Yes, this is one of the best classes I've taken so far at Yale!! It was so much fun to read essays each week (as opposed to more academic writing, or longer writing like novels), have the time to discuss them, and get the chance to try and recreate the styles and techniques we analyzed in the model essays. It was amazing to be able to get feedback on each essay, which helped me improve my writing during the semester!",
                "Yes, as my first english class at Yale I found it to be well rounded, accessible, and broad.",
                "I would. I love writing about myself, so anyone that loves to do that, should take it.",
                "If someone enjoyed seminars and writing this would definitely be their class."
