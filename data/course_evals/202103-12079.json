                "This course is one of the best intro art courses at Yale. Although it is a lot of work, it is very rewarding because of Henk's critiques, which are extremely helpful and straightforward. Unlike many other intro courses at Yale, Henk (and your classmates) don't hesitate to offer constructive criticism, which really helps you to improve your work and see where your visual language is unclear. It is a highly discussion-based and productive class. It is also really awesome getting to see everybody else's work. The only possible criticism I would say is that the School of Art doesn't offer many resources for creating, and undergraduates often don't know about places to print their work, etc. We don't have an open studio to work in outside of class hours, either. However, this is out of the class's control so it really just reflects poorly on the School of Art itself, not the class.",
                "It was perfect in pace and workload. I do wish there were more guest critics.",
                "Interesting projects/assignments with good breadth. A lot of time spent slowly evaluating work as a group which got a bit monotonous and unengaging as the semester progressed.",
                "This course is very interactive and engaging, and encourages everyone to participate during the critiques. It is very hands-on, with almost no digital elements.",
                "This course is very well taught and Henk does a fantastic job, but the course could be improved by possibly having a later section, giving the students in the class access to more of the art facilities, and possibly by having a TA.",
                "I liked the use of physical media to make compositions but I wish digital was more prevalent at the end of the semester.",
                "We often have critiques in class, which is really helpful for me to revise. Henk Van Assen is very honest and has high expectations, but is never hurtful. Even though he does not post a calendar schedule, he clearly says it during class so as long as you don't skip class and take notes then you won't be lost. Sometimes he thinks that he announced something even though he didn't, so be sure to ask if confused. Sometimes he changes his mind and gives contradictory feedback in critiques, which can be confusing at first, but don't worry, he understands that art is subjective and changeable so just try to follow your gut to make the best revisions according to all the feedback. I wish we had more guidance about how to actually make the projects to avoid getting criticized for imperfect handiwork, or wasting money getting the wrong materials and printing wrongly."

You will get no sympathy from Henk for the amount of time invested into each assignment (just like a real-life graphic designer and their clients, haha), but it is extremely rewarding to have your work actively critiqued by your professor and classmates. By the end of the semester you will feel more confident in your design senses and also a great portfolio of introductory work.",
                "Definitely. It is a great survey course on graphic design.",
                "Yes, it was a great introductory, studio based graphic design course. For students looking for a low-intensity introduction, it is a good fit.",
                "Yes! I think this is a wonderful intro course, and is for everyone and anyone who are interested.",
                "Yes! Henk is a fantastic teacher and you will learn quite a bit throughout this course, but be prepared to put the time in. This is not a gut by any stretch of the imagination - from the start of the course, you will have assignments you should be working on between every class. If you do this however, you will find yourself with a load of tools and words to describe and create design by the end of the course.",
