    "I learnt basic communication and sentence phrasing.",
    "A more intense understanding of French. If youve taken French before, but you get placed in L1, dont worry. Theres probably something that you never learned about before in this course.",
    "I was able to drastically improve my ability to read, speak, and write in French.",
    "I developed a broad overview of introductory French grammar, vocab, and pronunciation. I could carry on a basic conversation in French comfortably after taking this course."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Come away with a strong grasp of the language. \r\nWeaknesses - Extremely high workload, and unreasonably high expectations for getting an A.",
    "The course was very thorough and covered a lot of material, which was nice, but it wasn't very conducive to practicing speaking French because it was mostly direct instruction.",
    "Speaking was a weakness. Conjugations were a strength",
    "There were a lot of avenues for practice. However, sometimes, we learnt vocabulary specific only to certain contexts",
    "The strength of the course is the vast amount of material provided to study for the course. The weakness of the course was that certain areas were not fully explained due to the sheer amount of material that had to be covered. In order to improve the course, there should be a more clear coverage of all areas of the course study.",
    "Strengths: the immersion style; interactive lessons that required lots of speaking practice; repetition of the concepts for the week in various forms to help reinforce them\r\nWeaknesses: certain weeks required us to cover two lessons instead of just one, and there is not enough time in the week to properly cover two lessons in the depth demanded for the course\r\nImprovements: more coursepacket assigments\/worksheets to complete over the weekend as preparation for the weekly test; getting through the videos earlier in the week so there is more time for application practice"

   "comments": [
    "Only if they are very willing to put in the hours and really want to learn French.",
    "Yes, I think that overall, it was a good introduction to French. I thought the workbook and textbook were both very helpful. However, the videos were somewhat difficult to benefit from because they would use very fast paced French and, being completely new to French, the class often could not understand anything. It felt like immersion, but the expectation for what we would understand seemed very high.",
    "Yes because it is great way to learn a language",
    "Yes. It teaches the fundamentals of french",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it allows for a drastic improvement in your French abilities.",
    "I would recommend this course to somebody interested in learning\/reviewing introductory French concepts and building conversational skills. The course requires a lot of work, but you get just as much out of it by the end and emerge with a strong foundation in the French language"
