    "I developed a lot of knowledge about the academic studies of historical and contemporary protests and their elements.",
    "I learned about current and old social movements. The political theory that explain the success of different tactics, strategies, and organizations within protests and movements.",
    "Amazing class. Learned a ton about political protest theory and contemporary social movements. Prof. Hierro is incredible",
    "I learned the different qualities of a protest that dictate its direction and success. I also learned that the success of a movement is not easily defined.",
    "Knowledge: Theories regarding political protest, methodology in the study of protest, various fascinating case studies\r\n\r\nSkills: Practical insights regarding an organisation of successful social movements",
    "A both theoretical and practical understanding of political protest and social movements; a historically understanding of collective action as a political tool to affect change or enact individual agency; unbiased, informed methods of analyzing the political movements of today under various systems around the world."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings are really well selected and create for great and meaningful in classes discussions.",
    "I think the class was very well organized and facilitated conversation easily. Sometimes, there were discussions that I wish couldve continued or that there was more time to go into class discussion.",
    "The course was very strong overall. The biggest strength for me was my peers in the classthey were all super smart and I felt like I learned a lot from our discussions. I really am struggling to find a weakness with the course. Perhaps the level of feedback could have been a bit better. Everything (literally every assignment and assessment) was graded on a 3-point scale, which didn't really tell me much about how I did on more in-depth assignments, like the final paper. I also would've liked some more guidance regarding the final paper, I wasn't exactly sure what Professor Hierro was looking for. But overall, a very strong course! Great readings, great discussion, great topics.",
    "I thought the course was incredibly interesting and perfectly organised by Prof. Hierro. I really felt that the assignments helped me learn more.\r\n\r\nI would have personally liked to see more readings like the one on water wars in Bolivia - more descriptive, in-depth case studies of protest movements which can be taken apart by the class and analysed, but I understand that in the scarce time available during a semester it is perhaps more in order to focus more on analysing traditional journal scholarship and having pieces with ready arguments helps provoke a discussion.",
    "The course comprises of classical and more recent academic studies in the field, and uses case studies to great effect. The students are encouraged to understand events in different points of history in juxtaposition with one another, and to use these insights for investigating the current iterations of social movements. The course contains elements of social psychology, identity studies, political systems, etc. These are not simply mentioned but serve as crucial connective tissue for a holistic outlook on political protest\/social movements. I believe the course is an ideal forum for studying and discussing much of the unraveling events happening worldwide."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Great readings and a good teacher who really cares about the subject matter.",
    "Yes, I loved hearing different point of views from different students and Professor Hierro is absolutely amazing. I feel like I learned a lot about the positives and negatives of different kinds of protests.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Absolutely. One of the best courses of my time at Yale. But I would provide the caveat that the other students, not just the professor and the course material, are what made the class so good, so they should be honest with themselves about whether they are interested in what their classmates have to say.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course. It is in the top three classes of my 4 years at Yale. Professor Hierro is the most caring instructor I have met and discussions in the seminar were truly something I looked forward to every week.",
    "I would strongly recommend any student of comparative political science, political movements, identity politics, and international politics to take this course. It is one of the most insightful and instructive programs I have take at Yale, and I believe it will only become more relevant and informative in the years to come."
