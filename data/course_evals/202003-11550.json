I learned so much more about SARS-CoV2 than I thought I would ever know--so many things about the body's immune response, protein structure, etc. It was such a holistic view of the pandemic, and there was so much covered in those papers that we read in addition to the research that we did for our grant proposals. I learned how to write a grant, present it, and peer review other grants!",

I gained writing skills through the PSETS and grant proposal. More than that, I gained many insights into the wonder that is scientific research and the magnitude of collaboration among scientists. I gained this insight from reading different papers on SARS-COV-2 and connecting the dots between the knowledge of each paper and the emerging vaccines for SARS-COV-2 and antivirals such as Remdisivir. Moreover, I got to experience collaboration through working on the PSETS and grant proposal which led to a greater understanding of the material since discussing everyone's viewpoints leads to new insights and ideas.",

                "Strengths: The groups were very helpful to have as they made the assignments less daunting. The course was very relevant and engaging. Dean Chang is a wonderful professor who is always willing to help and offer guidance. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was sometimes hard to grasp the harder concepts in certain research papers we read.",
                "I think that one big strength for this course was the fact that much of it was guided by the students, and especially the discussions that arose when students asked questions. There was so much to be curious about in this course, and those questions definitely helped the entire class tackle challenges that were fascinating. Another big strength was that each individual group presentation solidified understanding of the paper and helped answer burning questions we may have had. One weakness of the course is that because p-sets were due before the presentations, sometimes, it was challenging to come up with an answer when we didn't know exactly what it was before having seen the specific group\/expert presentation.",
                "Strengths: Amazing class where I learned so much about the research surrounding the pandemic! It is so, so pertinent - you will be discussing about vaccines one week and seeing vaccines released another week! Dean Chang is such an exciting lecturer and makes you excited about science.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of work for a first-year seminar! The p-sets are challenging (but manageable) and Dean Chang challenges you by giving real, cutting-edge research papers rather than watered-down material. Presentations and writing the grant proposal are rewarding but stressful and work-intensive.",
                "What I loved about this course is being engaged in the latest COVID-19 literature and other latest biotechnology research. It helps me discover what I would want to research in the future. I would say that the only weakness about the course is the lack of a five minute break to go drink water or use the bathroom. Often times, I think that my lack of focus in the class stems from the two hour period without an interim period to process the information in the presentations or to get a snack or water.",
                "A weakness is that the course should provide more guidance on where to research procedures and methods for scientific techniques or tests run in labs. It seemed as if the professor expected students to be familiar with certain obscure procedures at times.",
                "The class is very engaging and Dean Chang is an amazing person! You will learn a lot about molecular biology concepts and techniques (and Covid). The class is organized so that everyone will get the opportunity to talk and share which is really nice for enriching discussions. Note that this class will most likely be filled with premeds and future grad students which can be intimidating though this makes the class only much more enriching as you will definitely learn a lot from your peers and be amazed at their breadth of knowledge.",
                "One of the strengths is that a lot of the learning you do about scientific papers is solidified in class because a group presents a paper every week. One of the weaknesses is that there isn't a lot of room for discussion outside of commenting on presentations because the majority of the classes are centered around a group presenting.",
                "Strengths: creates an excellent foundation for experience of what it's like to be a scientist. Very welcoming environment to facilitate discussion and exchange of ideas, especially on challenging and technical topics. No weaknesses!",
                "Amazing course! Would highly recommend",
                "The strength of this course is how engaged it is. There were only 21 of us, and everyone was very knowledgeable about biological sciences. This made our conversations very stimulating and we were able to discuss coronavirus and its pathology at a very high level. The weakness of this course was that it was kind of uncertain what Dean Chang wanted from us at the beginning, but as we went further in the semester it became clearer. Whenever we did an assignment for the first time, everyone in the class was slightly confused and asked each other questions. We also strayed from the syllabus and that caused confusion about deadlines and the work we were doing.",
                "I think the work for the class is highly valuable and gives essential skills to students regarding research and growth as scientists. I think the 2 hour lectures can at times be tedious but I think it is exceptionally valuable to be taken to grow as a student and researcher.",
                "One strength was the way we delved deep into the subject of COVID-19 research while learning many important biological techniques on the periphery along the way. One weakness, which may also be labeled as a strength in some ways, was the overly presentation-focused nature of the class. A potential improvement would be to allow more open discussion on topics.",

Sometimes it was difficult to stay energized throughout class because of its length and because of zoom fatigue, so this is one place of improvement.",

Given the presentation nature of the class, it was not all bad news for Zoom as presentations could be given through screen share and participants could unmute and raise hands as needed. The only hiccup is that free-flowing discussion was less possible when we couldn't sit face to face and see one another.",

I came out of this semester with so much knowledge about the virus (past just the symptoms and such), and I have found myself talking about things I learned in this class like the ACE2 receptor, the spike protein, etc. to my friends and family because it was so fascinating.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this for budding researchers, biologists, or people who want to go into medical professions.",
                "Yes, this course is my favorite from my schedule due to the small group size, great conversations with Dean Chang, and the exposure to the latest research and news of anything bio-related. If you dream of discovering new antibiotics, cure different types of cancer, or are thinking about graduate or medical school, this is the perfect class for you.",
                "Definitely. It may not give them the most exciting work, but the discipline needed to succeed in this course is something I think ALL students should try and develop.",
                "Yes definitely! Firstly, you get the opportunity to learn from the one and only Dean Chang! He is a really great and funny person and truly loves his students. If you are interested in doing any research in the future, I would greatly recommend that you take this course. You learn to write a grant proposal (and get feedback on it), how to present scientific journals, and a load about molecular biology concepts and techniques. While a huge plus of the class is that you get guaranteed summer funding, do be aware that the first-year summer fellowship isn't that difficult to get and I personally would not take the class just for that fact. The workload expected of you will definitely be dreadful if you have no interest in doing biological research whatsoever in any form. You are expected to understand concepts that are often taught at the graduate level and think and perform like a graduate student. You are expected to be able to research beyond the weekly paper assigned to understand the concepts and techniques used in-depth as they are often needed to complete the weekly psets. For the final grant writing assignment, you will be reading many many papers and expected to formulate a novel experiment project and work through all the nuances. While this may seem intimidating, Dean Chang does an excellent job in helping guide you through the process both of reading academic papers and writing a grant. Also, for the first semester, you do everything (psets, presentation, grant writing) in groups of 3 which makes the experience so much more enjoyable (the second semester you still present and do psets in groups but you are expected to write a grant on your own with a mentor you identify). If you take this course, you will definitely be satisfied with how much you learn by the end. Do note that this is a one-year-long course and this review reflects only the first semester.",
                "Yes! This is a really fun and interesting class if you like reading about science and biology. Learning how to read scientific literature and write grant proposals is also an invaluable skill if you want to do scientific research. It also really helps improve your presentation skills!",
                "Absolutely!!! Take this if you can! You will learn so much about being a scientist in the real world and be given a very honest and fresh look into such a fascinating career. Even if science doesn't pan out for you, you will gain so many skills on how to interact with difficult topics and engage with a community to learn and discover together. Take this class!!!",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Absolutely would recommend if interested in science and research!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with a strong background in biological sciences and an interest in research. This course was very stimulating, and we engaged in advanced scientific discussions. Additionally, the final was a grant proposal for a cure for coronavirus, so this course requires creative thinking, hard work, and motivation to research. Everyone in the course plans on majoring in STEM and working in a STEM profession, so if you aren't interested in that, the class's environment may seem intimidating.",
                "Yes, I believe this class offers exceptional research opportunities under Dean Chang's excellent guidance and also teaches important skills that can really help individuals grow as young scientists and spark their interest and path into research.",
                "I would. This course has helped me develop skills that are extremely important for my path in biological research and I think this class has put many of us ahead of the game.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course because students can learn incredible amounts about current research, and it can also help guide students who are interested in pursuing a related career in life sciences.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in the sciences, as while it may be challenging at first, it is incredibly rewarding, and I believe the skills you learn throughout the course to be invaluable.",
                "Yes, if you like scientific research this is the class for you. It's very student led, involves a lot of group work, and you can't be afraid to ask questions. You learn a lot in the class and it really teaches you how to read\/understand scientific papers, learn to conduct your own scientific research, as well as how to write grants."
