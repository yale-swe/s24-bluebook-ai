Sometimes I felt like there wasn't enough advice or criticism given.",

                "4 essays is good. turnaround is tight but the weeks off are nice",
                "The strength of this course was that it truly improved my writing with how much we had to write. The feedback on all the drafts were also super clear. In addition the discussions were always lively and intriguing. One improvement that could be made is in the discussions. Sometimes, it felt like some points weren't discussed enough as there was no time for response. The professor would call on all students and then let them take turns speaking in order. This made it so that sometimes, one person jumped to another topic, not allowing the previous topic to be delved further into. This could be improved by taking some time to just ask, \"Does anyone want to respond to this point?\"",
                "I thought this course was very strong - only wish we had more class time!",
                "This was one of the best classes I've ever takenthe engagement is unparalleled, both from Morgan and peers. I loved the pieces we got to read (so well chosen), and Morgan guides us through them well. Morgan also gives amazing, in-depth feedback for essays that really allowed me to challenge myself and improve them before the final draft. Getting the chance to read the work of my peers has also been such an honor: everyone had such a distinct voice, and I'm so glad I got a window into everyone's world all while learning from them. Peer review sessions and class discussions were also helpful and active. I have no complaints about this class."

They taught me to think about the bigger picture and think more abstractly, especially as a STEM major. In addition, the types of essays in this course are different from ones I've done before. I am used to doing academic writing and writing in the same format and template every single time; however, with this course, I was able to write about my personal life and discover my own voice as an author.",
                "Absolutely - this is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "100%! I cannot recommend this class enough. You can get so much out of it, and explore parts of yourself that you haven't had a chance to uncover. Though sometimes the writing turnaround can be fast, the workload is never unreasonable. You get a chance to engage with and learn from peers in such a lively, inspiring way. This class is an absolute joy and I cannot recommend it enough for students of all majors."
