It developed my skills to be able to access the richness of philosophy texts, and how to respond to these texts by asking insightful questions. I also learned to challenge my own beliefs, and found a process to filter information that I learn.",
                "This course made me look at the world in a more introspective manner that revealed how interconnected the norms and assumptions we live by are.

Another big theme throughout the course was the intersectionality of gender with race, class, sexuality, etc. Also, I learned how to critically read and analyze philosophical papers about gender and masculinity.",

                "This course was fantastic. I would say the biggest strength was that everyone was extremely interested in the topic at hand which allowed for great discussions. I would say that the only weakness this course had was that oftentimes the reading for class would be so dense that breaking down the text (to help us understand it) would take way too much time and would leave little time to discuss the larger picture.",
                "This course was very well organized. Each reading built on knowledge from questions explored the previous week which made the course cohesive and fulfilling.",
                "The course had great readings, lively discussion, and interesting guest speakers. Most days I felt we ran out of time to give the readings their due justice but besides that I felt the course was exciting and well structured.",
                "Loved every second.",
                "More connection with the professor",
                "Professor was greatly helpful and adept in leading, prompting, and continuing thoughtful discussion about reading materials. Course materials are somewhat consistent in format (written philosophical text), which can be taken as either a strength or a weakness of the course.",
                "I enjoyed the seminar style of this class. It kept us engaged. I would have liked some more guidance about how to read philosophy papers and maybe define some key philosophy terms.",
                "This class was the most engaging class that I took this semester. The material was relevant and exciting, and I always felt eager to learn more. I cannot think of any weaknesses of this course.",
                "Strengths: Everything! The readings are fascinating, the discussions are interesting and lively, the professor (Dembroff) is totally inspirational and whip-smart.",
                "This was an incredibly strong course. I appreciated the intimate, breakout-room-oriented format, as I believe it helped ensure that all students were engaged. I also think the unique grading approach aided in student engagement with material that would be too intimidating otherwise. I wish that there had been more writing throughout the semester.",
                "Student engagement was super strong; the discussions we had as a class was non-stop and lasted up to 30 minutes. Students were held accountable by: 1) having a discussion question ready for every class and 2) discussing in smaller breakout rooms. \r\nFor someone with zero background on philosophy, it was, at most times, hard to contribute to the discussion. Because there was no vocabulary review or a general run-down of the reading, it was difficult to keep up with the conversations."

                "This class, from my perspective, had the best structure for proper Zoom learning. The expectation of having a presentation followed by breakout rooms for discussion meant that we all got to participate and voice our thoughts in an organic, safe manner and the expectation of an end, communal discussion meant that there rarely was any awkward Zoom moments. I loved this class for this very reason. It was as close as you could get to what I would expect is an in-person first-year seminar.",

                "I think this class worked very effectively despite the circumstances provided by the pandemic because of the small seminar environment.",
                "The majority of the course assignments were twice-weekly discussion board posts, in which each student developed and motivated a discussion question based on the assigned reading. Though I sometimes scrambled to finish my posts, I found them to be a good way to recap what I had read and formulate a cohesive response to the material. Professor Dembroff was also very chill about discussion posts turned in a few hours late, though they were sure to let us know when it was crucial that we turn in our questions on time (for instance, if we were expecting a speaker the following day). This flexible approach made this class well-suited to virtual learning.",
                "There is little room for improvement, but I think that limiting the time students are allowed to spend on in-class presentations would help. Some students finished within 15 minutes, while other presentations filled the entire class time.",
                "The assignmentsbi-weekly comments on the Canvas course pageheld students accountable while also allowing students to have one thing to contribute to the discussion. The professor often asked questions that would allow the discussion to continue."

                "Absolutely! Although I don't really enjoy philosophy itself (and doubt I will take another philosophy class) I enjoyed the topic at hand. I would highly recommend this as an introductory philosophy course as it introduces you to the realm of philosophy using both philosophical and non philosophical texts. The workload itself might be low but the course, by no means, was easy. You have to be willing to read and reread texts until you can fully understand them.",
                "Yes. I think that it is important for every student to take a course that challenges the way they think about the world. This course made me challenge many of my beliefs, and it was an incredible opportunity to be able to discuss some of these things with other students, professors, and professionals in the philosophy field.",
                "Yes, I already have. Professor Dembroff was great and the readings made me turn inward whilst looking outward. This class was the best choice I made this semester.",

                "Yes I would. We discuss topics that are so essential and prevalent in the world we live in. It is important to be aware of how these issues occur in our lives and Professor Dembroff provides great insight into patriarchy and masculinity, allowing us to discover and see multiple perspectives to come to our own conclusions.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, even if they are not a philosophy or WGSS major. The material that is covered in this class will completely change the way you think about our society, in which gender is a potent and active force.",
                "YES! 100%. This course was by far my favorite course that I've taken at Yale so far. If you have the opportunity to do so, take this class, or any class that's offered by Prof. Dembroff. They are an incredible professor and the material is so interesting and relevant.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. I think that it was a phenomenal first experience at Yale, especially as a stem student, to be able to experience philosophy as directly applicable to my daily life. It is one of those few courses that can alter perspectives, while not having any prerequisite knowledge.",
                "I would recommend this course to first-years because, despite not having a background on philosophy, I was able to at least contribute one thing in each of our class discussions. The professor is very understanding and offers a great introduction to philosophy."
