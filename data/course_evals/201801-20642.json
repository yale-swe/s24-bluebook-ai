    "A unique approach to Comp Vision, differential geometry, EM, mixture models, diff maps etc.",
    "This was an awesome class.  It was a very broad overview of a whole world of computer vision.  Unfortunately (maybe?) this isn't a class where you come in and leave able to build a computer vision-based app.  You end up getting a broad overview of differential geometry, statistical methods, the theory behind computer vision, and research that Zucker has done or has heard about recently.  It's a great opportunity to become more curious about the subject matter.",

   "comments": [
    "Strength: extremely interesting topic, very enthusiastic professor\r\n\r\nWeakness: The topics are pretty complicated so you may not be able to master everything to a detail you'd like.",
    "The strengths of the course are that it covers such an expansive net of material!  I learned about things I hadn't previously heard of, so it serves as a great springboard for future work.\r\n\r\nThere were weaknesses, however.  Prof. Zucker's lecture style is unfortunately disorganized.  The material is so broad that having such disorganized lectures leaves you floundering until Luciano (the TA) comes in, tells you it's simple, and explains it more clearly.\r\n\r\nPerfect example: notation.  It is hard enough to wrap your (or at least my) head around differential geometry.  It is a really cool subject, but it isn't really easy.  So when you have i's and j's that switch our for a's and b's or p's and q's, it is just a huge mess.  Same thing for easier concepts like backpropagation. They are tricky to organize, but if well organized are not hard to learn. If Prof. Zucker took the time to clearly structure his lectures, type out the scrawled notes he occasionally posted online, etc. the class would be 10x better.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like I'm just going to town with critiques, but this is one of the better classes I've taken simply because of the content, Zucker's enthusiasm, and (of course) Luciano's help.  I've left with the full intention of continuing to study computer vision into the future!",
    "Tries to cover too much in too short of a timespan, but he and the TA makes sure to emphasize what the important points are in the class, and the rest serve as inspiration.",
    "A lot of the lectures were quite intense- material was kind of hard to follow without a lot of mathematical background. I think having clear, typed lecture notes available online would help too"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, good class, reasonable workload.",
    "In no other single course can one learn about differential geometry, deep networks, and the neurobiology of the visual cortex. I'd certainly recommend it!",
    "Absolutely.  Se my prev. answer for details.",
    "Is a weird course - it's very much dependent on self-interest because it's not particularly structured and requires students to do exploring on their own. It's certainly an extension of the first semester, but with even less instruction than before. The subject is fascinating, but the course is not very organized and as a result many topics get lost in the clutter.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in how the brain processes images, identifies objects, etc. Also touches on deep learning.",
    "Yes, if youre willing to deal with some disorganization. Professor Zucker and Luciano are great, brilliant and approachable. The class structure is a little messy though"
