                "This course is a great introduction to exploring the archives and resources of the Beineke\/Sterling libraries. If students have limited experience with doing archival work and want to learn more about it, this class is a great way to do so. The papers also introduce to writing with a number of different historical goals in mind -- summarizing archival documents, evaluating historiography, research, etc. This is a great introductory class for students interested in taking higher level history classes at Yale.",
                "I learned a lot about historical research; this course gave me the opportunity to explore Yale's libraries and archives and to use the Congressional Record, both of which were very interesting. I also learned a lot about the 20th century in America on a deeper level than I did in high school solely because I was reading almost entirely primary sources, which was a wonderful opportunity to be able to analyze the thoughts of people living history.",
                "This class provided me with the knowledge to better understand the major events of twentieth-century American History as well as the continuity and discontinuity between these events. I appreciate that the class utilized a variety of perspectives to analyze this period, rather than merely analyzing historical trends through the lens of one specific entity, such as Presidential Administrations or intellectual thinkers.",
                "Professor Gage is really into communism\/anti-communism debates\/history so the course quickly develops an overarching theme that communism and anti-communism exists as a very present idea within 20th century American history (that drive or influence many other historical narratives) and I agree fully with this assessment. Its basically the second half of APUSH but in much greater detail, you get beyond the 1960s in a more thorough way (to 2001!), and its taught much better.",
                "My biggest takeaway from this course was a reminder that patterns and trends in history are recurring between different time periods. I was struck by the amount of times we discussed trends in the 20th century that seemed similar to trends in the present or in recent 21st century history. Skills-wise, the biggest thing was definitely the introduction to doing primary source research using Yale's resources  i.e. the Manuscripts and Archives in Sterling Library and the Sterling Library stacks.",
                "Overall survey on 20th century US history",
                "A broad understanding of 20th century political history, including ideology over time and the constraints that political institutions place on how and when change is made",
                "Good historical summary of 20th century. Definitely didn't do the interwar years or 80s\/90s justice, but course overall was pretty good",
                "This course offers an in-depth exploration of the history of the 20th Century, including its politics, major social movements, and broader trends. While this was certainly not my first time taking a course about American history, I think that this course does offer a unique perspective that may not be found in a typical high school class.",
                "I learned how to look in archives and synthesize lots of old documents.",
                "I got to explore in relative depth the 20th centuries history as well as the literature that came out of these moments.",
                "I did the writing intensive version of this course so got more practice in writing\/editing research papers. Provided me a comprehensive understanding of the 20th century that I wasn't able to get in AP US history.",
                "Developed my overall knowledge of American History",
                "I learned about immigration, war, civil rights, labor rights, movements, politics, and economics throughout the 20th century.",
                "American Century gave a broad overview of the 20th century. Each writing assignment made students engage with the Yale archive system in different ways. I have a much better understanding of navigating the library system for future classes.",
                "Learned how to use the Yale library archives, stacks, and the congressional record. Also learned about US politics, major events, and social movements of 20th century.",
                "I  gain a basiced but valuable understanding of American History in the 20th Century. The information that I learned felt pertinent and important.",
                "I learned to be a much better history student from this course, and I felt that my knowledge of American history was enriched by this course, beyond the revolutionary-war-heavy APUSH class I took in high school. At first, I was skeptical of this course because it felt like it was too ambitious, trying to capture too much history in too little time. However, this course ended up being one of my favorites, because it revealed thematic, recurring threads interwoven throughout the 20th Century of the US, instead of merely chunking it into disjointed decades.",
                "I legitimately learned so much about 1900s U.S. history. COVID cut out the latter half of my APUSH class, so I feel like this course filled in that gap.",
                "I cannot honestly say that I gained a great deal of new knowledge from completing this course. I strongly believe that the AP US history course offers a more accurate and valuable narrative surrounding the history of the United States. The progressive narrative furthered by Professor Gage leads places disproportionate emphasis on certain minor social and political happenings. As a result of this, the coverage of certain topics such as the Great Depression and the second world war feels rushed and inadequate.",
                "I learned about 20th century American history, who to use the stacks, how to request archives, and how to see government databases and analyze primary sources.",
                "I learned about the 20th century in a pretty comprehensive manner. It's somewhat similar to a US History class in high school, but not in a pejorative way, as it goes much deeper. Also, I got good feedback on my essays, and definitely became more comfortable with doing historical research at Yale!",
                "I learned a lot about the evolution of political ideologies in the US in the 20th century and the major trends shaping American society over the same period. I also learned how to write short historical papers using primary sources.",
                "A working knowledge of Yale's various library\/manuscript services, a foundational knowledge of notable events and the course of political continuity and change from 1900 to the present",
                "As someone who has never taken a history class at Yale, never learned about American history before, this is the perfect class for me. I learned about not only the facts but the general themes and discussions that was present throughout the 20th century US. I gained skills such as going into the archives, research in the library stacks and in the congressional records. Great class on developing both your historical insights and research skills!",
                "Gained knowledge about how to Library systems at Yale works; specifically the manuscripts & archives libraries, how to do research in the stacks, and how to navigate the Congressional Record. It was also a solid historical recap of the 20th century.",
                "Gained a deeper understanding of the 20th century as a pivotal moment in American history.",
                "Significant insight into politics, foreign policy, social movements, and environment of the 20th century.",
                "In-depth knowledge of 20th century American history that challenged my perspectives.  Ability to conduct primary source research and how to write a history paper.  Understanding of historiography.",
                "An in-depth look at the 20th century, the events and people that made it the American Century.",
                "How to research in the library",
                "I gained thoughtful and extensive knowledge and insight into the political and social developments in America in the 20th century and the foreign relations which contributed to those movements and changes.",
                "I learned a lot about the 20th century. It was a very well-rounded course and covered events from both high politics as well as the perspectives of a lot of different demographics.",
                "One skill that I learned was how to analyze primary historial records at a college level. Much of our essays were focused on looking at archives from Congress, the libraries of Yale, and other primary documents, meaning that I had a lot of firsthand experience with history. As someone who is interested in majoring in history, this helped me understand how history is actually done at a higher level, and gave me experience in what might be what I do for much of my life. I also learned about an entire century of history, going from as far back as the late 19th century to the end of the 20th century in US political, international, social and economic history.",
                "Solid overview of political history and the social movements of 20th century American history. I appreciate this course exposing me to research through Yale's library system; super useful for future history courses and beyond!",
                "I developed a better understanding of the overall political trends and social movements throughout the twentieth century in the US.",
                "I learned a lot about the political landscape of the United States in the 20th century during this course.  I also learned how impactful certain events and people were in the grand scheme of the 20th Century.",
                "This course is a survey course. It goes chronologically through the 20th century, covering political, economic, and social history. The course is not in depth at all, and it might be pretty repetitive if you took US history in high school (it was for me). Still, you will certainly learn new things in lecture. The most interesting part of the course for me was the papers, because they gave me the ability to go deeper into areas I was interested in and also learn more about the Yale library resources. I took the WR version of this course, and I found the final paper to be an extremely interesting assignment.",
                "20th century American history, going over the themes of Communism, Race\/Immigration Inclusion\/Exclusion, Political parties, and Federal Power.",
                "In depth and interesting learning surrounding 20th century American history.",
                "This course was a great introduction to the study of history, and even as a senior history major, I still feel like I got lots out of the course. I practiced writing historiography, analyzing primary sources, and looking through the congressional record. I also got a better idea of macro history in practice -- the twentieth century contained so so much, and I really appreciate the difficulty of teaching such an event-filled time period. I learned how to approach American history with a critical lens, and appreciated how events could be interpreted vastly differently. I also really really appreciated how I can now organize in my head what major events and platforms are associated with which consequential presidents, and I feel that I got a much better understanding of the history of the two major political parties in the United States.",
                "A comprehensive overview of political history as it relates to the United States during the 20th Century.",
                "The course provided a good overview of American history in the 20th century while also allowing me to develop my researching and writing skills through its written assignments. The writing section allowed me to have my first experiences writing a true historical research paper, something I will be doing more of in the years to come.",
                "I learned about how the US's political ideology evolved during the 20th century. I learned about the rise and fall of immigration, civil rights, and labor movements.",
                "The course provided a broad overview of the American 20th Century--perhaps one of the most impactful periods in global history. The fast pace helped me understand broad themes of the era and the writing assignments helped connect us with the incredible archival resources available at Yale.",
                "I gained a comprehensive overview of the major events, people, and themes of 20th century US history.",
                "In this course I developed broad knowledge of the history of the 20th century in America. I also developed my writing skills.",
                "I learned more about the Unites states history and the research process",
                "Better understanding of US History as a whole, explaining why we are where we are today.",
                "Understanding history from documents.",
                "This course goes all throughout the 21st century, and touches on major events of the time period",
                "I developed a comprehensive view of America in the 20th Century. I gained an understanding of what Professor Gage posits as the four main themes of the century: 1) Communism & Anti-communism, 2) War & Conflict, 3) Race, gender, and immigration policy, 4) government expansion.",
                "a detailed narrative of historical events and trends in 20th century America, researching and history essay writing skills.",
                "knowledge of the history, Yale's resources",
                "I learned a lot about the different social and political movements that defined the 20th century and continue to be relevant to modern trends. I also learned how to effectively sift through and analyze different primary sources, navigating the archives in the Beinecke and the Congressional Record.",
                "Lots more about history",
                "Critical thinking skills when reading political readings.",
                "I developed a really, really in-depth understanding of American politics and history. This course granted me a great foundation of knowledge to base future study of American politics, history, culture, and economics on. I really appreciated how we not only learned about specific events and figures of the various time periods we examined, but also larger themes connecting them to frame our analysis.",
                "I acquired a much better understanding of the timeline and structure of US politics.",
                "This class was a great introduction to the research process.",

                "It was overall a really good analysis of the 20th century for America. Easy to track trends and get good analysis through it",
                "Full, in-depth understanding of 20th century American History",
                "Learned valuable research skills such as how to navigate the congressional record, how to request resources from the Yale Archives, and how to look for sources in the Sterling Stacks. Also learned the changing nature of conservative and liberal politics\/parties\/coalitions over the course of the 20th century, and it was fascinating to see how many of the political and social discussions which defined the 60s-90s mirror those we have today. Professor Gage really did a good job of contextualizing events within the big picture. Surprisingly, I also learned lots of dates for when things happened, too.",
                "This was a great survey course of American history that made an effort to touch on more complex themes than APUSH or a high school class. Prof. Gage is really good at structuring the lectures so that you can take clear notes, study big facts and ideas, and write papers over a number of topics.",
                "I gained a much more thorough understanding of 20th century history and a greater ability to analyze historical sources (archival material, the Yale stacks, and the Congressional record).",
                "How to conduct research in history, including in the Stacks, in the archives, and via the Congressional Record. Also how to look at a time period and observe overarching patterns.",

Also focused on the role of federal power in a variety of issues  civil rights, immigration exclusion, the economy, etc.",

                "This was a great course! I had already studied 20th century American history pretty extensively, and I still feel like I learned A LOT in this class. It was fascinating to trace communism and anticommunism throughout the century and to look at the evolution of party politics. The readings also provided a lot of interesting context that is left out of traditional high school history classes. The writing assignments also taught me a lot. Each of the three assignments focuses on engaging with a different part of the Yale library system, and this taught me a lot about how to take advantage of library resources at Yale and how to write about different types of primary and secondary sources.",

I had taken classes about 20th century US history before, but nothing this in-depth, and I felt like I was gathering not only facts but a wide range of opinions about the facts and events. I got better at reading essays and books from 50-90 years ago, and synthesizing what I was learning in the lectures when I wrote papers.",

The papers are not too daunting while still providing a bit of intellectual challenge and introducing students to modes of writing that might be new to them. Lectures are engaging and will make most students question the common narratives of certain decades\/historical eras.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not a fault of the course itself, but given that it's a survey of an entire century of history, expect breadth of depth.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were engaging and well-given, and content was interesting (I loved Professor Gage's trope of introducing each lecture with a timely song). The three papers were all manageable lengths and fun research to do, and I enjoyed the emphasis on primary source analysis both in readings and in papers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was just more surface-level than I would have liked, but that's really unavoidable for a lecture course with such a broad subject matter.",

For example - prior to this class, I believed that FDR was a President who always had incredibly high approval ratings, but this class taught me that there were many years in which the New Deal policies were proving to be quite ineffective and FDR ultimately experienced some significantly low ratings.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gage, the readings, many facts about the 20th century being filled in, lots of emphasis on how the history compounds and influences later histories. The papers are easy, fun, and get you into some historical modes that most non-majors would otherwise never get into.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some readings are very long, lecture material often feels too familiar, Fukuyamas interpretation of Hegel in The End of History reading (lol, this reading was still a good selection though)",
                "Strengths: the 3 writing assignments, which provided a good introduction for doing some hands-on research using Yale's resources (Sterling Library stacks, Sterling Manuscripts and Archives, etc.). Also, I enjoyed the chronological structure of the course, which helped me recognize patterns \/ recurrences of similar trends between different time periods in the 20th century and between then and now. Also, my TF was awesome and Prof. Gage is a great lecturer. I really enjoyed her lectures and the minimal words she put on her slides, which helped me better focus on what she was actually saying. \r\nWeaknesses: It was easy to get disengaged with the course as a whole sometimes. However, I would say that this isn't a problem with this class in particular, but with many lecture courses. Either way, the spacing out of assignments and midterm\/final helped me get back on track without being disengaged for too long.",
                "Strengths: professor Gage, getting into the archives\r\nWeaknesses: a repeat of APUSH, too many assignments (3 essays and 2 exams)",
                "great course, no critiques",
                "Strengths: Gage is a solid lecturer, definitely knows what she's talking about. Course is structured pretty nicely too\r\nWeaknesses: Reading selections were subpar (a lot of primary sources that weren't that helpful or informative; it kind of seemed like they were just included for the sake of having some primary sources in there). Also, for a gutty history lecture, there were way too many readings. There were a lot of weeks where it was pretty obvious in section that only two kids did the reading. The papers were kind of awful. As a first year, it might have been cool to use the archives for a paper, but as a senior it's just excessive.",
                "I think this course is very well taught. Professor Gage is a very engaging lecturer and she manages to make the course interesting even to such a large number of students which is impressive. I think a weakness of this course in general is the structure of the discussion sections. While I think the lectures themselves are great, I think the experience in the section can be more variable. Sometimes I felt like my section could be chaotic and that it was too large to effectively allow people to share their ideas or actually get a deeper understanding of the lecture. In my personal experience, I dont find that the section helped me at all better understand the material or gain something unique from the regular lectures. Another related flaw I see with the course is just how variable grading is based on who your TF is. From my friends who were in the course yet in different sections, it seemed that some TFs were much stricter than others and had different grading policies. I understand the subjective nature of grading an essay, but I think the course could do a much better job in trying to at least centralize the grading methods as much as possible between TFs. Unfortunately, it seems like a large part of someones experience in the course will be arbitrarily determined by their TF.",
                "I thought there was a disconnect between what professor Gage thought the level of difficulty was and my TA. I think she thought they were fun explanatory essays that were low-stakes (and thats why we had so many of them on top of the weekly reading response + midterm +final). However, my TA had very high expectations for the essays, suggesting we go over 5 pages and sometimes even spill into 6.",
                "The course was well organized.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gage's lectures are truly encapsulating, reading is manageable most of the time, jam-packed lecture that doesn't take too much time\/outside work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: reading towards the end of the course got a little heavy, but you're still able to skim but still get the gist of it; Prof Gage can go really fast through lecture especially towards the end but section helps out with this",
                "Weakness: we did not always go in chronological order and it was confusing for a course like this",
                "Strengths: Professor Gage is a FANTASTIC lecturer. Class flew by because I was engaged the whole time. The material is also super interesting and might challenge your ideas of american politics and society.\r\nWeaknesses: readings were sometimes overwhelming",
                "Strengths: For the non-WR section, the writing assignments were fairly short, but they required extensive research. Professor Gage is a great lecturer, so I enjoyed attending every class. My TA also put in a lot of time giving us feedback which was very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It is a surprising amount of work with the weekly reading responses, readings, sections, midterm, 3 papers, and a final. However, none of the assignments were that big. Due to the survey nature of the course, sometimes the lectures felt a bit rushed towards the end. While it was nice to give the TAs an opportunity to guest lecture, they were the weakest of the semester.",
                "While this is advertised as an intro history course, some background knowledge of US history is definitely necessary to understand the lectures and not be overwhelmed by the content.",
                "This is a survey course but it is far too broad. It was a whirlwind of information and time periods that just kept moving.",
                "The lectures were engaging, well-organized, and clear. Professor Gage is an amazing speaker. It is important to note that the essays for this class are very open-ended and required some difficult research in the Stacks, Beineke, and the Congressional Record. I would have loved a bit more guidance on how to succeed in writing these extremely broad essays with vague prompts.",
                "Beverely Gage is an interesting lecturer. The coolest part of the class is her knowledge of the FBI.",
                "The class is a strong survey class and goes over a lot of material in a short span of time. That being said, the lectures are extremely fast-paced and cover big chunks of history. Just be prepared to take notes at turbo speed or rewatch lecture videos. Another negative is that the lecture videos are not published until a week before the midterm\/final.",
                "The greatest weakness of this course is the paper assignments. The lack of direction and nature of the assignments (all focused on the analysis of primary sources) do little to advance the historical knowledge of students. Additionally, there was no genuine incentive or reason to to attend lecture, besides wanting to hear Professor Gage lecture in person, as opposed to the lecture recording .",
                "I think that this course is very interesting and you learn a lot in a short period of time. Professor Gage is great and knowledgeable about the topic. I think that sometimes the readings are too long.",
                "Great course! I'd probably assign full books less frequently, as it seemed that people didn't read them all the way though. Other than that, you learn a ton (although, if you're an expert on 20th century America, maybe it won't all be new). Bev Gage is a strength - she's a fantastic lecturer.",
                "Strengths: provides a good overview of a large and complex topic, such that it is easy to understand the most important trends and undercurrents in the material. Reading list is mostly interesting, with some seminal texts from the period. \r\nWeaknesses: section is nearly entirely useless in understanding the material. Prof. Gage has a tendency to occasionally provide a politically biased view of the material, emphasizing trends which she sees as particularly important in a political context. \r\nImprove: make section more engaging!",
                "At times lectures felt rushed, however assigned readings were interesting and often filled these gaps.",
                "Strengths: very engaging lecture, very helpful TFs in sections. Chronological order and discussion of overarching themes is helpful to make connections throughout the century. We covered some of the most important moments of the 20th century in the US.\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes the themes and the grouping is a little bit ambiguous\/ not so clear cut. I wish there is a clearer grouping and divide between the decades. We also went by each decade too fast (approx. one decade per two lectures), although this is supposed to be a survey class on the 20th century.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gage is a great lecturer and I enjoyed the readings for each of the decade that we cover. The workload is not too much as well, very manageable.",
                "This is a really strong course that focuses on a wide variety of topics and concepts.",
                "Great lectures and felt that the overall structure of the class facilitated learning quite well! I felt that the essay prompts were a bit weird and unclear and wish we had more guidance on them! I struggled with creating strong theses because it felt that the prompts were asking a lot without any strong guidance.",
                "I really enjoyed the material covered and thought the textbook provided good supplementary learning to what was covered in lecture. The weekly reading assignments were unreasonably long. Honestly, I don't think there was a single week when I had the time to actually read all that was assigned. I think fewer reading assignments would give students the opportunity to think critically about what they read and allow for more specific and engaging discussion in section. This is, by far, my biggest critique of the course, and would definitely recommend less heavy weekly reading.",
                "Strengths: An absolutely fascinating period of time made even more interesting by Professor Gage, who is a truly talented lecturer.  Cannot speak more highly about this class.  Weaknesses: The class is very large and I did not feel like Professor Gage was accessible at all.  It is also a lot material for a course that meets only twice a week for 50 minutes  would suggest a 75 minute time slot",
                "No weaknesses. Professor Gage is a god and its an honor to sit in her lectures.",
                "Its very information dense",
                "Some of the readings were not available online, which discouraged completing some of the readings. The range of reading length for assignments was quite large, which again sometimes discouraged completion of weekly reading assignments. Professor Gage was incredible and so engaging in lectures, and her slides were concise and helpful. All resources for success in the course were given and my experience with my TF (Paul Seltzer) was extremely positive.",
                "I thought the last few decades that we talked about were slightly less clear, but overall the course was taught and structured very well.",
                "The strength of this course is the amount of material. The Course goes from the Progressive Era of the early 20th century to the election of George Bush in 2000, which is a truly amazing amount of time to cover in a semester. We also covered a lot of ground textually. Another strength of the course was professor Gage. As a  leading scholar in Cold War and 20th century US history, the amount of detail she went into, and the experience she had with the topics we were covering was incredible. That being said, an issue with the course is that it might cover too much in too short a time. There were some moments in US History that definitely deserved more attention than we were allowed to give them, and I left many of the classes disappointed that we couldn't keep talking about seminal moments like the Second World War or the Civil Rights movement.",
                "Professor Gage is a fantastic lecturer, in conveying the diverse and intertwining currents of the century's history. I got a real sense of the change and continuity relating to broad themes.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gage is a wonderful lecturer and I thought it was helpful how she focused on themes and trends rather than specific events and dates. The writing assignments were very reasonable and allowed a lot of flexibility so you could delve into topics that really interest you. Weaknesses: Since this was a survey course, the lectures at times felt very rushed-- it felt like we were trying to touch upon so many topics at once that rarely dug deep into topics.",
                "I really liked the lectures as they flowed well.  I also appreciated the way in which discussion sections were held as they offered everyone a chance to give their interpretation of that week's materials.  My only complaint would be that the papers sometimes were very vague in terms of structure.  I felt like they were vague but then my feedback would ask for certain aspects, which would've been nice to know beforehand.",
                "I thought the course was very well organized. I was almost never confused about what I was supposed to do, the lectures were clear, and the sections were pretty good as sections go.\r\n\r\nFrequently, the last 1\/3 of the lecture was crammed into five minutes, because Professor Gage almost always spent longer on the first part than she had intended. This led to a weird imbalance in the cadence of the lectures and less comprehension of the end of each lecture.",
                "Very interesting lectures, great flexibility on essay assignments.",
                "Strengths were compelling lectures and sections, weaknesses were powerpoints were sometimes too vague if missed a lecture.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gage is an EXCELLENT lecturer, and sections were really enjoyable to go to. I felt that the discussions were extremely engaging, and the content was super interesting because it's so relevant to the present day and the recent history of the United States.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that sometimes the presentations didn't go as in depth as I had hoped, and they only contained bullet points. Sometimes the explanations seemed a little too surface level. I really did not enjoy the first guest lecturer, and I felt that there could have been a bit more structure to understanding why certain primary source readings were chosen.",
                "Prof. Gage is an incredible, incredible lecturer and story teller. There were days I honestly wanted to skip the class to get in a paper deadline or sleep in, and yet I didn't because I knew going would be an incredibly fun and enriching experience. Incredibly glad I took the course as someone with very little confidence or background in American history. I had a lot to learn, and Prof. Gage provided. (And the assignments were really fun and tailored to exploring the Yale libraries in a new way!). My main complaint is I thought the grading would have been easier, but honestly proved quite knit-picky for a lecture course. (Decoded: unless you're a history major with a knack for knowing what exactly goes into a history paper and the types of analysis it asks for, this class isn't the easy-A I thought it would be.)",
                "Though the course was taught in lecture format, the strength of Professor Gage's speaking ability made every class interesting and engaging to me. I think the readings were very well integrated into the lectures as well, as the professor would regularly make reference and expand upon what we discussed in section. I am not entirely sure how the course could be improved.",
                "I thought this course was awesome. Every lecture was engaging. I think anyone who does not have a good background in US history should take this course.",
                "I loved the freedom provided in the three essays--structured enough to acquaint us with particular archives, but broad enough to ensure that each student is able to write about a subject they are interested in. I have no suggestions for improvements.",
                "slides posted before lecture so we can take notes on them",
                "The strengths of the course are definitely the lectures Prof. Gage is a really wonderful lecturer and is very knowledgeable about the subject matter. Additionally, I found the readings to be well-selected and interesting, even if they were sometimes unnecessarily long. A weakness, in my opinion, is that the course was very breadth-heavy and lacked a lot of depth. I think this is partly the fact that the course is a survey and is intended to cover a wide range of material, but I found that sometimes parts of lectures were very rushed (especially in the last 10 or so minutes) and that we would just briefly touch on certain topics.",
                "I think the course is great and assigns excellent readings with engaging lectures. The only way I think it could be improved is to better work out how to deal with the smaller assignments throughout the year, especially with regard to the WR section.",
                "I wish the Professor Gage would have talked a little slower in the lectures. Other than that it was great",
                "Strengths: great lectures, interesting readings Weakness: sometimes it wasnt clear what was important to know",
                "It is a great course to understand the 20th century from an American perspective. I think the main weakness of the course is that sometimes I felt that the lectures, readings, and documents were curated so that we would all think in a particular way. The teacher and the TAs have very similar political views so sometimes (perhaps unintentionally) they guide the discussion and present information in a way that portrays some groups as heroes and others as villains. I think history is a bit more nuanced than how it is portrayed in this class, but I still think it is a very interesting and enriching course in many ways. It's fun to take it with friends and have discussions about the topics together.",
                "I really liked the format of lecture, and discussion sections",
                "Professor Gage is a fantastic lecturer! She lectures in a very accessible manner that leaves no doubt about her command of the subject at hand. The readings were interesting and contributed to stimulating conversation during discussion sections, which felt very much useful and productive.",
                "there are very few guidelines for how to actually write a compelling research-based history paper. grading for these papers are unclear and often inconsistent.",
                "strengths: interesting lectures, good section discussions, good readings. weaknesses: the memorization based assessments felt like a tedious use of time and didn't really feel like the best way to engage with the material",
                "The lectures move at a really fast pace and sometimes feel too little surface level, with trends not fully explained, but overall the course was amazing- I learned a ton in a fostering environment, the readings were fascinating, and sections were really engaging.",
                "Great lecture and slides\r\nMaybe could go a bit slower at end of lecture",
                "The main strength of the class was Beverly Gage's fabulous teaching (and the teaching fellows, who I usually heard good thingsabout). Another strength were the really great assignments that were interactive, unique, engaging and enjoyable-- I liked how it made us do extra (but not tedious work) like going to the library to view archival documents, going to the Stacks and flipping through physical books.Also, the lectures were always interesting and informative, and followed logical processions so that the information we received-- while there was a lot of it-- was not confusing or overwhelming.\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, I really can't think of many.I would say that I sometimes wished we had more time to spend on individual events\/political figures that were super relevant in history but we didn't have the time to spend discussing (for example, it felt like we spent only a second discussing the Tulsa race riot, an event that you could dedicate an entire class to.) But I know that our inability to spend a long time on individual events was attributable to how broad the class' scope was, which is a good thing, since covering 100 years of American history requires some sacrifices in specificity. So I don't really consider this a \"weakness,\" more that it was the nature of the course to give a broader, but slightly shallower, understanding of America in the 1900s, rather than giving us a super in-depth understanding of one aspect of America in one section of this period.",
                "The course was taught very well.",
                "The material covered at the end of lectures was very rushed.",
                "Professor Gage is a great lecturer and the readings are great.",
                "Improve clarity of the assignment on finals. Offer more opportunities for feedback generally",
                "Strengths: Professor Gage's lectures were always interesting and well-delivered, and did a great job of connecting themes across the century. Section was well run and the amount of reading for section was manageable. The paper assignments were all manageable and broke up the grading distribution well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would be nice to have the instructions for the papers more than a few weeks out because two of mine overlapped with exams\/projects for multiple classes at a time.",
                "The papers were pretty unique to do and I wish they counted for more. 3 papers and 2 exams is kind of a lot. I went into this course thinking it was American diplomatic history, and while I quickly figured out that this was untrue, I got a lot out of the class nonetheless.",
                "Strengths: Great discussion in section, Prof. Gage gave very interesting lectures \r\nWeaknesses: Course went WAY WAY too fast to truly enjoy material",
                "Strengths: Professor Gage is truly an incredible instructor. Sections were interesting especially when we got to discuss the great choice in readings. Papers were very easy to write and interesting\r\n\r\nWeakness: the papers were very focused on sources, which while the point, were less interesting to talk about than an actual analysis.",
                "Course was extremely well run. I would recommend a bit less reading because for many students the required readings for each week are impossible to fully complete because of other classes work as well.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gage is a fantastic lecturer and it is clear she is extremely knowledgeable about the subject, the class itself and exams are not all that difficult, my TA (Joe) was great, many of the readings are foundational texts that everyone should read at some point; Weaknesses: at times the course material feels surface-level which is unavoidable given the nature of the survey class and the wide scope of the course (covering the ENTIRE 20th century of American history is kinda difficult to do in one semester, so things\/people\/events get left out), sometimes Professor has to rush the last few slides each lecture due to running out of time",
                "Strengths are the well-organized lectures and clear assignments. You can get a lot out of this class by just showing up to lecture and section. One of the weaknesses is that it fails to go very deep on any subject because it has to cover so much ground over the course of the semester  understandable, but I had hoped it would touch more on some topics and relate them to present day!",
                "Professor Gage is a huge strength of this course - she's an expert in the field and a great lecturer. The course also balances exams and paper-writing well for determining the final grade. I personally enjoyed the course in large part because I had a great Teaching Fellow; be aware that the experience could largely depend on how much you like your TF.",
                "This class does an amazing job covering 20th century American history from a variety of viewpoints. The lectures are very engaging and well organized, the readings add nuance to lecture, and section does a great job encouraging you to think about topics. One weakness of the class is that it is only 50 minutes twice a week so many lectures felt rushed. Would have been nice to dive into a bit more depth into some of the topics if we had more time.",
                "It is a clear and well structured course. The lectured were detailed and organized, with good discussion in section. Great course. \r\n\r\nThe essay prompts did not always correlate to the desires of the TA. For example, the prompt would ask to describe something, but the TA would require analysis and argument.",
                "Strengths are the themes that are consistent throughout the course as well as the lectures devoted to socialist organizing and the conservative intellectual movement in the US. Weakness was a couple lectures felt rushed and too survey-like, but for the most part I appreciated how focused they were.",
                "It gives students a deep understanding of how America changed over the 20th century. Since theres so much material to cover, lectures moved very fast, but Im not sure how to fix that issue.",

                "strengths: engaging lectures and projects",
                "Strength: Prof Gage was highly engaging. The materials were fascinating and also highly relevant today.\r\nWeakness: Although this was an introductory level course, some of the materials were a bit glossed over, mostly due to the short 50-min lectures. Sometimes I found myself relying on my past APUSH knowledge because some events\/developments weren't adequately covered in this class.",
                "A strength of this class were the readings and lectures. Professor Gage knows a lot about this time period, so her lectures were always so engaging. The course does a really good job of tracing specific guiding themes in each lecture, which gives an easy-to-follow continuity to the course. The readings provided really good primary and secondary perspective on the time that exposes you to influential people of the 20th century. The assignments are designed to expose you to researching at Yale, which was a really cool part of this course. I did research in the archives, the stacks, and the online resources that I wouldn't have known as well how to do without this class. The only weakness would probably be that it always felt like lectures got rushed because of the shorter time constraint, so material towards the end wouldn't be described as in-depth.",
                "Mostly strengths, second essay assignment needed more detailed instructions about what was expected from students",
                "Strengths: visual organization of lecture and sections were highly structured.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were not posted until end of the semester.",
                "I thought that this course has had many strengths, including how the material was explained and what resources were used for assignments. The only weakness I can point out is the amount of students in the course, which made it difficult to communicate with Professor Gage sometimes.",
                "Lectures  strength",
                "A strength would be the TA's ability to have good sections that supplement the lectures while a weakness would be the size of the lecture.",
                "Prof. Gage's lecturing is a huge strength, since she managed to pack in lots of important dates and figures into them, along with analyzing trends from whatever time period we were learning about. The readings were mostly primary sources, so I was always learning about different perspectives from people from the time period. I also had a great discussion section and appreciated getting to talk about readings more in depth there when Prof. Gage didn't talk as much about them during class. One weakness is that the exams require knowledge of specific events and terms, even though the lectures would often only touch on specifics like that. However, the exams also included essay portions which played to the strengths of the course, where we were always gaining a broader understanding of the historical period.",
                "I learned a lot and the readings were helpful, but the lectures were too fast-paced. I think the lectures should have been longer.",
                "Relevant coursework, but sometimes can get dry. Also, the essays were short but graded rather harshly, with the TFs having lots of power over how you are graded."

                "Mostly yes. If you're already an expert on 20th century US history, aim for a higher level class that explores a topic in more depth, but for any student interested in this period of US history and wanting to learn more, this is a great class. It's engaging and will probably change your understanding of at least a few topics.",

If you're not doing the writing credit option and you have a good grasp on US history, you probably won't learn much in terms of content. The papers, however, will allow you to do a deep dive into historical topics of your choice, and if you want to orient yourself to Yale's libraries, this course is really helpful.",
                "Yes, even if you already have a solid foundation in 20th century American History, this class can still provide you with insights to understand concepts in novel ways. Also, if you are interested in the fundamental ideologies underlying different trains of thought during this era, then this is the class for you.",
                "Yes. I found that the discussion sections in this class were more productive than they typically tend to be for other courses. If you dont want to revisit apush in greater detail, I probably wouldnt take it though.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It's a pretty straightforward, standard American history class. I learned quite a bit (more than I thought I would, considering I had already taken American history classes here and in high school) without being bogged down with too much work. The writing assignments required some work but were not too time-consuming overall, especially compared to papers in other classes. The midterm was likewise not easy but manageable.",

                "Yes if you don't know much about U.S. history, no if you already do",
                "Yes, a must take for anyone in the US history track.",
                "Yes, solid course (probably a little less gutty than it sounds though)",
                "This course is a well-known staple of the history department so I would recommend it to another student, if for no other reason than to have a low stakes class to learn about how to write college essays and what large lecture classes are like.",
                "Yes absolutely!",
                "I felt like some of the lectures were really rushed. I understand we cover a lot of time (a whole century), but I wish we could've slowed down at minutes. It felt like a sprint, so digesting the information in class was hard. Not sure I would recommend.",
                "Yes, this is an engaging and interesting class with an adequate amount of work.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Gage is an amazing lecturer and I'm definitely going to try to take more of her courses just because of her. I also interviewed her for another class, so seeing her be just as vibrant and knowledgeable outside of lecture was also great to see. One of the assignments involves doing archival work which was a great first experience. Definitely a good HU credit to take and probably my favorite class I had this semester.",
                "Yes, it is engaging",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. You will learn so much, the content is so interesting, and the professor's amazing. I also took this during a 5 class semester, and it was doable.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Even if you've taken U.S. history in high school, Professor Gage gives new insights and perspectives. The writing assignments are fun, and you can focus on whatever topic interests you the most.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only if they have already have a good understanding of US history and are genuinely interested in learning more about political parties and social movements. Class is definitely more worth it if taken as a writing credit.",
                "I would not. There are history classes where you actually learn about the events that take place and then there is this class, where the material is so extensive that you are essentially learning what you would read in the first few sentences of a Wikipedia article. Gage is a great lecturer which I think is why this course is so popular, but this material will not stick with me. I learned so much, and at the same time, nothing at all.",
                "Yes! The lectures were very engaging and I think the material is important, basic information that everyone should know. The course definitely focuses on breadth over depth, so if you want to dive deeply into one topic, this may not be the course for you.",
                "Yes, I would recommend! At least for me, my US History course from high school was too revolutionary-war focused, and by the time we got to WWII, everything afterwards was rushed through. Now, I really feel like I have a better understanding of the present by understanding the century that preceded it.",
                "Yes, I think this is a good class to take. I used it to get my writing requirement, and I loved the freedom I had with my final paper. If you already know a lot about 1900s history, though, I think it'd be boring.",
                "I would not recommend this class to other students. I did not learn anything I had not learned in AP US history. Additionally, the expectations on exams and for writing assignments were vague and subsequently these assignments at times felt as if they were being graded in an arbitrary manner.",
                "Definitely amazing course",
                "Yes, if you are interested in this topic this is a very engaging course. You learn a lot and Professor Gage is an amazing lecturer.",
                "Yeah, I would recommend this class! Bev Gage is a great lecturer. Assignments are interesting and the readings are also interesting, and feel relevant. It's also, like, giants of American History: MLK, FDR, DuBois, Goldwater, Obama, Luce, etc. It's a little, uh, high-school-y? It's like APUSH vibes, a little. But it's definitely more in depth. And the short writing assignments are cool because you explore Yale's archives. \r\n\r\nI took it as a WR and it's definitely not a gut, as the reading is substantial on a weekly basis and you also have to write a big paper on top of the little papers. With that said, workload isn't crazy; I did basically all the reading and it took a few hours a week.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to better understand American history and politics, and the factors that have shaped our current society, without putting in too much work.",
                "Yes, the content is interesting. The assignments are somewhat vague and the grading is a little sporadic. Your experience will almost entirely depend on your TF, but Prof. Gage is a fantastic lecturer.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Gage and the TF's made it a positive experience",
                "YES! Prof Gage is an amazing lecturer! I enjoyed every single lecture, and it's such a great learning experience. If you are not as familiar with this part of history, definitely take it!",
                "Yes I would, especially if you would like a touch up on your 20th century American History and ways to learn more about Yale's databases.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in history and the defining moments of the 20th century take this class.",
                "Absolutely! I learned so much and was entertained!",
                "I would definitely recommend the writing optional section of this class. This class was much more of a time commitment than I had thought and the weekly reading were far too much, so I don't think I'd recommend a student take this class if they weren't getting a writing credit from it.",
                "Definitely!  I took this because I needed a writing credit, but it has definitely inspired me to take more history classes at Yale.  Truly loved showing up to lectures, especially once we got to the second half of the century.  Professor Gage is a must-take",
                "Only if you want to learn a cool history from the coolest professor at Yale.",
                "Yes I would. It was very interesting and I learned a lot",
                "Absolutely. The class was informative, interesting, and enjoyable. The readings all added to understanding the material presented in lecture and the lectures were all essential to understanding change and continuity over the time period in America. I looked forward to this class more than any other and thought the workload was challenging but manageable. The content was so useful to understanding American history and current political conflicts and challenges as well.",
                "Yes! I thought Prof. Gage was amazing and the course itself was very interesting and conducive to my learning.",
                "I would, but with the caveat that there are so many dates and events covered in a short amount of time that it often feels like the class doesn't offer much interpretation on events, but merely spits them out. The essays are where analysis is allowed to shine, but the class leaves interpretation up to the student, and doesn't offer much in the way of historiography or detailed analysis of specific events.",
                "A solid course, but I think most students (especially those majoring in history) would be better served taking a more focused class on topics of personal interest. Most of the class felt like a slightly more nuanced APUSH. The experience of utilizing the library's resources for research, however, compensated somewhat.",
                "Yes if you want an overview of US politics and social movements throughout the 20th century. Lectures are very organized and Prof. Gage is great but as a survey course, you cover a lot of topics rather than topics in depth.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in 20th century America, or for a broad understanding of the political system in the United States and its modern history.",
                "I would recommend it if you are looking for an introductory history class, or (if taking a WR section) a writing credit that is interesting and not too challenging. The readings are pretty interesting too, interesting enough that I read almost all of them. Overall though, it is a survey course, so don't expect to go in depth on anything aside from your paper topics.\r\n\r\nThroughout the semester, I spent approximately 109 hours on this class, and it was my most time intensive class for the semester (though less time intensive than some classes I'd taken in the past). I don't think you would have to do the readings as thoroughly as I did in order to do well. Breakdown:\r\n36 hours reading (~3 hr\/week)\r\n32 hours writing papers (I was in a WR section)\r\n21 hours in class\r\n9 hours studying for exams\r\n7 hours in section\r\n4 hours on the section assignments (~20 min\/week)",
                "Yes, great way to review 20th century history and earn a Humanities credit for STEM people.",
                "Yes, interesting american history course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student but only if they are a first year or senior. Someone with extensive knowledge of history would probably feel that this course is redundant.",
                "Absolutely! This is an anyone class. I really do think every Yale student would enjoy and benefit from Gage's story to tell.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. In addition to being a great primer for modern American history, the course also emphasized getting students into university archives and resources that will prove invaluable for future papers. Lecture was always engaging, and the writing section was also very well organized and supported.",
                "I absolutely would I think it is very important for young students to understand where the political parties were in the early part of the century in order to understand politics today.",
                "I would--especially those without any background in the period. I left the course with a very helpful understanding of the movements, ideas, and major events of the 20th Century.",
                "I would recommend this course to students looking for an interesting history course that is targeted for both majors and non-majors, and is both intellectually stimulating without being exceptionally difficult.",
                "solid history lecture tho high number of assignments (albeit easy ones)",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think having a solid overview of 20th century history is useful for many people, even for non-history majors like political science, global affairs, etc. Additionally, the workload is quite manageable and the lectures are interesting. Keep in mind that it's a very large lecture, the course emphasizes breadth over depth, and the material is not particularly groundbreaking (especially if you've taken something like AP US History or just have a background in US history). But, overall, I definitely enjoyed the course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in history or wants to learn more about America.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot and the topics were interesting",
                "Yes",
                "Yes a great class that teaches the crucial parts of US History in the 20th century. Manageable workload and interesting topics.",
                "My TA Eva Landsberg was amazing",
                "I would recommend this course but I would encourage students to challenge some of the assumptions that are made by the teacher and TAs to get a better experience out of it.",
                "I would recommend this class if you are a history major, as well as if you are looking for another class to fill a requirement\/enjoy history. The class is not necessarily easy, but it is not hard either. The work is very manageable, and the class is interesting to learn about, and if you take time to study and do the assignments you can do well in this class!",
                "Yes! It is an amazing course if you're interested in understanding how we got to where we are in the United States, and it is particularly helpful to identify recurring political and historical trends in the U.S.",
                "depends on the TA you get. overall, the lectures are informative and well-organized, but the quality of learning during section is heavily dependent on your TA.",
                "Yes, great class that I learned a lot from.",
                "Yes, even if you don't have an interest in history or political science, because the knowledge gained can help you be an informed citizen and better understand the trends that define our modern political system and society.",
                "Yes definitely\r\nVery interesting and enfagjng",
                "Yes I would (and already have!) Even for students not particularly interested in politics and history, it's a really engaging and interesting course that I found really rewarding. I was always alert and interested during lectures (as were the students around me), and I always felt like the readings we were assigned connected nicely to that weeks' lessons. I also thoroughly enjoyed the writing assignments. All in all, I would definitely recommend it to any student who is seeking out a relevant and engaging history course.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes if they haven't already taken a US history course.",
                "Yes, I think it's a great history course that does a great job of teaching history skills.",
                "Definitely take this course. Not that hard and very rewarding",
                "Yes- Professor Gage is great and this is an interesting, low stress course.",
                "I would recommend it if someone wanted a course similar to APUSH but not if they wanted higher level insights on college learning",
                "Absolutely: it was a fascinating class with great professors all around.",
                "Yes, this class is a great class for those wanting to understand the past of America and how we got to where we are today.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning how American politics and society have evolved over the 20th century. This class focuses a lot more on American domestic politics more so than its international role, which is something to keep in mind. Though the class briefly covers America's involvement in WWI, WWII, Cold War for contextualization purposes, the focus is really on the development of domestic conservative and liberal thought, parties, ideologies, and movements (which is extremely interesting and relevant to the modern-day btw). The course material is not difficult (the grading is fairly straightforward and relaxed), and the exams are extremely doable for anybody who attended lectures and at least has a baseline understanding of what the readings were generally about. There are a lot of readings per week, but many times its easy to understand the main takeaways without completing 100% of the reading. Professor Gage is a great lecturer, too.",
                "Yes! This is a good complete survey of 20th century America and what you learn can be applied to other classes. I honestly didn't realize how many gaps I had in my American history knowledge until taking this clear-cut, chronological class. Sometimes the assignments were tedious but having a good TF (like Nathaniel!) can make all the difference.",
                "Yes! The course would be manageable to a STEM major who struggles with writing\/humanities because its workload is supported and manageable, but it would also be really interesting to a prospective History major because Professor Gage is so engaging.",
                "One of my favorite classes at Yale so far. Professor Gage is an amazing lecturer, historian, and teacher. The class is a great look at 20th century American history and really engages you in the field of history by exposing you to primary source readings and historical research. This class is definitely not a gut or easy - the more work you put in, the more you get out of it.",
                "Yes. Great summary of the American 20th century through an array of cultural and political movements. Well structured and clear with its intentions.",
                "Yep! Great if you don't know much about American history and\/or want to brush up. Probably not the course for you if you already know about this time period thoughyou might feel like you're not learning much new information (though Prof Gage does focus on interesting themes that will probably be at least relatively new to you)",
                "If a student is interested in history or politics I would absolutely recommend this course. I would recommend this course to any student because understanding how we got to this point is fundamental to understanding the current political environment.",
                "Yes, great to get a deeper insight into the country I live in beyond the APUSH level",
                "Yes! This class is easy and interesting. Papers are creative and the exams just require a lot of memorization. Bev is a great lecturer and the subject matter is really interesting. Must-take!",
                "Yes. If youre interested in American history, this class really pushes you to tie themes together and develop a new perspective.",
                "Yes its a great humanities credit",
                "yes! a great introduction to learning about more recent American history",
                "Absolutely, workload is not too difficult and the information is all there is you attend every lecture. Readings are by no means too difficult to follow. I would recommend this class because it offers a way to understand our recent history and Professor Gage does a great job of peaking interest.",
                "Yes absolutely! The course materials were very interesting and relevant. Professor Gage was an absolutely fantastic and passionate lecturer. A great class for anyone seeking to learn more about U.S. history or just looking for a humanities credit.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students! If you're interested in history, this is a really overview to an important part of recent history. Even if you're not interested in history, it's interesting course material and the workload is not that bad.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Great lectures, engaging readings, and cool writing assignments.",
                "Yes! Rly good basic knowledge to have.",
                "I would recommend this course to a friend if they were interested in understanding American history in a more detailed manner than high school history classes.",
                "Yes",
                "For a sophomore\/junior history or poli sci major, yes. It's a survey course which probably means a senior would be bored. I'm not sure I'd recommend it to a first year due to the often isolating large lecture format and high variability among section experience due to some disengaged TF's. Also, the writing assignments and timed written exams are rather frustrating for students unfamiliar with the history department's standards.",
                "Id definitely recommend it as a pretty interesting introduction course.",
                "Yes, because it was a fun course that was also challenging and allowed me to hone my writing and research skills.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. As a prospective history major, it was a great introduction both to history at Yale and to conducting research. Even for non-majors, the topics of this course have so much relevance to all of our lives, especially if you live in the US, so I think that most people can find the course interesting.",
                "I would very well recommend this course to another student. The quality of the teaching fellows is amazing. They do a great job giving useful feedback and do a good job of keeping students engaged in section.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class. However, it is more a cursory overview than an in-depth look into the time period.",
                "yes, it was reasonably interesting and had a low time commitment"
