I feel like I learned a lot about the countries themselves and their history also through the lens of rock and roll. The youth's relationship to music gave insight on the overall culture of the place we were studying as well as the relationship between the people and the state. I also learned how to read, analyze, and write about journal articles which I had never done before."

                "strengths- seminar style, variety of material, professor, variety of assignments \r\nweaknesses- class was a tad small, lack of context on some things",
                "I feel like the guest lectures and trips to the Beinecke were an asset to this course. Being able to see and touch and directly engage with the material enhanced my learning, and the guest speakers always brought interesting new ideas and perspectives to class.\r\n\r\nI feel that this course could be improved by taking more time to make sure that the students have a strong grasp of the historical context for the music they're talking about. I found myself struggling at times due to a lack of familiarity with the regions and histories behind the music we were studying, and while I did my best to fill those gaps in my knowledge on my own, I would have appreciated the opportunity to go over those things more in class or as part of the readings.",
                "Strengths: Professor MacMillen is very knowledgeable on the subject and is one of the nicest professors Ive had! He gave extensive feedback on our papers and created a fun learning environment. The syllabus is accurate and the class is very well structured. Professor encourages discussions and is very open to questions! The Beinecke visits and the guest speakers were an amazing addition to the class.\r\nWeaknesses: Some terms and topics can be a little confusing, especially since most songs and material on these countries are in another language, but office hours and asking questions during or after class are always an option! Our grades for our papers were given to us through email, but I wish he would also insert them on Canvas so we could keep track of our progress during the semester. However, this is also not a big problem because it is easy to calculate your own grade, or even ask to speak to Professor about your grade!",
                "I think the biggest strength this course has was how knowledgeable professor MacMillen was. He really understood and cared about the topics which made it easier to engage and enjoy the course material. I wish there were a couple more students but there were extenuating circumstances.",
                "I thought the content was very rich, and I really enjoyed the music videos, movies, museum exhibitions, guest speakers, and other primary source materials we got to come in contact with. Our museum trips were especially very special! I do wish we spent less time on analysis of works already written, and more time to research and write on our own  we were able to do more of this at the end, but wish we had more opportunities throughout. Additionally, I wish prompts were a little more open ended, so we had more freedom in our creative and academic process! Also, I wish that grading was based more on the content and less on grammar. I wish I received comments on the larger structure\/ideas\/etc., and less on small grammatical errors, which seemed to be the main thing commented on. I also sought more background information\/history on the content we were learning because that often felt missing and left me a little confused. That being said, I did learn a lot, and enjoyed most class sessions!"

                "I would 100% recommend this class! It was definitely my favorite class this year, and a huge reason for this is Professor MacMillens expertise and kindness. This class is a great way to get a writing credit, as you learn a lot along the way and truly become a better writer. There is a lot of creative liberty and engagement, and we even make a Samizdat-style magazine at the end of the semester! If rock music, communism, or just music in general interest you, then DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS!",
                "yeah",
                "I would recommend it to students interested in this subject matter! Although the focus was really on the writing credit aspect, which I wasn't totally expecting, so I would warn fellow students about that. I do wish it was focused less on the writing and more on the material!"
