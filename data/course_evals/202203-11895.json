The only weakness is that because there were so many assignments for instructors to grade, we often did not get them back in time to help inform the assignments that built off of those.",

I didn't really feel like I was taking much away from the quizzes that I couldn't learn from the readings or lectures. The quizzes felt like busy work.",

Also, Professor Duchscherer is great and makes the work very doable!",
