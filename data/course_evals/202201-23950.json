                "Learned about various orders and families of fish, as well as unique characteristics of each fish type. Learned how to identify fish, as well as first-hand experience with field work.",
                "This lab is an excellent pairing with the course. It helped us really learn each family of fish and seeing specimens up close was a great way to see and feel what was being taught in class.",
                "Fish. Lots of fish. Evolution.",
                "I learned how to identify more than 200 species of fish by order and family, and was able to name a number of characteristics specific to each fish. I gained an understanding of the ways that fish are classified taxonomically, and examined preserved specimens in class.",
                "I learned how to identify fish, and a lot of interesting facts about many types of fish. I also think I have a better grasp of fish diversity, and how the major groups of fishes are related to each other.",
                "I learned how to identify fish from a wide variety of orders and families.",

                "Enjoyed the format of the class and how we were able to learn at our own pace and with whatever method worked best for us. It was a very informative class and supplemented the lecture class very well.",
                "The structure of the course was excellent. The overview at the start of the class was great, and plenty of time was given for us to look at specimens as well as ask questions.",
                "No weaknesses. This was an excellent course.",
                "The biggest strength of this class was the opportunity to interact with fish specimens from the Yale Peabody Museum. The museum has an enormous collection of fish, including many rare species dating back to the 1800s, that were incredibly fun and interesting to be able to examine. A weakness of this course was that it did not specifically line up with the accompanying lecture  some families of fish were discussed in a more general sense in the lab weeks before the lecture went more in-depth about them. I believe that synchronizing them would make more sense and help with retention of information generally.",
                "Strengths: very fun, you get to see the specimens firsthand, samples a diversity of fish\r\nI can't think of any weaknesses",
                "It might be interesting to look at a number of similar species and go over how to distinguish them (e.g. by scale counts, fin ray counts)."

                "Yes. This is an excellent lab course that pairs well with the class. It really adds another level of satisfaction in learning when the topic of lecture is also right in front of you with an excellent professor and TF nearby to answer any questions.",

                "Yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to students with prior knowledge of evolutionary biology or taxonomy. Students without this basic understanding may fall behind initially, but it will not be too hard to catch up. I definitely recommend taking this course if you are already taking the Ichthyology lecture  it is a great accompanying course that will help you gain a more in-depth understanding of the field and better appreciate the species diversity of fishes.",
                "Yes! It is a really fun way to spend the afternoon! If you are interested in studying animals in the future it is a good way to start practicing identification skills. It also helps put the things you learn in lecture into context.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! While the lab is definitely memorization heavy, the workload is super manageable and time spent in lab was stress-free, fun, and interactive. The field trip was also a highlight!",
