I have been evaluating various sorts of sources, interpreting them and constructing genuine arguments using these sources - all of which has helped me become more analytical if not abstract, and I believe that it is a person's analytical skills which allow one to think along the abstract spectrum. \r\n\r\nWhen I entered this class, I was writing chunky paragraphs on the class google doc. But activities such as the formation of quotation sandwiches have helped me a lot with sentence structure, especially making my arguments more concise, to the point and less wordy. \r\n\r\nThis class has helped me in identifying the difference between opinions, value judgments, facts, statements and claims so I never have to use assumptious words or phrases again. \r\n\r\nI feel this class has equipped me with a great set of tools for the future, looking forward to writing commercially and publicly if the opportunity arises."

Technically you can write and discuss whatever you want to as long as its related to bad art (your views are really heard in this class)."
