                "The quality of the course really differs based on your section and instructor. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Su Ji is excellent. She is organized, friendly, provides good intuition, and has super useful handouts during lecture to work through. The pre-reading helps reinforce material in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly problem sets are quite long (12 questions each). This was helpful practice but took a lot of time every week, and the problems are often quite complicated.",
                "This course needs a big reevaluation of how it is taught. I found it extremely difficult to engage during class and as a non-STEM student a lot of the content did not click for me immediately like it seemed to for other students. In such cases, we moved so quickly during class without much thought to the fact that you couldn't understand some content without understanding the previous first so I ended up lost a lot of the time. This meant I had to put so much more time into learning the content outside of class and as a sophomore compared to the many first-years in class I did not have as much time available to study the material.\r\n\r\nMany of the peer tutoring or office hours were during traditional club meeting or discussion section times making it difficult for me to attend many of them as well. In such ways, this course feels much favorable to first-years with more time to study and ultimately succeed.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think the psets need to be redesigned because they were so ridiculously long some weeks and easier/shorter other weeks in such uneven manners. Again, for those upper-level students with more commitments and higher-level courses the time commitment to this class became somewhat outrageous at points.",
                "Strengths: Instructor Su Ji was engaging, Instructor Su Ji created great lecture notes for understanding the content, thorough material, class was well organized\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: Love the worksheets, clear instruction, many resources for help, and the expectations were laid out nicely, \r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Class was extremely fast-paced and hard to catch up once you fell behind once.",
                "The strength was that the teacher was amazing and taught the course very thoroughly. \r\nWeaknesses included the fact that the depending on the teacher the course could be taught badly.",
                "I think the strength of the course is that it covers everything in a logical order such as the topics build off of the previous ones and you review previous topics while learning new ones. However, I didn't really like the structure of the preclass quizzes (having to learn the topics, then go to class to learn them again). I also didn't like how some of the problem set questions felt very repetitive and seemed to be testing our trigonometry and integration rather than the topics we are learning in Multivariable.",
                "guided notes with practice problems for lectures were very helpful, psets were consistent with test material, peer tutor office hours were very helpful",
                "Lots of practice problems, which is good for students. Not many weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: well organized and the in-class handouts were really helpful. Definitely learned a lot and the material was applicable to other courses I was taking. Weaknesses: fast paced, felt like pre-class videos were not helpful, psets started off very manageable and then suddenly became very long and tedious at the very end of the course. I felt like I didn't really understand the material until right before exams, when I would have to re-teach it to myself."

I'm sorry but as an Econ Major I definitely should have taken MATH 118 instead. This was unnecessarily stressful and difficult. The instructors and peer tutors are wonderful people, don't get me wrong, but this course as a whole can do a lot better at engaging and helping students succeed.",
