Really interesting stuff that I enjoyed a lot!",
                "The course is formatted so that class discussions can go wherever the students take it. This makes for a very fun class to be in that is extremely low stress since most topics up for discussion have no right or wrong answer. I do however think the course would benefit from some questions to consider with each reading or some other type of guided activity to go along with the readings just to help facilitate discussion since so many of the readings are on topics that the students have never covered or maybe never thought about."

                "Yes!!!! Professor Kane is amazing and very passionate and knowledgeable on Sound Studies. The readings are interesting and seminar discussions were always engaging  and completely led by students. You definitely take away what you put into the course, which is not much if you dont interact with the readings or participate in class. But if youre interested in a niche subject that is also relevant and very connected with music and the world, take this class for sure!",
                "Yes if you're fairly interested in sound studies or if you're a music major looking to satisfy a group IV credit. There are a lot of readings though and the course gets a bit philosophical.",
                "Yes, but: beware. Even though it's termed 'Introduction to Sound Studies', there is a lot of really dense media theory in the reading. I felt pretty bad for a couple of high schoolers who were enrolled in the class  the material can be pretty intense at times. Some background in philosophy\/aesthetics\/critical theory is definitely helpful in advance of the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because it is a great chance to get to study an interdisciplinary field that requires virtually no background to enjoy. The assigned workload is very minimal but you get out of this course exactly what you put into it so if you are willing to engage in readings and discussions it is a very fun and interesting course."
