                "This class was INCREDIBLY helpful for my Spanish speaking skills. It was very discussion heavy, and it pushed me to not only constantly speak Spanish, but also think critically with it. I learned a ton that didn't even have anything to do with Spanish, such as about  afro-descendent art, indigenous poets, film/film history, etc.",
                "I gained so much insight into afro-latin art and culture, indigenous knowledge and history, film analysis, false information in the Latin American world, and more.",
                "I learned a lot in this course. As opposed to conventional language courses, we focused on analyzing and discussing various works such as art, film, poetry, plays, legends, essays, and more. This made the class feel much more immersive and not other language courses that focus on grammar and memorizing linguistic rules. My vocabulary in Spanish grew significantly and I gained a lot of confidence speaking in the language. Since we didn't focus on grammar and linguistic rules, I also learned a lot about art and film and other topics that we studied, which was a really fresh and exciting experience in a language course.",
                "More about different cultures and how to get better at speaking Spanish.",
                "I learned a ton about hispanic culture, improved my ability to converse in spanish, and improved my ability to read and comprehend difficult spanish texts.",
                "My Spanish communitcation abilities improved immensely in this class. My working vocabulary is much larger than it previously was, and I feel like I can \"actually\" speak Spanish now. This class improved my speaking more than I ever would have expected, and that is very empowering. Along the way, we also learned about interesting and important topics, ranging from womens' studies to fake news.",

                "There was always continuity between the classes, and it was consistently engaging.",
                "It was less learning Spanish and more learning IN Spanish, which has its benefits and drawbacks depending on how fluent you already are. The course has such a variety of interesting subjects that we discuss over the semester, which made every week so exciting. Though prompting discussion from everyone was sometimes difficult, it always lead to fantastic comments on our readings/films/other materials.",
                "Despite what I initially thought, having class five days a week, barring the asynchronous day actually ended up being one of the strengths of this course. Just the act of speaking Spanish every day was really beneficial and helped my skills improve a lot. The class was very conversation based and professor Tordin created a really open and comfortable space where everyone spoke. Unlike other courses, there was no one person who spoke the least or the most in the class, and I think thats really telling in terms of how the class was set up. Professor Tordin opened each class with a one minute breathing exercise that was SO helpful. It was my first class every day and starting my day with even just a minute of breathing was so impactful and gave the class a totally different vibe.",
                "Strength - a bit more feedback, more in class conversation \r\nWeakness - movies were not the most engaging sometime s",
                "This course was extremely strong in all regards. The workload was enough to really help me improve my Spanish without being excessive. Equally as important, the assigments that Dr. Tordin created were highly varied in topic and format (which kept it interesting) and always very high quality. They were engaging and allowed us to use our creativity. I also felt that I could do as well in this class as I wanted to. Meaning, even challenging assignments (such as the short paper we wrote) were within our control, whereas in other classes there is a lot of memorization and \"luck of the draw\" with test questions. In my opinion, this course had no weaknesses.",
                "This was an amazing class!  I learned to apply my language skills to critically explore works of Spanish art, cinema, and texts--each of which bore so much relevance to our world of mass media, capitalism, and inequality.  Professor Tordin always made the class approachable and encouraged us all to contribute ideas to the discussions."

                "Absolutely. Professor Tordin is great, she's so understanding and so kind. Her lesson plans were always interesting and made the class feel less like a traditional, grammar focused, language intensive course. I learned a ton of Spanish in just one semester and my speaking and listening skills improved a lot.",
                "Yes, get Giseli Tordin, she's an excellent professor, she did a pilot project for L4 and I thought it went very well.",
                "Yes. It's an interesting exploration of important topics in hispanic art, film, and current events, all while greatly improving your abilities in spanish.",
                "I would HIGHLY recommend this course. My Spanish improved immeasurably in it, bringing me to the point where I can truly talk with someone in Spanish. The workload was not overly heavy and the assignments were of excellent quality. Dr. Tordin creates a warm environment where all feel welcome to participate, and never with any competitive feeling.",
                "Yes!  The pilot format of this course opened so many opportunities for the students and made the course really enjoyable.  I sharpened my Spanish skills by learning to put them to use in essays and open-ended projects."
