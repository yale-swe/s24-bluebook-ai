The course emphasized the reign and biography of Louis IX, and it also included more literary elements.",
                "This course was a very interesting combination of art history, history, and literature, and while I feel that I learned a lot in each discipline, I did not feel that at the end of the course we were able to effectively combine all the new skills and knowledge we have gained into a whole. I would have appreciated more class time and perhaps more discussion of the assigned readings in the course.",
                "this course presented a great amount of information about the Sainte Chapelle and medieval France, especially in terms of the monarchy and culture at the time. I also developed an understanding of how to tackle long and complex readings within short time periods and incorporate them into our discussions.",

                "Strengths: All the professors were wonderful, kind, and highly knowledgeable. I enjoyed each lecture and the visit to the Beinecke.\r\nWeaknesses: The course felt disjointed, I think particularly because we did not have enough class time each week. Because we didn't discuss the assigned readings, I also felt a low level of engagement with them.",
                "Great class discussions and great connections across time and space. The course essays aimed to encourage and emphasize the importance of drawing connections between artwork and text, relating readings to practice. This course is by no means like any other I have taken at Yale, from its structure being taught by three leading professors, each providing their own view of the subject, to the material covered, to the trips we took as a class.",
                "Strengths: it was really fun to have 3 instructors with different academic vantage points;  I liked having to submit one paper to each professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the class was more discussion based. I thought the humanities seminars were intensely discussion based, and this class felt like a lecture often."

The class was thoroughly enjoyable and I learned a lot. It's also the sort of course that feels paradigmatically Yalehaving three, excellent professors from different disciplines and spending an entire semester focused on one building is quite a unique and special basis for a course. Also, there's a Beinecke visit!",
                "Yes, I think it is overall a very interesting course, but not one of the most engaging. It's not particularly challenging and I wish there was more time for discussion.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend everyone to take this course! It is such an amazing opportunity to witness three professors talk about one architectural wonder throughout a semester, bringing their professional viewpoints and discussing the course material among themselves in front of the class.",
                "yes! all professors were excellent and the class was fun",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to sit in class and have information wash over them. It is very low engagement, so if that's for you, then so be it!"
