                "Fast-paced course for getting to an intermediate level of Spanish (can be admitted to SPAN 130 after). There is a big focus on learning through role playing, compositions etc rather than purely academic grammatical exercises - if you're someone who doesn't enjoy group work of this nature month then you may struggle to appreciate this style of learning."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Learn a huge amount in a very structured way with an excellent professor. Pretty engaging activities and you get to have a reasonably close community.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's just a huge amount of classroom time to devote to a single class. It's two credits, but it's replacing three credits worth of work (literally!). Sometimes I felt like we were just adding activities to get through the two hours a day. I would've appreciated more opportunities to just talk in spanish to each other about whatever we wanted. We got some of those, but maybe not enough.",
                "Strengths: well-structured, activities are conducive to learning the content. \r\nWeaknesses: some activities feel frivolous, very fast pace means some concepts don't stick.",
                "Daily intensive practice with students and a teacher who are incredibly committed was very effective.",
                "A strength was the way the course incorporated many types of activities each day. This reinforced the concepts we were studying very effectively.\r\nA weakness was that the material did not adequately represent the indigenous peoples of Central and South America. I think this course would benefit from the addition of a course partner who could advice on topics related to race and indigeneity.",
                "I particularly enjoyed the linguistic exchange we did with students from Lima. It was so wonderful to meet other young people and practice Spanish in a way that felt very applicable to our lives. I also really liked the structure of the course. I felt the workload was not too high, but also not too low.",
                "Strengths: Very well-organized - the syllabus was the most detailed I've seen of all courses at Yale and the instructor was very clear in talking students through expectations. This course does help you to progress very quickly in Spanish however that is mainly due to the intense workload and the amount of homework and additional assignments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class each day was two hours however I personally don't feel this time was put to best use. There was too much emphasis on group work activities - for example writing poems and stories - and the instructor would then insist we listen to all of the group drafts. I don't think this was the best use of the allocated time and we could have progressed further in our learning with some of these activities stripped back and replaced with more academic exercises. For example we actually didn't spent enough time on translation exercises (e.g. getting a sentence in English and translating it into Spanish). There was a lot of reliance on the textbook which already had Spanish phrases (just with gaps to fill in). I don't think the latter is as helpful with getting the class to learn grammar from the ground up, as the focus of the textbook was just verb conjugation or choosing the right tense, but not sentence composition from scratch. The supersite online learning platform was also a very frustrating tool - there was a time when we were learning clothing and it wasn't black and white from the pictures which item of clothing you needed to use (for example how could you know if a picture is showing a 'jacket' or 'blazer' as they can look exactly the same). Students were docked marks for unnecessary things with this platform. It was better after Dr Sab increased the number of attempts to three, however I still think it would be worth maybe reducing the portion of our grade that is from this platform.",
                "Professor Sab is a great teacher, cares for her students. I was surprised by how creative her lecture preparations were. The class atmosphere was really energizing, it was a pleasure to wake up for this class every morning. Feedback was clear."

            "comments": [
                "I honestly don't know if I would recommend it. I think this is probably about as good a course as it could be given how much you try to get through, and I'm really grateful for all the work the professor did to make it as good as it was. But it still wasn't fantastic. The first month or so was manageable, but then it got kind of insane. Particularly around Thanksgiving break, it was just ridiculous how much we were suddenly asked to do. Constant, constant tests, constant homework. It really felt like I was learning material for the test and immediately forgetting it afterwards because I had to move onto the next topic. Definitely don't take it if you haven't already taken a Romance language. Trying to learn the general structure of the language while also learning how to conjugate everything would be too much. If you've taken a Romance language before, though, you can at least step in with some basic knowledge of how most things work.\r\nBut if you want to learn a lot of Spanish, this is the way to do it. And the homework isn't comparable to the hardest CS classes or anything like that. The weakness of the course really is just the sheer amount of time you spend in the classroom. If you can get past that, then you can certainly enjoy the course and learn a lot.",
                "This class is hard. Profesora Sab is great but will not take any flak. If you take this class, be prepared to spend a lot of time every week. It is a great way to learn Spanish, especially if you have taken some spanish before but placed into L1.",
                "Absolutely  if youre ready to put in the work.",
                "Yes, if youre set on learning Spanish quickly and thoroughly this class is perfect for you. Definitely having some basic background knowledge of the language would help though.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student who wants to rapidly build a foundation in Spanish. It's a lot of work, yes. But if you put in the time and effort required, you won't regret the language gains you are able to achieve.",
                "Yes! I would encourage all students considering intensive to go for it. Its well worth the extra class time and the homework was manageable.",
                "I would recommend Span 125 to anyone looking to pick up Spanish quickly. I think the course is especially useful for people who are already familiar with another romance language. The course could be overwhelming for someone who is not fluent in another romance language, since it moves very quickly.",
                "I would advise students to think carefully about the time they can dedicate to this course and only do it if they know their other courses will have a lighter workload/not be difficult. Beyond the 2 hours of class time and at least 1.5 hours of homework every night (yes, every) you are also given a PenPal that you talk to for about 5-6 weeks, several of the assignments involve creating videos, and the group project at the end has a lot of requirements. This is an extremely time intensive course with 6 exams over the semester, and countless other formal assessment such as an oral and compositions. You will constantly be busy because of this, so I would only take it if you are prepared to have the majority of your studying time taken up by it.",
                "Yes! If youre willing to put in the effort, youll be able to speak with native speakers by the end of the semester. Professor Sab is really helpful and supportive."
