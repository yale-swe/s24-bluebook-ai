                "A large strength of this course was that we got to choose the scientific papers and our topic for a research proposal. Because of this, we were able to explore the topics that were the most important to us, which was very meaningful as a senior. Another strength of this course was that we learned about history of medicine and the modern day intersection of science and society. This is imperative for us to learn. Lastly, Dr. Horsley was a wonderful professor for this course. She met with us one-on-one, brought positivity to each class, and truly inspired us to be active community members. The largest weakness of this course was that we could not meet in person.",

                "i enjoyed the small class size and the class content. The workload is fair and overall stress from this class was low, which allowed us to be more engaged in the class content. It was cool to be able to write our grant proposal and literature review on any topic, because this allowed all of us to research topics we were interested in. Overall I enjoyed the flexibility in the class, as we were able to choose the topics we presented on.",
                "I loved how small the class was; it made for a really tight-knit community and great discussions. I particularly loved Science and Society presentations\/discussions because got to think about and talk about social issues that relate to science and the history of science and how it impacts the present day. We also talked about potential solutions to these issues. I was very grateful for these discussions, particularly because we don't really talk about these important issues in other science classes, and it is something that every science major should have the opportunity to learn."

                "Yes! This class has taught me so much about research, communication, and the history of science and medicine. I would recommend this course to anyone. Since we were allowed to choose our topics to read, present, and write, this course has allowed me to explore my deepest interests in the field. This was very special for me as a senior. In addition to learning about interesting research studies and how to read\/write\/present scientific papers, we learned about the interactions between science and society. This is essential for us to learn, as scientists and future doctors.",

                "Yes, this course brought me made me critically think about the role of science and medicine in society. We asked \"why\" instead of just accepting the past. Through the science and society presentations, we were forced to look at our history to see why certain populations may not trust medicine, or why there is a stereotype that exists today. We also had to think about how we can change our own thinking for the future, as we pursue careers in medicine and must interact with patients of different backgrounds everyday. \r\nAlso, this course allowed me to improve my writing skills in forming my own grant proposal. This experience is so useful for the future as we go into research and will have to do something similar.  \r\nI really enjoyed this class because it is so unlike any other science course I have taken. Most of my upper-level courses in MCDB are content heavy, have many tests, and can be extremely stressful. Although we discussed academic papers and wrote a grant proposals, was more important to me because it made us think critically about science and our role as future medical professionals.",
                "Yes, its a great senior year MCDB course load. Its unlike most other MCDB classes and allows you to think about your impact as a scientist on society. The workload is not too heavy which allows you to just enjoy the class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student! I learned so much and had a very great experience. Professor Horsley is an amazing professor and person, she really cares about her students and their learning. We also learned so much about society's role in science, something that you don't really learn in other science classes but is so important to learn."
