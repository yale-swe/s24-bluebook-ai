                "This is one of the strangest courses I have taken at Yale so farnot because of the material, but because the course never really felt like it knew what it wanted to be. This is a very strange hybrid of Math and Philosophy which only takes the worst elements from both. For the Math portion of the course, you will be presented with definitions and theorems that you are either expected to learn by heart or know how to apply, despite not being given examples for the applications of these definitions in the ways the Problem Sets will want you to answer them. For example, in one PSet, the student is expected to know how to differentiate shapes based on their topology which you could do in many ways but only one is correct (there is no way of knowing which one it is given the material provided for the course), even though examples of this differentiation were never covered in class and you are simply given a set theory-based rigid definition of topology that does not help your understanding at all, unless you have taken a Math course on this material beforehand. Even then, I felt like the bi-weekly PSets for this class had some of the most frustrating Math problems of all time, simply because you could never be sure if you are using the definitions needed for the problem correctly, since their use for similar problems was never provided. And this is coming from a Math majorthe PSets for this course are harder than any Math or Physics course I have EVER taken here at Yalebut for all the wrong reasons. The course has no book (besides a philosophy one which does not help with the nuances of the Mathematical side of the course at all), and the only materials you have to consult the Math portion of this course are the lecture slides, which are rarely helpful since the information on them is so bare-bones. The way this course does it is not a good way to teach Math. You will struggle. You will feel like it's unfair (because it is). And worst of all, you will not learn much, because often times I found myself making technical mistakes in the understanding of the ways definitions can be applied, for which I lost many points, even though there was nothing for me to go off from and the only way you could know in what ways you're allowed to apply the definitions needed for the PSets and what way you aren't allowed to apply them is pure guesswork. Feedback was useless a lot of the time. Also, you are discouraged from working together and the TA's won't answer your PSet questionsso you're on your own basically. Please do yourself a huge favor and don't take this courseif you find the material interesting, just take the Math courses correspondentsat least that way you will be taught these topics the way they're intended to be taught. The Philosophy side of the course was OK, although I feel as if I really learnt nothing new and most of the discussions were just speculative \"what if the world is really this way?\" Philosophy that felt a bit amateur-ish. There were some interesting topics though, but the way they were covered, again made them feel dull because of the way this course paradoxically both rigorlessly and most rigorfully treats Math.",

                "The course is well organized and the content is easy to learn by going to lecture and doing the problem sets",

                "Strength: A good understadning of infinite paradoxes conceptually\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThis course is a trap. It seems to be fairly low level math (from the syllabus) and there are some implications that the higher level math (i.e. set theory and proofs) will be taught to you but that is not the case. If you do not have higher level math experience you are screwed in this class.",
                "Strengths - you can get an ok grade if you have the prior Math knowledge for the materials taught in this course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - too strict grading, midterm based on brute memorization rather than understanding, not allowed to collaborate with others on homework, no feeling of progress or learning in the course, awful feedback, everything else",
                "Prof. Szabo is a great lecturer and the topic is genuinely interesting. I think he does a good job of going through the course content and his lectures are very organized.\r\nThe assignments were just way too much -- I ended up Cr/D/F even though I wanted to take the course for a credit. The problem sets are of much higher difficulty than the kind of material presented in lecture, so you really have to hammer those office hours if you want to get any sort of a good grade. I also felt my TF's grading was a little harsh in some areas. The midterm and final essay isn't too bad, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it if you think you're getting an easy A.",
                "The grading is extremely confusing and part of the reason I took it Cr/D/F is because it is nearly impossible to know what your final grade is going to be. Problem sets are graded out of 12, with each point being 1/3 of a letter grade, but it was unclear how this would translate into the calculation of a final average at the end of the day, with the midterm and final essay.",
                "This course sort of lacks rigor. The standard for writing proofs is low (i.e. pretty much everything can be handwaved) but this can make it difficult to see what's actually going on.",
                "integration between math and philosophy was great at times and not as much in some discussion sections; this is no fault of the teacher or my TF (who ameliorated this situation a lot), but sometimes it felt like students with a math background stuck to analyzing issues from that perspective and the same for philosophy students with philosophy.",
                "Strengths: Interesting content, passionate and well-spoken professor\r\nWeaknesses: Midterm was really arbitrarily graded. Make one mistake and suddenly you're at a 1/3 or 2/3 on a question. Do that a few times and your grade starts looking scarily low even though you feel like you didn't do that bad.\r\nMore clear guidelines on how to grade midterms would help.",
                "Strengths: discussion sections were generally pretty interesting topics, lectures presented interesting thought experiments and the professor made good attempts to avoid dryness\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We were very often underprepared for the psets. The content in lecture was not presented in a rigorous or comprehensive enough way for us to write complete proofs required in psets. I think professor Szabo needed to either spend more time on definitions and theorems in lecture, as he currently tends to brush over them as if everyone in class already should understand.",
                "Felt extremely repetitive at the beginning, but also would imagine that the introduction to writing proofs is insufficient for people who are brand new to it. There also seemed to be some discrepancies between sections",
                "The course is organized very well and the teaching staffs are really nice. The psets could be more relevant to the actually topics of infinity instead of set theory for example.",
                "I think that the material and organization of this course is highly interesting and makes it really stand out from other classes. A weakness of this course, however, is that the problem sets often seem disconnected from the lectures.",
                "Strengths: the professor is an excellent lecturer, and the material is interesting\r\nWeaknesses: occasionally the problem sets assume background mathematical knowledge that students may lack, making completing them difficult. Also, having a pset due right after thanksgiving was honestly just mean.",

Be aware that it shows up often on problem sets and lecture. The class will teach you about various topics in set theory, calculus, topology, and probability theory.",
                "Strengths: Great organization, good range of topics while keeping thread of infinity through the course and connecting each topic together. Interesting and reasonably understandable philosophical readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Short class time (maybe a strength?), grading and quality of section varies greatly by TA.",
                "The set theory was not explained well at all, and I had to essentially go off and teach myself set theory in order to make it through the class. The midterm was just testing if I had memorized every small thing mentioned in lectures, and for the final paper they sent out a bunch of philosophy papers we had never talked about.",
                "The content was very interesting and the discussion sessions were engaging, however I wish there was more philosophy and less mathematical components.",
                "Strengths: I think the sections were really helpful to understand the material. The fact that the professor posted the slides presented in class made it very easy to refer back to the material we covered... so it really helped with psets. Weaknesses: Even though I would say Prof Zoltan is a good lecturer, lectures can get a little boring especially when the material covered that day is particularly challenging... makes it very hard to follow so you just end up zoning out a bunch.",

                "I think this course is far too math focused. I was going in expecting mostly philosophy with some math, but what I found was a lot of philosophy and a lot of math. I remember the professor saying on the syllabus that there would be no/little formalistic language used, when in fact a lot of formalistic language (especially regarding set theory) was present, while not being fully/thoroughly explained. Otherwise, I think the professor was engaging and the content that was purely philosophical was interesting. I also had an immense amount of fun in discussion section, where I felt that the course was more focused on the philosophy than the math.",

                "Strengths: Very engaging. The lectures as well as the discussion sections are very engaging. The problem sets do not take too long to complete.",
                "Both a strength and weakness of the course was that it covered so many topics. As a new student, this was really helpful in my exploration of what may be interesting for me for future course selections, but I did feel rushed from one topic to the next and unable to fully appreciate the material this way. For me at least  this was my first philosophy class  it may have been useful to have engaged with a couple of the chosen topics more rigorously when covering such a large variety.",
                "The strengths were that it was structured very clearly but the weakness is that it varied section to section",
                "Could have been less math intensive.",
                "I found the topics very interesting, I absolutely loved going to lectures. However, the problem sets were often pretty hard, especially if someone had zero mathematical background. I found that those who were math or physics majors could do the psets pretty well, but for others it was too hard. But my TA was very helpful.",
                "The lectures were about theories related to infinity and didn't teach the methods for solving problems given on PSets and exams. It felt as though we were listening to ideas on the subject and then did work completely on our own.",

Everyone taking this class is a either a STEM student looking for an easy Humanities, or a non-STEM student looking for an easy QR. This is the kind of class where the material is really interesting *until you have to be graded on it,* and then it becomes, not necessarily less interesting, but much less enjoyable. The course attempts to address all sorts of different paradoxes of infinity, and spends most of its time giving remedial math lessons so that these paradoxes' solutions are understandable to the entire class. Its description as requiring 'elementary set theory' is generous at best - the other math necessary was easy enough to pick up from what I already know as a physicist, but I was totally lost on the set theory.",

I had a good time, but most of the people who took it with me did not find it so enjoyable. there are better philosophy classes you can take for your QR credit, and many, many easy humanities credits in a whole array of departments.",
                "Yes because it gives you an intro to some bizarre and usually unseen topics in a nice and fun way.",
                "You absolutely 100% need a strong math background to take this class. The lack of prerequisites is misleading and you will struggle if you've never written a proof before. But if you are prepared to take it, it's pretty interesting and not too much work. Sometimes the lectures feel like a bit of a waste of time, since you'll often be re-learning calculus or probability or game theory in just a less complete fashion.",
                "If you have at least some background in writing proofs, yes!",
                "Yes, if you are interesting in thinking about what other theories you are forced to accept once you accept or reject the existence of actual infinity, and what alternatives are there and what the consequences of the alternative is.",
                "Yes",
                "I think this class is marketed towards more humanities people but I want to warn that the psets are somewhat math/proof heavy so only take if you are comfortable with that. for someone who is math/phil major or has taken set theory, this is a great and interesting class and not very difficult",
                "Yes! I think the material is very interesting and the discussions that we had in section raised subjects that I would often think about after class.",
                "If they're interested in philosophy of math, yes, or if they want to get back into math after not having done it for a while. Probably not a good class for math majors or those who don't want to spend a lot of time talking about intractable and extremely abstract thought experiments.",
                "Yes, cool and unique class",
                "Yes, it was fascinating",
                "I would recommend the course to a student with a decent logical/mathematical background.",
                "Absolutely! Infinity is a terrific course. From start to finish, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's the perfect balance of very little work but engaging lectures and sections that made me learn a whole lot. Zoltan is an outstanding lecturer - engaging, thorough, and clear as to which slides were most important (he colored them blue). Also big shoutout to Sadie who was a great section leader. Coming from the math side of the class as I was, it was enlightening to learn about what various philosophers in history thought about mathematical theory. (The class welcomes people of both STEM and philosophy backgrounds to a common discussion.) It forced me to have discussions about things I had previously studied in a whole new light. Amazing Hu credit for STEM majors! Can't recommend enough.",
                "Yes, especially if you have some math background. You get exposure to lots of cool topics, and I genuinely enjoyed psets.",
                "I would recommend (and have recommended) this course to many students. This philosophy course has a lot of overlap with mathematics, making it an appealing class to those interested in philosophy as well as those studying STEM. It also makes for good conversation with friends, as your knowledge of infinity will surely stump them!",
                "No. Im a math major and did not enjoy this course.",
                "Would recommend this course to math-y students looking to delve into the philosophy of infinity. Math topics aren't given as much background in the course so would probably be more challenging for humanities/philosophy students with less math experience.",
                "I dont recommend taking this class without some prior knowledge of set theory. There are some pretty interesting topics we briefly talked about, but more often we would get lost in the semantics.  Its definitely more of a stem majors philosophy class than a humanity majors qr credit",
                "Yes, if you are a philosophy or mathematics or physics major (or anything that is mostly theoretical). Else, this course covers very theoretical concepts that are hard to follow if you don't have the background and can feel pretty much useless to know. The class was also much harder than advertised. Definitely not a gut -- do not take it if you thought this was an easy QR credit. It definitely is not. The psets will take you 3-5 hours and they are pretty challenging, and so is the midterm. The final paper is pretty short but a little hard to write if you've never written philosophy papers before.",
                "I think this course is a very interesting course to take. As a STEM student who had never taken a philosophy course, this course still felt very digestible. The course relies on some math but not very heavily. I think as long as you're willing to think about interesting questions related to infinity, this could be a very interesting course for you to take.",
                "I would recommend this class with someone with a basic math proof background because the problem sets contain many questions requiring proofs. It is also a decent class if you aren't super into philosophy but want to get a little taste of it.",
                "I would only recommend this class if the student is interested in mathematics.",
                "I would not, if they were looking for a more philosophy-heavy course like I was. I would, however, if I made them aware of the level of math involved and found that they were still interested.",
                "only if you have already knowledge in set theory, calculus, and statistics.",
                "Yes, only if they are genuinely interested in the topics taught. Otherwise, it may not be for them.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about infinity.",
                "ONLY IF you get a good TA and section. The TA and sections are what make or break the course, and will have a heavy influence on the grade.",
                "This course was listed as having no prerequisite courses, although I felt underprepared for most of the topics that were covered. I do not have any background in calculus, or set theory, nor did I know many of the vocabulary terms that were used in lectures (often relating to mathematics, physics, etc.). Unfortunately, this set me back enough to have taken me away from the learning process, as I was lost during many of the lectures and making an effort to keep up with those \"basics\" in real time, just for not having the assumed prerequisite knowledge.  That said, the course was wonderfully structured, I learned a great deal, and I enjoyed it. I would recommend the course to any student that is truly prepared for the mathematics required so that they may get the most out of the experience as possible.",
                "Yes, especially if you are more STEM-oriented but want a HU credit",
                "Absolutely.",
                "I would recommend it to anyone interested in both math and philosophy. Even though there are no prerequisites, I wouldn't recommend it to someone without any math background.",
                "No. This course should have prerequisites, notably in set theory. Its description was misleading. There was no direction to the material.",
                "yes if interested in both mathematics and philosophy, with an emphasis on the prior."
