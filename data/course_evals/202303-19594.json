                "This course was very interesting, but not super well organized. I enjoy having different lecturers come in and discuss their research, but I believe its main flaw was some disorganization of logistics. I would say the one thing I want to emphasize is that there should be a better system of the TAs and lecturers making sure that every group has the same opportunity to ask questions during group discussions.",
                "Strengths: Great topics, each lecture was very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: Could've been more organized, much of the learning is self taught since you're expected to come to class having read the assigned papers. Some of the discussion questions were a little unfair since the TAs wouldn't really know how to help with them either.",
                "This class is great for improving your scientific paper reading skills through practice and discussion sections. However, a weakness is that the discussion section questions varied in difficulty and there were several weeks where most of the students (and even the TAs) were unsure about how to answer the question. In addition, some of the lecturers had clearly not prepared the questions until shortly before the discussion section. Another weakness is that it took a long time to get feedback on many assignments (three discussions did not get graded until after exam period was over, and it took over 2 months for the mid-semester essay to get graded).",
                "Strengths: Papers were interesting to read. The weekly quizzes were mostly group format, and the questions weren't overwhelmingly hard. The TAs were helpful when they came around to check in. Very cool to have different instructors come is as guest lecturers and talk about the area they work in.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The teaching team could be more responsive with evaluations of quizzes and other graded work. The papers are graded fairly harshly compared to the rest of the class; I would have preferred consistency.",
                "Could have feedback handed out more consistently.",
                "The main strength of the course is the rotating lecturers. A weakness of the class is that we don't discuss experimental design weekly, which made the final paper incredibly difficult since the course was focus on molecular mechanisms. We also were given conflicting information for the midterm and final papers, and I wish Prof. Steitz and the TFs were clearer about what they actually wanted. We also had too many papers to read in the period between Tuesday and Thursday each week, and the questions assigned were very challenging. I also wish we had been able to choose our partners for the weekly assignments at least once. Finally, it was very frustrating how we did not regularly receive feedback on how we were doing in the course."

                "Yes I would recommend this course, especially to people who want to go to grad school, as it really helped me better understand many scientific techniques that I was confused about before.",
                "I would, but I would also include a disclaimer that it is not very well organized. It is a very interesting class and because you're forced to read a large volume of scientific literature, your skills in reading critically definitely improve. However, it was somewhat stressful in dealing with the confusion of turning in assignments/late grading, etc.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student in the sense that it was very interesting to learn about a new disease/set of diseases each week. Each lecturer is an expert in their respective topic, which makes it engaging. However, because it was a new topic every week, I felt as if I didn't retain a ton of information in the long run. Also, the grading was pretty up in the air, and we didn't get grades until months after submitting assignments. I don't want to fault the TAs, as there were only two of them for a 30+ person class -- I just wish there had been more consistency and more feedback.",
                "Yes, but I'd be cautious. This course is a lot of work, since many of the people who lecture go through background material very quickly, and you're expected to remember concepts from MB&B 301. If you're up for the challenge and want to learn from some of the great professors here at Yale, take it! Otherwise I'd consider a different elective.",
                "No, there was not much guidance on the papers and the many discussions were needlessly difficult. In addition, the lack of timely feedback made the course stressful and difficult to improve in.",
                "Honestly a good course, feedback is handed back inconsistently though.",
                "I would only recommend this course to other MB&B/MCDB majors who are very interested in molecular mechanisms and pursuing grad/med school."
