It's a great overview course for linguistics and touches on the most popular subfields within the larger academic domain of the scientific study of language.",
                "I learned a lot what linguistics was and the various subfields.  I remember a lot of stuff with IPA, distinguishing features, and syntax trees.  I really had no idea about any of these before the class, and but Dr. Wood is a great professor and I learned a lot from him.",

You will really start to notice a bunch of cool little nuances that we use in everyday language. If you want to continue study in linguistics, it will also give you a really good idea of which of the subfields you find interesting.",
                "I learned the basics of phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. I gained a heightened appreciation for language and began to take notice of different grammatical constructions.",
                "I learned about phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.",
                "This course is incredibly fascinating. You do a wide overview of linguistics and the different elements that makeup the field of study.",
                "I learnt all of the foundational level knowledge and skills of linguistics through problem sets ans quizzes, which reinforced learning in lecture. The information taught was interesting and taught in a very inclusive way which I appreciated. I learnt about the reasoning behind some weird language quirks that I hadnt even previously thought about.",
                "How to understand the IPA (big dub), basics of phonology, morphology and syntax, and sharpened a few basic reasoning and pattern recognition skills for various problems. Also a few basic things about semantics, logic and pragmatics",

                "This course provided a survey of the major subfields of linguistics, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Once we were familiarized with IPA, several modes of linguistic analysis were introduced to us, most notably: the recognition, construction, and interpretation of phonological rules based on analyses of distinctive features; the division of words into different categories of morphemes and assessment of compositionality; decomposition of sentences into syntax trees, governed by constituency tests; the assessment of truth conditions and relationships between sentences; and the application of Grice's maxims to understanding exchanges between language users. In doing so, this course provided insight into how language operates through interleaved processes and how the field embraces linguistic diversity as a phenomenon to be celebrated and studied.",
                "I learned foundational knowledge and evaluative skills in a variety of areas of linguistics, including why prescriptivism is an unhelpful and prejudiced approach to language variation; much of the International Phonetic Alphabet; and analysis of the components of language at different levels (sound, syllable, word, constituent, sentence, etc). I learned what some important questions are in the areas we looked at and what kinds of analytic tools they use to answer questions.",
                "I learned so much about the foundations of linguistics: reading the IPA chart, syntax, morphology, pragmatics, and phonology. For a lecture I felt that the course was very conducive to student learning. The in-class quizzes helped to reinforce the knowledge from the readings and the group dynamic in discussion section (and occasionally in class) was very beneficial to my understanding of the course material.",
                "We learned a bit about each of the six main subfields of linguistics (Phonetics, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics), as well as touching on some sociolinguistics and historical linguistics.",

                "I learned a lot about the variation in not only different languages, but the way individual languages change themselves. This course definitely introduced me to a more linguist-focused perspective of language, especially with IPA transcriptions. It also gave me eye-opening insights on the way we speak on a day-to-day basis, which made me much more aware and perceptive of the way we use our language and its microvariations.",
                "I learned to think critically about language and how to analyze a linguistic dataset. The course provided a solid introduction to the different subfields of linguistics: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. I came away from this course with a deeper understanding of how language works.",

            "comments": [
                "At first the venue was too small for us, then it was too big. I would rather to be physically closer to the professor. Maybe there could be two sections? Prof. Wood was perfect, you can just feel how passionate he is about his field, he is good at explaining things, he's funny, and very easy to approach.",
                "Strengths: course was very interesting and Professor Wood is an amazing lecturer who cares about his field and also tries to get to know many people despite the size of the class. The grading was very fair and not harsh (except for one TA, who later began to follow Professor Wood's grading policies) and the grading was done in a timely manner. Additionally, the readings are all very informative and the slides are usually very helpful (although Professor Wood does talk a bit fast at times). The in-class 'quizzes' were only graded for completion which took all stress away and really made them more informative and helpful than anything. Also, the homework deadlines were very reasonable and Professor Wood extended them when he saw that many students were struggling to meet them. Amazing course overall, highly recommend it to everyone. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: one of the TAs was inconsistent with grading policy, but this was quickly fixed. So not really any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths are definitely the professor and that the workload is not crazy high.  However, the readings were really long and I didn't often find them that informative.",
                "Fast-paced, could provide more support on psets, inconsistent grading between TFs.",
                "The only weakness is that the lectures aren't recorded, so if you miss one, it's on you to see Jim or a TF to get up to speed (this happened to me a couple times and it really wasn't that bad). The Prof (assuming its Jim), the TF's, the material, and the workload are all huge slam dunks.",
                "Strengths: engaging course materials and lectures, effective problem sets and in-class problems, clear learning expectations. Weaknesses: lots of class time devoted to going over many examples of features without much discussion of the features themselves; sometimes confuses what we need to know for problem sets\/exams",
                "This was a great course. The material is covered thoroughly, there are extensive resources to help the learning process, and expectations are clearly described. The material is interesting and engaging, and assignments were reasonable and useful to the material.",
                "A strength is that most important content is covered in lecture and is available in slides for review. The readings can be dense and a little too complex, so having the lectures as the reference is something to keep doing.\r\n\r\nA very large weakness is the lack of organization and unclear grading standards. The PSets were often due 2 days after learning the content, and we got PSets due during reading week. The less straightforward assignments were graded leniently but oftentimes asking for feedback from the TAs was unhelpful. I also think that 95 for an A is way too high of a bar--even though the final was very easy.",
                "There is a pretty significant learning curve. At the start of each pset it feels as if they're impossible, but then as you trudge through the week you are able to do it. The strengths of this course is that Jim Wood is one of the most passionate professors I have ever had -- he was so enthusiastic about linguistics it was crazy. A weakness was that sometimes I felt a lack of guidance and clarity on the assignments\/exams.",
                "Strengths of this course were having Jim Wood as a professor. The material was taught in a very engaging way by him. Having low-stakes quizzes in lecture was a a smart way of calculating attendance.",
                "Strengths: slides are very clear, professor is chill and down to earth, tests are easy\r\nWeaknesses: there is no need to do the readings as they often say the same thing as the slides but less clearly. I also felt as if some psets tested us on things we hadn't covered in class and were graded too harshly. Also I think Professor Wood sometimes goes top fast through the slides, but that's ok because he posts them on Canvas.",
                "Strengths: The course provides a robust overview of each subfield of linguistics, which makes the course fascinating and exciting to non-linguistic majors and provides a true insight into which subfield may be of particular interest to prospective linguistic majors. The lectures are engaging and the work outside of the classroom is short yet comprehensive.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The sections weren't helpful in furthering my understanding of course content and the grading on homeworks often felt particularly harsh. To improve the course, I recommend sections are either eliminated or reconstructed and there's more assistance on homeworks.",
                "Once we had the tools to do so, I really enjoyed the opportunities given to us to analyze real snippets of other languages. Although the data were obviously curated for the purposes of learning, it made the class feel relevant to the world directly, something I feel is lacking in other courses sometimes. Toward the end of the class we moved away from that model somewhat (most of our syntax work was in English, for example), but I'm not sure how feasible it would be to explain glossing, etc. The project was also a really lovely way to end the semester, by taking articles we could only dream of analyzing at the beginning of the semester and having us work through them in detail with our new linguistic toolkit. My only other comment would be that the phonetics and phonology unit felt a bit drawn out - if there was a way to condense it, then we could spend more time diving into syntax, semantics and pragmatics (the latter two of which felt a bit shortchanged).",
                "This course was well calibrated for an introductory level. It wasn't difficult, but provided a good amount of material to chew on and practice work to develop understanding and retention. As with any overview course, it would have been nice to spend longer on many of the topics, and we had to leave it at surface-level understanding because of time constraints, but I wouldn't necessarily call that a weakness of the course so much as a constraint of this type of course in general. \r\n\r\nThe lectures were engaging, and slightly fast-paced, but this was balanced by the fact that students had access to the slides after the fact and weekly readings on the material. Professor Wood was extremely accessible and helpful, and excited to answer questions about course material or delve deeper into various topics. He was responsive to student feedback He was also welcoming and respectful to every student as far as I could see. He was the biggest strength of this course; he made it fun through both good teaching and his clear passion for the material. I also thought that he tackled potentially sensitive subjects like linguistic prejudice and language change surrounding gender well and with care. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course was the discussion section. Despite my interest in the class as a whole, I found it unhelpful and unengaging to the point of being moderately soul-crushing. It became slightly more helpful later in the semester when we began doing practice problems, but even that was not very engaging. I am not exactly sure how it could be improved in general, but one way it would be better is if the person teaching the section could better answer students' questions about the material at a level that we are equipped to understand given what we have learned in the course.\r\n\r\nThe only other weakness I can think of was that most of the students in the class felt quite unprepared for the syntax analysis project and thus were stressed and unsure how to approach it. The professor was responsive to this and provided ample resources to help us, but I think our knowledge of syntax was a bit insufficient to the project, so either spending longer on syntax in order to develop a stronger, more sophisticated grasp of it or recalibrating the difficulty of the project would be an improvement.",
                "I feel like one strength of the course was making the material very relatable. There were always examples from pop culture, like TV shows and songs, that made it very obvious how the course material applied to everyday life.",
                "This course gave a very good survey of the six main subfields of linguistics. Though we didn't learn a ton about any one subfield specifically, it was enough to give me a feel for what I liked and disliked which will motivate my future course selection. To me, this is a strength, although I could see how the more surface level approach to each subfield could be a weakness to some. Jim is a major strength of this class. He is a phenomenal professor who cares so much for his students. One weakness is that there was a bit of ambiguity about grades but it was nothing too serious.",
                "The level of engagement during lecture was pretty high but also very low pressure. They were mostly in-class worksheets and exercises that we worked together as a class. It was part of the grade but it was mainly for completion, and it helped me keep track of what I understood and what I didn't.",
                "By far the greatest weakness of the course was the inconsistency in grading. Certain TFs would dock points for seemingly minor errors, while others let similar mistakes slip by. Additionally, some units I found terribly easy, while others proved to be significantly more difficult in terms of the types of problems we were practicing in class and on the homeworkswith only 1-2 weeks on each subject, mastering the material that was not immediately intuitive proved occasionally more difficult.",
                "strengths: professor is a great lecturer; Jim makes lectures really engaging by encouraging and answering questions and providing in-class practice. the course itself is also well organized and everything is done on schedule. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: the sections aren't always super organized, sometimes we spend the entire section on one question; makes it less focused and clear than preferred",
                "The material covered in lecture was always engaging, and the workload is pretty light. The class could have gone at a much faster pace, but other than that it was an amazing course.",
                "Strengths: Can't think of many. I guess the progression through the different topics was relatively organized, building skills over the course of the semester. There are also in-class practice opportunities built in that are helpful\r\nWeaknesses: The class is incredibly unengaging and pretty much identical to the readings. Having done the readings, I would space out in class and tune in occasionally when necessary. The teacher is not passionate, and the TAs are pretty dull as well. They graded homeworks extremely harshly, docking points for minor errors in format and the like. Meanwhile, the exams were absurdly easy, each took me no more than 30 min to complete. So it was very inconsistent in terms of grading expectations, but the material itself was all quite easy and straightforward.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe course content itself is very interesting, even for non-linguistics majors.\r\nThe Canvas page is very organized, with pretty much everything you'd ever need.\r\nProfessor Wood is an engaging lecturer, and his slides include funny videos and animations.\r\nProblem sets were approachable and never felt too difficult.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes homework feedback was not super clear in regards to the point distribution; the number of points taken off, though it wasn't necessarily harsh, seemed arbitrary."

                "YES!! I'm a hardcore STEM major and only took this for my Social Science credit, but ended up falling in love with it! In my opinion, the first few units (phonetics and phonology) are the hardest but also the most fun. You might struggle with the first few homeworks because they will be unfamiliar. Don't let that discourage you because once you master those fundamentals morphology\/syntax\/semantics is SOO FUN.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's an amazing overview of the field of linguistics and can teach everyone so much useful information. I feel like this should be a required field for everyone to take at least one class in, since it's so useful and so ever-present. It's a major rec. for ling majors, but it's just generally fascinating for anyone remotely interested in the scientific study of language. Also, the material isn't too challenging and is fairly accessible.",
                "Yes I would.  If you have any interest at all in linguistics or majoring in linguistics, this is a great course to decide if that's what you actually want to do.  That's what it did for me.",
                "Yes - people get scared away after the first couple classes but once you get the hang of it it's not bad.",
                "YES. I can't speak about the other profs that teach this, but if it's Jim, then a thousand times yes. This is not a difficult or workload intensive class. Definitely my easiest and lowest workload that I took this semester. The weekly homework took a couple hours at absolute maximum, but often less. Yet, I feel like I also learned more in this class than I did in any of my other more difficult ones. Jim is an absolute gem of a professor. He shows up to every lecture with a tangible excitement that rubs off on you when you're listening. He's also the best I've ever seen at answering in-class questions. His ability to come up with examples on the fly to show exactly what you need is super impressive and helpful. He's very responsive and cares about his students (he moved a couple homework deadlines when multiple students asked for it, and was very responsive to emails about class topics and even non-class topics). Even if you don't care about language at all, the material is still relatively simple and VERY interesting, and you'll leave the class noticing cool little Easter eggs about language that you didn't before you went in.",

                "Yeah, I would. It's a useful course, especially for budding linguistics majors or students who are interested in language. I took the course because I wanted to see if it could help me improve my Spanish skills and language learning capacity, and I think it will. The course content is interesting and worth learning.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Language is one of the most powerful faculties that humans possess, and yet most of us don't spend a lot of time thinking about how it works. Through this course, I obtained a glimpse of just how rich and complex language is in all of its forms, while at the same time being given the tools to navigate this complexity through problem-solving, logical thinking, and model construction. Taking a linguistics course teaches you not just about language, but also how to think critically and creatively.",
                "Yes, I would. It's a great introduction to what is cool and interesting about linguistics and (I think) provides a solid foundation to take a variety of other courses. It's also enjoyable in its own right, and is a real course without being too difficult.",
                "Yes!! Introduction to Linguistics was really fun and it completely changed the way think about language. You should take it even if only for a social science distributional requirement credit.",
                "Yes! As a STEM major, this course was very interesting and a very welcome escape from my other courses. I truly looked forward to attending lecture and the homework was very reasonable and often somewhat fun.",
                "Yes! if you are interested in Linguistics. The concepts are pretty straight-forward, and the TAs and professors provide a lot of support when it comes to homework assignments.",
                "Yes, I'd definitely recommend this course to someone who has room for an extra class or can fit it under their requirements, and they would be curious about human behavior and communication, as well as enjoy problem-solving. the first half of the semester focuses primarily on IPA and phonetics which may throw some people off, as it did for me, but after that, everything just became fun solvable puzzles",
                "Definitely! Professor Wood's lectures are all very interesting and he explains the material very well. As a prospective linguistics major, it was super helpful for introducing me to the different subfields of linguistics, and it affirmed my interest in the major. If you're interested at all in language and how it works, I would 100% recommend that you take this course.",
                "Do not take this class. As someone who loves linguistics, this course was such a disappointment. It was of a caliber that I might expect from an under resourced community college; it's pretty sad that a course of this nature is taught at Yale. The professor was boring, not passionate and not confident in the material. The TAs were similarly lacking in confidence and interest in the subject (even though they are linguistics PhDs??). I learned a couple of useful skills, like IPA and an understanding of phonetics and phonology, but the bulk of the course was devoted to subjects that seem pretty useless and certainly could have been taught in about 20 minutes each, rather than over a 75 minute class period.\r\nSave yourself the waste of time and maybe take a different intro type class like Syntax I or something similar.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if they have an interest in language as a subject to be studied and dissected formulaically.",
                "Yes, I would; the content is super interesting and applicable to our everyday lives, the workload is relatively low (especially towards the end), and Professor Wood is super down-to-earth."
