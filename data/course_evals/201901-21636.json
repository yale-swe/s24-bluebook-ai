    "The course is a great survey of trends in twentieth century American dance. I feel like I got a great sense of the major choreographers. I also definitely improved my writing; Prof. Seibert conducts writing workshops for each assignment.",

    "The strengths are the sheer amount of material covered and the organization of the course. Seminar time could have been more structured.",
    "Strengths: great learning opportunity to improve writing skills.",
    "I like that we had guest lecturers come in and teach us how to dance. I like that we had feedback on our work. I think the writing workshop process could be better. Since it is a writing class, I think it would also be valuable to deliberately improve on a piece of writing and have to turn in a revised draft to ensure we understand the corrections."
