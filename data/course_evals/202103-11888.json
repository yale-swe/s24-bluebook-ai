                "Basically a self-taught class",
                "The material is very cool especially after you successfully implement the techniques and see visual results yourself. Zach the TA is very nice and offers a lot of meaningful contribution to the class. However, the class was a bit disorganized and there wasn't a lot of meaningful input from the professor herself. Personally I felt that student presentations on the paper readings in lieu of proper lectures given by the professor weren't all that effective.",
                "This class would be much better if it was a lecture or seminar led by the professor, rather than a presentation based class. Every class was led by students, so we never really got to hear from Professor Dorsey.",
                "Strengths: goes through a gamut of different topics, great survey of computer graphics as a whole\r\nWeaknesses: little guidance for each assignment, also there was a lot of student teaching which I found less effective; I wish I had heard from Professor Dorsey more directly",
                "I learned a lot about how graphics work behind the scenes, but I wish the format could be adjusted so it's not just listening to student presentations on weekly readings that are assigned",
                "The learning curve for Blender is quite steep for someone who has never used Blender before. Having tutorials during class for key Blender functionality could have been helpful. A strength of this course is that it is project-based, so you can apply your skills to your interests.",
                "I enjoyed the presentations given by guest speakers over the course of the semester.  I liked having the opportunity to give a presentation for one of the lectures:  giving a presentation helped with my understanding of the material.  Also, hearing other students give their presentations was helpful in that it allowed me to see the same material covered from different perspectives.",

The professor doesn't give lectures but instead let students present the readings (which, depending on who's doing the presentation, can be hit or miss). Also do not expect to get any meaningful support from the professor through office hours. That being said, the topics are super cool and if you are sufficiently self-driven you can get a lot out of it.",
                "Not in its current form. I did not like the presentation based aspect of the class and felt that I was not tested on the information we talked about in class. Projects were pretty separate from the topics in class, especially towards the end. This class is very much of the \"you get what you put in\" style.",

                "I would not recommend taking this class unless you have a strong background in math and are familiar with understanding computer science academic papers. You should also be very motivated to do learn things on your own without the help of the instructor. Every week we were assigned readings to summarize, and students would present them in class. The professor did very minimal teaching. The workload is small, but I feel like I did not learn much from this class. This is also crosslisted as a grad course, and the grad students clearly had a better grasp of things than many of the other undergrads.",
                "Yes if you're interested in graphics. I'm not sure I would've enjoyed this class if I didn't want to go into a career in animation, just since it's so reading-centric, which is different from most other CS classes here.",

Most of the time, when I wanted to know how to do something in Blender for a project, I needed to search for the answer myself.  Finding the answer was easy most of the time, though.
