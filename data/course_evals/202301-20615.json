                "I learned so much while taking this course. Professor Lee is so caring and thoughtful about curating her class so that the vocabulary, grammar, and topics we learn are actually useful in real life and in actual conversation with people. I learned how to figure out certain grammar rules, how to converse with different types of people, how to write in certain context (e.g articles, letters, reports, etc.). Absolutely learned so much and in such a fun way too.",
                "Learned the specific cultures in Korea and learned how to speak more fluently.",
                "This class delves more deeply into language immersion through class projects, presentations, and group work. It lightly touches on grammar rules and structure (only a few days of class are solely dedicated to this topic), but my speaking and reading skills have vastly improved in this class because of the assignments.",
                "improved reading, writing, and speaking skills; explored Korean culture through various topics",

                "By taking this course, I became more confident in my writing and conversational skills with other peers, as this was something I did not have before the course. I also learned about Korean media, culture, and history.",
                "Improved Korean speaking abilities. Exposure to so many different aspects of Korean culture and media.",
                "Through L4 Korean, I was able to learn more about Korean culture (mukbang, Kpop, and film) as well as important dates in Korean history. I have also learned to differentiate between when I should write and speak formally (when talking to elders) versus informally (peers siblings etc).",
                "Korean grammar, new vocabulary",
                "I built my knowledge of the Korean language by taking this course. I learned more grammar rules, sentence structures, vocabulary, and also built my reading skills. I left the class with a more comprehensive understanding of Korean and better reading and writing skills.",

                "Strengths: Professor Lee! She's the absolute best and dedicates a lot of time towards building class bonds \/ an environment where class is enjoyable. She tries her best to make everyone included in discussions and her understanding of the students in the class means that the class dynamics are always great. The class also utilizes a lot of resources \/ teaching methods to make sure that the lessons are always engaging.",
                "strengths: Lee Seonsaengnim is a wonderful instructor!!! She is kind and understanding, and cultivates community in classroom. No weaknesses for this course!",
                "Engaging prof, although sometimes too easy",
                "Strengths of the course were daily homework assignments that ensured that my writing and\/or speaking would consistently strengthen, as well as the teacher's high enthusiasm and excitement for learning. One weakness is that the students did not interact with many other students in the class, which could have made learning Korean more exciting and personal, but this was mainly due to the large size of the classroom and everyone being spread apart.",
                "Strengths: Lee ssn is the best! Super engaging, enthusiastic, and friendly. Weaknesses: none",
                "Strengths include interactive teaching, peer review, and weekly projects. One weakness was that the class did not have weekly tests\/assessments.",
                "Strengths: High engagement with professor and peers, fun activities\r\nWeakness: Class everyday\r\nCan be improved by having more random groups to facilitate new relationships.",
                "I appreciated that the class met every morning because it made practicing the language more habitual, thus helping with my memory and literacy. I also liked the teaching style of Professor Lee, she taught the lectures with passion and engagement from the students. I also liked the emphasis that the class placed on verbal practice--I enjoyed when we would have to break up into small groups and discuss the lecture with the peers sitting next to us.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lee was so understanding and she made the learning environment so upbeat and fun. She encouraged participation for all the students in the class, and it was a very collaborative environment.",
                "Professor Lee is the biggest strength of this course. She is such a positive energy and creates a nurturing, comfortable environment in class. She is very understanding of personal circumstances and is open to making adjustments based on class feedback. This course provides much opportunity for learning, but it does not have a high course-load. The community built by Professor Lee in this class allows for a comfortable classroom environment and encouraged collaboration. I became a lot closer to my peers through this class which helped make the class so enjoyable.",
                "The strength of the course was the teacher. She brought so much energy and enthusiasm, it was a class I looked forward to everyday. She was also flexible and understanding with deadlines. No weakenesses."

                "Yes absolutely. I would recommend taking Korean to anyone since most of the professors are kind, caring, and wanting you to learn. I would recommend this course to heritage learners because it truly allows you to learn more about topics and words that you may not have used all the time since we don't live in Korea. In addition, Professor Lee is very kind and teaches you so much without it feeling like an overload of work. Little assignments everyday (not all are due and not all are about writing or reading) truly does ingrain it all in your brain. Absolutely would recommend.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want to learn more about Korean culture.",
                "Yes! It was a great class to attend on a daily basis.",
                "Yes! this heritage class is not only a great opportunity to improve in Korean language skills, but also to participate in the Korean community at Yale",
                "If interested in learning Korean yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, as the workload was not too high but there is a lot of cool and exciting content to learn that if you put in the effort, you can definitely get a lot out of this course. The instructor was very fun and engaging with the students, which made learning Korean less of a required thing but as something enjoyable to do.",
                "Yes. It's a fun, low-stress class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because L4 Korean is structured such that students are guaranteed more opportunities to practice and fine tune their ability to speak Korean coherently. Professor Lee-Smith is incredibly supportive and makes an active effort to build formative relationships with her students; through this, she has made the learning process much more meaningful.",
                "Yes, the class was very enjoyable and welcoming.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student that is interested in building their language skills in an encouraging environment. The professor was not only engaged in her teaching, but genuinely caring towards her students. She was able to incorporate a lot of different activities like Cook and Talks that introduced different topics of Korean in a different, interesting way. Professor Lee really made the class something to look forward to.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Lee is amazing and gives clear feedback on homework assignments, and also makes learning Korean fun.",
                "Yes! It is a good class to improve your Korean skills through conversation and writing, and Professor Lee is such a sweet and supportive professor.",
                "Yes! It was a fun and engaging course."
