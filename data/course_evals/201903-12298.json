   "comments": [
    "it was so amazing! I love the topics and how pertinent to everyday life they are and all the thoughtful insights from the professor. It was fantastic! only improvement might be for more guidance on the essays since that constitutes the entire grade, but other than that, best class i've taken",
    "I liked how Professor Brunson draws from poetry, paintings and movies to give broader context for the novels. I would have preferred more historical context as a lot of ideas in these novels are bound up in the historical context. We did get some overview, but I think my lack of experience with Russian history definitely impacted my experience with these works.",
    "Strength: lectures are a delight, the books are beautiful, and the professor\/tas are super engaging\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of reading, scarce time",
    "The strengths are too many too count, but they include Professor Brunson's amazing lectures and the absolutely unforgettable texts we read. The course could be improved by giving more feedback, perhaps in the form of smaller assignments, rather than only having a midterm paper and a final paper and exam.",
    "This course had a manageable reading load which was spaced out well through the semester. The lectures were engaging and thought-provoking.",
    "Professor Brunson is amazing, couldnt recommend her more highly. she has incredible things to say about Russian literature that would never have occurred to me without having taken her class",
    "Amazing!! Loved getting to read these novels for the first time, plus Prof. Brunson is a FANTASTIC lecturer and the TAs were amazing! \r\n\r\nIt can be frustrating if you fall a little behind in the readings and then have a pivotal plot point spoiled in class, but Prof. Brunson tried her hardest to reasonably prevent this, and the pace was reasonable enough that I should've been caught up, so no real weaknesses",
    "Strengths: excellent lectures and sections\r\nWeaknesses: assessment structure was strange; potentially another paper and no final would have made more sense, since the final seemed to have a hard time covering all the material dealt with",
    "Its perfect. You get to read well known and lesser known works with Prof Brunsons amazing insight",
    "The strength was Professor Brunson. Her lectures were brilliant and very engaging. I think the weakest point was my TA, who was not very deeply involved with the subject.",
    "Amazing lectures, amazing section  no complaints",
    "Strengths - incredible lectures that make you engage with the text to develop your skills while learning information you wouldn't have gained by reading the texts on your own, fantastic choice of texts, sections that are really molded by what the students are interested in discussing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - not a lot of feedback on your abilities, first grade isn't given until past the midpoint of the semester so it's hard to know how well you're doing, there's no quantitative way of knowing how well you're doing in section",
    "This class was a lovely excuse to read some of the best novels! The lectures were engaging, though they were more focused on context than the literature itself.",
    "This course could be improved by eliminating guest lectures and extraneous readings.",
    "Strengths: Lectures were very well organized, insightful, and sometimes spiritually filling.\r\n\r\nWeakness: There is a lot of reading. Could have benefitted from a slightly shorter booklist and more time spent on each part.",
    "Strengths - great professor! good diversity of reading, reasonable assignments \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - my only suggestion is that maybe there should be a midterm exam and a shorter final? I just felt like we didn't have to engage with Brothers Karamazov very much on the final, and it would make sense to have one exam more focused on Anna Karenina and another more focused on BK. I might be biased, because I usually find exams much easier than essays! But that's my suggestion. I also wish my section had been bigger, but I know that's not really something they can control."

   "comments": [
    "i would. you have to read these classics at some point, and they give you an excellent structure for usually very dense literature",
    "If you are interested in Russian literature already, definitely take this class. I would say to fully grasp the ideas in the novels, you would need a good understanding of Russian history though.",
    "Absolutely, the course is so inspiring and engaging. It is important both as part of my general cultural education and for my soul.",
    "Absolutely if they are interested at all in literature.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The questions which we discussed as emerging from these books are just as relevant to us today as they were in 19th century Russia. The books are fantastic and Prof. Brunson really distills the message well.",
    "Professor Brunson and the teaching fellows were absolute experts in their fields and made me excited to read the books we were assigned.",
    "I really loved this course. This was my first literature class at Yale, but it wasn't too much for non-humanities people. I took it because I had always wanted to read these books and it certainly felt better to do so in a space with a little more guidance than taking them on by myself.  The readings were long, but manageable. The lectures were all very interesting and made me enjoy the books even more.",
    "Yes, especially if like me you have always wanted to read Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, but have never gotten the motivation to commit to do so!",
    "Yes, this was an excellent course and one I would recommend to anyone, whether interested in literature or otherwise",
    "Such a great course. The books are amazing, the prof is amazing, the TAs are great and passionate. You get to read amazing books and talk about how you interpreter them. Like a book club but better, and Everyone will find something special in the syllabus. Best course.",
    "Definitely. If you love to read, these books are all classics.",
    "Absolutely!! Its such a unique opportunity to read Tolstoy & dostoevsky side by side and put them in dialogue with one another. Molly Brunson is a great lecturer and I couldnt have had a better TA",
    "amazing books that everyone should read in their lives, what a joy to be able to explore these works with such a knowledge guide as Prof Brunson",
    "This is one of the most fantastic courses at Yale, partly due to the texts, and partly because Professor Brunson is the best lecturer I've ever had. Her lectures, while informative, are engaging. I'm not a religious person, but the texts and her lectures encouraged me to engage with the world in a spiritual sense. I often had to sit and think deeply about the lecture after I left, not because it was difficult to understand, but because it was weighty and fascinating.",
    "Yes! This class will make you think about the world in new and interesting ways through the deep and incisive writing of two masters of the form. You'll grapple with questions of modernity, religion, relationships, authenticity, guilt, and so many more. The Professor is clear and a great storyteller. Furthermore, you learn a good amount of Russia, which to me had always been sort of an empty spot when it comes to high art such as literature. Finally, you get two wildly different perspectives in both style and substance with Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, providing a nice tension and contrast to keep the class fresh and enjoyable. Highly Recommend for a nice beginning to Russian Literature.",
    "If you are committed to doing a significant amount of reading, yes. It's worth it if you actually engage with the texts, but beware if you do a lousy job of reading. There is a final.",
    "Yes, the course takes a very multifaceted approach to examining the literature of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. There is so much to learn about the two-way impact of great literature and its societal context.",
    "Yes! This is a fantastic course with amazing readings. Please take it.",
    "This course is truly fantastic. Molly Brunson is a great lecturer. You definitely have to be ready to devote yourself to the reading for this course, or it's really easy to fall behind, but the books are really fantastic and completely worth your time. Reading for this class ended up being my more fun work that I would do to procrastinate my less fun work. If you want to read The Brothers Karamazov and Anna Karenina this is a great way to do it, as the lectures add a lot to your reading experience. The papers are very kindly graded and the final is definitely fair. I absolutely recommend this course. Definitely take it."
