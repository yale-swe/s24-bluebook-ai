Not only did we learn how to understand and analyze real bank balance sheets and bank functioning, but we also had the privilege to take this class while a mini banking crisis was occurring in the US, and Prof. Pascutti did a great job at explaining to us what was going on. The class also improved my confidence in my knowledge of finance  in areas ranging from the financial crisis to bond math. While the tests were challenging, they forced me to study and get a really solid grip on the immense amount of content we learned.",

                "Its a great class",
                "Strengths: extremely engaging. Professor Pascutti has a lot of life experience in finance and a genuine interest in the topic, which both add so much to the lecture. He is a great and funny lecturer, and it feels like he's just having a conversation with the class when he's teaching\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of content that is crammed in the semester",
                "Interesting material and one of the more useful / applicable econ courses. Exams a little hectic / time rushed however.",
                "Excellent for student learning",
                "I really enjoyed the topics we discussed and I'm happy we were able to hit on so many topics throughout the semester. However, I don't think that any of the readings we did were particularly useful. I absorbed more information in class and felt like what we discussed was not at all related to the readings. Also, I know this is part of the class experience, but the testing style where tests were very difficult and then curved was confusing for me as I didn't really know how to study or prepare myself well. Also, I often felt misled about what concepts would be on the test; I'd prefer it if what we were told would be on the test in section was actually what ended up being on the test. I still felt like people very experience in finance had a huge advantage in this course.",
                "Strenghts: Prof Pascutti is very knowledgeable, he comments on a lot of current events. During our semester, we saw the collapse of SVB, Signature, Silvergate, and First Republic, and we talked a lot about them in class which was very helpful.\r\nWeakness: it is not a well-organized course. Prof sometimes just goes on and on without having a clear structure. This class also has a lot of assignments (3 quiz, one banking assignment paper, one 14 page final paper, one 3-hour final exam), so make sure you have the time to put on this course before taking it. It is a lot of self studying, I learned almost all the bond math on my own.",
                "Slightly disorganized, but Pascutti is always engaging and you learn a lot.",
                "Strengths: Loved how time-sensitive this course is. Majority of the lectures were clearly applicable to financial news and current events. This made learning topics more enjoyable. \r\nWeakness: At times, going on tangents to cover current events made the structure of course a bit more difficult to follow.",
                "Strenghts are Prof Pascutti, who is very passionate in teaching the course and will draw from his own experiences in industry\r\nWeaknesses are the assignments - quizzes were routinely 5-10 (double sided) pages long, and it seemed at times that the quiz and final tested more for regurgitation of very specific aspects of the concepts, rather than a deeper understanding.",
                "Strengths: course was structured well and I learned a lot.",
                "This course has great content and provides extremely practical and useful knowledge. One improvement I would suggest is more in-class support for the more technical and math-heavy material that is required for the exams.",
                "A strength is how much the professor is passionate and knowledgeable about the material. I love that we focused on current events.",
                "Strengths: Professor Pascutti is a very engaging lecturer (especially if you like the classic finance bluster) and a smart person. The US banking system is a super interesting and complex machine, and he does a great job helping the class make sense of it without simplifying away important details.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: many of the readings are not actually necessary for learning the course material, but you are required to read them all in order to write a weekly reading response. As someone generally interested in learning about banking, but who doesn't care about all the details, this class had a lot of work and took up more time than was ideal.",
                "Strengths: Prof pascutti is super knowledgeable and has good insights into basically any question you can throw at him. Also, because \"finance happens in real time\", the class has been a great way to keep up with major news surrounding bank failures and inflation. Also, our TF was super helpful in guiding us on how to do well on written assignments, and had discussion sections that were good supplements to the lecture. The content goes quickly and has a wide breadth, which made the class a bit difficult but also meant I was able to learn a lot!\r\n\r\nA major con was that the class doesn't have a very good flow in lecture. For example, the first two weeks we more or less skipped what our readings was about to dive into current events in finance, but without a very comprehensive review of the topics the professor was discussing. Prof pascutti also would skip around topics a fair bit, and had a fast pace, so taking notes was hard sometimes. He also didn't always stick to what were in his slides, which would have been fine if some of the test questions didn't lean pretty heavily on the slides."

In fact, I think this course would benefit from having more perspectives from other majors and I don't think anyone should shy away from it if they don't have previous finance knowledge. Since this topic also concerns every taxpayer in this country, I just think it's a useful course for most Americans). \r\nThis was one of my favorite courses at Yale. The professor is just so engaging, and the TF Alice Wang is a fantastic teacher. They are complementary.",

                "Yes",
                "Yes, but be prepared for a lot of work. I think it's worth it if you're either very interested in finance or are going into finance, because the concepts you learn will be very relevant. However, the testing style is bothersome and the workload is pretty high (especially for those in their senior spring). Be prepared for tests that you will probably come out of feeling unsure about. However, the tests will be curved. Just be prepared for a confusing class logistically where you learn a lot about finance.",

                "YES! This was one of my favorite courses I took at Yale, so I would say if you have any interest in or knowledge of the US banking/financial system, you should totally take it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it! You take a really deep dive into the ins and outs of the US Banking system from a functional and historical perspective, and I guarantee youll learn lots of useful things you didnt know before, particularly if you looking to go into finance or policy in the future. Prof. Pascutti is knowledgeable and passionate about this class. Hell take the time to engage with students about whatever question they have and to talk about current events, which I really enjoyed and put the course material in a living context.",

                "Yes. Very engaging",
                "If interested in this area, definitely! You will learn a lot and come away with a far better understanding of the overall banking system.",
                "Yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! You learn a ton about the banking industry and Prof. Pascutti is a fantastic and engaging lecturer. The material is super practical and useful, especially for anyone going into finance. It is also so important to highlight the many imperfections and vulnerabilities that exist in the financial system.",
                "Yes, I believe it is essential to know how banks function as we mostly all put our income and savings into these systems.",
                "Yes! I loved this course. It was super engaging and interesting.",
                "If you are interested in how the US banking system (or finance in general) works, take this class! It's a lot of work with weekly reading responses, tests, and a final paper + exam, but it is really interesting material and it's a lot of fun to listen to Professor Pascutti talk. He's an engaging lecturer and great at explaining things. I don't always agree with his takes about regulators, but even then, he makes interesting points. It's also worth mentioning that the class is graded on a pretty generous curve, so if you're okay with getting a B, you probably don't have to do all of the extra legwork.",
