    "I learned how to assess my own aesthetic opinions and how they relate to specific politics",
    "As somebody who has never taken a political science class before, I feel much more aware of how politics influences art and literature. We looked at theory (specifically Wallerstein), and then applied the theory to different poems throughout the class. We were encouraged to think about how and why certain works appeal to us, and what that might say about our certain political tastes or sensibilities. We looked at a range of conservative, liberal, and radical poetry, and considered what made each poem fall into each category or defy the categories.",
    "This course helped me think about the way that aesthetic tastes are political and political tastes are embodied in certain aesthetics. I was exposed to a wide range of both explicitly and implicitly political poetry and associated texts.",
    "This course not only introduced me to the political poetry of figures like Brecht, Neruda, and Szymborska, but made me understand the political nature of poems in a different light. Poems can be political, I learned, not just in their overt messages, but also in their form and in the particular sensibility of the poet.",
    "I loved this course!! I think this course pushed me to think about aesthetics and politics in a more complex wayand to question my own assumptions and first impressions about the political implications of various styles. I appreciated how the class left a lot of room for self-reflection as well. The poetry itself spanned a wide range of contexts and forms.",
    "Skillwise, this class improved my close-reading skills, provided language to articulate my aesthetic and literary responses to poetry, and guided me in integrating political and literary analyses.",
    "as advertized, i learned how to identify the political sensibilities underlying different aesthetic tropes \/ ways of thinking. it has changed the way I think!",
    "Learned how to derive political leanings and aspirations from seemingly apolitical texts through close reading."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths\r\nlow reading assignment which allowed me to really focus and appreciate the fineries of the poems we were assigned, and it also meant we discussed basically everything we read outside of class in class and gave these poems the time they deserved. \r\nstarting the course by reading wallerstein helped frame thinking about political sensibility in other poets; it put all people on the same page of what political ideologies we were dealing with\r\nwe worked through these ideologies individually which gave the course a clear order\r\nProfessor North's clear and detailed comments about problems with my writing but HOW TO IMPROVE IT UNHEARD OF FROM A YALE ENGLISH PROFESSOR\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\nSometimes Professor North waited until the night before class to assign reading, and I would've liked them posted earlier\r\nby the end of the semester, we had essentially broke from the syllabus completely, which allowed for us to talk about poetry and political sensibilities most relevant to the class's interest, but it also meant that you couldn't look up the poems on your own if Joe waited until the last minute to post them. \r\ntook a very long time to get papers back to us (but honestly it was fine because the comments were so in depth and worth the wait)",
    "Strengths: Professor North is very kind and cares about his students immensely. The texts were interesting and engaging and definitely manageable in terms of reading workload. This course made me think about my own political reactions to art and literature! Overall, the experience of each class was enjoyable and non-stressful. Professor North's comments were extremely detailed and he definitely wants us to improve and succeed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We read a lot of poems by the same people (think Brecht, Szymborska, Yeats), which meant a lot of our discussions felt a tad repetitive. It felt like a lot of the time, students had to search for a very specific interpretation that Professor North had for each poem. This felt like the case when we were writing our papers, and when had to classify poems into the categories of \"liberal,\" \"conservative,\" and \"radical.\" Most English classes I've taken so far seemed to encourage more open interpretations, but this course felt very much like there was a \"right answer\" when it came to each poem. This is not necessarily a bad thing-- but it was definitely different. Furthermore, it took a while for each paper to be graded, so it was difficult to incorporate comments. For example, we received grades\/comments for our 2nd essay two days before our 3rd essay was due. Also, people who don't know the historical or political context surrounding each poem might feel at a bit of a disadvantage during lecture.",
    "I think the questions and tensions at the heart of the course are really interesting, and make the study of literature feel relevant to all the other things we think about in the world. The selection of texts provided really interesting variety as well. The weakness I would point to, maybe an unusual one, is that there wasn't quite enough work to put in outside of class to make for fruitful discussion. The reading was very minimal, so that often I didn't feel I got a good sense of the poet from it (we would discuss only a small fraction of it in class anyway). I think even having a discussion post before class would help - anything that would generate some more thought-provoking questions. I also think that some kind of final assignment that asked for more synthesis would be helpful. Most of us have done many close readings; I feel most challenged when that skill is paired with a research component to make a project that is broader in scope. This material specifically would lend itself well to a research paper - perhaps even one that could be developed over time so that students are more engaged with the material throughout the semester. Additionally, while I liked using the Wallerstein essay as a common language for discussion and writing, it became limiting at times; I would appreciate perhaps having a few working frameworks of what liberalism, conservatism, and radicalism are, so that there could be more room for negotiation within the categories.",
    "I appreciated how the small amount of reading allowed us to focus on the political sensibilities of particular poems rather than simply talk about the general political sensibilities of Yeats or Heaney. I also appreciated that we started with Wallerstein's essay, which gave a clear definition, or set of definitions, for conservative, liberal, and radical perspectives.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel that after the first few weeks of class, wherein we modeled the close reading of particular poems according to Wallerstein's essay, this course flatlined. The close reading perspective became repetitious, and I felt at times that we were stagnating by lingering on one or two poems for the entire class. I also wish that Professor North would have supplemented Wallerstein's essay with other perspectives on modern politics. Wallerstein's definitions were a helpful entry into discussing the political sensibilities of certain poets, but I don't think they apply equally well to every poet and would have appreciated encountering alternative definitions or categories. Finally, while climate change was never meant (I think) to be the overt topic of the course, we hardly ever discussed it.",
    "Professor North was a huge strength of the course. He put so much thought into his comments on our papers, and he consistently set a welcoming, inclusive tone for the classroom while challenging us to think more deeply and with more nuance. I think in the future, more poetry could be incorporated into the semester. I think we could easily have managed more reading, although I also loved that in class we were able to focus really deeply on a contained amount of text. I also think we could have expanded beyond the three categories of radicalism, liberalism, and conservatism in class, or delved into the gray areas between those categories a bit further.",
    "The main goal of this course is to showcase the different aesthetic sensibilities associated with different political outlooks, which is definitely succeeds at.  My only complaint was that we spent much more time talking about radical political worldviews than liberal or conservative ones.",
    "Strengths: Professor North is a wonderfully enthusiastic and engaging professor. He is a joy to be in class with, and was particularly helpful and fun to talk to in office hours. He also offers very helpful and extensive paper comments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Generally the course felt pretty disorganized. Most classes were focused on one author (and usually just one poem), and we would spend most of the class doing a close reading of the poem without relating it back to the broader issues of aesthetics and politics that the course was engaged in.  Also, the paper prompts were relatively vague (simply to do a close reading of a poem).",
    "I would say that the course's greatest strength was the sheer breadth of poets covered on the syllabus. Class discussions were also engaged and animated. The course's weakness is the semi-oblique political approach to some of the poets, which felt a bit forced at points.",
    "Strengths of this class include a helpful and enthusiastic professor, well-chosen and fruitful poems (some very well-known and others more obscure), a great, supportive classroom environment (every class, we went around the class and talked about our morning thoughts -- a wonderful tradition that I wish existed in more classrooms at Yale!), and generally, interesting and rigorous discussion, light workload, and reasonable assignments with extensive feedback. Not many weaknesses in my opinion, but the syllabus changed quite a bit (deadlines and readings) and sometimes class discussion seemed slightly too guided by Professor North's interpretations. Also, wish the syllabus was organized slightly more intentionally and designated into themed chunks of sorts.",
    "The final project was a wonderful challenge. Incorporating similar interdisciplinary analysis would strengthen the classs foundation. Diversifying the syllabus to reflect political leanings from a multitude of traditions would enrich our conversations and help us move beyond categories that felt, at times, unnecessarily discrete and contrived.",
    "Joe is a brilliant professor: he is great at leading discussion, gives the most helpful essay comments I've received at Yale, is clearly thoughtful about how he chooses readings \/ structures the course. you really get the sense that he wants us to get something from the course, and is willing to go above and beyond to help us make it worthwhile. only weakness:  I think we could've had a little more reading, especially from political science, to give a deeper\/broader theoretical background for our discussions.",
    "Reading was very interesting and manageable. I loved the variety of authors we were exposed to. The political theorists we discussed helped frame our poetry readings. It would have been helpful if we discussed more writing tips in class.",
    "This course did not follow the syllabus very well  though it is not essential to follow the syllabus exactly, the class could have benefitted from more organization. Sometimes, the seminar discussions were too focused on just one or two poems and could have been more helpful if we addressed more of the assigned reading sometimes. The extensive feedback we got on assignments for the class could have been helpful, but we got them back very late (in one case two days before the next paper was due) so it was very difficult to actually consider the feedback we received. \r\n\r\nThe poems we read and the approach to them that the class took were very interesting."

   "comments": [
    "YES. Professor North is an amazing professor who is incredibly knowledgeable about the politics of poetry. the class was made up of an amalgam of english and polisci majors, which allowed for me to increase my own understanding of political ideologies and specifically how i could see these ideologies represented in the aesthetics of the poetry. So so interesting and really pushed me to think harder about what a poem means and what my own political sensibilities mean and what they cause me to learn toward.",
    "I would recommend this course if a student is interested in political science and poetry, or wants to learn about political science through a lens of poetic analysis. It was very relaxing, especially at 9 AM. There aren't many readings a week, which means one can really spend time on a specific poem if they choose to do so. However, this meant most of our class period was spent close reading one or two poems. Much of this close reading was spent trying to reach a very specific interpretation. Because of this last point, I would warn students that this course is not necessarily easy in terms of grading. I didn't love the first prompt (which was classifying poems into political categories), but I enjoyed the second and third prompts because they were more open in topic.",
    "It's a fine course, especially if you're particularly interested in the intersection of literature and politics or if you're looking for an English class that isn't a ton of work.",
    "Professor North is an engaging instructor, and the analytic that his course provides is useful in understanding the politics of poetry. However, the course can quickly feel repetitive, given the lack of perspectives on politics other than Wallerstein's and the relatively unchanging type of analysis modeled in class. If these issues are fixed, I would definitely recommend the course, but if it remains as is, then I would caution other students against it.",
    "Yes!! This class had a low workload, but challenged me to read poetry and consider aesthetic tastes in a new way. I left the semester having learned a lot!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's a cool concept and gives you the chance to dig your teeth into poetry you may know very well and poetry I guarantee you've never heard of. It is, as all seminars are, pretty dependant on who else is in your class. North is amazing and knows his stuff and is very accessible; the only downside is that he clearly has interpretations of poetry that he thinks are correct, and others he thinks are incorrect, which is a pedagogy that I disagree with but it may work for some people.",
    "If you want a class that will expose you to a wide variety of fascinating yet lesser-known poets, while also not stressing you out too much in terms of reading load or workload, then this is the course for you.  Professor North is a fantastic and passionate instructor whose enthusiasm turned a good course into a great one.  He also provides very detailed and helpful feedback on your essays.",
    "Yes! Great course. Professor North is an amazing professor",
    "While I enjoyed professor North and our class discussions, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course for someone who wants to become familiar with the poets on the syllabus. The pace of the course leaves very little time to concentrate on any one poet, and our discussions allocated very little time to focus on specific textual elements of poems and other texts. Instead, the course is geared more towards illuminating a more political message \/ tint within some of the poets and poems. This was interesting at some points but less compelling at others.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student looking for a relatively chill (low workload, high reward), engaging poetry seminar with an enthusiastic professor and a great selection of poems. It was my first poetry course at Yale (I'm not an English major), and I felt both challenged and rather supported in this environment. Not a perfect, must-take class, but a very pleasant, low-stress way to start my Tuesday and Thursday mornings and re-engage with poetry at Yale!",
    "Absolutely! Super manageable workload, great discussions. And you'd be cheating yourself to miss out on a course with Joe North!",
    "Yes - it almost seems to lie at the intersection of literature and political theory, which is a really terrific combination. Its a breath of fresh air from all the English and political science classes you take at Yale.",
    "This class felt disorganized and while the reading was fascinating, the seminar discussions sometimes focused too much on a small portion of the assignment."
