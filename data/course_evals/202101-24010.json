                "Strengths: Professor Wolf is one of the best professors I've ever had. His discussions are always engaging, and he really cares about his students and genuinely wants us to appreciate art in our own ways. The workload is incredibly manageable and I always came away from each class feeling inspired\r\nWeaknesses: There were only two graded assignments which put a lot of pressure on both assignments.",
                "This course is amazing. It is an incredibly reasonable workload and is honestly a ton of fun. Professor Wolf is a gem. It is unclear as to what goes into your grade at the end but take this class!",
                "Strengths: fascinating material, a manageable workload, and a unique final project that is far more engaging than writing a traditional paper\r\nWeaknesses: conversation sometimes dragged a bit when we spent a very long time on a single piece of artpace could be quickened a bit."

                "I think the Zoom seminar worked well because there was a limited number of students and everyone was actively engaged.",
                "This class worked well over Zoom! We mostly looked at art via shared screen, which allowed us to really scrutinize each image, but it took away from the fun of getting to see people's reactions and have a true conversation. The class at times felt more like a lecture than a discussion seminar beacuse of that",
                "I thought our virtual discussions were often highly engaging, but focusing closely on particular pieces of art over Zoom can be exhausting, so sometimes it was hard to maintain focus in those portions of the class. Again, I think this might be a question of needing a slightly quicker pace\/more varied learning formats (breakout rooms, perhaps?) specifically because it was an online semester and it was much harder to stay engaged."

                "Yes, absolutely. Professor Wolf is fantastic and the class is engaging and fun. The assignments are broad enough so assignments can be tailored to individual interests, making them always pleasant to work on. The course material is also worth studying and does a good job of not overwhelming, yet presenting lots of material.",
                "I could not recommend this course more highly! Anyone who has an interest in American history, literature, or art should take this course for a new perspective and deepening of analytical skills as well as the opportunity to learn from an absolutely incredible professor.",
                "Yes!!! Professor Wolf is so amazing, and as someone who took art history for the first time with this class, I can tell you you won't regret it. The class is endlessly inspiring, and I felt that I learned a lot about history in a way I wouldn't have in a normal history class. The imaginary exhibition assignment is also a great opportunity to be creative",
                "Absolutely take this course. It's a ton of fun and is not a source of stress. The learning environment was great when I took it, and the professor is super accessible.",
                "If you are interested in close analysis of art (and some literature) from the pre-Civil War period, and\/or learning a bit about what it's like to be a museum curator, definitely take this course!"
