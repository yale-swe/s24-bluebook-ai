                "We spent most of the course learning about the Carnatic music system. In-class time was mostly spent learning about intervals and practicing singing scales. From the Western music system, we learned about key signatures, notating rhythm, the names for different-sized intervals, and the circle of thirds and fifths, and got a bit of practice with transcription"

                "In class, we were introduced to a plethora of topics and figured out the principles of music theory through singing in practice. In section, we clarified the content we practiced in class and discussed assignments. As the course structure is still being worked out, we went through different forms of mini-quizzes and assignments to see what fit our class best. Versatility of content and practice was wonderful but would not be conducive to students seeking a rigid structure in their course.",
                "This course was very good, and I know that the professor is committed to making it even better!",
                "A strength of this course is how it starts from scratch to introduce the concept of music so those with no musical experience can understand the class. A weakness is how fast some of the concepts were taught such as rhythm.",
                "I loved how we grounded a lot of our coursework in Carnatic music, that was really interesting",
                "This was a new course, so some elements were still being fleshed out. As an example, I didnt find the notation labs that helpful. That said, the focus on singing made the course very engaging, and I actually found the final project fun. It was always a course I looked forward to, and it felt like it catered to students with a wide range of musical training, including none at all.",
                "loved singing <3",
                "I think it would be more realistic to have two separate courses on music theory for those with and without some previous study of music, since I felt like that gap was never really bridged fully.  The organization of the course wasn't the strongest, but I thought the assignments we did have were genuinely helpful to my learning.",
                "The class helped me a lot with aural skills/my ability to recognize the difference between half and whole steps, a perfect fifth, etc. Though I was already familiar with MuseScore and transcribing music, this course also strengthened my skills in that area and introduced me to new tools like Sonic Visualizer which aided me even further with transcription. Class sessions were very engaging and fun, especially when we got to sight-sing.\r\n\r\nThough I appreciated the course being centered around the Carnatic music system and learning a different way to view music outside the Western system, I would have also enjoyed learning some of the concepts in more traditional music theory courses, especially chords and harmony."
