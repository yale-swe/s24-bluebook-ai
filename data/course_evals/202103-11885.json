This course carried me through many topics, which include derivatives, integrals, sequences, series, new applications of integrals, Taylor series, finding volumes, arc length, and areas between curves. I would say this class has a lot of utility for students who want to pursue a course study in econ, math, engineering, etc. Honestly, this class was not taught very well, and I found myself learning the material by simply being taught by the textbook. Each class made me more confused a majority of the time.",

                "Canvas site is well designed. Grade feedback is fast. Small class size is wonderful. There are many facets to the class which makes it easy to learn. \r\nThis class goes at a very fast pace. There is so much content crammed in so tightly. I wish this class were 3 days of the week instead of 2. Many students had already taken AP calc BC which can be frustrating for those of us coming in with no experience with integral calc. I kind of wish that there was a different course offered for students learning this material for the first time since it affects exam curves. \r\nI am sure I am not the only anxious student who does not like the very high weight timed exams hold on our grade, but since the exams are not unreasonable I cannot fault it too much.",
                "Please standardize this course more. My friends were getting guided notes and very clear breakdowns of the content that would prepare them for the exams. This was not my experience and it seems like a problem that would be so easily solved.",
                "Teaching was kinda tough",
                "Strengths: use of the textbook and was relatively easy to follow, could easily access other resources to learn. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think it was the professors first time teaching, so it was a bit rough. I think with time and practice this would improve.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that a large number of resources are offered to students who are struggling. Office hours are extremely useful for clarifying any questions that you may have during class or on problem sets, and the peer tutors are extremely helpful as well. One weakness of the course was the rate at which the course was taught. At one point, we were covering content in class that would be on the midterm later that day. Other sections in the course had already covered some of the content we were going over.",
                "I liked the material it covers, and the pace it moves at was challenging. There were plenty of resources available. However, the lectures were boring at best, because most of it was watching our instructor solve examples on the board, and there wasn't any coherent idea of how to apply different strategies we learned. Also, the homework did not give a wide enough selection of material to give us sufficient practice with the concepts. There should have been at least double or triple the amount of homework so we could fully grasp the concepts.",
                "Strengths: The textbook and review sessions\r\nWeaknesses: My teacher",
                "It teaches materials well, no particular strengths and weaknesses.",
                "Strengths are that it is well structured and organized, however weaknesses can be that a lo of the learning depends on the abilities of the professor.",
                "I think the the Professor could have done a better job engaging the students during each class and provided more activities that presented real problems. I felt like I had to do a lot of after class research on the topics in order to fully understand them. I liked that the class gave some insight into the origin of each topic or equation but I wish we had focused more on the modern usage.",
                "Could be improved with pre-lecture introductory videos in addition to the explorations.",

You need a strong math background to excel, and if you don't have that you need to do twice the amount of work as the other students. For students like me, with a strong humanities background and a weak math one, you will struggle like I did.",
