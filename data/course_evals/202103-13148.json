I think there was support from my advisor and from the DUS, which was very helpful, but I appreciated that at the end of the day, the essay was my own. I also really like how broad the requirements of the thesis are, as they allowed me to write about topics I was interested in without worrying too much about ticking boxes. I feel I learned a lot about how to do long form academic work, the subject material of my thesis, and how to manage my time independently.",

I never felt forced to do anything I didn't want to or to jump through academic hoops for bureaucratic or silly reasons, but I did feel like my questions could all be answered easily and without hassle.",

Particularly if you have any interest in pursuing academia or research, it's a great way to get a feel for it and see if you actually like it. Additionally, it was really nice to  use the skills I've acquired throughout the major and my time at Yale and produce something. Also, I appreciated writing the thesis in the standalone EP&E 491, as then I didn't have to worry about class readings or anything like that and could spend all my time researching and writing the paper.",
                "You're required to do this so it doesn't matter if I'd recommend it! But yes I do! Just make sure you get a good advisor who believes in you. I think that's far more important than even subject matter expertise. And get a second reader who also likes you! It makes the whole experience so much more positive and exciting, rather than stressful.\r\n\r\nAnd get started early -- just for your own benefit, you don't want to give short shrift to this essay, since it's a culmination of all your undergrad work and also a likely candidate for a writing sample in your future.",
