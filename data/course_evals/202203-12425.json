                "2 paragraphs copy/pasted from Q1:\r\n\r\nI am an experimentalist, and I only took one (admittedly low level) college math methods course during my undergraduate (and no other math).  Even so, nothing in this class was new to me.  Even for some of the harder topics (i.e. tensors, complex analysis), I had seen them introduced already in physical contexts such as special relativity and quantum mechanics at the same level of depth.\r\n\r\nI think that in order for this class to be valuable, it would have needed to be much more rigorous and closer to proof-based.  I am not a rigorous student of physics, and I hate proofs, but I still think that this class' lack of anything rigorous (even definitions!) made it utterly useless.\r\n\r\nSpending less time on elementary subjects in favor of more difficult topics may help.  For example, we quite literally had a homework problem on integrating a polynomial, and I think every person with a physics B.S. should be able to effortlessly do that.  The same thing can be said about other topics such as eigenvalues, basic differential equations, and vector calculus like Stokes' theorem.  Most of the topics were just unnecessary.\r\n\r\nI also think that making this course an optional elective instead of a mandatory requirement would go a long way to making it more valuable for other students.",
                "The broadens of the topics",
                "The course was too ambitious in scope, trying to cover too many things, often at too basic a level. Many students, myself included, stopped going because the lectures were all content we'd seen before, but lacking rigor and often full of mistakes.",
                "The problem sets were the star of this class. For the most part, they were very strong problems, well thought out in their scope, and I found myself learning a lot by doing them. I feel like there was a really good amount of them too... some classes had too many psets, and others too few, but this one was perfect!\r\n\r\nI found the midterm (and to some extent the final as well) to be poorly-matched to the students' ability in the course. I could tell Keith was trying to make the course more accessible to the (significant) population of undergrads in the course, but at the end of the day, this is a graduate level course, and there is already an undergraduate equivalent that undergrads can take if they'd like a course that is not at the level of a grad student. I wish the course had been a little deeper on some topics, and I wish the exams had been closer to the difficulty level of the problem sets. I was hoping that this course would help me hone some mathematical skills that would help me in future topics, but I think that the difficulty level of the exams was a big reason it fell short of that goal. \r\n\r\nI did have some major issues with the lecture portion of the course. I love Keith so so much, and I can tell he's a super nice guy, but I do not think that lecturing in a course like this is his greatest skill, and I got the sense that this course was not the best fit for him or his skillset. I'm sure there's other courses that he would be a phenomenal prof for, perhaps some particle class, but for math methods, I do not think math methods was the right course for him. Keith is an excellent storyteller and very good at giving insight and intuition to broad topics and the philosophical parts of physics, but he struggles with the fine details and minutia of calculations. Unfortunately, MM is a course that is full of nitty-gritty details and careful calculations and more-or-less devoid of broad-strokes insights and philosophy, which I feel makes it orthogonal to Keith's style: it ignores his strengths and relies on his weaknesses.\r\n\r\nI feel so bad for Keith for being in the position he is in. I can tell he tries extremely hard and prepares greatly for the lectures, but at the end of the day it just simply isn't the right course for him to teach, and I worry that he might feel badly about his performance. I also expect a lot of the responses to this to be unfairly harsh towards Keith for how this course went down, which makes me sad. I wish we had gotten to see Keith in a different course where his skills and talents can really shine. What happened isn't fair to the students, but it really really isnt fair to Keith.",
                "The final exam was fair considering the course content but I felt blindsided by it compared to the practice final, which was far easier than the actual final ended up being.",
                "Lectures werent very clear and the depth seemed very insufficient for a graduate level course.",
                "This course's main strength was the resources that it provided. The textbook, TAs, and professor were all extremely helpful. The main weakness of this course is the large number of topics taught and the disconnect between them. Some more context at the beginning of each topic would be highly valuable.",
                "Textbook is good. Some lectures were useful, but others were a bit disorganized.",
                "Professor Baker clearly cares about student learning, and he put effort into preparing for this course. However, under no circumstances should he ever teach this course again. Every lecture was riddled with errors, and some of his explanations (or lack thereof) indicated deep, fundamental misunderstandings of the material. A few examples include mixing up Green's functions and Green's theorem, declaring that there wasn't a general solution to a particular PDE after writing it on the board moments earlier, and misunderstanding some theorems in complex analysis. This class would not prepare students for using the mathematics necessary in a physics PhD program, and I would even venture to say that it could put in place some fundamental misunderstandings for students that would be a challenge to undo later. I respect Professor Baker as a scientist, a researcher, and as a person, but the only reasonable improvement for this course is to choose a different instructor.",
                "This course was quite disorganized and scattered. I think if the number of topics was reduced and students were given a thorough and rigorous introduction to each, they would learn a lot more, rather than having just a weak understanding of many different topics.",
                "weakness is that it is hard to put so many topics into just one semester because you end up just scratching the surface of many topics.  I think this course would benefit if only 7 topics were chosen and then those were explained at a much deeper level. These topics should be of interest to a wide range of PhD students of a degree of backgrounds like complex analysis, greens functions, special functions, etc. And perhaps leave out basic topics like series sequences, linear algebra etc which many students saw in undergrad.",
                "It is a good course for practicing math we already know. Some topics like linear algebra are already familiar and the problems done in class we're too easy. I wish the course pushed me further and taught me deeper topics in math.",
                "Adjust the difficulty level according to whats expected from a graduate course",
                "keith baker should not be teaching mathematics. he is woefully unfit to teach this class.",
                "Strengths: lots of resources outside of class, kind professor Weaknesses: lectures did not feel carefully planned",
                "Sometimes the level was a mismatch. Most of the time the material was too easy, but I appreciate that he went over the basics thoroughly.",
                "The course could be a bit faster and more challenging, separating undergraduates and graduates would probably fix most problems with the course.",
                "We covered a wide range of topics which was really nice! I think the attempt to make this class work for both grad students and undergrads was maybe a little awkwardly executed, since we had some undergrads who felt like it was moving too fast and grad students who were bored/not engaged.",
                "Dr. Baker truly was a nice guy who cared for his students and wanted them to do well. The main issue was the level of the course material. The material covered math that should be expected of any graduate student but was presented as if it were our first time seeing it. The midterm exam could be given to a high school student and was extremely easy. The professor did mislead students by providing a sample final exam and stating we should expect problems of a similar level to this, then making the final exam much harder (though I should say, appropriate for a graduate course). In the end, the whole course needs to be reworked."

                "No, unless your mathematical background was below that of an undergraduate (i.e. a student from high school).  No graduate student should need to take this course, since I think it taught very little that someone with a degree in physics shouldn't already know.",
                "Yes.",
                "Unfortunately, I would have to say only if Keith isn't teaching it. Keith is great, but this course isn't right for him, and I feel students would get more out of it if it is led differently. \r\n\r\nWhether I would recommend a hypothetical different prof version of the course, I cannot say. I think a math methods course is a useful course to have in a physics grad program, but that there are so many different topics required and not everyone has the same background or needs, so it can be tricky to tailor it well to the class. A similar course that had an extra level of rigor and covered more advanced topics while forgoing some of the basic vector algebra could be a strong course. I think many people would have seen manipulation of vectors and matrices, and probably also vector calculus, multiple integration, and stokes/greens/divergence theorem. Removing or de-emphasizing these topics to make room for more discussion of complex analysis, PDEs, and other advanced topics could be a way to make this course stronger.",
                "Yes, because it goes over important topics.",
                "The textbook is good. If you take the course for no other reason than follow the textbook, its not a bad idea. If you have seen all the topics in the syllabus list, then maybe opt to take a harder, more specialized course.",

Also depending on the Prof. If it has a notably kind/easy prof and you want a physics elective credit that looks nice/high-numbered on a transcript, go for it! It's low-workload and you will get a nice intro to some mathematically advanced topics. If it's a difficult professor, I would skip it and take something in the math department instead.",
