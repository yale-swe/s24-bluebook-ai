   "comments": [
    "In this class I learned how to perceive beauty, cadence, musicality, tone, and meaning in text. I learned how to see and observe what is around me - every day occurences that we would record in our observation notebooks, and which reveal surprising, beautiful, painful, funny, and uplifting facets of human life, relationships, and nature. I learned how to have a strong vision as a director while never imposing on my actors or stifling their own instincts and creativity. I learned how to treat everyone I work with in the theatre with respect, dignity, and immense care. Toni teaches you much more than how to be a better director. In many ways, she teaches you how to be a better person.",
    "I learned how to approach theatrical texts from the POV of a director, including how to dissect a script and mark it with director's beats, bring out the full world of the play, and how to create a safe and comfortable rehearsal environment that still runs efficiently.",
    "How to analyze a script, a bit of how to work with actors, and so on.",
    "Directing: how to run a rehearsal and mine a script.",
    "I developed to direct with much more specificity. I learned how to make deliberate use of staging and props. I also learned about different ways to look at a scene that, when put together, make for a much richer production (thinking about a scene as a sensory experience, parsing a scene out into \"tasks\" that accomplish one action for the whole play, etc.). \r\n\r\nI also found this course to be incredibly insightful in the way we were taught to think more sensitively about the world. For example, having to diligently record the instance of a leaf trembling in our observation notebooks, and recreating observed scenes of awkward interactions between passing strangers and the intimate moments between friends which, in my opinion, made us much more sensitive to the depth of everyday mundane moments. This class really changed the way I experience plays, not necessarily making me more critical, but giving me a profound appreciation for small, and probably unintentional happenings on stage.",
    "I learned a lot in this class, including the foundation of text analysis and some of the fundamentals of working with actors. The course is a great mixture of practical technique and the more removed or preparatory work of text analysis and interpretation."

   "comments": [
    "This course was challenging and exciting at the level of thought, creative challenge, and striving for excellence. The workload was always reasonable, engaging, and highly useful in learning specific skills that will help us as directors. Additionally, there was a great and engaging balance between practical and conceptual work. We got to experience casting actors, scheduling rehearsals, working with them, and seeing them perform before the class, which was a joy. It was also very helpful that once the scene was performed, we received feedback from the class and from Toni and worked with our actors for another week before giving the final performance. This was such a great way of seeing our own progress, that of the actors, and of our classmates.",
    "Focusing on three texts is a huge strength. If we had to read a new play every week it would be overwhelming, but formatting the class where we do a deep dive into the first text as a group and then split off into reading two more plays, but then being able to choose which of the final two we want to focus on for the second half of the semester made it feel like I left the class having analyzed two plays really well fro a director's POV. Another strength is being able to choose the play our second scene comes from; I felt like this is where everyone was able to shine and our reasons for picking each scene\/play came through very clearly. Another strength is Professor Dorfman (Toni) herself. She is so knowledgable and always willing to engage. The course could be improved in its format. At times we'd get assignments on Tuesday and they'd be due Thursday the same week, and the assignments would require a lot especially on top of work from other classes. I personally don't mind classes that are more free flowing, and this class has a syllabus and is structured, it's just that all the assignments aren't clearly posted on it, so maybe putting the week to week assignments on it and not just the major ones would be helpful.",
    "When it got to the point of directing scenes for grades, it would have been helpful to have more instruction on running rehearsals -- how exactly to get from the analysis to the practical.",
    "The two major strengths of the course are the number of performance opportunities and the well-calibrated equilibrium between practical work and intellectual inquiry. The class is generally very small (9 students my year), which means that we can all perform many times and receive feedback from the class. In all, we each did about 4 directorial performances of various sorts, 2 of which involved outside actors. The biggest weakness of the course is the sometimes disconnected nature of the intellectual (i.e. on-paper) work from the practical work. Professor Dorfman is incredibly knowledgable, and I sometimes wished that she had more explicitly discussed these links."

    "Absolutely. If you are in any way interested in theatre making (or film), or even in the art of storytelling in a broader sense, this course will assist you to grow and develop in your creativity\/intuition as a director, analytical acuity, perception, and love for the art. Toni is truly inspirational and just being around her is a continuous source of knowledge and growth.",
    "YES! This course takes a lot of work and time, but if you have any interest in directing, you need to take this class. Professor Dorfman gives consistent feedback on our work and is ALWAYS willing to meet and give you advice whether it's about the course or not. Even though I'm not a theater studies major, I gained so much information from this course and feel like I grew exponentially as an artist.",
    "Yes, for anyone seriously interested in directing (and it's required if you want to direct a senior project).",
    "Yes",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It didn't just change the way I think about theater, but also really made me appreciate so many small, mundane parts of life and look at them in a novel and inspiring way. Definitely worth it, for the directing skills and the new outlook!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student! It's a great introduction to directing that really pushes students, conducted in a liberal arts context but grounded in the real work of directing actors. The purpose of the class is clearly based in performance."
