In particular, I learned about the making of ceramic, wood, textile, and metal objects, gaining a vocabulary to describe their processes. In the second half of the semester, I learned about the interchange of objects, how trade affects object designs\/uses, how objects can be imitated\/appropriated, how objects can carry different functions and memories, and how objects can enchant the viewer through visualization and touch.",

I developed the ability to look at different objects and write descriptively about their distinct realization processes. Towards the end of the course, I learned about how senses enhance ones engagement with an object.",

It was fun to learn about different manufacturing techniques -- I'd really never thought about how most things were made -- and to think critically about how everyday objects can embody these broader themes.",
                "This course taught me how to look at objects and see the people and historical context behind them rather than just an object. It broke down hierarchical barriers between \"fine art\" and \"decorative art\" by realizing that the level of technical, artistic, and cultural skills necessary for both types of artists are entirely the same. Further, this course taught me a new way of looking at history by giving me insight into how to \"read\" an object, thereby allowing me to hear the perspectives of people who's testimony and experience is not, or is no longer, part of written, translatable record.",

                "Strengths: different approach to art history; teaches you to see the world in a new way; section takes place in the YUAG and you get to actually interact with the objects which is super cool\r\nWeaknesses: lectures get pretty dry about halfway through the semester, and they all follow the same outline; sometimes it can be hard to tell which info is important for exam review and which is just interesting to know",
                "I think the course is a good survey, but I think the lectures could be better organized for learning. Sometimes they were a bit tangential and all over the place and it was hard to synthesize and absorb material.",
                "Engaging lectures. Sections were really interesting at first (cool to see and handle objects up close) but got a little repetitive as the semester went on. I think that a more critical approach could be taken with regards to art collection (i.e. the YUAG's acquisition and holding of objects) and the field of art history more generally: there was a whole lecture on art collecting & museums as imperial projects, but the YUAG's role in this was not addressed.",
                "I cannot think of any particular weaknesses of this course. Professor Cooke never relied too heavily on the powerpoints which was great to keep students engaged. I believe that the class was incredibly well structured, focusing first on understanding the materials of object and later learning the objects themselves.",
                "Strengths: The course is very well-organized. The expectations for each assignment and exam are clear. I felt prepared going into every assignment\/exam. The pacing of the course was also great. I liked that the first half of the semester focused on the processes of making objects and the second half focused on the connection between different objects. The course builds well on itself, and I felt engaged the whole time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "The sections in the YUAG were this class greatest strength. It was also great to learn from an expert like professor Cooke but nothing compares to working with and handling the objects themselves in the collections of the art gallery.",
                "The lectures were really good and then getting to do section in the art gallery and interact with objects was such a great experience.",
                "The discussion sections were not facilitated in a way that were super useful. No one took notes, but then the objects from section would be on the exams.",
                "This course changes tone and direction at midterm, focused in the first half of the semester on knowledge acquisition and the second half on global networks of exchange. The first half is much more compelling. The second half recycles objects and themes quite often, often making lectures redundant. Moreover, slides are often labeled with very little text (or text that says nothing about an object besides its tombstone information--devoid of thematic significance) or long-form, extraneous content. Both make for a frustrating student. experience. This course could benefit from a curricular redesign and refreshed educational materials.",
                "I really liked the sections in the art gallery and how they were hands on. The only thing was you didnt really know what you needed to know in lecture.",
                "Strengths: Dedicated professor, good overview, fair and creative assessments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was a lot of content and information to take in each week, and I wonder if each topic could have more of a narrative or if Prof. Cooke could choose a smaller selection of objects to discuss in greater depth--sometimes it felt like he provided lots and lots of examples without much structure and they were hard to remember",
                "I very much enjoyed the different assignment types and structure\/organization of this course. I also loved the way our sections were run as they allowed me to build upon my knowledge base from lecture.",
                "Section is a big strength of the course, allowing students to engage with objects first hand.",
                "I thought that all of the TAs and the Professor (Prof. Cooke) were incredibly kind and reasonable with grading. I think one area of improvement would be some more guided\/structured sections. Not every section lined up with what objects we looked at during lecture m.",
                "Section was amazing. You get to hands-on look at and touch objects every section in the YUAG",
                "Strength: Well-designed sections, knowledgable professor, fresh topic of class\r\nWeakness: Not really",
                "Strengths: engagement with YUAG collections + Professor Cooke's own collection, Professor Cooke's expertise and obvious passion for the subject, material itself (very interesting course, unlike anything else you will really take)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sections could get a little bit repetitive, course itself was more organized towards the beginning of the semester as opposed to the end; readings were LENGTHY and it was hard to tell what was important and what wasn't by virtue of the reading list... found some readings to be a bit technical and unnecessary given the \"survey\" nature of the class.",
                "Great lectures, sections are a ton of fun in the YUAG.",
                "Loved the slide format and the sections which provided time to actually interact with the objects we talked about",
                "I loved this course!! \r\n\r\nStrength: The sections were my favorite part and, by engaging with the objects in the YUAG, I really got to understand them in a way that one cant from just 2D pictures. The lectures were interesting, as well, and provided a wealth of information that we could put to use as we held and discussed the objects in section.",
                "This course is very thorough which can at times be overwhelming when taking notes. This is not a major weakness, just a note.",
                "The first half of the class on technique and material is pretty dry, but the second half is super interesting. It would be nice if we were given more detailed handouts in section regarding the objects we interacted with",
                "The lectures were for the most part very interesting and engaging and the discussion sections in the YUAG were incredible. Being able to apply what we learned in lecture to real objects that we could handle ourselves just made the class material so much more real. I have to say that there was kind of an odd low point in the middle of the semester where there were two or three lectures whose content felt kind of redundant with each other, but after that the class picked up again and each lecture felt unique and engaging, so overall I'd say the weaknesses were very few.",
                "For a lecture, this course is extremely engaging. Professor Cooke brings objects from his own collection to class so students can interact directly with the materials they are learning about. Section, which is conducted almost entirely in the object study rooms in the YUAG, gives students further opportunity to interact with objects from both Professor Cooke's collection and the museum itself while also driving intellectual discussion about the objects and honing their object analysis skills. The making exercise and the final label bring the whole course into perspective by reframing materials and practices that seem something of an older age into a modern context. The only suggestion I have for this course is the implementation of weekly discussion posts. The intention here would be for them to be graded on participation, with only a certain number being required by the end of the semester, but for students to be able to practice their material literacy in a more informal capacity where they can still receive feedback from the TFs and even their peers.",
                "This course has very interesting lectures, although lecture slides to not contain words about what was discussed so if you miss a lecture it is hard to make up what you missed. Discussion sections are very unique to this class because you are able to touch objects and explore the YUAG.",
                "strengths: you maybe only need to read two of the readings that they give out for the entire course, just actually take good notes during lecture\/lecture recordings, trust me, I got an A on the midterm with only two readings behind me. at a certain point I forgot they existed. because he had a staggered upload schedule, i'd watch one lecture recording and go to one lecture in person every week. the making assignment was really cool. a good way to start a new skill as well!\r\n\r\nweaknesses: seemed to be two camps of TFs that you'd get for sections. either super intimidating or friendly. just a luck of the draw. but the intimidating ones were incredibly intimidating. which, this was kind of a strength if your response to this is to come super prepared. even if you come super prepared you still end up with a solid undercurrent of fear, but it did make me pay more attention for lecture. sessions weren't really a place to not know or ask questions, it was where all your non exam grades would come in. so you had to know, be correct, and use the correct vocabulary, not only the correct concept, in order to get your grade."

                "Yes, definitely! This course changed how I see the world. I never realized how surrounded we are by objects, and this course made me see these objects in a whole new light. Now, when I see a chair in my dorm or a dining hall mug, I can't help but think of the materials and process that went into making those things. This is such a cool class, and it's a truly one-of-a-kind opportunity to be able to take it. I'm a senior, and this was one of my favorite classes in my entire Yale experience. So yes, definitely take this class!!",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, if you are interested in decorative objects or art history specifically about ceramics, textiles, metal work or wood work. Otherwise, the material may seem boring or dense.",
                "If you're looking for an intro art history credit (or are hoping to get a taste for the major), look elsewhere! It's fine, but I regret using one of my precious few slots for classes on this course. More engaging and applicable courses elsewhere.",
                "I think it was very interesting and I learned information I never would have learned otherwise.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone looking for a solid Art History intro course. That said, the content is pretty different from other HSAR courses at Yale, and I would make sure you are at least semi-interested in learning about the kinds of objects discussed in the course (textiles, furniture, ceramics, etc).",
                "Definitely! The lectures felt a bit dry for my taste, especially towards the end of the semester, but the heart of this course is really the sections. Section gives you the opportunity to physically handle the objects that you're studying in lecture, which not many other art history courses let you do. This hands-on component is truly unparalleled, and also gives you the opportunity to explore the YUAG which is in and of itself a hallmark of Yale that everyone should explore.",
                "Yes absolutely! I had never taken an art history class before and this course was an incredible introduction to their distinct style and workload.",
                "Yes! This course was incredibly interesting and Professor Cooke was very engaging. All of the lectures were easy to follow and Professor Cooke explained things in a clear way. Section really built on the material from lecture and helped to cement the concepts and materials from lecture.",

                "Yes! Very unique class that is chill and engaging.",
                "Yes, Professor Cooke and his teaching team are top-notch. This was a really, really fun class that I loved and looked forward to. It was a refreshing change of pace from pure visual analysis.",

                "Yes!",
                "Yes!! This has been one of my favorite courses :) if you are at all interested in art or museum-going you HAVE to take this course. The best part is being able to hold and examine the objects that you usually see behind glass or on display at the YUAG in order to learn about them.",
                "Absolutely! This is a great course with very little work outside of class. Despite this, it is incredibly rewarding and just paying attention in class will teach you a lot about art and material culture.",
                "Its not my favorite intro HSAR class but its often the only one consistently offered professor Cooke is very very invested in the subject matter so take it if a passionate professor matters, but be prepared to go in depth with tons of objects",
                "I'd highly recommend this course. It was really high bang for your buck; the assignments were few and super manageable, and the content was so enriching. It just made me look at the world around me differently and see objects for all parts of their history -- as things that are manufactured in certain social and cultural contexts and which take on various meanings throughout their lifetimes. Going to discussion section in the YUAG and actually handling really objects was an incredible experience and made the lecture content all the more meaningful. And I really enjoyed the label-writing assignments because it was a fun way to try to condense the themes I was learning into a very concise format. Also, Professor Cooke is just wonderful. He's so kind and willing to engage with students and answer questions both after class and in his office hours. He's a professor well worth taking a class with and just good to know in general.",
                "If you are even slightly interested in decorative art, history, or cultural interchange, I would highly recommend this course. It takes content that could easily be dry and organizes it in a way that clarifies its richer meaning at every step. The lectures, sections, and assignments are all hands-on and experience-based rather than being entirely rooted in theory.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because I feel as though I view formal and everyday objects through a different, informed perspective now."
