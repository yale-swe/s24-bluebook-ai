    "Thought content was very thought provoking. A lot of the material was really fresh because it doesn't appear in most other subjects. Class discussion was also eye-opening.\r\n\r\nSometimes the readings are quite dense and difficult to understand if you don't have prior knowledge to gender theory or political science theory. Perhaps maybe going through a brief discussion to unpack some tougher readings before launching into discussion",
    "One strength of the course was the professor and TA. The professor was very engaging and provided interesting ways for us to interact with the material, such as online class discussions and relevant essay topics."

    "Yes! This class is so enjoyable. Definitely take it if you can. This content is so cool and not discussed in other parts of schoolwork. You gain so much perspective and everything you learn about and discuss in class is super thought-provoking.",
    "Its an incredible course to take in gender studies!",
    "Absolutely. This is a course everyone should take.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it was very informative for anyone looking to gain an understanding of gender or culture. The class was well organized and facilitated engaging conversation."
