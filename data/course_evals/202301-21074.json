In particular, I strengthened my skills working with statistical programs and analyzing these results, as well as thinking critically about findings and drawing a bigger picture representation of what they mean.",

Thanks to my advisor and graduate students in the lab, I received a lot of support and help with the organization of my thesis, which was helpful. The psychology department needs to be improved drastically!",

                "I think the strength was my adviser. Having a good adviser could make or break your experience with writing a thesis.\r\n\r\nI think this course could be improved by helping guide students about the process. It seemed really daunting starting the process but after having gone through it, it really is not that bad. I wish though that I had maybe an info session or some peer adviser who could have helped guide me through the process a bit more.",
                "It would be great if we had any intermediate assignments or prompts or meetings - they could all be optional, but it would be nice to have some guidance and accountability throughout the process.",
                "You need to be very disciplined and treat this as a priority, but you get to study questions that you are truly interested in",
                "I could lead my own project and had the support of my advisors.",
                "The strength and weakness are the same: it's excellent to have the freedom to make your own schedule, but I do think that some structured work time or deadlines would be helpful."
