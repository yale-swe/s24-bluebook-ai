Professor Weir was also helpful.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Little infrastructure tying students writing senior essays together (would be great to do something in-person in future years). Also was difficult at first to find an advisor.",
                "Probably could have used a more formal structure from EP&E with more reasonable deadlines. (Going from proposal to draft in 4 weeks makes no sense when we're given 5 weeks to go from draft to final draft. To put that in perspective, we have about as much time to produce a draft as our readers have to grade the final paper.)",
                "EP&E offers a lot of freedom in choosing and pursuing your senior essay, but the drawback there is that the department provides very little guidance about how to go about the senior essay. There is no criteria apart from addressing Ethics, Politics, and Economics in your essay, which is liberating but also difficult when attempting to assess whether you're on the right track. As a result, it's especially important to pick a good advisor who will shepherd you through the the process. The department, for better or worse, provides very little oversight, so your advisor will be your lifeline.",
