                "You will 100% learn Old English (even when you think you can't)! Within the first 6 weeks we covered all of the grammatical elements of the language and then dove into translating actual poetry and prose written in Old English. I also learned how to do research in a more niche language\/area with support from Professor Thornbury and our TA.",
                "Not only did I learn a new language, but I developed a new appreciation for linguistics, the history of language, and the art of translation.",

                "This class was a really fun way to engage with Old English!  I had never thought much about medieval Anglo-Saxon literary works before taking the course, which has left me with a much deeper understanding and appreciation for the intricacies of Old English texts.",
                "Strengths: Professor Thornbury! Her knowledge and support are instrumental in being able to cover so much content! She really knows Old English and makes so many connections to historical components, literature on the language, and more. The textbook and attached work book are really useful as well especially in the first few weeks. Additionally, there are not exams (instead there are weekly writing assignments) which I appreciated because they are still rigorous without relying on sheer memorization of vocab.\r\nWeaknesses: it can be hard if you don't have a study buddy\/work flow for the class. Once I had a schedule and a study budy it became a lot more manageable.",
                "Strengths: The structure of the course is incredible. I still can't believe how much we were able to cover in such a short amount of time. You end up learning so much so early on. And the teaching staff was amazing. They offered so much consistent feedback and so many open office hours and study sessions (often with donuts and coffee or tea), and were always so willing to find time to meet with you even outside of their regular hours. In general, the course was really fun. The Anglo-Saxon poems and story excerpts we'd read were always entertaining to translate. You'd find yourself translating something sounding absurd, and assume you must have made a mistake somewhere, only to find out in class the next day that not only was the story really just that absurd, but the history and background for it all from Professor Thornbury. It was a lovely time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
                "for the weekly assignments, I thought the ones that ask for Old English to be translated into English more helpful than English to Old English. I also don't think an assignment was necessary every week, for example the week of fall break",
                "The textbook is fantastic! Prof. Thornbury is also great. And Megans study sessions were really helpful.",
                "Strengths were the quality of instruction, the helpfulness of the course materials, and the engaging material and assignments.\r\nOnly weakness is workload.",
                "Professor Thornbury was very supportive, though I do wish we had more time during the first half of the course to really master the fundamentals of Old English. It was rather fast-paced and when we started reading poetry, I was not too confident in myself to be able to translate all of it.",
                "This course could be more engaging, but it was really interesting and cool. I wish we had done more analysis of the literature itself rather than just translating"

                "Yes!  It's a great way to explore a linguistic and cultural era that often gets overshadowed by our modern stereotypes.  I learned new ways of approaching grammar and words, and by extension, the rich history of our English language.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in language learning, this class is an amazing addition to the English major. The beginning part of the class moves exceptionally quickly, but I really enjoyed this class. Professor Thornbury is a gem, I recommend taking any class you can with her.",
                "Specifically if you need the medieval requirement or are interested in linguistics this is the course for you! It could also be a fun course for senior year (though the workload is high!). My second piece of advice is to find a study buddy or two and to create a routine for translating, textbook work, and the weekly assignments. Additionally, office hours are life savers!",
                "Yes! Take Old English! Even if you're not an English major looking to fulfill the medieval requirement. I will fondly remember this class as one of my favorite from my time at Yale. It's definitely a challenge, but a really rewarding one. You have to work hard for it, but you also end up having a lot of fun with it. Obviously Anglo-Saxon is a dead language, so it felt kind of refreshing to learn something just for the sake of learning. It made for a really enthusiastic and involved classroom environment, where it felt like everyone who was there genuinely wanted to be. \r\n\r\nThe high workload merely ends up being something to bond over, and you'll find yourself forming study groups and meeting up at Bass at late hours to work on translations with classmates while whining about it. \r\n\r\nI'll genuinely miss this course so much.",
                "YES! I loved this class so much, but beware: you need to put a lot of work into the class to get the most you can out of it. And Old English is intuitive in some ways but not in others! So yes take the class but make sure you have enough time in your schedule to dedicate to it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! I learned a lot and really enjoyed it. Fascinating materialits fun to learn how this language worked and be able to read texts in it by the end of the semester. Professor Thornbury is fantastic as well.\r\n\r\nBe prepared thoughits a lot of work.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Though I took it to fulfill an English major requirement, the course was extremely engaging and I learned so much content that I would not have had access to otherwise.",
                "This course was cool and interesting. The workload was generally regimented and well-spaced through the semester. It is not intellectually challenging: if you put in the work, you will do well"
