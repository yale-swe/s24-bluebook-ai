                "In this course, I not only learn architecture drawing skills like perspective, isometric, multi-view diagrams, but also develop sharper eyes to observe life and discover all the beautiful and interesting details around me.",
                "I learned the rules and fundamental ideas behind drawings through this course.",
                "I learned how to pace myself throughout a long term project, as well as how to do detailed work carefully.",
                "I improved my spatial awareness, drawing skills, understanding of different drawing techniques, and expanded my understanding of architecture related jargon.",
                "This course was an amazing introduction to drawing in general, and also in an architectural sense. I 100% became a better and more intentional drawer from this course.",
                "Formal instruction on perspective drawing, introduction to architectural terms (plan, section, elevation), introduction to various ways to depict objects (axonometric, isometric, etc.). I also gained a lot from the daily drawing assignments, as they accelerated my drawing process.",
                "I was able to improve upon the drawing skills that I currently understood as well as ventured off to try new types of media and more challenging subjects.",
                "Knowledge around basic drawing techniques, 3D drawing (isometric, axonometric, objects in multiview, 1\/2 point perspective).\r\nDeveloped my skills of freehand and quick drawing.",
                "My drawing skills greatly improved. As a result my ability to see the world changed. Drawing allows you to learn how to see and this course did a great job in cultivating that skill. Additionally we had to comment on other people's drawings, which cultivated the skill of giving constructive feedback on other people's artistic workwhich is a difficult but useful skill to master.",
                "I gained many new skills through this class!! I gained skills in drawing, sketching, measuring, vision, thought, expression, analysis, and architecture. I gained insight on drawing styles, forms, and critiques. I learned a lot about drawing, its expression through architecture, and self-reflection."

                "It's a great course to learn architectural drawing skills. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who's interested in architecture or just drawing in general. The only thing is that I sometimes feel this class spends too much time on critique and reviewing the students' work. Maybe spending less time on reviewing and more time on lectures or drawing together will make the course experience even better.",
                "Strengths: There was a great collaborative community within the students where we would measure areas we needed to draw together and also go draw after class together. Professor Knight gave us great critiques in class which really helped me improve my drawings.",
                "A weakness is that I did not receive any grades for any assignments I did during the semester.",
                "I wish there had been more time drawing in person during the class and section times. I was expecting more emphasis to be placed on that rather than just reviewing our work.",
                "Strengths: Professor knight is incredibly knowledgeable and a great lecturer. The size of the class allows you to get to know the prof and TF very well, and learn from the work of your classmates. \r\n\r\nWeakness: the 2 hr section on friday can be unfortunate, but honestly I always had fun and the TFs are very helpful.",
                "Strengths: you will learn a lot in a short amount of time, George dubbed some assignments \"high fiber content.\" Paul and George were available for feedback.\r\nWeaknesses: Section often felt unproductive because of the nature of individual feedback. Perhaps it would be more effective for each person to sign up for a time slot so other people will not have to wait for a long time.",
                "The strengths of the course were the constant feedback and the instruction given by both the TA and the course instructor. The weakness was just time. I would love for this course to be much longer where I could really dive into each assignment but it sometimes felt much harder to do a great job with time restraints.",
                "Strengths included that it constantly pushed us students to draw and keep up with the course. There were high expectations for our work and were critiqued on it in a manner that was productive to future drawing improvement.\r\nWeaknesses included sometimes being thrown into a type of drawing without really knowing\/understanding how to do it. Would have been helpful to do more drawing exercises in-class (such as the isometric drawing practice we did). \r\nAnother weakness was section with the T.A., most of the time none of us. had begun the assignment which made our time fairly unproductive unless we had questions about past assignments. Also, the length of section did not need to be 2 hours, 30-45 minutes was usually efficient enough.",
                "This course was demanding but fair.",
                "There are many strengths of this course!! I gained vast knowledge of drawing. I loved the class outline for critiques, lectures, and sections. I liked the creative assignments and on-site approach. One weakness was the workload. Although the class was a lot of work, it was also high reward. I feel very proud to have taken this course. Overall, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, it was a great class!!"

                "If you are looking to improve drawing skills, take this class. You will be challenged by architectural convention but by the end should feel comfortable drawing almost any building. Grade feedback was almost non-existent throughout the course, so it may be a difficult course in that aspect as well.",
                "Yes, I would if they were wanting to learn more about the topics at hand. It is very focused towards drawing architecture so one may not enjoy this course if they do not like to draw and do not care for architecture.",
                "Yes, this is a great course to improve your drawing intuition and skills. I would not recommend if a student is looking for a low-intensity drawing class.",
                "Yes I would recommend, this course is great if you want to get better at drawing and you enjoy drawing architectural spaces or buildings. However you must not be an architecture student to enjoy this course. The course fundamentally focuses on drawing and simply uses architecture as the subject of the drawings.",
                "Yes!!! I would definitely recommend this course to another student!! This course was my first ever drawing course and also favorite course of this semester. I recommend this course to any architecture or art majors. I improved drawing skills greatly because of this course."
