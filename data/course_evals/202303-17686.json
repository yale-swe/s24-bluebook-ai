                "I developed a much wider understanding of the field of art history, and knowledge of what's what in the current conversation around the discipline.",
                "Learned about a wide range of different theories and methodological approaches to art history. I had not taken a theory-based class prior to this one, so it was a very enriching (although challenging) course.",
                "I was a little scared going in because the previous iteration of this class had such a high workload rating. It was indeed a lot of work, but I learned so much about major themes and questions that have surfaced and are surfacing in the discipline. I also got better at parsing through dense readings & synthesizing the information I've read through the weekly writing responses.",
                "Many!  I was able to look at the canon of art history through many lenses-- it was wonderful.",
                "I think that the weekly essays about readings and object observation exercises were really valuable for developing my analytic writing ability and preparing myself for the class discussions."

            "comments": [
                "The workload was quite high, making it difficult to fully internalize anything.",
                "Strengths: great discussion, fantastic readings, super engaging assignments\r\nWeaknesses: A LOT of work",
                "There are a lot of readings, so be prepared for that. The workload for this course was insane, and I found myself directing most of my energy to this course because it was also the most challenging for me. I guess that would be the main weakness: the workload (especially the readings) was so large, that at times I found it hard to meaningfully engage with the material. A writing assignment every single week, even after breaks like Thanksgiving and Fall break was also exhausting. I think fewer assignments spread a bit further apart throughout the course of the semester would've been better. I also found that a lot of the readings dealt with theories/ideas with a foundation in European art. If you don't have a solid foundation in European art, this class can be a bit difficult, especially in terms of class participation, but it's not impossible. In short, this class requires you to put in A LOT of work, but I will say it is very rewarding in the end and you come out of it feeling a lot more secure in your knowledge of art historical theory.",
                "I feel tempted to complain about the weekly writing assignments, but having to write one per week not only helped me stay in touch with the readings but also significantly improved my writing and my comfortability with writing.",
                "This class was very engaging. Sometimes the discussions for one presenter would not mesh well with the next, causing the flow of the conversation to suddenly stop, never reaching a full conclusion (or at least as close as you can get in a seminar class). Each week there seemed to be a text on theory and a text that was like a case study using that theory, but it was hard to present the case study when we were on-location in front of other interesting artwork. Maybe more engagement with the works we visit at the YUAG? Also, it may be helpful to have the opportunity to skip an essay once a semester. It would be helpful if you need to catch up on work.",
                "Under Professor Buckley, this course is an extremely thorough review of art historical methods. The readings he chose are fascinating and introduce you to a huge diversity of perspectives. Discussions were well facilitated, though it was often the same smaller group of students contributing regularly. The major problem with the course as Professor Buckley teaches it is the huge amount of work compared to when the course is taught by other professors. Weekly, you are expected to do ~70 pages of reading and then write a three page short essay. Im a little unconvinced that the weekly three-pagers produced much greater reflection than something like a weekly discussion post would, especially because it gives you less time to focus purely on the readings.\r\n\r\nMy objection is less to the workload itself than to the large disparities between the workloads of the class as taught by different members of the faculty. Given that HSAR 401 is a requirement for the art history major, I really think the amount of work should be standardized between semesters. As it is now, its unfair towards some students and produces different levels of understanding between class years. I think standardizing the workload can be balanced with still giving professors a lot of freedom in designing how they would like to teach it."

                "If you need it for the history of art major, then yes. Otherwise, no. It is not worth it. This is certainly one of the hardest classes I've taken at Yale, so if you don't need it to fulfill a major requirement, look for a different course.",
                "Yes! It will teach you skills that could be applied to any art history course you might take in the future and to any future museum outings and excursions.",
                "Yes, I would.  It is a wonderful requirement for the art history major.  I really enjoyed the weekly assignments, although it was quite a grind.  I particularly liked reviewing specific exhibits and objects from the art gallery's collection.",
                "I strongly recommend this course as an introduction to a variety of methods of understanding, conceptualizing and contextualizing art. I think the courses weekly practice with writing and discussing approaches to art history greatly improved my knowledge and comfort with those skills.",
                "I learned a ton from this course, but I would suggest only taking it with Professor Buckley when you have an otherwise light course schedule because of the huge amount of work he assigns."
