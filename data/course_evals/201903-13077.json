   "comments": [
    "The course was extremely well organized. Probably the only thing that I would change would be the way that the audio programs worked. I'd suggest them having more of the text spoken written down, so that it is easier to follow all the examples, see the spelling of words as well as make it easier for students to revise during exams without having to listen to the audio tape. Also, I would have liked to see in the audio programs the grammar rules more explicitly written out, instead of having to decipher them through the examples. Additionally, I would have liked to see more balanced workload. I mean that sometimes we had do to more work from a Tuesday to a Wednesday than we had to do over an entire weekend. Finally, I would have preferred to have spent fewer weeks on Jules and Jim as I think three weeks is a bit too much and leaves space for an additional movie or book to be studied.",
    "The volume of work for the course gave ample opportunity to practice reading, writing, listening, and speaking.",
    "Like all French courses at Yale, too high of workload and too many stressful tests. The way the oral production questions are administered on tests is a highly stressful environment particularly if prone to test anxiety. Strengths: engaging material, definitely better pace than L2.",
    "It was an intense amount of work and the course had high expectations.",
    "The workload is very intense and can take away from the joy of learning a new language. However, the instructor is engaging and very knowledgeable. The readings\/films we studied were difficult but rewarding to get through.",
    "Strengths - covering a large amount of material in a small amount of time\r\nWeaknesses - doesnt provide any cultural background, feels like were learning the language in a vacuum"

   "comments": [
    "If you love French culture or language learning in general this is a great course to take! However, you have to keep in mind that the workload is pretty heavy as there is a 50 minute teaching section every working day of the semester and on top of that you have about an hour of homework each night which, although long, is pretty straight forward and rewarding.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The course material was fairly interesting and provided a lot of opportunities to improve French skills.",
    "I mean if you're taking French already you're probably stuck. Good luck. Consider changing languages unless you love French.",
    "Not unless you are willing to do the daily work and except a lower grade",
    "Yes. As long as that student is ready and willing to put a lot of time and effort into their French studies, theyll learn a lot in this course. I feel like Im much better at the language now than I was before this semester.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I wasnt planning on continuing French beyond L3, but because of this course I intend to continue through L5 and even study abroad in Paris!"
