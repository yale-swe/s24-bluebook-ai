    "The class provides an excellent theoretical and practical grounding in understanding  and addressing economic inequality in America. The first half of the class focused on income inequality more broadly--including statistics, potential causes, and future prospects (with automation and globalization). The second half of the class then focused on specific policy areas and proposals related to economic inequality.",
    "I deepened my familiarity with modern American political processes, and learned more about the complicated landscape specifically for legislation with distributive implications.",
    "I gained knowledge on a wide variety of topics related to income inequality in the U.S., and gained insight into the political processes that influence distribution of wealth.",
    "This course provided a thoughtfully curated overview of inequality in America. Inequality was presented as a multifaceted issue, and we discussed issues relating to education, housing, healthcare and more."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is really well structured, and I thought that the progression of topics in the syllabus made it so each week built upon what we had learned in the course so far. I also liked the course's mix of theorizing about the problem and talking about potential solutions to the problem, which I think is an important balance to strike. Professors Shapiro and Graetz are both giants in this field, and their massive body of knowledge is evident from the way they conduct class and respond to even some pretty niche questions with expertise. They both had so much to say that there were some weeks when the class was a bit more of a lecture than a seminar, and I think that reworking that balance could be a way to improve in the future. I never minded that this fact, but I do think that if students are expected to complete so much reading each week it is good to have more time for student discussion and questions.",
    "Strengths: the content and syllabus were well-developed and -presented, the professors are so knowledgeable, which comes out in their ability to answer most questions that students would bring up.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the volume of prepared content felt like a lack of faith in students' ability to read and understand the materials, and many class sessions did not have enough time for thorough discussion.",
    "The strengths of the course are the insight and knowledge Professor Shapiro and Professor Graetz brought to every seminar. The structure of half lecture and half discussion allowed us to cover both a wide ground as well as engaging discussion. I would say for an introductory course specifically looking to understand the influence of politics on distribution in the U.S., the course provides a fantastic overview, and I don't have any areas I would suggest for improvement.",
    "At times it was difficult for discussion to be led by students because of the varying levels of prior knowledge we brought to class."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course to people who are interested in the connection between the politics and policy of issues related to income inequality. I think the class' focus on specific policy areas and proposals to address inequality makes it particularly well suited for students who are interested in careers in public service. The class' mix of law students, students from SOM, graduate students, and undergrads is also very unique at Yale, and class discussion benefited from the diverse perspectives that people brought to the table.",
    "I would recommend the class, especially to students just getting involved in the subjects discussed. The readings and slides the professors prepare are very informative and approachable.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in understanding the influence of politics on distribution of wealth in the United States. This course is pretty broad in nature, and you won't ever go into any one topic that deeply. The seminar is half lecture\/half discussion, so if you're the type of person who prefers a traditional seminar style, I wouldn't advise taking the course as we didn't always have a ton of time to discuss the readings. Shapiro and Graetz are both incredibly knowledgeable, and I would recommend taking the course just to hear their insight. They are also incredibly supportive when it comes to writing the final paper, so if you make an effort to meet with them and ask for feedback, they're more than willing to do so. If you make an effort to research your paper with some thought in advance, I think you can gain a lot from the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are self-starters and have a particular interest in wealth inequality."
