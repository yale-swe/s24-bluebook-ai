   "comments": [
    "I gained a better knowledge of how to write a literature paper, and about how to use language as an analytical tool to engage further with certain texts.",
    "I learned how to read literature better and discuss it with my peers. My essay writing has improved a lot. My class participation has likewise improved.",
    "I learned so much about how to participate in discussions and have thoughtful discussions as a group. I also learned a lot about many literature works and different ways to analyze them.",
    "I gained a better ability to participate in group discussions in a fluid, considered manner. I learned about the development of narrative technique in modern literature, and I gained an appreciation for authors I had not yet encountered.",
    "DS Literature taught me to close read effectively, tackle large reading loads more manageably, write more clearly, and speak more confidently in our small seminar-style classes.",
    "This course helped me tackle huge texts in short spans of time, understanding the greater themes while at the same time appreciating more minute details. It also greatly increased my appreciation for the form and style of texts, employed much more by authors of the spring semester as compared to the fall semester of DS.",
    "Knowledge of modern literary canon; ability to trace continuities between texts; increased literary vocabulary; close reading.",
    "One of the main takeaways from this course was surprisingly not just reading and writing skills too, but oral presentation skills! DS Literature really prepared me to read efficiently, write clearly, and argue coherently. It also offers a broad humanistic education that makes you think about history and the human condition from a literary lens."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was enjoyable and I felt I really learned a lot. That being said, sometimes, the method of discussion felt inorganic, as we would just go chronologically through people's reader responses, rather than letting the discussion flow naturally. However, this occurred less frequently than what normally happened in class.",
    "I feel some weeks the reading load is simply too high, but with literature you kind of have to read to the full books so this would be hard to solve. Other than that I find the discussions very productive and engaging. Sometimes the lectures are a little superfluous.",
    "The strengths are definitely how Professor Hagens really emphasizes class discussion and participation.",
    "At times, the course had a nearly unmanageable level of reading. In conjunction with other work, it was impossible to read all of paradise lost and most of Omeros. Other than course load, the class was a highlight of my week.",
    "The nature of DS is to emphasize breadth over depth. While we don't learn too much about each of the books we read, we got a solid introduction to the western literary tradition that will serve as a backdrop of our intellectual careers.",
    "Strengths - the texts  I loved the choice of authors which spanned German, French, Spanish and English authors culminating with Derek Walcott. It was such an incredible exposure to different literary styles and traditions, and lectures were very enjoyable!",
    "The breadth of DS Literature is both its strength and its weakness.  You get a sense of the canon and some great writers, but it is hard to dive deeply into any one book.",
    "As it always is with DS, I feel like the course's breadth is a double edged sword. Something that I really appreciated about the course was the bird's eye view it offered us  by finals week I found it so satisfying to look back at the semester and read the texts again with the benefit of hindsight and over-sight, and see how themes and ideas influenced each other over the centuries, how literary traditions were carried on or morphed or come full circle, and truly feel as though I'd gotten a flavour of every era purely by reading books produced in their respective times (finals weeks was ironically probably the most enjoyable week in the whole semester because suddenly everything made sense  put together). At the same time, DS suffers from that same chronic illness of too-much-to-learn-and-too-little-time, because while it is its breadth that makes it so great, it is simultaneously its greatest drawback. Some weeks felt really rushed, and at times during the semester I felt I didn't really grasp the texts at all before we moved on. There's also always that issue of needing to read SO MUCH in a week and therefore feeling the immense pressure to read fast and read copiously in order to cover ground, but at the same time the opposite pull of needing to slow down to really get it. Often I ended up doing the former instead of the latter, which was really sad. Nevertheless, I think the structure of the final exam really helps to mitigate that at the end of the semester, so the overall takeaway from the course is still arguably very very high."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I learned a lot and would recommend this course to anyone else looking to connect on a deeper level with some of the many essential literature texts in the Western Canon.",
    "Yes, Directed Studies is a great program for anybody interested in the humanities.",
    "Yes, if they wanted to do Directed Studies.",
    "Absolutely! You only get one chance to do something like DS-- take it. It's challenging, but there truly isn't anything like it. You're at Yale with great professors and intelligent peers, and you learn so much throughout the year.",
    "Yes, most definitely. DS literature with the wide variety of texts and authors is absolutely wonderful, and seminars were Professor Hagens were always very enjoyable!",
    "Certainly.  A fantastic introduction to the Western literary canon.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Hagens is a huge proponent of DS as a great preparatory course for the rest of one's career at Yale, and I couldn't agree more. It is an insanely challenging class and definitely a huge intellectual stimulant because of the amount of information one has to process and the amount of thinking one has to do, but it is all so fulfilling and worth it at the end."
