I heavily doubted him, but he was exactly right. This course also forced me to develop some better study habits than I had back in February."

                "Great course, though of course content moves quickly. I wish there was a slightly more organized approach to grammatical concepts.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was Michael, our professor. He is so passionate about Italian and ensuring his students are enjoying their experience in the course as well as learning the language. He is also really funny and injects humor into our lessons. This course was incredible and so much fun. There are no areas of improvement (aside from the remote, virtual format).",
                "i loved this course!",
                "Strengths: prof. Farina is very knowledgeable and engaging, the discussion and immersion format forces you to know the material\r\nWeaknesses: lessons on grammar could be improved by going a little more in depth and explaining more thoroughly, personally I learned most of the grammar on my own just using the textbook and was expected to know it",
                "Strengths - Michael, Michael, Michael. One of the best teachers I've had. You'll get lots of comments about how affirming and encouraging and understanding he is, all true. He's also a hell of a teacher. Teaching grammar is kind of a weird thing, because those who master it often don't have a sense of the rules -- it's just intuitive. Michael explained grammar in a very easy to understand way, offering extremely helpful tips and mnemonic."

There is a lot of work, but it is manageable. There are daily quizzes on the material we go over in class, which was helpful in keeping us accountable and on-pace.",

                "Absolutely, 100% yes. Especially if you have a background in Spanish but don't want to continue Spanish here, this is the course for you. I was nearly scared off by reviews that talked about a high workload. I honestly didn't experience that at all. The workload is high, but Michael isn't oblivious to that, and he paces the course and grades the assignment bearing in mind the high demand of the work."
