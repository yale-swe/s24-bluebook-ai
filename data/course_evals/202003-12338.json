I developed a greater confidence in efficiently evaluating, understanding and discussing primary research, as well as in implementing specific methods. I also gained experience in scripting in the Autodesk Maya environment - I certainly wouldn't have gotten this experience in an academic setting outside of this course.",

                "Many projects, more of learning by myself and trying out different tools than being taught how to use tools in Blender\/Maya.",
                "Strengths: provided great overview of computer graphics via seminal papers. Weaknesses: largely you-get-what-you-give, so only take if you know you're interested in computer graphics.",
                "The papers were interesting to read through, and the discussions definitely helped clarify their contributions. Assignments were generally fair and interesting. I wish we could have seen how to use the techniques we've discussed ourselves in lecture, in Blender or Maya, though I'm not sure if that's feasible.",
                "Good balance of reading papers\/research and short programming assignments working in Blender or Maya.",
                "I felt really proud of what I accomplished at the end of the course and definitely learned a lot, but the zoom format of giving presentations on papers that we already read and wrote a response to wasnt very engaging and not as effective. I wish we spent more time learning how to implement those things into personal projects or discussing the math behind the concepts instead of essentially reviewing homework.",
                "Strengths: The self-directed projects were great and allowed for more organic exploration of the field of computer graphics. The guest lectures by Pixar research scientists were also a highlight of the semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly student presentations on the papers we read werent that great for retaining\/learning information. Lectures from the professor would probably have been better for learning the material better.",
                "I really enjoyed the format of discussing research papers. Most of the papers are classics in the field of computer graphics, so having the opportunity to study those seminal methods in depth was quite rewarding. I also appreciated listening to other students' presentations, as there were frequently insights or observations that I had missed on reading. As the semester continued, I was able to make deeper connections between the weekly paper readings and other materials (even those outside of the course).\r\nThe guest lecturers provided great insight into how the procedural methods discussed in class are used at Pixar.\r\nOne drawback to the format was that there wasn't always time for a lot of discussion - I wish there had been more time for the class as a whole to digest a specific theme. For example, the week covering L-systems for botanical modeling was quite compressed. Having a very short scripting assignment (maybe structured to replicate a specific paper's method) to discuss during class could provide an alternative to presenting an entire paper.",

                "Sure, if you have interest in computer graphics, procedural animation in specific. I think the course equips you with the skills and assignments in order for you to make something cool and that you're interested in. The guest speakers were also really engaging, and their work was really cool.",
                "If you have some interest in the field, it's pretty digestable. You don't need to take CPSC 478 Computer Graphics to take this course, and in fact, I'd say it's easier to start or only take this course over 478.",
                "If youre interested in going into the computer graphics field, definitely consider taking this course.",
                "I really enjoyed the depth of topics that were covered in this course. Although the modeling and texturing techniques are more evidently used in media and entertainment (i.e., the guest lecturers all worked for Pixar), it was interesting to see how more universal computational constraints and concerns were explored (e.g., particle systems leverage parallelization). A rewarding experience from the course is being able to watch an animated film like Ratatouille and recognizing the various techniques and methods. There's a great balance between technical capability and artistry that is really fascinating to study and navigate.\r\nOne caveat is that while CPSC 478 isn't listed as a formal requirement, I think having at least familiarity with graphics would make this course a lot richer. Furthermore, the learning curve for Autodesk Maya is a bit harsh, and induced a fair bit of frustration in the beginning of the course.",
