                "I learned a lot about epistemology and historiography, interaction, systemic relationships, the self, and capitalism among other topics. The framework of decay serves as an interesting entry point and mode of analysis for such topics.",
                "Ability to write a research paper, think critically about pieces, and feel comfortable participating in academic settings.",
                "While I've always felt fairly confident in my writing skills, it wasn't until this course that I understood what it meant to combine reading and writing together. The essays Lacey showed us over the semester were incredible and thought-provoking, and good reading breeds good writing. I feel more prepared to write analytical, personal, or research essays, as Lacey always encouraged us to read alongside the text as well as within it. My topic sentences are clearer, and my grammar is much better. If you've ever been stuck on what a conclusion should look like, this is the class for you.",
                "I learned how to not be scared of writing. It was really helpful as an introductory writing class for this reason primarily. In high school I oftentimes felt overwhelmed about writing papers and I left it to whenever inspiration struck, but I learned in this class that I can write always if I am equipped with the right mindset and the right set of tools. The mindset that I learned to have in this class is to have any idea and run with it. It is only by jumping in head first that you realize the idea is awesome or it is terrible or it is somewhere in between but any way it ends up being is great because editing is just around the corner and the second draft will always be better than the first. On top of that, Lacey emphasized how visual the writing process is, and as a visual learner, this was immensely helpful since I now can map out essays in a way that clicks best in my brainwhether that is drawing out a web of ideas or having thoughts and arranging them physically with post-it notes.",
                "My writing skills have significantly improved after taking this course, and my critical thinking skills have been developed as a result of analyzing the readings we did.",
                "I am better able to write academic papers and integrate my own voice and opinions into the works of others. The course has also highlighted the variety of ways decay is present in society and how decay can be useful in understanding both ourselves and larger societal processes."

                "Strengths were the flexibility to choose the topics you were writing about, how awesome the professor was, and the extent of support offered for writing and completing assignments. Weaknesses were that a few of the texts we were assigned to read felt very abstract and not as conducive for thinking about in relation to other things. Also, there were such vague prompts for essays that it felt more difficult choosing what to write about than actually writing.",
                "Strengths of this course include the relevant readings, the discussion catalysts facilitated by the students, the peer reviews, and the discussion posts that were so insightful. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: \r\n1) Lacey is the best!! She's so kind and thoughtful, and when you meet with her for office hours you can tell she's really read your stuff with a serious eye. She was never mean or overly authoritarian, but we all really valued her leadership in taking us through sometimes-difficult texts. \r\n2) The syllabus like... changed my life. Some of the stuff you read in this course is legitimately invaluable, and Lacey's way of walking you through it is clear and objective. What we read came from really diverse fields, with mostly women-writers of all backgrounds. So good!\r\n3) Canvas discussions. In other classes, I have found them kind of dumb or not worthwhile, but in this course I loved the discussions! My peers were so smart and thoughtful, and occasionally Lacey would give us a fun question or two to spice things up. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1) The only weakness I can really speak to is struggling with the first essay of the semester. That being said, this was also my first semester of college so it might have been hard for that reason alone. But the first essay felt a little shaky/hard to grasp conceptually, and I'm not nearly as confident about it as I am about the other assignments for this course.",
                "The readings assigned, the class discussions, and Lacey as a professor were the strengths of this class. Lacey always had clear, targeted feedback that could directly improve my writing. She was so accessible and approachable. I also really appreciated the discussion post prompts that were posted in Canvas, especially the more creative prompts, as well as the creative project for the final. The only weakness was when Lacey had a guest teacher lead a discussion one classI did not vibe with her.",
                "The small seminar nature of the course allows for everyone to be able to engage meaningfully with the topics. However, the topic of decay sometimes feels overwhelmingly broad because it can be interpreted in so many ways that you never feel like youve fully delved into it.",
                "A major strength of this class is the amount of feedback we received on our essays. Im not sure how it is with other ENGL 114 seminars, but we got feedback for both drafts and final submissions that was always incredibly useful in improving our writing. I would also say another strength would be the content in the readings, for it never seemed to be constrained by the topic of decay or feel repetitive. A weakness of the course might be the structure of some class periods. Sometimes it felt like the introductions to the readings went on a bit, so there was not as much time for actual discussion."

                "1000%. If you think you're shitty at writing: take this course. If you think you're mid at writing: take this course. If you think you're god's gift in writing: take this mf course. Lacey will change your perspectives and force you to have encounters with yourself that are deep and vulnerable, but she won't make you feel like a bad person in the skin you're in. I feel so much more prepared to tackle the \"yale essay\" now than I would have if I'd never taken Decay. The subject was amazing and versatile, conversation was flowing essentially every class, and I'm actually proud of what I've written for this course!",
                "I would recommend this course because I loved Lacey as a professor, I loved the subject matter, and I think it is a wonderful introduction to writing at college. I always found writing papers in high school a stressful experience that led to super late nights so I was mortified to write in college, but this class made me feel comfortable and confident in writing a paper. I know I still have a long way to go in my writing journey but this was such a wonderful step in the process.",
                "Yes, especially to freshman taking English 114, I think this is a very interesting section that has a lot of room for interpretation.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. Ive learned so much about writing and my personal strengths and weaknesses, and Lacey is an amazing instructor who provides a lot of amazing feedback. The readings we did covered a broad spectrum of topics related to decay, and it was always interesting to see where the discussions led. My only caution is that the readings toward the latter half of class became a bit more theoretical and abstract."
