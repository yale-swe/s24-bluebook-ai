                "Strengths - the artists that we studied were extremely interesting and well-selected, as was the reading for the most part. The artwork was also varied in media and across time, and it was a great introduction to modern african american art. The prof has a lot of knowledge about the artists and often had personal connections with them which was cool. the lectures were really detailed and high-level and I learnt a lot of personal information about prominent artists, as well as their connections between each other. \r\nWeaknesses - there was a very high level of reading that sometimes felt unattainable on a weekly basis. The reading was also all in Haas, and unable to check out which was super inconvenient - if you were away from campus or wanted to do the reading when the library was closed there was often no way to do that, as a lot of books aren't even available online. I was often not sure which pages I needed to read for class as they weren't outlined in the syllabus. There was no rubric provided before the beginning of the first essay and marks were deducted for areas that felt unexpected, like the quality of our bibliographies. The class was sometimes confusing and the expected level of participation was difficult to gauge. Sometimes we would not talk about the readings at all and other times we would for most of the class. I also felt like i had no real idea of how I was doing in the class throughout the semester!",
                "It is a very good course, with good coverage of many different themes and artists. It is definitely hard to follow with little prior art history knowledge or experience, but it is possible.",
                "Topics were interesting, but the lectures were somewhat disorganized, and readings were very long and confusing. I know it's a survey course, but I felt like we went over SO many artists when it would have been more engaging to go a bit deeper into fewer."

                "I would recommend it if you have high-level knowledge of the topic already, and enough time with other classes to do all the readings. I think that the course has a lot of potential for the future.",
                "Yes, it is a very interesting class, and there is much to learn. It helped me grow in both my analytical skills and as a person and a writer.",
                "Honestly, no. I always felt stressed entering the classroom and I have just taken better art history courses."
