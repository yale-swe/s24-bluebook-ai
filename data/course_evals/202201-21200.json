At the end of this class, I feel much more confident making websites with animations and that respond to user input. I'm now thinking more about what it means to design for the web rather than just treating it as some sort of grainless blank canvas."

Love to see some introduction to generative design, but I understand the other parts are already a lot for one semester and perhaps more essential.",
                "Rosa is a really generous teacher and very clear in her explanations of coding languages. She was very thorough in her preparation of class materials (in-class demos and presentations, sample code, links to external resources) and went as far as providing multiple formats of learning materials (video and text) for the same subject to accommodate different learning approaches, which I really appreciated. She also would always pause and ask for student feedback, be it whether she was explaining a technical coding issue clearly, or what we thought about the class more generally. Overall she ran the class in a manner that was very non-hierarchical and accommodating of student needs.\r\n\r\nI could also tell that the project formats  interview, tool, and billboard  were designed in a way that was both open-ended enough to allow students to tailor each one somewhat to their own interests yet also playing to the specific affordances of the web. I appreciated how they were always designed with specific collaborators and/or audiences in mind. I've heard from previous students that Rosa has been changing the course over the years too, which I think is great. I think more classes in prelim should be like this  flexible and always growing.\r\n\r\nOne way this course could be improved would be the type of feedback given during presentations of work in-class. Often I felt the feedback focused on technical, minor issues rather than higher-level analysis/criticism of the project's artistic concept or overall form/structure, which I would have really appreciated.\r\n\r\nBut most importantly, I think this course could use 2, even 3, TAs. Rosa's office hours were almost always booked and would go over, simply because coding problems take so long to solve. It's not fair that she (and I imagine Rok too) ended up putting in what felt like so much extra time beyond their paid-for hours. I think the students would also feel more comfortable with asking questions and soliciting help if they knew that they wouldn't be competing with other students for office hours and running the risk of overextending Rosa and the TA. Especially when it came to learning JavaScript, I feel some students ended up detaching somewhat from the class simply because they felt there wasn't enough time for them to resolve all their questions and keep up with the class. Perhaps this class could also be taught over the course of 2 semesters, like core  fall for HTML and CSS, and spring for JavaScript."
