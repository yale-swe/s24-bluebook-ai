                "Not very well organized as a class, basically just readings and discussion, little guided instructions and engagement",
                "Strengths: Coherent structure, straightforward expectations, enjoyable experience\r\nWeaknesses: Could be a bit more diverse in terms of what we did on a weekly basis (more debates or different discussion formats could have been useful)",
                "I would recommend less texts so that students will focus on the texts distributed each week.",
                "The course has so many strengths from which I benefitted a lot from. To begin with, Xiaoxiao has very carefully designed a syllabus that does not overly focus on the development of political psychology in studies of American politics. We covered a range of research in which political psychological methods are applied to study a diverse range of research questions in different regime types. In addition to the always informative course content, Xiaoxiao is also very supportive and instructive outside the classroom during office hours. I presented my research design to her, and over the course of the semester, she has very meticulously helped me to refine my research and point out directions and resources to look at in future studies. I feel so immensely lucky to have chosen the course and I am really appreciative of Xiaoxiao's continuous support!",
                "The course is incredibly interesting and well-structured, and I found the readings to be accessible. I also loved the professor's teaching style and always found discussion questions from both the professor and my peers to be incredibly engaging."

                "I would definitely recommend this to a student with no background in political psychology, but not to someone who has more background in this field. The readings were very introductory so good for someone who is trying to dip their toes in the water.",
                "Yes! It's a great primer to understand research in the social sciences",
                "Yes! If you would like to develop a deeper understanding of political psychology as a field and social science research methods in general. I would highly recommend you to take the course with Xiaoxiao!",
                "I highly recommend this course! I'm a political science major, and it was by far one of my favorite courses I've taken within the department (and in general) at Yale."
