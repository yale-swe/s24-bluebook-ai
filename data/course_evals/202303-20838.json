                "This class teaches you how to see the world and the way weve built it. Understanding the foundations of culture and infrastructure using Space in a way that is applicable to everywhere.",
                "I learned to recognize and question many assumptions taken as \"natural\", such as the supposed divide between human nature and culture. I engaged with various aspects of cultural anthropology, and learned to apply them in grounded analysis (e.g situations related to outer space in particular, and the practice of the sciences generally). I learned what an ethnography is, how to structure one, and what limitations it may possess as a research method.",
                "Space. Thinking about space.",

It is difficult to compress what seems like endlessly sprawling anthropological concepts into a 600-word essay. However, through support from Michelle and continual engagement with class concepts, I understood how to organize and focus my written responses into concise arguments.",

This course blends two seemingly unrelated topics and reveals how much culture plays a role in how we think about outer space. I also learned what it means to analyze something from an anthropological perspective."

                "lectures are really fun and interesting and Prof Messeri is the best",
                "One strength is that it combined the topics of anthropology and space very seamlessly. One weakness is that the reading response assignments feel uneven due to the different lengths of the four units. Also, the unit at the end and the final project feel a bit rushed.",
                "Most interesting course I have ever taken at Yale.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures very much; I think Professor Messeri is engaging and the material was fascinating. I also enjoyed how the lectures incorporated the readings without being a direct paraphrase of them. I think that more small group discussion during lecture would be great, since many people seemed to pay attention more when we did that.",
                "Very well balanced class, readings are manageable, assignments are fair and well spaced, the final Martian Museum was fast and crazy and fun",
                "Strengths: This course is very approachable for people who don't have any prior background in anthropology, and introduces foundational concepts like the practice of ethnography through examples grounded in both \"traditional\" anthropology and scientific analysis of space. Discussion sections allow for deeper formal engagement with the material. The final project is genuinely so much fun, especially at the exhibit where you can see everyone else's work! Weaknesses: Having finished the class, I'm not sure what it was leading up to, since it seems like discussions at the beginning and end of the semester hold the same level of uncertainty - or perhaps that's the point? Also, the lecture/seminar hybrid format is engaging at first, but results in the same few voices contributing later on in the semester (which may skew the direction of worldbuilding for the final project).",
                "Strengths: Clear progression of themes/ideas from week to week, very enthusiastic instructor, very good organization \r\nWeaknesses: Dense material, sometimes felt like we were talking in circles",
                "Strengths: The lectures were very engaging. The final project was fun -- it was the perfect way to use the material learned in class to do something creative. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings were incredibly long and boring. The course does not appear to have a point overall -- it felt like a lot of disjointed topics that never came together to form a full picture.",
                "This course was interesting to see how different cultures view space and the selection of reading material was a strength of this course. I think it would be interesting to take more time to learn about other indigenous cultures' beliefs, since the ones that we did learn about were so intriguing.",
                "Sometimes it got a little boring in lectures, but other than that this was a well-taught and fun class!",
                "A major strength of the course is professor Messeri. She is engaging, brilliant, and offers really thoughtful insights and perspective on the material. She makes the class feel like a collaborative effort to think about the topic and make sense of it, rather than a class in which youre simply being taught material. In this way, and because of the material itself, this class is really different from others Ive taken. I do wish the final project was a bit more connected to class concepts, but it was still fun to do.",
                "The class was well structured around core intersections of anthropology and science. The reading responses and midterm and final projects were fair, and relatively straightforward to approach with the content of the lectures. The readings were interesting, oftentimes with one ethnographic piece and one space-focused piece, though they often were lengthy or dense. The worldbuilding project at the end of the class is great!",
                "Strengths: beautifully constructed lecture topics and discussion sections I was constantly engaged\r\nWeakness: Some the readings could have been reduced down because their core content was less than what was assigned.",
                "The readings and the material covered in lecture were always very interesting! The workload is not bad at all, although the readings for some lectures were really long. The final project required putting in a lot of extra time outside of class, which was hard to manage at times, but the project was very fun and creative."

                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who's interested in socio-cultural anthropology, space, or who is just looking for something interesting to check out. The subject matter is unique and strangely applicable to everyday life despite how it seems on paper.",
                "Absolutely, it is the most interesting course I have ever taken at Yale.",
                "I would! If you like space and anthropology, then it's the perfect class for you.",
                "Yes! It is super fun and a good intro to new ideas about time and space and settler colonialism in an approachable way. Final project this year was a mars museum, which was great.",
                "This class changed the way I understand everything, from scientific literature to commercials. I could go on about the benefits but I will say this was the most applicable and informative course I have taken at Yale. The teaching team all have interesting backgrounds in science and technology which allows them to explain the modern western world we live in through the outlet of space in a remarkable way",
                "I would recommend it especially if you're a STEM major, to truly contend with a different perspective on how you conduct studies in your subject, and what assumptions you make/leave out implicitly. I learned that anthropology is not for me, but I don't regret taking this class as my introduction to it at all.",
                "Yes. Its very interesting material, and even if sometimes I got lost in the intricacies of the discussion, at the end of the day I enjoyed the class.",
                "I am not sure I would -- unless I know they are interested in niche cultural anthropology. It is not very difficult and is a low workload most weeks so if they are looking for a relatively low workload social sciences credit, I might suggest it. But I feel like I left the class with very little impression. We learned numerous topics but how they connected together was never entirely clear. The final project, where we make a museum artifact was definitely the highlight for me.",
                "Yes, at first I was interested in how this class would connect Anthropology to space, since there are no other known human civilizations in space. However, after learning about the metaphors of colonialism, geopolitics, and the cultural differences between how people view space around the world, I learned to view space in a different way, than just focusing on planets or stars.",
                "I definitely would. ANTH 229 is a lovely foray into anthropology for the less experienced, and if you need a Social Science credit, this was excellent. If you love space, it's a fun class!",
                "Yes! The class is very fun and exciting. The workload isnt heavy, and the readings and lectures were all very engaging. I honestly cant think of a reason someone wouldnt enjoy this course.",
                "Absolutely! This course expertly bridges the sciences and humanities...and sprinkles in a fair share of science fiction!",
                "I would recommend taking this course no matter what you are into. All students at Yale need to have the chance to evaluate the societies of the world through this context. As a chemistry major, this was the most eye-opening class for me. You think of space and think aliens but there is just SO much more than you deserve to know, undercover, and experience. You do that with this class,",
                "Definitely! 100%. All of the readings are really interesting, and I always left lecture thinking about outer space in a new way. The final project is also super fun!! This class made me want to take more anthropology classes.",
                "yes!! such a fun, low-stress course that is still engaging and interesting. really added nuance to how I view my relationship with outer space and astronomy",
                "Yes, I definitely would recommend this course to another student! It's a really interesting thought experiment and fun introduction to anthropology! There's something for everybody in this course whether it be learning about the fundamentals of anthropological research, the craft of world-building, developments in space exploration, or museum work. I loved telling my peers about this course and many of them wanted to take it!"
