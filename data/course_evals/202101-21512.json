We learned many important linear algebra theorems (like the rank-nullity theorem and spectral theorem), and fundamental algorithmic methods of solving linear equations (gaussian elimination, gram-schmidt, diagonalization, etc). The definitions/notation/terms used throughout this course appeard to not follow what many others use (i.e. using the term nullspace instead of kernal) based on my browsing in stackexchange for help with lecture concepts, but that probably isn't an issue, especially if you go into more pure math later. Some of the concepts I learned like matrix inversion and linear transformations were ones that I wish I had learned sooner - some s&ds courses I took before would have been a lot less painful having already known these topics!"

                "I truly do not understand how Yale as an institution tolerates such poor classes in our math department. The current state of 222 (abysmally taught, horribly organized, and unfairly graded) is frankly an embarrassment to the school. This has probably been the worst course I have taken in my life. I ended up switching it credit/d because I had 0 clue where I stood grade-wise relative to the rest of the class. Stay away if you can.",
                "I think it's an effective way to learn these topics. The course mainly teaches computational methods, so I will say it could be a little boring at times (since many problems would be similar or mostly following a rote technique), but I appreciated that the problem set makers including some more interesting conceptual problems as well. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if the course could incorporate more programming, since there's not much reason to do these methods by hand anymore except to learn them. One question on the bonus problem set involved image compression - maybe there could be more questions like that?",
                "The teaching of the concepts could be improved immensely. I found myself learning from Khan Academy more than anything else. I found the teaching disorganized, and the lectures need to be better at explaining the significance of what we even are learning instead of just giving us the method and some vague theoretical proof. \r\n\r\nI think class could be improved by organizing it such that: \r\n1.) Tell us what the thing we're learning is (i.e. Eigenvalues)\r\n2.) Tell us the method with some examples. \r\n3.) Give the big picture (i.e. what's the significance of an eigenvalue?)",
                "Having it taught by all three professors made the learning more equitable for all students, but I found that I understood my assigned professor the best so I wish he had been my only professor the whole semester.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- reasonable exams\r\n- incorporates practical applications of course concepts\r\n- responsive instructors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- not the most engaging lectures\r\n- prerecorded lectures were a bit on the long end during some weeks",
                "Strength: The live \"class\" twice a week was where I did most of my learning. The discussion sections were also super helpful to do more examples and ask more nuanced questions.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The recorded lectures were not my style. A one hour lecture would take more twice the amount of time.",

                "The manner in which the material was taught was rather difficult to understand. Despite watching all classes, material was seldom understood due to the overload of terminology seemingly out of nowhere.",
                "Sometimes some wrong information was given in lecture or notes or answers or something and that made some things really confusing. Notes and slides were given and were useful but I think it would be more useful if they were all typed instead of hand written and if they included the important comments that were spoken in lecture but weren't bullet pointed or mentioned in the notes.",
                "A strength was the variety of practice problems that were given to us, either in lectures or in the optional sections. The professor was pretty good about explaining his steps, and answered questions really well. A con was that in this this semester, 3 different professors took turns recording a given week's asynchronous lecture videos for all of the math 222 students across sections. While Prof Landa's lectures were always pretty good, the other professors' were not. It was harder to get a good flow of learning because of this. Also, the psets became increasingly difficult, and would have personally been near impossible to complete without the help of a study group. This was combatted by another major strength - the quality of peer tutors was astounding - they were friendly, funny, and helpful. They really made the class worthwhile"
