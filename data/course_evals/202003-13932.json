While we talked about contextual historical background at times, this course does not talk about the Opium Wars or what led to British Conquest. We mainly start after British colonization and go to the 2020 Hong Kong protests.",

                "Strengths: There were only a few students in the class, which gave everyone a lot of opportunities to speak and engage with the materials. You learn a lot from Professor Ho, but the other students also play an important role in your engagement with the content. You really learn a LOT in this class, so be prepared for that. Weakness: There were times when the class just became quiet, and Professor Ho had to step in and try to direct the conversation. I think that's just a product of virtual setting. It might be solved in an in-person setting with more students.",
                "The syllabus is well-organized. I enjoyed reading books and articles in other disciplines such as sociology and anthropology. Writing essays based on primary sources has been a great learning experience as well. This seminar has been one of the best I have taken at Yale as everyone is devoted to class discussion.",
                "I enjoyed the seminar style of the course. It was helpful to receive individualized feedback and to learn from my peers. Moreover, a lot of the primary sources that we examined were very niche and unavailable publicly, so it was cool that my classmates and I had access to such material. The main thing I would have appreciated more of was clarity regarding writing expectations. I felt like I went into the first essay blind and din't know what had been expected of me until after going over my comments. It would have been helpful to receive the rubric beforehand. Moreover, there were times where I felt like some of the course readings were a little repetitive and could have been cut down and\/or replaced with something else. Furthermore, while we started examining pictures, videos, and podcasts towards the end of the course, it would have been interesting to look at more diverse formats of primary sources earlier on.",
                "On the whole, the course was engaging and the readings & primary sources were well selected. However, there were a few weeks when we had an enormous amount of reading assigned, to the point where it was unfeasible for me to finish all of it in addition to my other coursework (but I guess this is a history seminar, so kind of typical)"

This made the class material extremely accessible, and I feel like this aspect of the course should even be preserved during non-virtual times."

I will warn you though that there's a decent amount of readings, and you can't skip them. My seminar had six students, and so you had to know the material pretty well to discuss it.",

I felt like the material was put together thoughtfully and enjoyed many of the readings. However, I feel like students who are interested in general history, rather than region-specific events, may find that this course isn't for them."
