The course was very fascinating and rewarding because I could see how concepts I learned in other classes be translated to various technologies in the real world. The guest speakers allowed me to understand what the field of pharmaceutical companies and industry was like and provided a unique perspective that I hadn't otherwise been exposed to.",

                "Strengths: I know many people find the rotation of professors a little confusing, but I personally enjoyed learning about different areas in biotech form experts in their field of research. I was engaged with the material and felt that they were including basic biology themes in the context of their applications to biotech\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like the midterm/final formats were a little too difficult, and that we had to memorize too much content as opposed to just learn it.",
                "I enjoyed the papers we read each week because they were not very long and they related well to the course content. I also appreciated having guest lecturers.",
                "The TAs are not updating the Canvas files regularly. The course materials are very interesting, but the course overall is a bit unorganized.",
                "Really interesting course. Learned a lot. Having many different professors is really cool! Exam structure is a little bit confusing.",
                "The course was taught well and the discussion sections were helpful.",
                "Strengths: The course was very detailed, and all of the professors did a thorough job with explaining the main concepts. The course provided a wonderful overview of biotechnology and things I haven't considered, including plants, how industry works, etc. Key biology concepts were emphasized and tied into applications, so I learned a lot and got to review a lot of key concepts from past courses. The professors were open to questions and each contributed something new and illuminating about biotechnology. The learning objectives are very helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the quizzes had more questions rather than some of them only having one, so it was worth quite a bit. Sometimes the exams feel like you have to remember a key detail or slide.",
                "Strengths: you learn a wide range of topics. Weaknesses: the instructors are often rude, unhelpful, and non-responsive to emails. Some of the lectures were really confusing, and it was often unclear what to expect for assessments. The exams (particularly the final exam) test minute details that are not important in terms of the larger themes of the course. The course was also really disorganized, with professors not even aware of upcoming assessments listed on the syllabus.",
                "Strengths: the material is very interesting and well-taught by professors who are experts in the respective topics; the assignments, grading, and workload is fair; and there is an emphasis on analysis and discussion of primary literature. Lectures are recorded and can be rewatched at your own pace, which is especially useful. Weaknesses: Previous exam materials would be helpful at understanding what is expected, which can be difficult at times when multiple professors are writing questions for the same exam and the result is a somewhat schizophrenic scattering of content.",
                "I think one strength is the amount of professors that teach the class, meaning if you have trouble learning from one there are more you can learn from. In the future, I might recommend more study guides after each professor to keep the information organized before each exam.",
                "I think the strengths of the course were that there was a wide range of perspective that was possible due to the guest lecturers, but this was also a weakness in that there was not a clearly unified topic or field that the course covered.",
                "It is great because a lot of info is crucial to know. It could be improved with more detailed coverage of topics.",
                "Feedback was very slow and getting grades/comments back on my assignments before a month afterwards would have been very helpful.",
                "I really enjoyed both lectures about scientific advances that are currently being applied in biotech and the lectures from people in biotech about the different career paths. I would have enjoyed hearing from a few more outside speakers because the second half of the semester was very science heavy."

Each lecture was very detailed and highlighted key biology concepts and how it has been applied. The professors and speakers also provide unique perspectives on industry and current technologies, which was fascinating to learn about, and they connect it to real world issues.",
                "No. This course was really disorganized, often confusing, and taught by professors who did not have much interest in the success of the students.",
                "Definitely, this is a great upper-level in MCDB. I was surprised by the sheer volume and breadth of information covered, as biotechnology really is more of an umbrella term than I initially expected. The emphasis is definitely on the science rather than the business side of biotech, which I personally appreciated. Each professor had something unique to add to the course and lectures never felt monotonous as they can sometimes be in other courses.",
                "If this student is interested in the world beyond simple biology or how biology fits in to the world, I would recommend this class.",
                "It's very interesting, but the grading can be quite harsh and variable by the TA.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, I think it is a great way to get a sample of what type of technologies are being used in the biotech industry. However, I would caution that there is a lot of biology that is reviewed but not covered in depth, and it is difficult to understand some of the concepts if you haven't taken some other biology courses previously.",
                "Yes",
                "Eh- it was a fine course, but definitely not the most interesting in the MCDB major. Im sure you can probably find an upper-level elective that dives into a topic more deeply and in a more engaging manner.",
                "Yes, I will recommend this course to another student since this course covers a range of topics and really helps to expand our vision in viewing biotechnology.",
                "Yes Its wonderful.",
                "Yes. It was a good course which covered a broad range of topics and will likely appeal to a broad range of people."
