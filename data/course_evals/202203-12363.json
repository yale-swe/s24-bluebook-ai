                "I can only think of strengths! Mike and Kelsey are great teachers, class is super interesting and exciting, and almost all of the time needed for the class can take place. during class time. This class was one of the coolest things I've gotten to do here.",

                "YES!",
                "Yes - 100%! For anyone interested in acting stage combat is such a valuable skill and for anyone interested in telling stories (directing producing designing even) the fundamentals of consent based work and critical analysis of the stories you are telling is so important.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any actor or director, or anyone with an interest in doing fight choreography. Not only did it give me the confidence to execute and choreograph fights, but I also really appreciated the emphasis on cultivating a consent-based classroom and rehearsal space.",
                "Yes.  This course was incredible, both in the kind and helpful instruction we received and in the fascinating content.  This is a must take for anyone who wants to act.",
                "Yes! This is the perfect class--you learn so much but it's not stressful. Outside of the midterm and final, there's not a lot of work required outside of class. Classes are a joy to attend, and Mike and Kelsey are great at giving clear feedback along the way which makes it easy to learn everything correctly. And if you've ever wanted to punch your professor, this is your chance."
