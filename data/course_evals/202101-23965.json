                "I learned a lot about critical race theory, settler colonialism, and how to think critically about texts, poetry and writing that I had never even considered before. Through the projects and presentations, I learned how to become a better and more aware writer and reader. I learned how to discuss and read academic and critical texts and apply them to poetry and prose, which I had never done before.",
                "I learned how to think critically about the portrayal of indigenous people, their efforts to reclaim ownership/autonomy over their stories, and the modes of resistance employed by Native authors in their poetry to further this process. Also, I have a new found admiration for spatial features of poetry that many of these poets have used.",
                "Professor Hickey is incredible at teaching and selecting texts that shift your understanding of Indigeneity and settler colonialism through the lens of poetic expression. We discussed so many different ideas and epistemologies that have really changed how I approach the world and think about things like power and loneliness and sex.",

                "In some ways this is a survey course of Indigenous Poetics. In order to make sense of the poetry, we read theory alongside it both the poetry and the theory complement each other in unique ways. The topics we discuss are so important, and (unfortunately) so unique at a place like Yale.",
                "Exposure to poetry written by Native poets, bodies of theory on poetic practice and indigenous politics.",
                "I learned how to think critically about the obstacles that Indigenous, non-settler populations in the U.S. and other settler-colonial nations face.  These barriers include, and are certainly not limited to, the ways that publishing companies and political agendas can influence and determine what stories may be widely told, who can tell their stories and what ways they can be told, and what information may be withheld and changed (by the story-telling populations, as well as the editors who influence the ways certain stories are be structured).  The course also reinforced the importance of viewing history as a culmination of iterative structures versus one-and-done events."

                "Strengths: Alanna Hickey!!! She is the sweetest, most encouraging, and most knowledgeable professor at this university.  \r\nweaknesses: Literally none, I learned so much and this was my favorite class this semester.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Hickey and the poets included in the Syllabus. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The reading was sometimes a bit long (esp w/ the secondary readings) but Prof. Hickey was able to adjust her syllabus like the queen that she is to address this workload during this hard semester.",
                "Everything was an open conversation and Professor Hickey made it clear that we could come to her if the workload was too high or needed adjustment and I feel that those changes were made with the number of readings we were assigned around the middle of the semester.",
                "Professor Hickey has created an amazing, welcoming, and intellectually stimulating class that I absolutely loved. The course covers a broad survey of really interesting poetry collections that scans some of the thematic motifs in Indigenous poetry (queer/feminist Indigeneity, Indigenous futurisms, etc.). Prof Hickey organized the class in a way that really builds community between students and puts all ideas in conversation with each other. I really enjoyed the brief check-ins at the beginning that made me feel more grounded and helped create connections between students. The student-led discussions were really fun and helped make it feel like the conversations were ours, with help from Prof Hickey to smooth over transitions and link ideas. I really loved this course and can't think of something I would change.",
                "Professor Hickey is absolutely amazing and really made this class interesting. Poetry was great and the assignments were really accommodating, which was so great this for semester!",
                "I loved this course!\r\n\r\nStrengths: thoughtfully organized syllabus, reading great poetry, Prof Hickey fosters a wonderful class environment and is incredibly understanding and responsive to student feedback and input of all kinds. the main weakness was I wish we'd done more work so discussions could have gone more in depth, so the fact that I wished we had done more reading hopefully tells you something about how special this course and professor are\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we chose as a class to make the theory readings optional. I hope in future in-person classes they're either mandatory or strongly encouraged because I got a lot out of reading them and wished we could have spent less time in student presentations on the theory and more time discussing both the poems & theory in conversation with each other! But despite this I still loved the course",
                "No weaknesses. This course was incredible. I learned so much without stressing too much about it.",
                "This course was fantastic. Prof Hickey is an astonishingly brilliant and kind instructor, and the class material is fascinating and something everyone should engage in at some point. The discussion format worked really well, the overall structure was great, and the feedback Hickey gave was always incredibly helpful.",
                "No weaknesses, other than my wish for more time in class to discuss.\r\nStrengths are endless an incredible syllabus combined with an incredible professor makes for an excellent class.",

                "The class syllabus was structured to give a comprehensive overview of materials from a variety of Indigenous, First-Nation, and native populations.  The instructor was also very knowledgeable about the field and provided great additional reading suggestions to the class to continue their learning outside of the classroom."

That was infinitely more valuable to me than any other assignment I'd completed during the COVID-19 semester.",

                "The check-ins were amazing and helped me feel like both a sane person and a member of a communal space. Breakout rooms were always successful in helping us formulate ideas when we were drained and feeling low-energy. The alternative assignments were generously compassionate and actually made me feel like I took more away from the course than if I had just written an argumentation paper.",

Prof. Hickey will meet you where you are at and help you become a better reader, writer, and thinker.",

She is so warm, brilliant and radically welcoming (especially for students who are new to this subject area, like me). She will do everything she can to support students, point them to texts that they would be interested in, support them when things get difficult, and treating students like real people. The class itself was wonderfully thoughtful. We were able to explore so many ideas, experiences, and modes of thought. I think I've learned more from this class than any other course I've taken here.",

                "I cannot recommend this course highly enough. I learned so much and honestly had a great time.",
                "YES!! Take any course with Professor Hickey, she might just be the best instructor at Yale. The course was always fully engaging, the readings were excellent and often the type of thing one wouldn't necessarily have exposure to otherwise, and the assignments were really mindful of covid limitations and our overall exhaustion. One of the best courses I've taken thus far.",
