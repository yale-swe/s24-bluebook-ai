            "comments": [
                "A weakness of this course is that is tons and tons of new material every single week. This is more of an issue with heat transfer as a subject rather than the course itself, but we probably could have spent less time covering the early chapters and started covering conduction closer to the beginning. This would have allowed for more time to finish convection and maybe cover radiation at the end of the course.",
                "I think that the course is very thorough but could have more emphasis spent on examples and applications at the expense of some depth in derivation.",
                "The course is impeccably organized, and Professor Bennett's teaching is great. The lectures can be tedious (not sure if there's much that can be done about that). The psets were all reasonable in length/time commitment. Professor Bennett's office hours were significantly more helpful that the TFs' office hours.",
                "Extremely organized course, even if this is Professor Beth's first time teaching this course. The lectures were very clear, the topics gone over in class translate fairly well to pset problems and to exam problems as well (besides some of the first exam). There is also lots of help and resources beyond the lectures as well. Though the first exam was pretty difficult, the difficulty and content overlap was fixed over the last two exams.",
                "The course was very well taught, however, I believe the exams were much harder than any of the homework or practice problems we did, especially given the time constraint. I also believe that the TA's did not grade the exams fairly, but gave back points in places where you felt you deserved partial credit.",
                "One of the strengths was that it was SO organized which is a given since Dr. Bennett is teaching the course. The lectures notes are super useful, and there were plenty of office hours where you could ask questions. I think any hiccups that occurred this year will probably be smoothed over next year since this was Dr. Bennett's first time teaching this course. The weaknesses include a lack of preparedness at some of the office hours not run by Dr. Bennett and typos in the textbook problems/solutions, but the latter was often addressed in announcements. The workload was definitely manageable. I think the SD problems were very helpful, but the SD sessions themselves were not and it was kind of awkward to sit in a room and work on problems, so I rather ask my SD-related problems at an office hours then go to an SD session.",
                "I wouldve like to have learned something about radiation. Other than that, A+.",
                "De. Bennett is the best teacher in the mechanical engineering department and has a great way of teaching.",
                "This was a great semester, especially for one being taught by Beth for the first time. I really was engaged by the lectures, and there is always help when you ask for it. Some more practice problems in class would be useful, but it is understandably hard to do so in the given time with all the content supposed to be covered.",
                "Strengths: just like all of Dr. Bennett's courses, S23 heat transfer was incredibly organized and well put together. There are plenty of opportunities to be successful, and she will work with you until you understand the material. I also have always been a fan of the 3 \"mini-exam\" format as opposed to a traditional midterm and cumulative final. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I mentioned that the 3 \"mini-exam\" format was a strength of the course. I think, though, that an in-person closed-note exam was not ultimately the right format for assessments. By the end of the year, our formula sheet was 20+ pages, and the exam was pretty much knowing when and what formula to plug the problem variables into. I think a take-home, open-note exam with a handful of more difficult problems would make more sense.",
                "This was an excellently-taught course. Dr. Bennett's lectures were very thorough and seemed to have an intentional narrative to the presentation of information. The organization could not have been better. My only comment is that I would have preferred to learn a little more about radiation at the end of the course instead of more about convection correlations, because I don't feel I gained much from learning about additional correlations beyond the first few.",
                "I like overall how the course is laid out. I do wish that we had formula sheets to work off of from the beginning of the semester. I think that would help a lot.",
                "This course moves very quickly but it really has to. I appreciated the exam and grading structure. There were plenty of office hours where I learned quite a bit. Having typed lecture notes for every lecture was also a HUGE boon for me and my learning style. The greatest strength was Dr. Bennett's communication and care for each student. I was pretty okay with writing this course off as an L from the start and really was dragged back into the fight through her care.",
                "This course was difficult for me due to the sheer quantity of equations you come across. By the end of the term, our equation sheet was over 20 pages long! Also, the material can be very repetitive because it builds on itself. \r\n\r\nI also feel that our practice exams had very little bearing on the exam questions, which made it hard to feel like you could prepare adequately for exams."

                "Yes! Though the lectures may be a bit dry, they are very clear. All of the course's resources and information are very neatly organized, with plenty of reminders and notes and advice. We had a pretty deep dive into conduction and convection, but we ran out of time to cover radiation as in-depth as the other modes. Regardless, I learned a lot about heat transfer, I think about the concepts quite a bit outside of class, and as long as you do what you're expected to do, it's a good course and you'll do fine.",
