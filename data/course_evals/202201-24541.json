                "Knowledge of US-China relations and related issues in economics, grand strategy, technology, politics, etc; ability to use evidence to make inferences and dispel misconceptions",
                "So much! China's shifting ideologies and ambitions, misconceptions that China has about the US and vice versa, the problems that China is facing right now (e.g. social safety net, weak consumption), how to interpret the trade and tech war between US and China. The writing exercises (op-eds and final paper) also helped me improve my writing and argumentation skills.",
                "Key issues in Chinese economic development",
                "It was interesting learning from such an experienced professor and his viewpoints on China and more specifically us China relations. Definitely a global class and not much economics. Based off of his book coming in the fall so read that and its very similar to his class.",
                "A thorough understanding of China's growth from the 1970s to present day, with a firm emphasis on the country's economic structure and political pressures. Real-time understanding of the issues facing China today and how it has chosen to deal with them. A comprehensive understanding of US-China relations over the last two decades and how they went from codependent to conflict-ridden. Tells both the Chinese and American stories.",
                "I learned a lot about China's trade deficit -- the reasons behind it and all; the tech war between US and China; decoupling -- and a lot of concepts that come up when discussing US-China trade relations.",
                "I was forced to approach US-China relations with a more open mind and really improve my critical thinking skills via analysis of this topic. I feel that I have left with a much deeper understanding of the Chinese political system and economy, as well as the US's China policy. The course also helped my presentation, concise writing, and economic analysis skills.",

                "Easily the best class I've taken at Yale. Professor Roach is knowledgeable, thoughtful, and deeply invested in his students.",
                "No weaknesses. Strong investment from Prof and TA, incredible content, fun assignments.",
                "Strengths: syllabus is excellent and Professor Roach is obviously an expert in the field\r\nWeaknesses: the two hours sometimes felt long; class size slightly too big for a seminar",
                "This was an extraordinary course taught by an extraordinary professor  really no suggestions for improvement (I'm sad that future students might not have the opportunity to take it!)",
                "Strengths: Professor Roach is very passionate about teaching and does a great job stimulating good discussion. He provides detailed and extremely timely feedback on all assignments, including tips on how to prepare presentations, comments on draft presentation slides, and feedback on papers. He is such a knowledgeable scholar on US-China relations and it's just a fantastic opportunity to learn from him. The course workload is very manageable and the readings are well-selected, such that you learn a lot without feeling too stressed.\r\nOne very minor weakness is that Professor Roach has a habit of calling on the person who raised a critical question before class to answer the question during class. I find it a little weird to cold call the person who raised the question, and sometimes this prevents other people from jumping in.",
                "Too big of a class and maybe should have more reading responses",
                "Strengths: Almost everything. Structure of the class is perfect--roughly one third lecture, one third seminar discussion, and one third student presentations. Nothing ever felt forced. Each class was a gem. Reading is sizable but fair, and the workload is very appropriate. Having to write the big research paper at the end of the semester is great experience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can't think of anything.",
                "strengths: passionate instructor--clearly cares a lot about the material; flexible class-- Zoom make-up sessions for students who had COVID\r\nweaknesses: leminar -- technically a seminar, but felt like a lecture -- students were call-and-response when it came to questions. Very much felt like the professor would present his presentation, ask a couple of questions, then students would present their presentation for the weak. There was little discussion, and when there was, some students who would participate would get into technical economics jargon that went beyond the readings and felt a little inaccessible. The readings for each were also a little repetitive and a little too much for each week.",
                "Though it was perhaps unavoidable, the extension of virtual classes resulted in my being more distracted and less engaged in class. Also, students seated at the back of the classroom were really unable to see or hear as well as those at the front. It also would've been nice if the critical questions portion of the class was not the same every week or if students whose questions didn't get selected as often were invited to speak about another subject, because sometimes it felt that the same people were getting selected to speak every week. I think there should have been more time for questions and discussion  or students' contributions could have had a time limit  so other students could speak.\r\n\r\nHowever, all the assignments were really engaging and I felt like I grew a lot in this course.",
                "Strengths: layout of the course with lecture and student presentations followed by discussion is great",
                "could be more of a seminar-style format. I really really enjoyed the student presentations - wish they played a larger role / took up more of the class time!"

                "Absolutely, for the opportunity to learn from Professor Roach, to learn about a very important topic in the current world, to understand US-China relations, and to improve presentation and writing skills.",

                "Absolutely, absolutely recommend if you can get in. Best course I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes, but only if you're very interested in the very quantitative workings of why US-China relations are the way they are. Students should also prepare for slightly biased viewpoints when it comes to presentation topics and the sections of readings that are provided.",
                "Yes, definitely. I fear I would've been fed a US narrative of what China is like if I hadn't broadened my view through this course. The assignments are fun and the course style forces you to get to know the other students and what they think. It is a great space to be challenged and to improve.",
