                "A major strength is the overall direction of the course. It's centered upon three films with very distinct directions (no dialogue, dialogue, etc.) which was helpful! It's difficult to improve upon, but yes the three films can be... a little overwhelming for producing a great product. However, I also think that naturally comes with an undergraduate semester timeline!",
                "Strengths: You learn so much in the course and receive so much practice by making your 3 films during the semester and helping your teammates on their film sets. You also gain so many friends because the film community is so tight-knit and supportive. Professor Andrews is a great instructorhe essentially teaches all of Yales film students how to become filmMAKERS. And he provides a wealth of feedback on every single thing you do to help you improve your craft. I do wish that we could have done a few more small filmmaking exercises during class time with Professor Andrews assistance at the beginning of the semester so we would feel even more prepared to make our first films outside of class.",
                "This course provided a lot of hands on work which was great.  It felt like a good language class that focuses on total exposure to quickly build fluency.  3 projects is the ideal number.   It also built a resilient community of filmmakers which I hope persists through the later programs and even out of school.\r\n\r\nMy major complaint is that we spend most of our class time reviewing each other's work.  This often drags on.  Not all students are on the same experience level.  High level students did not get the same utility out of these long feedback sessions.  \r\n\r\nThis time could have been better spent teaching fundamentals of filmmaking, breaking down certain cinematographic looks\/ lighting setups, teaching editing workflows and tricks, watching famous directors work with actors, or giving us time to work on our projects during class time.  I'm not suggesting that we get rid of the review sessions, but they could become one part of the three-week production cycle rather than every class.  Maybe part of homework is assigning students to review each other's work and send feedback by email?\r\n\r\nADDITIONALLY: The lack of film equipment is unacceptable.  THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH 4K CAMERAS, BATTERIES, AND LIGHTS FOR STUDENTS TO USE.  The 1080p camcorders and Canon EOS Rebels at Bass Library are suitable for high-school level projects and below, NOT FOR WHAT WE ARE DIONG.  The fact that students are competing on the online sign up system to get enough V-Mount batteries for their cameras or lights is absurd.  I gave up halfway through the semester bothering to use it and relied on the equipment I had brought with me from home, not all students have this ability.  This is embarrassing for the film department.",
                "I loved this course. It was really really hard but I think that was an important element to this course. I will say it felt sort of sink or swim, but if you put in the work, you are rewarded."

That being said, I would reiterate the insufficient equipment and encourage them to supplement their learning as much as possible with YouTube to explicitly learn how to structure their scripts, work with actors, and understand their editing software.  The upsides of this course was the community and the experience, the learning was mostly student driven.",
