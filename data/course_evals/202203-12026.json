                "Learned how to look critically at the archive, about how black history intersects with this. Also how to read and understand fiction and non-fiction within the context of the archive.",
                "I learned so much it was such a lovely class and i feel like profesor Kelley brings so many good perspectives. Going to the Beinecke was such a great experience and the readings were amazingly manageable but also had so much depth and the class had such a high return without being overwhelming and the final creative  counternarrative was such a great and creative experience. Really amazing class to also think about the process of writing and how to express inexpressible. Great to have a majority minority class too.",
                "So much more engagement with close reading, topics that truly made me think about the black archive in ways I hadnt before, and learning how to take a closer look at primary source material.",
                "In this course, I had the opportunity to learn about a new framework of looking at archival works & reframing\/re-defining Black histories that were either taken away or distorted.",
                "Not only did I learn so much history through the texts we read and pieces we studied in the archives throughout this course, but this class challenged me to consider what we consider history versus fiction (and if fiction can in fact be a generative form of history in the absence or erasure of the archives). In a word, it pushed me to reconsider who defines history itself. For this reason, this class greatly improved my skills as a reader and a history student, especially since we spent so much time in the archives.",

                "Strengths - incredibly engaging, really great material and readings from a diverse source. Well-organized class with the perfect amount reading (that is shown by number of pages each week!). Professor Kelley is a fantastic professor.",
                "Strengths: manageable amazing readings with really meaningful class discussions, going to the Beinecke every week and looking at some amazing texts and photos. Made me think a lot about writing and the violence in reproducing some histories as something ordered but also the hope and joy and radical imagination in counternarratives. Professor Kelley tended to have an introduction and some context which can feel at times more lecturing than some seminars but I think often provided really helpful context and a perspective that organic and exciting class discussions grew out of.",
                "This class was FANTASTIC!!! Prof Kelley is exemplary. Not a question about it. Best part Id say were the readings. Every single one was amazing. Also, my favorite part of the class was honestly just the energy in the room. It was very relaxed and it felt like this incredibly safe space to talk openly about things you were thinking about, wondering, or just unsure of.",
                "STRENGTHS: the class itself, both the formatting and the teaching. Each week, we visited the Beinecke, which was integrated in the discussions we would be having two days prior. EVERY discussion was engaging, and the act of physically touching the history we were talking about was such an intellectually powerful experience.",
                "The strengths of this course were Professor Kelley's teaching, the texts we read, and the class' frequent visits to the archive. Through the different media we explored, Professor Kelley constantly pushed us to consider the texts we were reading not only within the historical contexts in which they were created (or which they addressed), but through new lights as counternarratives. I looked forward to attending this class each week because of the engaging conversations we had, and I especially enjoyed the creative projects we completed for our final assignment.",

                "Yes! Definitely look at the course reading list and assignment list but I think that this was a high reward class and experience where there is genuinely time to read and discuss. Really amazing class and special in its archival focus.",
                "Yes oh my god if you have a chance to take a course with Prof Kelley, absolutely jump on it",
                "YES. TAKE IT. My absolute favorite class of the semester, and my favorite English class at Yale so far.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Kelley is one of my favorite professors I've had at Yale, and the course itself was fascinating for the texts we read and our frequent visits to the archive. This class intellectually and analytically challenged me more than any other class I took this semester, and I looked forward to coming to class each week!",
