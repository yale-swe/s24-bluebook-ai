The community that Professors Herreid and Dorfman build is supportive, intellectually rigorous, and outright fun. One weakness this year: while a theatrically fulfilling experience, the stage management for this production was at best condescending, at worst demeaning, and on every level unprofessional. The great thing about YBOP, however, is that everyone is incredibly caring and works to make sure that everyone feels well supported and that their needs are met.",

                "This course is unique; before spring break we talk about acting and do some exercises while learning our music, and after spring break, we have rehearsals multiple times a week to create an opera. Because of this, the culmination of this class is incredibly satisfying; a performance is much more gratifying than a test or essay. This class could maybe be improved with a little extra rehearsal of the music before break."
