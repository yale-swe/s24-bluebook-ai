The format reminded me of the Directed Studies program (I'm an alum), but with a greater emphasis on lecture\/historical context and somewhat less on group discussion. The syllabus proceeds from early Church history all the way to the present, offering close engagement with primary source texts each week. You will learn to trace the development of Christian ideas over time and make connections across centuries. Very rewarding!",

                "Strengths: amazing professor, guest lecturers, and TFs; visual aids during lectures; interesting reading assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes there is too much reading to get to in one week; no break during lectures, some days it is hard to stay focused the whole time\r\n\r\nHow it could be improved: avoid an overload of reading (less reading makes me more compelled to do it all, but sometimes I get overwhelmed seeing so much and don't know where to even start); break up the lecture by showing a video or asking a poll question or even just saying take two minutes to stretch",
                "The course presents its themes from the very beginning and chooses material that reflects these well. However, considering how large some jumps in time periods were, making connections from one week to the next can be very tough.",
                "This is an excellent, well-structured course. You can see how the professors who designed the course (Prof. Eire and Prof. Brenzel) carefully selected each text to provide a coherent narrative of the Catholic intellectual tradition that is easy to follow (while still interesting and challenging enough), even for someone new to the tradition. Each primary text selected provides key ideas within the Catholic tradition or challenges to it that allows you to gain a broad understanding of the tradition over two millennia (which is not an easy thing to do at all in a course).",
                "This course has many strengths. The frequent guest lecturers offered engaging perspectives across a broad range of disciplines and academic expertise. The weekly discussion sections offered an excellent complement to the lectures. The exams were very manageable (one-hour passage ID) and I actually enjoyed putting the various texts we had read in conversation with one another. The essays also offered an opportunity to practice this skill in more detail. No improvements to suggest!",
                "some of the reading is very very dense and I don't think they contributed to my understanding of the essence of the course.",
                "This course's strength was its breadth. We covered so much and I truly felt like a got a strong understanding of the general ark of the Catholic intellectual tradition. However, I did feel that I was lacking depth on some texts. This would've been helpful for work like Thomas Aquinas' Suma Theologica and Augustine's Confessions, which we kept returning to throughout the course but I never felt like I fully had a grasp on.",
                "Strengths and weaknesses were a bit contradictory- I really liked that there were multiple lecturers, but Professor Eires lectures were always the most engaging, so I wish he had lectured more.",
                "Strengths: great choice of readings, manageable reading assigned every week, guest lecturers also added to the course.",
                "Carlos is an excellent lecturer, and the guest lecturers he sometimes brings in are highly respected and intelligent themselves. Certainly the strength of this course  is Carlos Eire himself, he is a brilliant mind and makes lectures entertaining and engaging. I wish all of my teachers were as cool as he is.",
                "Strengths: Carlos Eire is a great professor and very easy to follow, and the actual work assigned wasn't difficult.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings were especially long and could have been cut down, and some weeks had significantly more readings than others. I think the week on Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton in particular seemed lopsided relative to the much larger quantity of reading in other weeks. Some of the guest lecturers also didn't use slides so it was harder to follow.",
                "I would say a weakness of the class is the long readings, the lectures that include no participation, and the lack of time to fully dive into any topic. The strengths would be the discussion sections and how interesting the course is.",
                "This was my favorite course this semestervery organized, and my TF was helpful and encouraging. Professor Eire was so knowledgeable and enthusiastic, and I loved the guest lectures too!",

You read all of the \"core\" texts: Dante, Augustine, Thomas Merton, the Gospels. There are some really knowledgeable guest speakers, and small sections make for a great discussion. This course has a low workload, with just a couple of short papers and a midterm\/final that are just a few reading IDs. Definitely take this class if you can.",
                "Definitely! I learned so much and I really loved the professor and TFs. Very interesting discussions and readings, and I enjoyed the class a lot.",
                "Yes, everyone should learn about the Catholic Faith in its fullest and most beautiful forms.",
                "Absolutely! This is an excellent course. You should take it especially if you've interacted, engaged with, or consider yourself part of the Catholic tradition. You will really gain a much deeper understanding and true appreciation for the richness of the tradition and the ways in which it has changed, been challenged, and stayed the same through history. This is a class about intellectual history so you will learn about ideas and debates within the Catholic tradition over millennia (e.g. touching on the earliest church debates about Jesus, or natural law), rather than church structure, modern day politics, or socio-political history if you're more into that, but engaging with these ideas are very worthwhile. The texts can be challenging at times, but the professor, TA, and section are there to help you through it.",
                "I am not exaggerating when I say that this class changed my life. I had never come in contact with the depth of this tradition that I have (nominally) belonged to my whole life, but have only recently begun to pursue in earnest. I am all the more inspired to inquire into my faith now after encountering the vast scope of ideas that have endured for millennia and shaped the Catholic Church for what it is today.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is looking to learn more about catholicism or christianity. It is a very well organized crash course in the intellectual origins and evolution of the Christian\/Catholic faith, which underpins Western thought in general quite substantially. Some of the reading gets dense, some of it is interesting, close reading isn't super necessary so I would say it is manageable.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course if this is a topic they're interested in. This was my first ever religious studies class and it was excellent way for me to be introduced to the subject and I felt really confident in a lot of the knowledge I learned.",
                "Yes, absolutely. This course shaped my understanding of Catholicism so deeply. This course is great for anyone, regardless of their religious background. An understanding of the religion is not assumed in any means. Personally, however, I found myself getting more engaged in my faith as a whole after\/while taking this course.",
                "Yes, it was well-organized and well-taught.",
                "For sure. Take this class if you are Catholic, thinking of converting, or just interested in Catholic history in general. I cannot recommend this course highly enough.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in Christianity. As far as lectures go, it's not a gut, but the workload is extremely manageable.",
                "Yes! I loved this course. I truly feel like I learned a great deal that is easily applicable to my other studies and the world around me. Yes, there is a bit of reading but the discussion helps anyone get through it. I really really enjoyed the course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to other students! If you are at all interested in religious studies, or, like me, are interested in intellectual history but are more familiar with the secular side of things, this course provides a wonderful survey of some of the fundamental texts of the Catholic intellectual tradition. Professor Eire is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic, as are the guest lecturers.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student, especially those who are interested in majoring in history or philosophy and those seeking to better understand their faith or lack thereof, whether they are Catholics themselves or want to better understand Catholicism in juxtaposition with their present beliefs. It is interesting, engaging, and edifying.",
                "Would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Catholicism (institutionally, theologically, etc) and its development over time and with\/against change. It covers some very foundational works and gives a great introduction to higher level courses. Its great for non Catholics as well, as it covers the pre-Christian thinkers, Enlightenment, Protestantism, and modern thinkers"
