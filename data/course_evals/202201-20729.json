I learned about medieval women writers, but also so much more, like what it means for women to have a voice, what access to their interiority can show us, and what it means for us to access them so many years later. I also learned how to quickly read and understand texts like Dante, the Decameron, and Sor Juana."

                "I loved the way that this course engaged so thoughtfully with a variety of female authors. I was fascinated to see how the prototypes of biblical and classical women reappear throughout the centuries after, and the ways that women work within these cannons to construct themselves and other women. I felt that anyone interested in this time period would find that the lens of feminine figures is incredibly revealing of the values of the period at large. Also, it was a great opportunity to read a number of very prominent texts (The Aeneid, Dantes Inferno, Bocaccios Decameron, as well as remarkable, lesser known female authors like Christine de Pisan)",
                "Strengths: everything! Professor Tylus is such a kind soul and always knew how to lead discussion in the perfect way. While sometimes the reading was a little overwhelming, it was always interesting. This is the rare kind of course where you get out more than you put in; regardless of whether or not you'd sat down and analyzed the reading, the class discussion always flowed so smoothly that you felt comfortable jumping in with questions that popped up on the spot or your own take on things. \r\nWeaknesses: there often were tiny problems with structure, like not knowing about how to hand in assignments/assignment details beforehand, but that's a pretty easy fix"

                "Yes! You will read and write a lot every week, but on material that is fascinating. If you participate regularly and do the readings, the weekly responses basically write themselves.",
                "Yes yes yes! Please take this course, if only for Professor Tylus, who is one of the most caring, well-spoken professors I've interacted with. Her thoughts always encouraged the most interesting discussions and it's clear that she wants every one of her students to succeed. As an example, she bought us tickets to go see SIX (the musical) on broadway, and afterwards invited us to her apartment for refreshments. If that's not the type of professor you want then I'm not sure what to say to you.",
                "Yes! I learned so much about a niche topic and all of the readings were interesting. I would warn future students that a lot of the readings were long, and some were dense, but it was easy for me to figure out a balance between the amount I could read to be fine for class each day."
