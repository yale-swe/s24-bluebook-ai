Sources that we explored in the course ranged from those typically seen in the study of history, such as written primary sources, to those that may be less common (but valuable nonetheless), such as podcasts, interviews, newspapers, memoirs, art\/photography, and even participant observation (drawing from sociology). Furthermore, through the three short paper assignments, this course helped me improve my writing skills. I was able to explore and experiment with incorporating close readings of different kinds of sources into my papers.",

                "I learned fragments of Hong Kong history, which was inevitably filled in by three Vox videos, an informative animated history, the Cambridge History of China, and Google. I learned how to not have small talk during office hours, b\/c when Ho says 15 minutes, your appointment will be nothing more and nothing less and she will stare at you coldly as you attempt to smile, but instead the life is sucked out of you as she is there to talk history and nothing more. She refuses to read drafts (even when 10 people total were taking the class and barely anybody was asking) or paragraphs, won't really help you refine your argument, and will tell you your thesis is bad without telling you why. I learned that grading is arbitrary and sometimes you just have to suck it up. In terms of Hong Kong, well, I learned more about southern China than HK. We talked about Shenzhen and southern China equally if not more than about Hong Kong, which boggles my mind. We skipped major parts of HK history, like the Opium Wars and the initial ceding of the territory to Britain, the Asian financial crisis, Vietnam War refugees, and migration in out of the city between the 60s and 80s (she basically skipped an entire two decades, along with pre-1900s HK) which left much to be wanted. The knowledge I accrued is not comprehensive, and barely covers anything important. We discussed protests, but they were rarely contextualized. We talked about factory workers, but instead of reading historical documents, we looked at ethnographies. And then talked about why visual imagery and participant observation is important. At times it seemed like Ho wanted to be a secret anthropologist, but as already explained, she lacks the social skills to actually carry a conversation. Because class is ENTIRELY STUDENT RUN, we were attempting to learn from each other's underdeveloped opinions. We spent a great deal of time talking about the merits of studying history, looking at different archival materials, and about her other course \"China from Mao to Now\" along with her own historical work; sure it's interesting, but I did not pay for this. I signed up for (and applied for actually) a class on a cross-border history of HK and China, and I left with what should have been called \"Cherrypicked and Fragmentary: South China in Selected Years.\" That's the knowledge I left with. And I still don't really know how to write a history paper. [sidenote: why would we read about Chen Village anyway, if it's not in HK??? Some of the reading materials were so disconnected from HK proper that it was discombobulating to read something that seemingly had no connection to the topic of the class. Not to mention that this 400 page single spaced ethnographic study was assigned during the peak of midterm season. No one read the whole thing in-depth. No one had anything insightful to say. Would've suited \"Mao to Now\" better than this class. Please swap with something more HK-centric or HK related b\/c this was not.]"

                "Strengths: The short papers (as opposed to one long term paper) allowed for more feedback from the professor early on in the course. In this way, I was able to use feedback from previous essays to improve future work. The small, seminar format of the course was also conducive to lively discussion. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only (minor) weakness is that the \"blog post\" requirement sometimes led to redundancy in the discussions- occasionally, the discussions became a revisiting of what students had written in the weekly discussion post on Canvas.",
                "Strengths: well-organized, expectations for each week are laid out clearly\r\nWeaknesses: not much to be honest",
                "Some visual context would have been good, and some introduction to actual content\/contexf",
                "STRONG: the content was what kept me surviving this class. Reading are super interesting. Ethnographies are fascinating (albeit more suitable for an anth\/sociology class, so they felt out of place). Some materials were gathered from just a few months ago, if not last month. We talked about the resignation of the remaining pro-democracy members of the LegCo in HK and discussed the implications of that. !!WEAK!!: literally everything. No joke. I read a review that said \"Ho has heard this feedback and will likely provide a bit more in terms of background lectures and\/or overview-focused readings in the early weeks.\" This NEVER happened. Not once did she lecture, and only when someone made a blatant error in recounting Chinese history did she interject. I cannot tell you where Bao'an County is or point to Shenzhen on a map. I did not know why HK was British until I watched a Vox video that explained all of HK history better than our readings did in 10 minutes. In our discussion posts (which I'll get to soon), we were begging her for context by asking concrete questions. Never answered. And for the life of me I have no idea why we had to do those posts anyway. I wrote all of my thoughts about the readings in my post, so by the time I got to class, I had ~nothing~ more to say. At all. Then, inevitably, we'd get \"could you talk about your selected quote?\" Well, no, b\/c if you'd read my post, you'd see I said everything there is to say. Might I suggest that we DON'T post the posts and instead write them so we can all share what we wrote in class instead of trying to recount what everyone's already read? They were useless. Even worse, in a 4-6 person class, there is no need to assign 2 discussion leaders. At this point, Ho's class was glorified book club, glorified because we're paying tuition for it. None of us actually knew anything about Chinese history to make an apt synthesis point or make an astute observation about trends of the past coming to the future. Comments were \"it's so interesting\" umm thank u, next? Most infuriating of all was the \"how would you answer your own question\" question. Prof. Ho, if you're reading this, for love of Cardinal Joseph Zen, I asked my question in the first place BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO IT! Why on earth would I write a question I had an answer to? And why would I want to answer my own question? And she never failed to ask why a certain medium was good for studying. Idk, b\/c it is? Like, I'm not learning anything from discussing the merits of participant observation for 45 minutes, but b\/c this class is a waste of time anyway, might as well go with it. Don't even get me started on the papers, though. Incredibly unhelpful and condescending when you go for help, with half-assed preliminary commentary. Refusal to meet to discuss anything class related outside of the two office hours at very inconvenient times (she just won't meet at any other times. at all). Essay grading when there are only 10 students who wrote 5 page papers on the same things took 2 months, and then she used a rubric we didn't know existed. She sent two sample papers with students' names on them, too--way to inflate egos while making the rest of feel stupid and worthless. That's literally the worst possible thing you could do to tell someone how to write better. No thesis guidance. No argument guidance. Don't need outside research.. unless you want an A, or you want to do prompts 1, 2, 3--or wait, they're all the same prompt: create your own prompt after reading and watching the following things that were not on the syllabus! Spend an ungodly amount of time writing a 5pg paper to get back illegible feedback that says \"improvement from last time!\" or \"you almost convinced me\" or \"I'm not sure you fully proved that\" yes queen, give me absolutely nothing! What am I supposed to do with that feedback? Biggest letdown of 2020, let me tell you, and it had so much potential. Waste of time."

What ensued was the most catastrophic disappointment of my college career (and I've taken over 35 college classes). Not once did Ho use a visual aid. No PPT. No pictures. No videos. No screen sharing. No text. Nothing at all. This was the least engaging class I have ever taken in my life. And in the middle of midterm season, as the election was getting ready to wreak havoc on our democracy, she assigned a 400 page ethnography of village that basically had nothing to do with Hong Kong. No one read it intensely. We all skimmed. I got nothing out of the book. The short papers were a stupid idea too. \"No need to use outside sources\" yeah sure, unless you're aiming for B. I can't say anything succeeded at all. It was a major disappointment through and through.

First, she reordered the readings so as to provide some continuity in the timeline. Fine. But where were the background or contextual readings? Yes, it's a seminar, but for the love of all that is holy, that does not mean that when all we do all day is stare into boxes on a screen that you can't use visual materials??? Put a picture up for god's sake! Play a video! Share your screen when we look at specific quotes! Do some lecturing so we don't make baseless claims! Answer a question with actual substance! She literally set us up for failure. We talked about protest art but never looked at any together. We talked about the Ta Kung Pao coverage of the 1967 riots, but didn't collectively view the pictures we were assigned to look at. We listened to podcasts about the 2019 and 2020 protests, but never watched any of the media coverage. There was no color among this vastly colorful city. There was no vibrancy in the dullness of the pandemic. There was nothing hopeful amidst hopelessness. Ho is utterly as non-personable as you can get. She's as cold as dry ice and as bland as unsalted pretzels. Her personality is a deep as a rusty screwdriver, and the class format is as stale as the piece of bread you forgot about in your dorm refrigerator. You go to office hours to say \"Hi! How are you!\" and you're met with disdain and nothingness. She's there because she has to be, or at least that's what it looks like. Any of my excitement or joy that would've come from studying HK was thrown out the door as soon I took her class. She sucked the jubilation out of thin air. If we went on a tangent for an extended period of time, a bunch of us considered that a win b\/c it was more engaging than the regularly scheduled programming. This class was not a history of Hong Kong. It was a disarray of various episodes in southern Chinese history, with little continuity. Governor Patten, his reforms, the Opium Wars, the relationship with China, refugee crises in both directions, economic strife, etc. were never discussed. It was just assumed that we knew how HK became HK and how the government worked. It was assumed that we knew about the creation of the CCP and the Chinese Revolution, when on the syllabus it said \"no prerequisites.\" No wonder after the first class, when both sections were completely enrolled, 75% of the people dropped it. Literally no guidelines on how to write a good paper. Arbitrary grading (someone please tell me what a dual grade with a slash means?? still don't know). And grading took forever. Like two months forever. And feedback was useless. This class was just a disappointment. In her course video, she seemed so engaged. The syllabus looked fantastic. The primary source documents specially curated during her research in HK were a unique touch. The seminar style looked great. Assignment grading seemed fair. Result: not engaging, breakout rooms were pointless. When we didn't get that the Shenzhen Museum would have been patronized by wealthy HK citizens she gritted her teeth, laughed angrily, and looked as if \"you guys have literally learned nothing!\" Well guess what, I haven't! I'm literally heartbroken over the fact that I thought this class was going to be my favorite one this semester and it turned out to be the one where I could have read all the materials and talked to an imaginary friend about them--I would've gotten the same out of it. Please get rid of discussion leaders. It's lazy teaching. There. I said it. Fix discussion posts so we don't say everything we have to say on them. Give actual prompts for the papers so we aren't in the dark. Have a rubric with numerical grade values. Explain where on earth HK is. And rename the course b\/c it's a lie to say the class is a border history of HK. Yale history dept is famous, but this class was just not it chief."
