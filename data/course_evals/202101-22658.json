I loved the diversity of disciplines that were incorporated into the course, and I feel like I have a such better understanding of an incredibly interesting region. Even during the semester, I was able to use things I learned in this course in other courses I was taking simultaneously, and I think any student pursuing global affairs, IR, or political science should be knowledgeable about the Middle East.",
                "This course gave me a solid, broad understanding of politics in the Middle East, with a special focus on the Arab Spring and its aftermath.

                "Strengths: very interesting, relevant, and important content. Fun and engaging TF. Assignments were overall very manageable and easy if you keep up with the course content and pay attention in lecture. \r\nWeaknesses: many of the readings often did not seem particularly relevant to the assignment content or final exam",
                "not in class",
                "There isn't a single thing I would change about the syllabus or course structure. I really enjoyed the material, learned so much from section, and thought that the assessments/grading policy kept me genuinely engaged with the material throughout the whole semester and week to week.",
                "Strengths: interesting material that was easy to follow, no one assignment would dictate your grade, assessments were such that you had to be engaged with the material throughout the course to succeed\r\nWeaknesses: no major ones I can think of",
                "Strengths: The course readings and lecture content give you a broad understanding of many aspects of Middle Eastern politics that were impacted by the Arab Spring. This is a really thorough introductory course. The weekly live lectures, where Professor Nugent would interview experts on the MENA region, was so fascinating. It was the highlight of the course, and it was so cool to hear her ask them questions that I had submitted to her. Weakness: The recorded audio lecture was not very engaging. I'm a visual learner, so it was difficult for me to absorb the information in the audio. The content was interesting, but the mode of learning made the content less engaging.",
                "This course is supremely well-designed for a beginner who has little background in the field. Recorded lectures were organized, guest speakers were fascinating, and section was structured to supplement and reinforce material from earlier in the week. This is probably the best-organized class for online learning that I've taken.",
                "Strength was cool class, but weakness were the lectures. They did not really adapt well to remote learning environment.",
                "Good class",
                "The readings were quite interesting, and I really enjoyed section.  My TA, Drew, was great and we always seemed to have lively discussions.  The lectures were generally interesting as well.  Overall, this was a great course for understanding the cultural and political aspects of the Middle East as a general region. \r\n\r\nI wasn't a fan of the weekly guest speaker.  It was difficult to stay focused, especially on Zoom.  I think if this class had happened in person the guest speaker component would have been quite engaging, but I often found myself working on other things during this time slot each week.  A better way to format the class would be to provide more lecture material and go a bit deeper on a narrower range of topics; this could be compensated by limiting guest speakers to every other or every third week, rather than each week.  This type of format would simultaneously address what I feel are the two biggest weaknesses of the course: the surface-level coverage of a wide array of topics (as opposed to a more confined focus) and the outsize presence of guest speaker presentations as a pillar of the course.",
                "There was very little student engagement in this course. There were only pre-recorded podcast-style lectures and town halls with guest speakers where our questions were mandatory, submitted before the town hall, and asked by the professor, not us. Everyone had their camera off for almost the entire semester. It s a nice course if you're looking for an easy grade without having to do much work. But if you want to learn and engage, I'm not so sure.",
                "Strengths: very comprehensive overview, good readings, manageable workload that didn't place too much emphasis on any one particular assignment, great TF and discussion section organization. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: recorded lectures made engagement with course a bit more difficult at times; class often focused on egypt and tunisia because of the prof's background, would have liked to delve more into other countries in the region; we looked at a lot of Western-oriented literature on the region, I believe this class demands more literature from scholars in the region to be more comprehensive and accurate/representative.",
                "Very disorganized, I genuinely did not learn a lot.",
                "The strengths of this course were the guest lectures, which were fun and helpful, some of the non-textbook readings, which were interesting, and Professor Nugents clear and succinct lecture style, which was refreshing. The main drawback is that the course definitely stays at the surface levelwhich is somewhat (but not completely) understandable, given its introductory nature.",
                "Strength - low workload\r\nWeakness - Doesn't go too in depth on anything (could be a positive)",
                "The pre-recorded mp3 lectures were obnoxious to listen to, especially since Professor Nugent spoke quickly. It was difficult to feel engaged while staring at a blank screen. However, I enjoyed how the class was structured and it was evident that the readings were chosen thoughtfully.",
                "I loved the course! I think section and the town hall's were the strongest portion of the course, followed by the course materials (especially the video materials that we watched). I also really appreciated how the final paper was broken up into 4 parts, which made writing it significantly easier. The course's  weaknesses are: (1) The weekly quizzes. I think that weekly quizzes are appropriate, however, it was not accommodating to students schedules. Instead of being open from 9 a.m. till 2 p.m., Prof. Nugent should have let them be open for a 24 hour window.;(2) The podcast lectures. While Prof. Nugent did provide a brief outline for each lecture at students request, it could have included more information/highlighted more key terms. As someone who is more of a visual learner, it meant that I often had to replay her lectures to fully capture the content on the recording because of the complexity of the material being provided.",
                "Strengths - super interesting format, really enjoyed the hybrid of the recorded lectures, live virtual town halls, and discussion sections. I also liked how the paper assignments were broken up. Prof Nugen was wonderful!\r\n\r\nweakness - the quizzes often covered extremely specific subpoints and studying the lecture / readings etc sometimes didn't help",
                "I think the strengths of the course is its structure. We had prerecorded lectures as well as townhalls with many interesting guest speakers. The workload is really light, and the readings, videos, lectures, and townhalls are all really interesting. Professor Nugent is very knowledgeable about the region, and does a great job of making the material accessible to students who have never studied the Middle East before. I also think the fact that the course covers such variety of topics makes the course interesting for students across all fields of study at Yale. The one weakness of the course is that the guidelines for the final paper were extremely vague (i.e. no rubric), and the very strict word limit and source number requirement felt tedious and unnecessary.",
                "Strengths: The professor and teaching fellows packed a lot of information into the syllabus and lessons without them seeming too dense/overwhelming. The assignments kept me on track and assisted my learning but weren't overwhelming. The weekly town halls were really interesting, as was the \"virtual teach-in\" assignment. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I left the class with a lot of knowledge about certain countries/developments in the Middle East (e.g. those involved in the Arab Spring, Saudi Arabia and Iran) but wished that the course had gone into deeper detail on other topics as well (e.g. Israel's occupation of Palestine, the legacies of western imperialism/influence, gender and politics).",
                "I wouldve loved to cover other areas of the Middle East, especially in relation to our readings on Turkey and Iran",
                "I really enjoyed the weekly town halls as well as section each week.",
                "Strengths: strong professor, cool guests, Arab Spring discussions were enlightening.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it was taught during COVID times, and while Professor Nugent changed up the syllabus to conform more to that, it still made it tough to concentrate. Plus, it's an intro class about political science in the Middle East, which is very hard to do. I think that, while it is nice that we teach this, a intro to modern history course would be more suited for the MMES department to have, so that this type of class could specialize on the Arab Spring.",
                "The lectures could have been accompanied by photos/slides/transcript as the podcast was not difficult to stay engaged with and less accessible for different types of learners. Overall I really liked the format of the course",
                "Strengths:\r\nFantastic Professor and TF's.\r\nVery well structured.\r\nMany useful resources for studying.\r\nBrilliant diversity of content.",
                "This course was a wonderful course. Besides its large focus on the Arab Spring, it foucsed on many other aspects of the politics in the Middle East, such as elections, voting, and political participation.",
                "At times it could be difficult to follow along to the recorded lectures without much visuals besides the outline, but the townhalls were a great way of listening to experts in the field and sections also cultivated great discussion.",
                "Strengths: I loooved the guest speakers -- they were all amazing (and particularly enjoyed hearing from Professors Masoud, Zaki, Lotito, and Ambassador Ford). I also appreciated that the questions were curated beforehand so the conversation was organized and there were no awkward silences. I also though that the readings were pretty good, though I didn't always read the Lust textbook readings. I recommend making the historical background / content from the textbook feature more prominently on the quizzes if you want students to read it. Finally, I liked how section was organized around a piece of recent news rather than just a review of the material, which is often boring if you did the reading.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would've liked a little more historical background in the lectures, if possible. I'm a history nerd.",
                "strengths: topics are interesting and having guest speakers was very exciting and informative. Good balance of films, articles, and textbook material that were interesting. Assignments were very manageable. \r\nweaknesses: The readings were quite long most weeks and it was hard to get through them all and take notes relevant for the quizzes. The podcast style lectures were very difficult to take notes on because the professor talked really fast and you have to pause every few seconds to write down what she said. The class was a lot of listening without any seeing."

                "the townhall with speakers was very successful and the teach in was also interesting. The podcast lectures were the only thing that were rather unsuccessful just because the speed at which the professor spoke was too fast to learn and take notes without pausing every 3-5 seconds. This could be improved if we received a written version/slides of the material to go along with the podcast or the outline she was reading off of."

                "Yes! It's very fun and manageable. You have the advantage of discussing and reviewing interesting current events topics without stressing over memorization or strict grading.",
                "yes!",
                "Yes, especially for students who may not have much familiarity with Middle Eastern politics. A great introduction to the region.",
                "If someone asks me for a course that provides a thorough introduction to Middle Eastern politics, I would recommend this course.",
                "Yes. Chill class where u get to learn a good amount about the Middle East and protest movements",
                "Absolutely -- regardless of year or major, this is a helpful introduction to the region and the issues that affect today. It is a low-stress way to study highly consequential topics, and I feel I've gained a broad understanding without sacrificing nuance. The teaching team is super responsive and helpful, and everything was well-organized for note-taking and generating understanding of the material.",
                "Yeah, if they are interested in the Middle East and do not know too much about it, take it. It's a pretty easy course if you put in a little effort too",
                "Yes",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking for a first foray into political science or a better understanding of the Middle East.  That's the situation I found myself in, and I've come away with a good grasp of the region and its issues, as well as a heightened interest to learn more.  This class probably isn't the best for specialized knowledge --- say, the Israel-Palestine conflict --- but it is an ideal starting point for identifying and pursuing subtopics of interest within the field of MIddle East studies or political science.  I wish I had taken it before my senior year so that I could have explored some of the avenues it illuminated.",
                "I would recommend it if you have a good understanding of the Middle East already and are looking to do some thinking on the Arab Spring. If you're looking to learn about the Middle East a new, try to find another introductory course, perhaps Professor Lotito's because this course is very much on the Arab Spring and can give a very biased perspective of what the Middle East is like if you don't truly understand it. \r\nAlso if you want an easy grade, sure take the course but that shouldn't be why you're at Yale.",
                "Yes! I really loved this course and it was the survey course into the region that I was looking for! Really caring prof and TFs made engaging with the course virtually much more possible.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who has little background in Middle East studies and also has a strong interest in revolutions and the Arab spring. To students who only have one of those, the course may still be helpful. Students with any background in Middle East studies may learn little new material from the course.",
                "Yes, It is super low workload and interesting!",
                "Yes, if the lectures are in-person. Great material.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I would like to note though that the course's name is a little misleading. I initially went into the course thinking that we would be examining current domestic/intra-regional politics of the Middle East. The course primarily focused, however, on the Arab Spring. Although the Arab Spring obviously greatly impacted the current state of the Middle East, it was essentially all that we discussed in the course. While could have been that it was the 10th year anniversary of the Arab Spring, but I do not feel like the course title and description accurately reflect the course material. It was still an incredible course though, and I do believe that it enhanced my insight into regional politics of the Middle East.",
                "Yes!!!!! I loved it!  I originally thought I would credit - d - fail it as a fifth class but ended up getting so much out of it that I took it for a grade.  Highly recommend it, I learned so much, can't say enough great things.  Helps if you have a background in the middle east or international relations or Arabic, but not necessary.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It really strikes the perfect balance between interesting material and light workload. Especially for students in the social sciences, learning about the Middle East is both fascinating and important. Professor Nugent is great, and she brought in phenomenal guest speakers.",
                "Yes, this course is a solid political science lecture that will introduce you to comparative politics concepts and give you a general understanding of politics in the Middle East. If you are an upper-level political science student or someone looking for more specific content, I would recommend looking for a seminar with a similar topic.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course",
                "Maybe? An intro class about the Modern Middle East is sorely needed amongst the Modern Middle Eastern Studies department, and until said department gets a regular, introductory class, one should take Professor Nugent's classes or Professor Lotito's classes which fill this gap. A history class, or at least a class that focuses on events and people rather than theories, would be more suited, but definitely do take these classes to learn from a brilliant and caring professor.",
                "This course isn't what it appears: while the name makes it seem as if it's a basic survey course of Middle Eastern politics, it could more accurately be described as an in-depth exploration of the many causes and consequences of the Arab Spring. Turkey, Iran, and Israel, for instance, feature very little in the course, while you'll feel like an expert on Tunisia and Egypt in the Arab Spring once you're done. It's certainly a fascinating topic; just be aware that the course isn't what it says on the tin. The course overall isn't super difficult, and the professor and TAs grade gently as long as you complete all the required work and check-ins (of which there are a lot, such as submitting a question for each week's virtual town hall guest). The town halls definitely set this course apart from others, and some of the guests, such as a former US ambassador and human rights defenders on the ground in Egypt and Palestine, are really stellar, while others are less so. Readings and each week's discussion are generally interesting and I recommend the course overall.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would definitely recommend this class.\r\n\r\nThe content is fascinating and teaching is brilliant. If you are looking to understand how culture and factors specific to a particular region affect their politics, you would find this interesting. Additionally, my historical knowledge and understanding of events such as the Arab Spring developed enormously. Truly loved this class.",
                "Yes, I will certainly recommend this course to another student. It teaches real-life lessons about the politics of the Middle East and allows one to critically think about different issues and topics.",
                "If you are interested in gaining a foundation in understanding the Middle East, yes.",
                "Yes, definitely.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in the middle east! The workload is very manageable and the lectures and guest speakers were very engaging and covered interesting topics. There is a good mix of readings, articles, and films so you would learn from a lot of sources and gain a good base of knowledge about various specific countries and politics in the MENA in general."
