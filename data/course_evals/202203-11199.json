            "comments": [
                "Strength: The course readings are entertaining and interesting to read, and they are definitely composed of some of the best literature contemporary China has to offer. Weakness: The course is really unengaging. Su Wei is super interesting and has a lot of fun stories, but it kinda drags on after a while and you don't spend any time discussing the text in any meaningful way, and there is virtually no time spent on grammar or vocabulary, despite this supposedly being a \"language\" class. Also, there was a lot of unnecessary handouts that we received in the class and were told to memorize, but they were not graded, and were not useful in anyway except as a party trick that you memorized some random verses from a poem or from Confucius.",
                "I believe that the stories we read are a real strength, and Su Lao Shi's passion about the course is as well. However, I do think that this course would benefit from more participation from the class, because as I experienced it, it's essentially a small lecture course. Everyone is great at Chinese, and I would've loved to be able to hear my classmates' opinions more.",
                "I think that while the course covered a lot, some of the content seemed too hard. Some of the readings would probably have been challenging even for native Chinese speakers, so it seemed like these weren't such a good idea for people still learning Chinese. The course's policy of giving non-heritage students an additional five points on big exams seemed kind of strange as well: given how disparate the skill levels were across the entire class, whether those students were heritage or otherwise, it seemed like a very odd attempt at making even a playing ground that was uneven in far too many ways to be adjusted for. I think that the course could have been organized better if, instead of one reading assigned to cover 3 some classes, there were given parts of each reading assigned for every class, and we would cover only that portion in class. That would allow the reading to be more evenly distributed across the week. Also, there were quite a few grammatical mistakes in the textbook itself, which was confusing at times.",
                "I think the firsthand experience and expertise of the instructor, who lived through the Cultural Revolution and knows many of the authors we read personally, is the class's biggest asset. That said, I sometimes wished he gave students more opportunities for oral practice and discussion. Despite it being a literature seminar, it did not feel like a discussion-based class, and often consisted of the professor rambling interspersed with students' short answers to reading comprehension questions."

            "comments": [
                "I wouldn't recommend this course unless your Chinese is already above the level of this class such that you can read the texts with no substantial effort, and you want to just write essays and listen to Su Wei talk for 75 minutes. That's the only thing that really makes the course enjoyable.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is curious about Contemporary Chinese Fiction, but as a caveat, say that they should expect to be mostly listening.",
                "I think that it's hard to say because people go into that class with such uneven skill levels. Some of the students were literally native Chinese speakers from China, while others had only been studying Chinese for a few years. I think that it's exciting to read Chinese literature in a Chinese class, but I don't know how much the course actually facilitated my Chinese learning, particularly my speaking ability. It felt like I just had to rote memorize a lot of terms and never really had the opportunity to participate in discussions or practice speaking ability. If someone is confident in their Chinese reading and/or is happy to put a LOT of time into studying, then I guess the class is ok. Otherwise, particularly if you want to get better at speaking Chinese, I probably would say that this isn't the class for you.",
                "Probably not, only because of what I noted above re: discussion opportunities. I might give it a lukewarm recommendation, though, because there were parts of the course (especially the texts) that I really enjoyed as a Humanities major interested in literature."
