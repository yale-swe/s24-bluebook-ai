                "I learned a ton of information about the Roman Empire with a particular emphasis on understanding the biases through which we tend to interpret classical history to benefit our own modern narratives (a lens I both wasn't expecting and found particularly interesting).",
                "I gained a broad yet thorough understanding of the Roman Empire.",
                "I learned a thorough history of the Roman empire from Augustus through the early Middle Ages. I feel I know all the most important moments of the history of the Roman empire and that I understand how it changed over time. I learned skills of evaluating sources and placing them in a cultural context. I liked that we looked at all types of historical evidance--coinage, inscriptions, monuments, statues, literature, etc.",
                "I learned a bunch of history of the Roman empire after Augustus and the Julio-Claudians, the Flavians, the Antonines, the Severans, and the Tetrachy, and everything in between like the 3rd century crisis, the rise of Christianity, the barbarian invasions, the year of the 5 emperors, Pliny and Tacitus, eastern cults, the provinces, the Roman army. I read a lot of primary sources and learned to do historical research at Yale in different online archives and at the Yale library.",
                "I learned about the history of the Roman empire from 44 BCE to the 5th century CE. We learned about each emperor and his political program and how they vied for power. We learned about archaeology and methods of knowing history, and the challenges of knowing Roman history accurately. We went to the Yale art gallery once and looked at objects from a Roman town, which was so cool.",
                "I learned about the history of the Roman Empire",

                "Gained skills in historical analysis, especially over a long period of time like centuries",

                "Learned A lot about the Roman Empire but also about evaluating historical sources from a critical lens. The course was actually incredible.",
                "Close reading",
                "I learned a lot about Roman society.",
                "Amazing overview of the Roman Empire, with a focus on culture, representation and identity. Johnston is exceptional, and the content is dense yet absolutely worth it.",
                "I learned so much about not only the history of the Roman empire, but also of its economy, politics, religion, and culture/society.",
                "Knowledge of what shaped the world into how it is today",
                "The most important skill I gleaned from this course was the ability to study history as a big-picture subject, using the Roman Empire as the case study. I had never thought so much about how history was written and by whom, and I think that was an angle that Professor Johnston examined, which I've never really considered before.",
                "Political, social, and cultural developments of the Roman Empire, and its lasting repercussions.",
                "I acquired a great amount of knowledge about the history of the Roman Empire from this course. This course covers the materials from Augustus down to Justinian the Great, and almost every major development in Roman society, politics, economy, military and culture has been detailedly covered by Prof. Johnston. Apart from this, through course readings, papers, quizzes and discussion sections, I have been able to horn my skill in close reading, analyzing and writing. In short, all the necessary skills to be a historian have been trained. Consequently, through my constant effort, I have gained insights in the history of the Roman Empire, which was a rather unfamiliar area to me, in general. And in particular, I have gained insights into what led to unstable imperial succession, which was the topic of my final paper.",

            "comments": [
                "The biggest strength of this course is Professor Johnston; his humor and passion for the subject made lecture the most engaging of all of my classes this semester I would say the biggest weakness is the amount of readings that are assigned; additional readings for section on top of readings for lecture was a lot.",
                "Strengths: Professor Johnston is an extraordinary lecturer. His slides are the best slides I have seen in my four years at Yale - they are clear, engaging, and insightful. It's obvious that he puts an immense amount of work into the class. The subject of the course is also just so interesting!\r\nWeaknesses: You can feel a little overwhelmed with all of the information thrown at you in this class. Detailed lectures, lecture handouts, quizzes, section readings, other readings, papers... it's a lot. It makes sense that there is a lot of information, since there's a lot to be said and learned about the Roman Empire. I would remedy it by making sections optional, like in the Intro to Ancient Greek History class. Sections were interesting and I loved my TF, but I would have preferred the class if there weren't sections.",
                "Strengths: Professor Johnston is a fun lecturer and he is always more than happy to meet with students. The material is also very interesting. I loved the visit to the YUAG, and I wish we had done it with more than just the Dura Europos gallery. It was also great to have Professor Johnston there to answer questions more in depth. The weekly quizzes were a good way to solidify my knowledge, though I felt they could have been worth more of the grade, because reviewing for them felt like a lot of work compared with how little a percentage of the grade they represent. Weaknesses: Having a final exam on top of a final paper was a bit much. I felt only one was necessary to cap off my understanding of the course. I also thought the additional readings assigned for section were a bit too much, and we could have just used section time to discuss the material from class.",
                "Lots of material, hundreds of years, very short time span. Strengths: the amazing lecture slides and really interesting lectures, legitimately awesome history, great organization, an extraordinarily fun field trip, lots of material evidence to examine as well as primary texts. Weaknesses: the lengths of the sections were too short, the size was too short, it felt like a review more than an investigations, discussion was not deep.",
                "Strengths: AMAZING lectures. I learned so much, and Prof Johnston packs so much interesting stuff into a lecture. It's like watching a movie. Weaknesses: none! it might be a lot of work for those who aren't interested.",
                "The strength is that we cover the facts from the Roman Empire in detail. The weakness is that we don't look at the history of the Roman Empire as a process. We learned about what every emperor did about Christians, but we never put these facts together in a coherent story about the deep causes behind the rise of Christianity in Rome. I think the strict chronological order and the focus on super-detailed facts, rather than the process with few facts, was the biggest issue. I'd recommend having more topical lectures, such as \"MIlitary\", \"Bureaucracy\", \"Christianity\", etc. I also dislike when lectures are just the repetition of what was said in the textbook. What's the point of it? Reading would suffice then. I think students should come to lectures with all the facts in their heads, and the professor should only help students connect these facts into a coherent insightful story.",
                "A large amount of info in a little amount of time, but if you can keep up it's good",
                "Very strong course. Engages its students in interesting material.",
                "Strengths - great content, good survey of imperial Rome, great professor\r\nWeaknesses - no recorded lectures",
                "Strengths: best lecture I have taken at Yale. Always structured like a narrative, and done exceptionally well. Weaknesses: Quizzes are graded a little bit harshly, but this is a very small thing.",
                "Course was very well taught and the section TFs were very helpful, I just think that the sections could have been focused more on reviewing the material from class.",
                "The course overall was incredibly strong. Great lecturer, great readings, great material.",
                "Lectures were long and we never finished a class material in one class",
                "Great course. Could have a better textbook",
                "It focuses almost exclusively on society on culture. I think a bit more history would makes the course more interesting.",
                "The main strengths of the course lie with Prof. Johnston, who is absolutely wonderful! He is incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what he teaches, and his lectures were always interesting and engaging. I think one thing that could be improved is the end of course workload in most classes, there is either a final paper or an exam, and I thought that have a 10-15 page paper in addition to a three hour sit-down exam was somewhat of a burden.",
                "Strengths: incredible prof and TA, fascinating material, immersive lectures\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "I would really love a review sheet for all the id terms.",
                "I really think this class is good as it is. It excels in all the right ways -- it's a great lecture course, taught by a great lecturer -- and it's not excessive in any way.",
                "Strength: Very engaging professor, interesting topic.\r\nWeakness: Heavy reading load. The lectures sometimes included too much details that were unnecessary and distracted from the main developments. Given the unrest and instability in the late Empire, we skipped a lot of changes (especially political changes) that made it difficult to see overarching trends/continuities.",
                "The strengths and weaknesses are the same: the number of materials covered in the course. Much information was provided in lectures and slides, and I like that because without it, I could not gain a rather comprehensive understanding of the history of the Roman Empire. Yet, that also means we need more time to consume it. We rarely finished slides in class and the discussion sections simply wasn't long enough. I always felt that if the lecture and the discussion section could be half an hour longer, the course would be greatly improved, since all students would have more time to listen, think, and discuss.",
                "I think that the discussion sections could be more geared towards deepening our understanding of what happened in lecture rather than trying to cover new material. I found that we oftentimes couldn't get to the section readings because we wanted to review in-class topics first. Also, recordings of the lecture being made available would be very very helpful.",

Prof. Johnston is fantastic - his slides are a marvel, he's passionate, and he 100% knows what he's talking about. The course is superbly well organized. There's a lot of information to process over the course of the semester, but it's definitely worth it.",
                "Yes, amazing course",
                "Yes. It's a great overview of Roman history. Come midterms and finals season, it's a lot of work, but other than that, it's not bad. Professor Johnston is a fun and engaging lecturer, and you will learn a lot.",
                "Definitely recommend this with Professor Johnston. His slides are the slickest things youve ever seen, and he just makes things fun and engaging. You will learn so much Roman history it will blow your mind. Your level of engagement with it is very flexible: you could do just the basic reading, or you could expand to more primary sources and other places of exploration. Professor Johnston makes himself available to talk about your interests, and grants extensions when you ask. You will have a blast.",
                "YES! One of my favorite classes at Yale, coming from a senior. Learning about the emperors was so interesting. It felt like we were watching a super exciting story unfold.",
                "Take this class only if you're super interested in the Roman Empire. If you expect to obtain a broad understanding of historical processes, I would take another class.",

                "Yes I would. Any person interested in Roman history.",

                "Strongly, strongly recommend to any student. Rome is useful for anyone. And Johnston cares and teaches with a passion that few others do. Attending class is a treat. The papers you need to write are sizable but a useful exercise. Take it.",
                "Yes. Great history course with an excellent professor. It assumes no prior knowledge and is a great course if you are a classics, history, or any other major.",
                "Yes, it was a great course. It was also better with the Roman Republic course. I feel like many Yale students have an interest in history and Rome definitely holds a certain cultural fascination within western societies. The course has broad appeal.",
                "yes, Johnston's awesome",
                "Yes. great insight into Rome, and Johnston is a gifted and exciting lecturer",
                "Definitely!",
                "There is a test and a paper both during the midterm and final. I would recommend students think carefully and make sure they can handle the workload.",
                "Absolutely! Its a wonderful history lecture that is very well taught by both Prof. Johnston as well as the TFs",
                "Absolutely! If you are at all interested in history, please take this class. It is one of the best (if not the best) course I have taken so far at Yale. The lectures were incredibly immersive: the professor spent so much time and effort cramming the lecture slides full of information, quotes, and images, and never failed to spice up lectures with interesting stories and jokes. (It turns out that ancient Romans could be quite funny, when they weren't (and especially when they were) fighting civil wars.) And the professor himself is such a knowledgable, enthusiastic, and wholesome scholar of ancient history. There's a lot of content to know, but I always found it manageable, and I thought the grading was very fair. There are a lot of readings, but if you don't get to all of it every week that's ok - the lectures give you almost everything you need to know, and the readings are there to supplement them and make the material more immersive. Overall, if you're on the fence, this is your sign to take this class. You won't regret it!",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the study of classics. It's straightforward and enjoyable, and now I feel like I have this wealth of knowledge that I didn't have before!",
                "Yes! Ancient Rome is a fascinating subject to learn about. Prof. Johnston is an amazing lecturer and very helpful throughout the learning process. You will get a lot of opportunities to meet with Prof. Johnston and to discuss the course materials.",
                "Absolutely. If anyone is interested in ancient Rome, this is where they should go. If anyone is particularly interested in the imperial Rome, this is where they should go. And even if this is not their major interest, a study in the history of the Roman Empire is still essential to the greater understanding of the history of Europe and the developments that have continuously shaped the world we live in today.",
                "If people want to get a good and comprehensive overview of the Roman Empire from start to finish, I would definitely recommend this course.",
