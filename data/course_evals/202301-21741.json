                "Writing a song every week is very helpful, but also very stressful. I think the course could possibly improve if there were more partner projects and also if some projects were 2 weeks long. This would also give us more class time to really examine everyone's work. We had two projects where we partnered up, and these were the most fun and educational.",
                "Weekly assignments were very helpful for me in producing a lot of new material. I think the class could have benefited from a single 1-on-1 meeting with the professor though at some point during the semester to discuss the works I produced as a whole, since each week was focused on a single assignment and there was no structured time to discuss my progress throughout the semester.",
                "strengths:\r\n- this course forces you to write a TON of music, which is probably the best possible way to learn about composition, and it is so meaningful looking back at the semester having accomplished so much\r\n- Prof. Frankel is excellent! He gives great feedback and is incredible kind and invested in his students\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- I would like slightly more music-related feedback. I think feedback leaned slightly more towards lyrics, and usually I knew exactly which of my lyrics were bad anyways (I just didn't have time to change them because of the tight turnaround). Maybe this is just me, but in that case it may be helpful to start the course (or each presentation) by saying what specifically each student is looking for feedback on? I know we did this for one assignment and it was helpful!",
                "This was a really excellent class (taught by Prof. Frankel this semester). Class always had a really great vibe, and everyone was really supportive of each other's work. I genuinely had a great time working on the assignments for the class and then sharing them in class, and I feel like I grew as a musical theater composer. \r\n\r\nSometimes, I wished that Prof Frankel would critique our compositions more/a little more harshly, or that the critique wasn't completely driven by student comments  I actually would have loved a little bit more faculty advice/less student discussion at times!\r\n\r\nBut I had a great time in this class and highly would recommend taking it with Prof. Frankel!"

                "Yes! It was very challenging, but very worth it. You get a lot of great feedback on your pieces and a lot of great experiences writing, critiquing, and presenting.",
                "Yes!!!! This was one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale. I learned so much and am so proud of the work I accomplished this semester! I knew almost nothing about musical theater before taking this, but as a songwriter it was completely doable.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is comfortable composing and composing a lot. This is definitely not a beginner class for composition or for writing for the voice. It is really important that you have a grasp of music notation and engraving for voice and piano before taking this class  it was very clear that some students who were a little more uncertain about those fundamentals struggled more or had to put in a lot more time. But this is a great class that gets you to write A LOT (bring in a song EVERY week!) and to get a lot of good critique of your work  which is a super valuable way to learn and grow as an artist!"
