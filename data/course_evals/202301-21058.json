                "I learned so much about post-colonial history, the histories of economic development, and environmental struggles originating from all sorts of different actors. This course gave me an appreciation for history that feels so urgent in our present moment. This course truly has changed my academic and world outlook through the incredible syllabus and seminar discussions.",
                "An understanding of environmentalism and environmental movements outside the US and Europe in the 20th century. In particular, there is a good focus on how environmental movements and their interests often overlapped with nationalist, labor, gender, and religious movements.",
                "Now know a lot more about the dimensions of global environmentalism, the ways in which it varies by region, and the ways in which environmental questions shape with (and *are*) social, political, and economic questions. It was particularly nice to see this course represent a variety of perspectives, issues in environmental action, and regions of the world. I also felt like it contributed substantially to my thinking about what the environment and environmental justice are as conceptsnot things we can take for granted.",
                "I learned about the various forms that environmental thought and activism can take in the global South as well as the conditions that have led to their emergence, including colonial and post-colonial legacies.",
                "Taking the course \"Environmentalism from the Global South\" with Professor Amrith has helped me develop valuable knowledge, skills, and insights. I gained a Global South perspective on environmental issues, learned to analyze complex problems using an interdisciplinary approach, and deepened my understanding of environmental justice. Professor Amrith's use of case studies and real-world examples, emphasis on critical thinking, and fostering of cross-cultural understanding were instrumental in my growth as an environmentalist. Overall, the course and Professor Amrith's teaching have been invaluable in shaping my perspective and abilities.",
                "Various knowledge about environmental movements",
                "This course had the best discussions of any class I have taken at Yale. I learned to consider environmental issues from many different perspectives, and to think critically about beliefs that a lot of people in contemporary environmental activism take for granted. I also grew a lot as a writer because of Professor Amrith's kind feedback and advice during every stage of the writing process."

                "I cant think of many weaknesses for this course. Our seminar really just clicked right away, and Ive never been so engaged in a class at Yale. The workload was reasonable and facilitated learning really well. Prof Amrith led seminars brilliantly, introducing new primary sources that stimulated really interesting discussions. The entire course flowed so well and I left most weeks with my head spinning about our discussions for several hours.",
                "This was a great class! There is plenty of opportunity for discussion, which was wonderful, and Prof. Amrith's mini-lectures were also excellent. I have taken history department seminars before and was already comfortable writing the final research paper, but it might be useful to have a little more guidance on that for student for whom this is their first time.",
                "I think this was almost perfectly designed. Sunil has a really good sense of how to balance readings/new information with assignments. I never felt overwhelmed by the class, despite feeling like I was learning a lot. The one thing I would say is that we could have probably done slightly more reading or slightly more academic readings for some weeks; that said, I liked all of what we read and particularly associated the intersection of political science and activist histories. \r\n\r\nI uniformly enjoyed our discussions, and I think that was honestly the biggest strength of the course: this was seminar course in which I've felt most like students were talking to each other, rather than the instructor, and that's a testament to how Sunil cultivated an environment in which students felt comfortable doing that. I learned a lot from hearing what other students in class had to say.",
                "This was such a remarkable class that I can not think of any weaknesses. The biggest strength of the class is that it's taught by Prof. Amrith who is one of the most knowledgeable and kindest professors I have encountered. It was also a very well-structured class with all the readings connecting to one another and leading to some very fruitful discussions.",
                "professor amrith facilitated discussions so well and the readings were fantastic. this was a class that really shaped my worldview and left me coming out of each class more critical about the world. this is THE class i came to yale for. no weaknesses.",
                "Great prof and course material, I would like the readings to be more connected tho",
                "Strengths: Professor Amrith! He was so genuinely interested in everything that students had to say, and fully explored every idea we brought up. He also provided interesting new perspectives on the ways in which environmentalism relates to colonialism and development. Other strengths included the other students in the class (obviously I'm not sure this will continue to be the case, but the class seemed to attract really interesting and insightful people) and the syllabus, which spanned many decades and geographic regions.\r\nWeaknesses: honestly, none come to mind. The final paper is a fair amount of work, but the assignment is clear from the beginning of the semester and you have plenty of time to work on it. You also turn in an outline a couple weeks before it's due, so you're forced to put ideas on paper before then.",
                "I loved the readings and the presentations at the end. I also really liked how the syllabus introduces ideas like \"slow violence\" so we had a vocabulary for the rest of the semester. My only complaint was that, for a course that aims to make environmental history more global, many of the authors were foreign academics. This isn't a problem, necessarily, but it felt ironic. \r\n\r\nThere was also a bit of a sharp transition from discussing secondary literature to writing original research papers. I wish there had been a little bit more emphasis on primary sources earlier in the semester to prepare us."

This one was especially cool because he's currently writing a book about the global history of climate change, and it sometimes felt like we were getting a peek into the writing/research/thinking process.",
                "Yes! The topic is important, Professor Amrith leads discussion well and the readings are interesting yet manageable. I also appreciated how the professor brought in films and poems to give us context."
