All of the material is super duper relevant and simply important to know as someone living in the US. It's really an amazing foundational course. You learn about all different factors that contribute to poverty and inequality, including social policy and taxes. The workload is also super chill; you have weekly response memos (low stakes), a midterm exam (one page double sided very straight forward if you've been paying attention) and midterm paper about a cool sociologist of your choice, and finally the final which was also just one paper with a bunch of the same questions from the midterm.

                "One of the few well balanced classes at Yale where you can absorb a ton of information without feeling overwhelmed by the amount of reading or weekly sections. I loved how engaged my TA and Rourke were throughout section and lecture  genuinely a class I looked forward to going to every week.",
                "The professor had a contagious energy and a genuine passion for his work. No better way to begin the week\/the day than with this class.",
                "A major strength of this course is Professor O'Brien. He is unbelievably knowledgable, passionate, honest, and kind. He cares about his students as people and handles the course material with so much thoughtfulness. Another strength is the approach of the course, which focuses on important trends in different areas of social life. This format takes some getting used to and can at times feel a bit repetitive in class but is ultimately really useful knowledge that will definitely stick. The only major weakness was the weekly reading responses, which were simply not formatted to facilitate learning; they were too long to make it feasible for students to read each other's, and often difficult to write because of the length. If these can be re-imagined to be a bit more critical and shorter in length I would have no complaints about the class.",
                "Everything is a strength! The content, the engaging and supportive professor and TFs, discussion section, the exam structure. Its all manageable, interesting, and provocative. Would recommend to anyone looking for an introduction to inequality and social policy.",
                "only strengths. best class I've taken at Yale.",

                "The course had a really good balance between ensuring to provide a foundational understanding of topics, whilst still expanding on and engaging with important debates\/contentions that arise. I feel like the style of the lectures were perfect and Professor O'Brien was, quiet honestly, a PHENOMENAL instructor. I wish the discussion sections had a bit more structure.",
                "All strengths. O'Brien is extremely enthusiastic about the material and goes through a lot of content in just one class but in a concise, and easy-to-understand crash-course style.",
                "Weaknesses: no emphasis on the \"why\"\r\nStrengths: everything else. The material was super interesting, Rourke did an awesome job at covering a range of topics, and Rourke himself is the biggest strength",
                "strengths: super interesting and important material for literally everyone to know, light workload, awesome professor\r\n\r\nweaknesses: very fast pace and you don't spend much time on any one particular topic so you only get an overview of topics with lots of holes to be filled in later hopefully!",
                "Its a lot of material but very fair tests!",
                "The strength is Rourkes contagious passion and incredible knowledge of the content. Every lecture is both informative and interesting. It is the best class I have taken so far, I dont see any weaknesses.",

Without a doubt, understanding what's actually going on in our societal infrastructure and its effects on inequality really influences how you read the news, how you orient your career, etc. It's awesome that this course focuses a lot on real-world outcomes, and I really appreciate how much of the information on the slides was conveyed through charts and graphs. I appreciated that only information that you needed to know was on the slides -- Professor O'Brien never put extraneous information there. Sections should have some more structure and objectives. I rarely got much out of section. I think the sociology essay seemed a bit like busy work -- I didn't really get much out of it either; it just felt like a longer reading response.",
                "really informative course, great instructor, very interesting topic",
                "Professor O'Brien presented all the material in a way that was both interesting and informative. Coursetime was well divided between subjects, and even though there wasn't enough time to go in-depth on everything, all topics got a fair share.",

                "Strength: the course information and focuses were well-selected; I never felt like the information was unnecessary or inapplicable to current policy or society. Professor O'Brien was energetic and detail-oriented. Weakness: There was so much content packed into each lesson that there was not much room for questions or to allow ideas to set in before moving straight into the next topic.",
                "The strengths of this course are that: 1) the weekly response memos force you to engage with the assigned readings, which helps me to make the most of lectures. 2) the readings are more diverse medium than I've experienced with other classes, I liked that there were articles as well as book chapters. 3) testing is extremely fair and what we learn and have to memorize is actually useful information for us to know more about how the US is run.\r\n\r\nI can't really think of any weaknesses except that lectures move kind of quickly.",
                "This course did a great job at covering diverse topics on inequality and mobility as understood by sociologists and other social scientists. It was well organized, and revealed important social trends over time as well as the influences of various social and environmental factors. The lectures were especially informative. One area for improvement could be in the structuring of discussion section meetings. I think sections could be organized to better supplement material covered in lecture, by having a more consistent format.",
                "strengths:\r\n- the professor\r\n- the TA's\r\n- the structure of the class\r\n- organization\r\n- homework and assignments \r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n- none",
                "Strenghts:  Rourke O'Brien is so committed to teaching and so passionate about the content. You will be inspired to understand inequality and be motivated to change current trends and policies."

                "Yes, very good overview of the state of inequality in the US, very interesting lectures, awesome instructor",
                "Yes, it's a great course for anyone interested in the topic, and appeals as both an introduction to and a expansion on the topic.",
                "Yes! Very much. Loved taking this.",
                "Absolutely! Lots of valuable information, and it's grounded in facts and figures rather than theory or conceptual ideas---very important for understanding how American politics and society operates especially if you're interested in research or public policy work.",
                "I would!!!! This class was better than I could have thought, one of my favorites at Yale so far. Professor O'Brien is amazing and his passion alone makes the content so interesting. If you have any interest in the course title at all... take it!!!",
                "YES! PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS! 1000%. This is the kind of course every student needs to take before graduating. Professor O'Brien is an incredible professor and his passion for the subject will make you passionate about it too.",
                "I would recommend this course to all students, because it provides essential insights into the dynamics of the American economy and its impact on groups and individuals. Relevant to any studying social sciences (especially those interested in economics or public policy), but more broadly important knowledge as citizens of the U.S. or, through comparison, other nations.",
                "Yes! I would 100% recommend this course. It was clearly taught, and I learned so many important facts about our world that relate to every person. I also enjoyed going to lectures and sections. This is a very relevant and needed class to take.",
                "Absolutely. Everyone needs to take a socio class with Rourke. He is magnetic with his commitment to students and sociology. If you want to get a basic understanding for US social trends, programs, policies, how inequality really shapes up in our country, and what one can do about it, this is totally the class. And again, Rourke, with his excitement every. single. day. !!"
