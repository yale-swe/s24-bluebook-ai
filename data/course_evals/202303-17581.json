                "Ivan Marcus offers an incredibly broad historical overview of pre-modern Jewish history. In terms of insight, he effectively cuts through pervasive myths and narrative illusions, many shaped in retrospect through the legacy of the long 20th-century. He fosters an intimate and earnest relationship between his students and the course material, and to that end, he forces his students to overcome their trepidation. While his exams demand specificity and attention to established historiographical conventions in the literature, his one term paper requires that students boldly immerse themselves in the text. His course therefore does an excellent job of requiring dual forms of scholarly engagement, between \"strict historicist\" and \"new critical\" approaches."

                "Strengths -- lectures are fascinating; readings enjoyable though lengthy; examining religious primary sources a real pleasure.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- students have to organize content from lectures on their own; exams difficult and hard to prepare for; limited feedback.",
                "Professor Marcus is a lively and engaging lecturer. The readings were fascinating and not overwhelming. A weakness perhaps was the lack of feedback on assessments. While the grading is not harsh, I could have better engaged with the course with more comments on my work.",
                "It's taught diachronically, which makes it very difficult to follow. It's mis-titled as an introductory course to Jewish history.",
                "professor Marcus is kind accommodating and passionate about the interesting subject matter! I do think lectures could be slightly more organized or lecture notes/audio could be published",
                "The greatest strength of this course is frankly Ivan Marcus himself. He's an incredibly engaging story-teller, and frequently intersperses his lecture with his disarming sense of humor. He sets an important tone for his class by encouraging his students not to take its material over-seriously.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the course does seem to struggle slightly with a lack of clarity, or at least informational accessibility. This has little to do with Prof. Marcus' attitude, which is nothing if not concise, direct, and pointed. Rather, I suspect there's some difficulty in translating information to the online platforms that most of Yale courses now rely on. Most notably, it was slightly difficult on my end to note on the syllabus that a course packet was provided specifically through TYCO printing, as this was not a distribution method I'd encountered in other classes. Additionally I am aware that I wasn't the only one to struggle with this problem of clarity, again with particular regard to the packet. It is possible that the remote-learning period during COVID pandemic has disoriented students' sense of place in New Haven and has defamiliarized some of us with certain distributional approaches through third-party sources. Perhaps it can be said that students should speak directly with Prof. Marcus with regards to their inability to find the readings, and yet it is also possible, as was the case for me, that students were intimidated and feared coming off as incompetent.\r\n\r\nThat said, when the course works altogether, it works incredibly well. The packet, once obtained, is incredibly comprehensive and a handy tool between sessions. Prof. Marcus also recaps each preceding lecture at the start of the next, making the general progression of the course easy to follow. As mentioned above, the coursework is laid out in a highly intentional manner that demands sophisticated engagement from the student. This is a must-take course, and if not for the aforementioned lapses in communicative clarity, it sets its students up well for success in its subject matter."

                "Yes, it's a complete history in one semester.",
                "While the content is theoretically interesting, the readings are incredibly dense and also you don't need to do ANY of them except for the single 5-10 page text you choose for your paper. I attended lectures, took minimal notes, *never* did the readings, and got an A in the class by studying the night before using mainly Wikipedia articles about Jewish history. If you need a preindustrial credit with a super low workload I would recommend this, but if you are looking for a fun or engaging class I would not recommend this class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, especially those interested in Semitic history, religious studies, the history of the greater Mediterranean region, or even the practice of history itself. While the scope can certainly prove intimidating, Prof. Marcus centers the coursework itself around honing essential skills in History as an academic discipline, and he does so to great effect. While there may be issues with communication between the student and the requirements of the syllabus, these are small hurdles to overcome for what is ultimately an incredibly worthwhile course."
