                "I learned a lot about various Latin American literary movements, authors, and styles, and learned how different authors and contexts have approached the theme of travel in their works.

                "I learned host to analyze literature in Spanish.",
                "We read a variety of Latin American fiction somehow related to travelers (or \"viajeros\").  Much of the readings focused on the experiences of Latin Americans living or traveling in countries outside of Latin America, particularly countries in Europe.  We read works related to migration, such as Yuri Herrera's Seales que precederan el fin del mundo.",
                "I gained a contemporary understanding of the modes of travel, forms of traveler, and motivation for writing for latin american writers.",
                "I learned so much from this course, like how to read large amounts of spanish literature and how to write efficiently and productively in Spanish. I also learned a lot about the theme of traveling and the many perspectives of Latin American travelers.",
                "Through the readings of travel narratives and in-class discussion, I honed in my Spanish speaking and writing skills and developed a much more varied vocabulary that I hadnt been able to attain before. In every class, Anibal also makes sure to evaluate the life lessons contained within the text and provides us with valuable insights applicable to more than just the reading of Latin American travel narratives.",

                "Strengths: Professor Gonzlez-Prez, Stefan (our TF), and the reading list. The works were very well-written and served as excellent examples of of the themes and movements discussed in class, and although they were a little complex at times, they made a great reading list overall for the purposes of the class. Professor and Stefan are great- super knowledgeable and helpful, and more than willing to be approached with questions, comments, clarifications, etc. They are great resources (especially if you're a first-year or if this is your first Spanish course at Yale)!\r\nWeaknesses: The class was advertised and set up like a seminar (short group, discussion-based) but at times it felt more like a lecture. The Professor would lead the class discussion and go through his own points before opening it up for questions and comments from us, and I feel like I would've gotten more out of the class if I'd been able to interact more with the other students directly (maybe in breakout groups?)\r\nI also think I could've used more guidance with the writing assignments -- they were only mentioned in short sentences on the syllabus and we never got any rubrics for them, so I often wasn't sure exactly what I was supposed to do for the papers. It helped to be able to ask Professor Gonzlez-Prez and Stefan for clarification, but I would've liked for the instructions to be a little more direct and detailed from the start.",
                "This course is a good overview of many different Latin American texts, may different authors, and many writing styles. The texts are carefully-selected, and the course is well-organized and flows well. It is clear that the professor put a lot of thought into choosing the texts. Sometimes the texts were quite challenging. It would have been nice to have a reading guide or background to accompany some of the texts, and maybe some set discussion questions.",
                "The class itself has very interesting readings.  Professor Gonzlez-Prez did an amazing job of curating the syllabus, and exposing us to authors we otherwise might not have heard about.  The workload is also extremely manageable, save for the final paper. This class itself would benefit from greater discussion surrounding the readings. I often felt like students did not have as many chances to ask questions and talk openly about the readings during class. The readings assigned were quite engaging and provocative, and I feel like the class sometimes focused on tangential details not totally related to the readings. The readings themselves could have also been organized thematically, as to address shared themes throughout the syllabus. I would also suggest incorporating more secondary literature into the class.",
                "The class could have been started off with a few minutes of discussion. While I understand it's difficult to foster class engagement, it would have been appreciated to have a certain amount of time for banter before beginning.",
                "I think it was a great course, so I wouldnt change much. It would be nice if it was in person, so then it would be easier to contribute ideas in class.",
                "Anibal did an excellent job teaching this course over Zoom. He regularly engaged the class in interesting discussions and was always prepared to share his own knowledge regarding the text or the author in question. Before some classes Anibal provided students with a list of questions to be ready to answer or discuss regarding the text. I think the class could be improved by providing this list of questions before each class to better engage the class in discussion and guide the students in their reading of the text."

                "It is just really, really tough to focus on Zoom for more than an hour. I honestly think that if the class had been cut to 50 minutes each day, the conversation would have been more lively. It is just a really, really long time to remain engaged online (especially if a large portion of the class is a lecture). Hopefully, the class will be offered in person next year and this won't be an issue.",
                "I enjoyed live classes, but it was very difficult to stay on zoom for that period of time. I would suggest making powerpoints asynchronous and shortening synchronous part.",

I don't know if I'd recommend this for first-years in their first semester, since the advanced level of the course was a little overwhelming in terms of prior knowledge and expectations, but this is a great course overall.",
                "I would recommend this to a student who is really interested in Latin American literature, wants to challenge their Spanish reading\/speaking abilities, or is pursuing the Spanish-language certificate. Also take this course for the professor - he is excellent!",
                "Yesas far as Spanish courses here go, this was the course I've been the most interested in, content-wise. The reading load is fairly standard and very manageable, as are the two comentarios. The final paper is doable, though a little of a doozy if you are not a native speaker\/very comfortable writing in academic Spanish. Prof Gonzlez-Prez is really good at this stuff, and is very kind. I will say that as an online course, a twice a week seminar that meets for over an hour will probably be very tough regardless of the class itself.",
                "YES!! This class was so fun and informative.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The workload is not excessive, but one should be prepared to spend quite a bit of time writing the final paper. The readings were usually quite engaging and very manageable as well. Professor Gonzlez-Prez does a great job of discussing the readings in class and drawing students' attention to details they might otherwise miss. One thing to note is that while Professor Gonzlez-Prez does ask questions throughout the class, it does feel a bit like a lecture as he does most of the talking.",

                "If you are looking for an enjoyable level 300 Spanish course - take this class!!! Anibal is an excellent professor and has a wealth of knowledge to provide. The reading load is much much lighter than other Yale classes so you can actually focus on the weeks reading and engage in detailed discussion during class. The readings are also super interesting and do not all fall under exile literature so the class discussion doesnt ever feel stagnant or boring. The final grade is also only based on three essays assigned throughout the semester, so you can feel free to practice your Spanish in class without any pressure.",
