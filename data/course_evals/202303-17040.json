                "I learned not only about specific locations and events in queer US history but also about different components of LGBTQ studies. We learned about intersectional racial\/queer identities, trans disabled identities, and even queer environmentalism. Through primary documents and\/or essays by a diverse array of authors, the course offered me insight into many queer experiences different from my own. As for the skills developed, Professor Herring had us do an annotated bibliography and a final 10-page research essay (neither of which I had done before in this manner). He talked us through the process and was available to advise and help explicitly so that we could develop the skill of writing a research essay in our first semester at Yale.",

                "I learned so much about LGBTQ history in the United States.  Before taking this class, I did not realize just how much of US LGBTQ history was overlooked. I believe that this was a great seminar class for people who are not used to seminar style classes and may feel anxious about speaking as it is definitely a safe-space.",
                "Ive developed new perspectives on queer history, extracting from unique intersectional experiences, immersive art, and critical frameworks. Professor Herring guided us to always think deeper which led to great and memorable discussions.",
                "I greatly improved my knowledge of LGBT+ history in the US as well as the intersectionality between sexuality and other identities such as gender and racial identities.",

            "comments": [
                "There was a good balance of seminar-type discussion and lecturing. Professor Herring was very open to hearing our ideas and letting everyone contribute, and then he would go through the slides he had prepared to give us more historical context or queer theory background to our readings. The small class size (16) was definitely a strength. The presentations for different US cities\/regions were really great. This allowed the whole class to explore the queer history of different US regions, and the fact that students got to make the presentations was a cool way to switch it up from just looking at Professor Herring's powerpoint. I would say a weakness was that the structure of the class could become a bit monotonous. We didn't have many assignments throughout the year (which was nice because it reduced stress), so almost all of the days had the same structure: read for homework and discuss in class. These discussions were usually really engaging, and the city presentations did break up the monotony a bit. Sometimes in our class discussions, there would be issues or interpretations of the readings that people respectfully disagreed on. I think it could be interesting if Professor Herring incorporated some kind of debate into the course where students would have to build their \"claim\" on material from the syllabus. That could be a fun activity that would also encourage high-level thinking.",
                "Strengths: the class environment built by Prof. Herring and the peers, I feel like I got to know many people in the class; lecture \/ analysis Prof. Herring provides for the material is SO thought-provoking, concrete, amazing, loved Rubyfruit Jungle and On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous. Weaknesses: the seminar isn't as lively as I hoped, I wish there is more conversation happening between the students instead of just everyone talking to the professor; the more academic readings can get dry and the discussions around them are less engaging",
                "Strengths: like other first-year seminars, this class was a great way to find community. Also, the readings were balanced and well-chosen, truly widening my perspective of the course's themes.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the way seminar discussions were run did not generally lead to conducive, engaging conversations. I wish we didn't essentially answer questions in a single-file line, and instead responded to each other's thoughts.",
                "Strengths: Organized, intriguing, and most importantly, fun. I giggled more in this class than I did any other, yet I learned so much!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, the readings can be a bit overwhelming to read thoroughly.",
                "I think the course's strength was that it covered a lot of diverse and very interesting history and topics, and everyone in the seminar was really engaged and participated. However, I think it could be improved if we were allowed to talk to our classmates a bit more, and also the reading and homework load was sort of inconsistent (sometimes we had to read a book in a week, while other times the reading was much less)",
                "The contents of the course were extremely diverse, touching on communities and places that are not commonly discussed in queer history, and professor Herring is an amazingly talented and animated educator who always made class engaging. At times, however, it felt like there was so much to cover that we were not engaging as strongly with the very rich communities we were discussing.",
                "strengths: discussions were very engaging and insightful, feedback\/assistance with writing assignments were very valuable\r\nweaknesses: sometimes the reading load was a lot and it could be hard to know what ideas to focus on, a couple of times reading guides were given with questions to think about while reading and these were very helpful"

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. LGBTQ Spaces & Places not only created a safe space for queer first-years but also taught genuinely interesting components of US history and culture that I had never thought about before. After almost all the readings, I found that I was legitimately interested in the concepts or themes being dealt with. I also think Professor Herring's class is a perfect class for a first-year transitioning into Yale. Professor Herring was lenient with deadlines, gave extensive feedback, and taught us important research skills that we can use during the rest of our time at Yale  and beyond.",
                "Yes, if you want to meet other first-years interested in queer studies and have an incredible professor who will take care of you for the first semester. If you are looking for a class purely for the materials, there might be other WGSS classes that go into depths more, mostly because of the nature of this class being a first year seminar.",
                "Yes, given that they're aware that it's explicitly designed as a first-year seminar and will probably have a lighter workload\/slightly different expectations from a standard class.",
                "Yes, this was my favorite class this semester. I believe that the majority of the readings were extremely interesting. I also believe that as a queer freshman, this class is a great way to make friends.",
                "Yesss! I never had the opportunity to take a queer studies course until coming to Yale and this course is truly my favorite class! Professor Herring created a warm and safe place that allowed all of us to have a sense of community, making me look forward to the next class and making it easier for me to adjust to Yale.",
                "Yes, I would really recommend this course because as a first year seminar it is a great way to take a seminar style course and improve your writing, while still taking a course with an appropriate difficulty level for someone who is inexperienced in college seminar courses.",
                "Definitely, the breadth of knowledge that I gained not only about queer history that is not often discussed but also how queer and trans individuals have thrived in communities that we often associate as hyper-conservative, has opened my eyes to the expansiveness of the LGBTQ community and how important it is to understand the experiences of queer and trans people from all different walks of life.",
