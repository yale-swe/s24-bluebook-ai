                "I learned so much about myself, my family, and my community through this course. I have never felt so directly connected to course contents as in ER&M 356. I became knowledgeable about the field of Latina feminism more broadly and more deeply through the case studies of Brujeria, Cholas, and sex workers. I gained substantial insights about what it means to be a Latina feminist and live in praxis to that sentiment and how it exists as a field different, yet connected, to other struggle movements.",
                "This course exceeded my expectations of what I thought the readings and discussions would look like. This was the first time I heard about terms true to the culture, like chola, chonga, and puta, put into a theoretical and academic context. I developed the skills on how to talk about different facets of my identity and using these different terms to theorize my body and my relationship with my Latinidad. It was also insightful to hear what everyone had to think every week.",
                "This course helped me understand critical Latina/x/e feminist theories and historic moments that have emerged all in relation to U.S. nation-making projects. I've learned to think through a variety of interdisciplinary methodologies (social movements, archives, literary studies, art, etc.)  and conceptualize \"feminism\" centered around Latina/x/e lives, experiences, and formations.",
                "I learned so much about the history of Latina feminism, as well as modern applications of this. I learned about important historians and. thinkers and current researchers. It was clear that Profe Vargas had clear intentions for the course but was also excited to adapt the course so that we could best learn. THey brought in amazing speakers and were always super thoughtful about what we were learning."

            "comments": [
                "This course is one of the best I have ever taken at Yale! It has more strengths that I can iterate. One includes the instructor's commitment and knowledge of Latina feminism. Professor Vargas' personal experience researching and interacting with the field substantially contributed to the course ambiance. Additionally, the reading selection was strong. Students were able to gauge a theoretical understanding of Latina feminism while also diving into specific case studies. Additionally, the course assignments were geared towards facilitating our learning, such as letter writing and portfolio making, which pushed students to learn differently than we ever have. Those assignments were successful in their intent as I have learned so much about myself, others, and the course through those assignments. \r\n\r\nHowever, a weakness is that the readings are often long and dense. Rather than having an immense amount of readings, it would be best to hone in on a few (especially if they are dense) so students have time and mental capacity to read and effectively engage with them in the seminar.",
                "This course had different types of media, including research articles, poetry, songs, and artwork. I learned a lot from all the pieces and enjoyed theorizing in a way that wasn't just readings. However, I will say some of the readings were very dense and theoretical, so I would recommend giving yourself enough time to read through all of them. I believe this course can be improved by integrating the works of more Latin American authors. Though the course does give the heads up that this focus will primarily talk about Mexican and Puerto Rican communities, we barely talked about Puerto Rican identities and primarily focused on Mexican and Chicana feminism.",
                "The readings for the course and layout of the weeks was incredible. Consistently challenging, insightful, and built off of one another productively",
                "Profe Vargas did an amazing job of assigning interesting and important readings/videos/podcasts/artwork. The assignments always felt incredibly relevant but never overwhelming in amounts. It was also great that we had a portfolio to offer an alternative form of assignments as well as the letters that we wrote. There were no weaknesses for this course it was so amazing.",
                "The seminar style of the course was really productive for thoughtful conversations! The course also pushed me to consider different approaches to learning?"

                "I could not recommend a course more! This class is one of the most insightful and applicable that I have ever taken at Yale. I learned so much about myself, my family, community, and the histories that I embody as a Mexican-American. The schools of Latina feminism thought are not only theoretical, but are extremely applicable to the ways that we interact and understand the world around us. Therefore, this class is perfect for anyone remotely interested in understanding their histories, the struggles of Latina feminism, and how it can inform our histories and futures.",
                "Absolutely! Latina/x/e Feminism is one of my favorite classes. The syllabus and readings assigned were phenomenal, covering key theories, movements, writers, concepts, and conversations and, in turn, our in-class discussions were so engaging. Profe Vargas led class so well and it was also a really powerful and community space for me this semester.",
                "I would recommend! You will learn a lot though the discussions can become more experience-based rather than about the texts/theme of that days class.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to every student. I learned so much in every class, met amazing people, and got to really explore my understanding of Latina feminism and how that applies to my history, background, as well as current identity and understanding. I looked forward to every class and learned from every reading. It was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes! Prof Vargas is very knowledgeable and approachable, the concepts taught in this course are useful to any student interested in feminism and cultural studies.",
                "Definitely!! I think the cultural work being done in this class is such a great way to explore our positionality within and outside Yale. Theres so much creative and intellectual freedom that I enjoyed each time I came to class."
