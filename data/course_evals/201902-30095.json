    "This course is useful and good, with proper amount of homework to practice. Sometimes the in class quiz had more questions than we could do in 30 minutes so the instructor kindly gave us more time to finish. However it influenced the pace in class and we ran out of time as a result. I suppose it will be better if one question is cut off in some quizzes.",
