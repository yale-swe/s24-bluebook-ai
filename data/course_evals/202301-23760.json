This class taught me the tragic conventions/how to read tragedy, identify trimeter, improved my Greek, and improved my skills at reading/critiquing/understanding scholarship.",

                "Strengths: Professor Kraus' love for Euripides and the Ion is infectious; even though I began a skeptic of the play, by the end, I think it's one of Euripides' greatest. The course had a great pace, with just the right amount of reading (both primary and secondary per week). Interesting assignments (critiquing commentaries, staging a modern Ion, etc.). Very in-depth, but also felt like we learned a lot about tragedy generally and the historical context. \r\nWeaknesses: some of the discussions in class would meander and I would've appreciated more close reading/textual analysis at times; we would read about 200-300 lines per week for discussion, but some weeks we had less to discuss than others purely based on the sections we read that week (I'm not sure how to change this though). Also, it would've been nice to read Aristotle's Poetics together, since it was mentioned quite often. Otherwise, wonderful class!",
                "Strengths:\r\n - The comprehensive approach to the text. I can say I know the Ion more confidently than I can say I know any other text.\r\n - The comprehensive approach to tragedy as a genre. This was my first class on Greek poetry, and I have a much better handle on the formal and thematic elements of Greek tragedy than before.\r\n - The emphasis on contemporary theoretical scholarship. I'm especially partial to structuralism and post-structuralism, and it was great to engage with articles that applied these concepts to a work that I became very familiar with.\r\n- The diversity of scholarly and non-scholarly sources. Some of the articles engaged with the Ion in pretty conventional modes of formalist literary theory/criticism. Others were more historically concerned, emphasizing the political moment that the Ion embodies. Still others took the form of reviews of contemporary adaptations of the Ion, and general discourses on the concept of adaptation from the perspective of theater-makers.\r\n- Genuinely interesting assignments. I thought it was a great idea to throw in a paper about how we would adapt a Greek chorus for a modern theater  it was both fun and instructive.\r\n - Professor Kraus. She's just a wonderful professor. She was exceptional at guiding the seminar, keeping things on-topic while still allowing for free-flowing discussion, and constantly pushing students to engage more deeply by (briefly, but actively) adding her own input to comments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n - None that I can think of. A warning, though: the jump from L3/L4 to L5 is pretty massive.",

She organizes the syllabus so thoughtfully, and every scholarly article contributed to my understanding of the play. Her grasp of tragedy and Greek is incredible. Euripides was already my favorite tragedian going into this class, and, having read an entire play in Greek, my love and appreciation for his work is even deeper than before. Please take this class!",
