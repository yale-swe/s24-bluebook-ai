            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Thermodynamics is a tough topic to teach. It is relatively dry, and the applications are hard to see in a course that is mainly focused on teaching the abstract concepts. With that being said, Professor Guo taught this class extremely well in my opinion. The problem sets and tests were extremely fair; if you work to understand the material, you will be rewarded. The recitation sessions were very helpful in facilitating understanding of trickier problem set questions. By the end of the course, I feel like I have a strong foundation in basic thermodynamics concepts that are crucial for higher level CENG courses (and Pchem 1).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More focus on in-class examples in the earlier sections, especially entropy and heat engines, would be appreciated. I think these concepts are some of the most abstract to grasp, so more worked problems would really help!",
                "Professor Guo provides so many resources. His class notes are great, and the homework greatly reflects the exam content.",
                "The lectures were very thorough and clear for the most part and the posted notes are very useful when referencing back and studying. The exams were also very fair and reflective of the material learned.",
                "Strengths of this course are that there is a lot of support for the problem sets and the practice is efficient in teaching the material. The kinds of questions we were shown in class and were assigned for homework were very relevant to what we were studying and helped me learn the material more. The transition from studying the practice problems and problems in the textbook to answering the problems in the exam made sense. The exams were a little difficult, but graded very fairly with an emphasis on the thought process of the approach to the answer over just valuing the correct numerical answer, which makes sense for thermodynamics with a lot of calculations. One weakness of this course would maybe be that the lectures could be a lot to sit through at once, but this is probably because the subject matter itself is pretty dry so it would be hard to teach it in a super engaging way. The material itself taught in the lecture however was relevant and helpful.",
                "I felt like the structure of the course made it easy to learn and to do well if you put effort into it! Prof. Guo posted all his lecture notes, and they were very clear and followed directly with the lectures. The problem sets and exams were all very fair, and I liked how Prof. Guo let us bring a \"cheat sheet\" to each exam because it let us focus on understanding concepts as opposed to memorizing formulas.",
                "The lectures for the course werent overly engaging, but they worked in tandem with the book quite well.",
                "I think I got lost in a lot of the lectures as they went to deep conceptually. My understanding of the lecture went down as the lecture went through.",
                "The professor explains concepts  clearly and the lecture notes are a huge help",
                "Prof. Guo was very clear in presenting the material in the class and it was paced very nicely. Despite it being rigorous it did not feel very rushed and I got to spend a lot of time on the topics.",
                "The problem sets and exams were relatively straightforward, so it was easy to know what was expected of me in terms of what I needed to know. The main weakness was the teaching. You can tell that Dr. Guo is very new to teaching as his lectures literally consisted of him reading his notes word for word to the class. He dedicated class time to mathematical derivations and very rarely did he attempt to explain how to solve problems or how to make use of the formulas given to us. Because of this, what I learned was how to use formulas but I have very little conceptual understanding of what it is that I am solving. There was very poor support for getting help on problem sets. There were no regular office hours for the class, so if you had questions, you literally had no place to get clarifications because the only office hours that we did have were focused entirely on the upcoming problem set. Additionally, the TAs were of very little help in answering conceptual questions. Just the teaching was very poor on so many different levels for this course.",
                "Strengths: the organization was logical, the lecture notes were really good and helpful, homework problems were great practice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we did not really focus on many practical applications like refrigeration or learn about basic devices like throttles in depth",
                "Strengths: Content is organized and two-week psets are amazing since they don't overload students but do provide ample opportunities to demostrante the knowledge acquired in class. The exams were also fair and it was really convenient learning-wise to have 3 midterms that were non-cumulative.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No regular office hours offered. You can meet with Professor Guo outside of class and there are recitations but I Would have loved to have proper office hours.",
                "Strengths: lecture notes were very clear, Dr Guo put the time in to help us understand during class. Problem sets and exams were  fairly assigned and graded. Content was very interesting in itself, especially when the problems got more applied. Weaknesses: not enough examples in lecture to help quantify abstract laws. There was only one recitation a week (however only 6 Psets for the semester), which didnt allow for much time at all to ask questions about the problem sets.",
                "I really enjoyed the notes that were posted by Dr. Guo before the lectures- they were really central to the course. It was also easy to get help from the professor and the teaching fellows. Towards the end of the school year, we were doing more problems in class, which really made me understand the content better.",
                "Strenghts: prof is super chill and the class seems like a painless alternative to the other thermo classes.  Recitation sessions were helpful and the workload is not bad.  He lets you take in the review slides to the exams which is incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were a little boring.  The psets wildly vary in length, and they are pretty infrequent compared to how many exams there were.  No pset drop and only 6 of them is kinda tough.  75% exams is tougher.",
                "I think lectures could be justified a little more as we go to make the course more engaging, for example explaining more clearly what we are trying to prove before embarking upon the derivation."

No.  Everyone told me there are easier alternatives, and yes, there probably were.  I took the 3.0 workload a little too seriously and expected a gut -- note that 3.0 is relative to other chemical engineering classes, and a group of Econ or History majors would probably rate this a 3.high or even a 4.0 workload.  Take the easy way out and do Astro 140 instead if you're me."
