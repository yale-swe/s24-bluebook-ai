Thats not an issue for the basics, but given that I took this in Spring 23, I feel like more conversation shouldve been about AI today and how quickly its developing and how it can be used.",
                "It's hard to talk about the strengths of this course without pointing out all of the glaring weaknesses. All of the course material was taken from other universities. I understand that other institutions may have already built a robust AI course, but I feel cheated that the instructors didn't put any effort into crafting original material. Additionally, the instructors felt under-prepared to give the actual lectures; there were always long pauses and corrections of previous mistakes during lecture. \r\n\r\nThe lectures were somewhat related to the projects we were assigned, but had very little relation to the problem sets. This meant that students were left to self-learn material or seek additional office hours. Assignments were also published later than outlined, causing the push back of deadlines. There were always adjustments to the office hour schedule, which meant that students couldn't count on a routine for peer help.",
                "Great course",
                "The main course assignments are divided into coding projects and written math-based problem sets. The coding projects are really fun and rewarding to complete. The problem sets, however, have unclear directions and can be extremely tedious at times. Some questions on the second problem set felt like cruel busy work. The teaching staff is not very helpful in assisting with the problem sets.",
                "Strengths: projects are well-designed and a lot of fun; good amount of work (only psets and projects, which shouldn't take too much of your time); material is engaging\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes way too broad; students aren't very engaged",
                "quizzes aren't great, and I'd prefer more project-oriented assignments",
                "I think the professors are really enthusiastic about the materials and carries out the lectures and discussions with great passion. However, somehow I feel like the assignments and projects are considerably harder than the materials discussed in class. It would be more helpful if we go over more thorough examples that we would see in the problem sets, or just to make the problem sets less intensive.",
                "remove some repetitive works in the problem sets",
                "Strengths: instructors who really care about the material and engage the students; weaknesses: a lot of busy-work style psets that feel unnecessarily tedious and lengthy",
                "Great",
                "It was very disorganized and the lectures were not very engaging. The professors seemed to not have a good sense of what they were doing this semester, which was very apparent in their ability to lectures and create reasonable problem sets.",
                "Lectures were not always very clear and did not reflect what was asked of us on the homework very well. However, the office hours were always very helpful and the content was interesting.",
                "There were very unenjoyable weekly quizzes, and the problem sets often required many iterations for a single part of a problem that felt unnecessarily long.",
                "The class was good overall, but had some quirks. Some of the homework assignments relied on tedious computation, like manually doing backpropagation or dynamic programming. Lectures were also somewhat vague, so youd have to keep an eye on the Ed to do the assignments.",
                "Strengths: chill grading scheme, doable psets and projects. Tesca is an engaging and helpful lecturer, despite the 9AM lecture time. Weaknesses: psets were extremely tedious in the beginning, but the staff were able to learn from feedback and rethink their psets.",
                "The course is well-designed, meaning that each unit is clearly outlined and connects into one another. Starting from the basics into harder concepts that involve the combination of previous ideas. It could be hard to catch up if you are behind, but if you keep up with the learning then you'll have a lot of fun. The course also has no exam which is AMAZING! Though the weekly quizzes can get annoying and stressful, but they are generally pretty easy so just make sure to pay attention in class and take good notes. The homework is helpful in some way because you are implementing a bunch of helper functions on the core mechanisms following the pseudocodes presented in class, which can get satisfying when the visualization of the result runs smoothly. But doing little work meaning that you might not understand how something works 100% of the time, but some partial understanding. Also the practice problems of the homework are kinda boring because they are just boring computations by hand. It'd be much more interesting if they are just a few questions to test basic knowledge and leave the main part in coding. Though doing these problems do help you develop a better understanding on how the algorithms work.",
                "This was the most tedious course I have ever taken. It doesnt really teach you about AI and it definitely wastes your time and effort",
                "The course covered many different topics, but I feel like it could have gone more in-depth. Homework was often tedious and arbitrary. I felt like a lot of the course was minutiae.",
                "The format of this class really needs to be restructured. Towards the end, it felt like we were rushing through concepts way too quickly to meaningfully understand them. And the grad student presentations took up an entire week or more of class, and sure, some of them were interesting, but I really feel like the class wouldve benefited more from having more class time for the curriculum.",
                "This course could be great but right now it is not. The co-teaching method didn't work. The problem sets adn slides were taken from a Berkeley course which made it feel impersonal. The lectures were pretty unengaging, i wish that office hours had been better run and that there had been more.",
                "problem sets were filled with many tedious calculations",
                "Good lectures",
                "This course had significant weaknesses in the lecturing and problem sets. Lectures were generally error-filled, with many mistakes needing to be corrected in the middle of lecture or in an announcement after class. As a result, the material could become somewhat confusing at times without any prior knowledge as even the definition of the examples in class would change frequently. Problem sets were also tedious and more of a test of mental tenacity than one of understanding. Slides and projects were both taken from one of Berkeley's intro to AI courses, a fact that was frequently evident through the lack of definitive answers about the slide material.",
                "all good",
                "The class was rather disorganized and the psets were unnecessarily tedious at times. Sometimes I couldn't even tell if what I was doing was correct, even after going to office hours. We were also given little help with understanding the context behind the project code base.",
                "The course was taught very well and clearly. There aren't any weaknesses that could be improved upon apart from mistakes made in some of the assignments when posted.",
                "The biggest weakness of this class was the design of the problem sets. The problem sets made us take an algorithm designed to be run on a computer and do all the calculation by hand, which I think is a good way to help us to understand the material. The problem is that these algorithms are usually very repetitive, and at some point repeating the same procedure over and over ceases to be instructive and starts to feel like busywork. Some of the problem sets made us continue repeating similar calculations long past the point that it was instructive, and I think those questions could have been made considerably shorter without changing how much I learned.\r\n\r\nI generally liked the programming projects, but I think they could have been longer and more involved, to help us engage with the material more deeply. \r\n\r\nI think it would have been nice to have some sort of cumulative final project or final exam. I find that if I only have to know material for a few weeks (to do a problem set and a programming assignment), I sometimes forget it afterwards, especially in a class like this one, where not everything builds on the previous material. The process of refreshing myself on the material for a final project or exam really helps me commit it to long-term memory.\r\n\r\nI thought the idea of random Canvas quizzes during class was very reasonable.",
                "The coding assignments are well-organized and intriguing. More instructions and examples relating to the written assignments would be very helpful for completing them.",
                "Strengths: good range of topics to provide a base understanding of AI and no exams. Weaknesses: problem sets often got tedious and were graded a lot on accuracy of calculations rather than conceptual understanding of the materials.",
                "teach clearly and the problem set helps. but some questions in the ps are too tedious",
                "strengths: cover a lot of important topics in AI\r\nweakness: sometimes the class materials are not explained clearly causing the confusions in doing problem sets",
                "Strengths:\r\nThere are no exams, which allows students to focus more on learning through the PSETs and de-emphasizes rote memorization of equations. The office hours were abundant and the ULAs \/ TAs were very high-quality.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSince the class had new professors this year, there was some lack of organization which I believe will improve in future semesters. The in-class quizzes were often too difficult and gave us very little time to apply what we had just learned in the last class. The 9am course time was a bit inconvenient, as was the lecture location in the Humanities Quadrangle.",
                "Strengths: Strong support system among professors\/TAs\/ULAs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Problems often way too tedious and grading often did not reflect how much we actually understood the material",
                "Strengths: PSETS are very interesting, and teach the students how to mathematically think about the inner workings of the algorithms\r\nWeaknesses: the PSETS were very grindy, and I cannot name one I enjoyed working on",
                "i think it was a good course overall. some of the home works were hard and not enough content was covered in the course to cover all of the homework",
                "I think the structure of the course was great. I loved the biweekly PSET\/Project format without exams, and I especially liked how the projects were always engaging applications of the material. It was nice for the material to build from week to week, and it made seeing how the methods we learned about exist in every day applications that we use. For improvement, however, some of the PSETS were quite tedious and required a lot of repetitive calculations, so we all ended up worrying more about whether the dozens of little calculations we were doing were correct rather than thinking about the big picture material.",
                "I would like the instructor to break the projects down into smaller tasks. Besides the extra credit part of the project is hard and I wish there could be more hint.",
                "The PSets were sometimes needlessly tedious. They would make us calculate hundreds and hundreds of probabilities by hand, which felt unnecessary to gain an understanding of the material. Also as a 9am class, the in-class quizzes were quite tough.",
                "Unclear instructions on problem sets could be ironed out earlier.",
                "The content of the course is very interesting and overall well taught. However, the homeworks were poorly designed, as they often doing full algorithms by hand, which was very tedious and not very helpful for learning.",
                "Strengths: good variety of problems to solve through the problem sets and projects, the project portion of the course gives cool applications of AI concepts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Problem sets especially seemed very pedantic at times, lecture content would provide relatively straightforward examples that ended up being much more complicated on assignments, which caused quite a bit of frustration",
                "In my opinion, the course should be less dependent on quizzes that lock after 15 minutes for the sake of accessibility, and instead aim towards having tests.",
                "The pseudocode for the backpropogation algorithm, taken from the textbook, was the most helpful way of learning backpropogation for me, but I spent a significant amount of time attempting to decipher its too-terse notation rather than trying to understand the concepts of backpropogation. In particular, attempting to infer whether specific variables where, ie, 2D or 3D.\r\n\r\nPsets are due before projects. However, you are able to automatically see the grade for your project & resubmit it, which is not an option for psets. The result is that, a couple times, I did the project first to help concretely grasp the concepts covered in class before doing the higher stakes pset. I felt this was worthwhile despite the issues imposed by going against the order suggested by the due dates.\r\n\r\n(although, on one occasion I misunderstood a concept in a way that didn't matter for the project but did for a pset, leading to a poor grade on that pset)\r\n\r\nI think the quizzes are a decent way of making sure everyone is reasonably up to date on the material, and dropping a few of them is a good way of ensuring they aren't too punitive."

                "I would recommend this course if you have experience with Python and want to learn the basics of AI implementation, but only if you have the time for problem sets that often feel unnecessarily long.",
                "Go for it! The material is interesting and relevant",
                "Yes if you would like a breadth of AI knowledge.",
                "If you already taken the in-depth AI courses in NLP, image processing, and deep learning, then you don't need to take this course as it covers these topics on the surface. However, if you are interested in how AI works in general and want to learn more about these fields mentioned, then this course would be a great start! It gives you some basic intuition, but they are not too much in-depth and are not easy to remember. So it can be viewed as a gut. First 2 assignments seem hard and tedious and can throw many people off, but after these two it's all chill and games. So don't give up ;D",
                "Not when taught by the current instructors. In the current iteration of the course, the assignments were extremely tedious and wasted your time, while teaching you very little. On top of that, this course is more similar to an algos course, and does very little teaching about AI",
                "Maybe. This is a pretty straightforward AI survey course. The assignments don't take too long and we didn't have any exams, so the workload is not super high. However, the grading can sometimes be harsh and arbitrary\/specific.",
                "Only if they were very sure theyre interested in AIthis course needs to be restructured.",
                "Unfortunately I would not. I think it could be made better and it has the sekeleton of a good course but it was really not well run, the written psets were trivial and annoying as hell, the code was all online.",
                "Yes, it was engaging and interesting introduction to the AI\/ML space",
                "I would not recommend this course. The survey style of this course may appear to give a good overview of artificial intelligence, but it is much more worthwhile to take CPSC 474, CPSC 475\/480, and\/or CPSC 477.",
                "yes",
                "This class overlaps with other CS courses in the same fields quite a bit and I feel like I had learned more\/better learned the same content from those classes as opposed to this one.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, since it teaches you the foundations of reinforcement learning, deep learning, etc.",
                "Be aware that this class is not primarily a machine learning class--it's a much broader class about AI, starting with simpler algorithms.  I would recommend this class to a student who hasn't taken very many CS classes yet. I took this class only after finishing the whole CS core sequence, and I found it easier and less in-depth than I would have hoped; if I'd taken it a year ago, I think I would have enjoyed it more. I've heard that the department is considering making an intensive version of this class, and I think that would be a great idea.",
                "I would recommend it to other students since one can learn a lot from implementing algorithms and AI systems in coding assignments.",
                "No.",
                "If it's fulfills a major requirement, sure, or if you're looking to take more advanced AI courses in the future. Would not recommend taking this class for fun though.",
                "yes",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend this to any CS major. Although the class involves a lot of work, it is actually quite low-stress due to the lack of exams. The office hours are an excellent way to get help.",
                "I'd say so. This class has taken a (completely unannounced) transformation this year, from being the same course under Scaz for years and years to now essentially using the Berkeley AI materials and having brand new professors. They were really supportive which was great, and I liked the weekly quizzes instead of exams. That being said, the grading was really weird - we'd get separate grades for correctness and \"show your work\" on some problems which were then multiplied together, meaning if you (by their questionable standards) didn't show your work you could get a very low grade. Then some of the problems were just straight-up tedious where 90% of the work happened after all learning stopped; that felt like a waste of time. I hope that with the re-numbering of this course to 370 and possible transformation into a required\/core class in the coming years, the staff takes the chance to sand out the rough edges and keep only the theoretical\/programming parts that are the most fair\/conducive to learning.",
                "Maybe not. In retrospective, there must probably be another class that can teach you how to build these algorithms without you having to go through the unrewarding grind of the PSETS.",
                "i would definitely recommend it to people who are looking to learn more about AI",
                "nice course if you are interested in AI!",
                "Yes, it is a good introduction to Artificial Intelligence if you've never been exposed to the field. It is not as intimidating as it sounds, and anyone with a decent background of computer science (you should be fine after 201, and 223 is really just complementary) would be okay in the class.",
                "This course needs a lot of improving.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about how AI works, but be aware that machine learning\/neutral networks are only a small part of this course",
                "I honestly would not recommend this course to another student. There are other interesting CS electives and honestly this was a course that I was really excited about, but ended up being quite disappointed with.",
                "Yes."
