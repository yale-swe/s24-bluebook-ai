                "Dr. Lant did a really great job at making this course engaging and useful despite the somewhat boring content",

                "I thought it was very well run",
                "The course is very good as long as you stay on top of it. It's manageable with a helpful pre-lab video and quiz to make sure you know the experiment you're conducting, plus it matches well with the content of Chem 164 to help understand concepts.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Lant!! Is ! A ! GEM!! Please don't go to UChicago :( Her and Chris were also AMAZING at giving feedback and making themselves available for office hours, etc.! \r\nWeaknesses: workload is really high for a half-credit course, and lab reports took me ages. The length of lab reports could be cut down a bit, given the level of specificity required, but this really isn't a big deal.",
                "Strengths for me was the professor (Dr. Lant) and teaching fellow (Kristian Oleson). They were so helpful all of the time and such great people to be around in the lab that made this first lab at Yale fun and engaging. I thought another strength was the occasional class periods of getting help with writing a lab report. These made writing the lab reports a lot easier/more smooth. Not really any weakness for the class, except I wish I could have gotten to know the people in the class before choosing a lab partner rather than just sort of randomly being assigned.",
                "the lab reports were really time consuming, the course workload is definitely worth more than 0.5 credits. i spent many hours doing the reports as much 1 credit courses.\r\n\r\nstrength: very rigorous and meticulous, enjoyed lab time as well as lab workshop hours and the pre lab lectures",
                "Strength is definitely the instructors who were super helpful and very accommodating. Weakness is the super long lab reports which sometimes just seem like a stats class",
                "The stoichiometry rules were not really taught, but other than that it went about as well as a hen chem lab can go",
                "A big strength of the course was the lab report workshops that were occasionally held to help with the upcoming lab reports. It was incredibly helpful to have a session where I could ask for help on my lab report simultaneously while doing it."

I got really lucky that I had two great helpers who made lab fun and easy.",
