                "There were more weaknesses than strengths to this course. While we practiced Spanish everyday, we were not learning any new grammatical structures effectively enough to become better at Spanish and integrate it into my writing or speaking. Additionally, the course itself is very anti-Indigenous. The movie for the Indigenous unit was framed through a white savior narrative. The materials in the unit was also not telling of any current conditions of Indigenous people that included resistance or happiness or joy. All of the materials focused on the oppressive situation of Indigenous people through anecdotes that did not properly show or reflect the oppression that Indigenous people face.",
                "The guiding question of \"what does it mean to be a minority\" and the social, economic, psychological, and national ramifications this question suggests were abundantly interesting to explore in class. Opening each class with brief recaps of our week\/plans for weekends settled us into discussion-mode before we addressed the main material. Most assignments were very clear in requirements and due dates. Feedback and progression of projects was quite orderly. \r\n\r\nThe course could be improved through providing targeted reading activities for homework; grammar activities were provided, but accompanying listening activities with this grammar would help solidify it all.",
                "Strengths: course topics were interesting and engaging, conversations were extremely engaging and involved the entire class\r\nWeaknesses: a relaxed focus on grammar as it was mainly assigned as homework lessons, so it became difficult to implement such skills into our writing",
                "More notice about upcoming assignments and projects would be helpful, since they are a bit ambiguous on the syllabus."
