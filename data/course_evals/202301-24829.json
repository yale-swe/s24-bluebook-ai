                "Strengths- good overview to the major isotope systems. I really enjoyed going to class each week because it was a fun and comfortable learning environment. The class was half grad half undergrad which I liked. The professor really cares about his students. \r\nWeaknesses- the midterm and final didnt feel aligned with the content we covered so it was just not what I was expecting. I appreciated the low workload but wish we had more psets representative of the exams. \r\n\r\n*something to note- there are very little assignments throughout the semester until the final paper/presentation/exam which is a lot at once"
