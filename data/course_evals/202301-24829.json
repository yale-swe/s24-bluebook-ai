More regular assignments could have been helpful but the problem sets we had were well written to make you figure out what was happening, and the paper review assignment was cool.",
                "Strengths- good overview to the major isotope systems. I really enjoyed going to class each week because it was a fun and comfortable learning environment. The class was half grad half undergrad which I liked. The professor really cares about his students. \r\nWeaknesses- the midterm and final didnt feel aligned with the content we covered so it was just not what I was expecting. I appreciated the low workload but wish we had more psets representative of the exams. \r\n\r\n*something to note- there are very little assignments throughout the semester until the final paper/presentation/exam which is a lot at once"
