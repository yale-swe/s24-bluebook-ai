                "Knowledge: Experience with fundamental Romantic works that transformed how the West views Identity. Most of the readings were unfamiliar yet incredibly striking. Even among works I have encountered before, our approach allowed me to glean more information out of them than on my first and second reads. Areas of thought span psychoanalysis, morality, interiority, child psychology, race, gender, sexuality, etc. in an approach that meaningfully weaves our readings together into a reliable canon.\r\n\r\nSkills: Strengthened ability to find profundity within texts, develop my thoughts in class and meaningfully respond to others' input, connect common ideas between subject areas, and develop my written arguments to greater depths.\r\n\r\nInsights: Identity is a paralyzingly large word, yet it is not so vague that it cannot be examined in isolation. The \"I\" underlying every human experience can, to an extent, be sought after, found, and obscured by the greater world.",
                "Integrating philosophical, literary, and psychological modes of analysis",
                "I am so glad that I took this course because it opened my eyes to many new ways of thinking and changed me as a reader and analyst. Professor Barasch selected such interesting texts that didn't necessarily fit together on a superficial level, but, in actuality, complimented each other perfectly. From Romantic poetry to mid-20th-century psychoanalysis to modern fiction, this course asked me to think deeply about how humans identify and group themselves from many different angles, exposing fundamental truths and ironies. The small class size also allowed me to develop new insights, as my fellow classmates and I, under the direction of Professor Barasch, were able to engage more pointedly and thoughtfully with each other's ideas.",
                "This is one of my favorite seminar classes I have taken at Yale. It brings together a diverse array of works relating to identity and selfhood spanning three centuries and a variety of subtopics (independence, subjectivity, intimacy, race, gender & class). I learned a lot about all of these concepts and the connections between them and I got to see what a highly engaged seminar-style classroom environment looks like  it's incredibly rewarding."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Barasch assigned a highly engaging syllabus. Every text evoked vivid, lively discussions among the class wherein people listened to each other and respectfully responded to one another. Our discussion posts somehow felt more engaging than those in my other classes, and I truly looked forward to reading everyone else's thoughts based on the question prompts Professor Barasch proposed each week. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the class had more time to sufficiently discuss each work to a satisfying conclusion. I found two hours per week, once a week, to be an insufficient amount of time to handle all we were assigned. There were a few texts that we were assigned that we were not able to discuss for more than five minutes or at all, though I would have liked to in the classroom setting. I also wish that we could divide the class assignments into three projects instead of a short midterm and a long final. There were so many topics we covered in class, meaning that there were some readings that only got a quick read-through before class and a quick discussion during. It is a bit frustrating to only turn in papers on two to four readings from class overall, and since we were moving relatively quickly through each work, I feel a bit unprepared to address a work we briefly touched upon in a final project.",
                "A strength in this course is attention to detail in material and intimacy within the classroom. Because of the size of the class and the attentiveness of the professor, the environment we had to discuss and learn from each other was extremely fruitful. The things we were reading and discussing were diverse and pulled from different parts of the world. Every single person in the class had something to say or relate to, and that made the discussion even more effective. I also enjoyed the lack of technology within the classroom and the comfort that fostered. If I had to pick a weakness in the class, I would say I wish we met more than once a week. There were so many things to say and not enough time to say them.",
                "Fantastic discussions and great range of subjects, maybe spend 2 weeks per unit instead of a different one weekly (at the same time this was often kind of great.) spending two weeks on Nietzsche was very helpful and led to me getting much more out of it though",
                "This course had many strengths and not many weaknesses. It was the perfect mix of breadth and depth: there was a large variety of texts across disciplines, but each text encouraged deep thinking and pushed us to examine the central theme of identity in a new light. In this way, this course represents the ideal of what a humanities class should be, synthesizing different fields around a central question about human existence. Our discussions were always engaging, with Professor Barasch always steering us in a productive direction. He also always provided helpful feedback on our writing, again encouraging us to think about the material more closely. The only weakness I can think of is that we didn't have enough time in the semester to explore everything as thoroughly as I would have liked to!",
                "The vastness of the topic is both a strength and a weakness of the class  since basically everything is on the table, we had very wide-ranging conversations that strayed from the texts, sometimes productively and sometimes less so. At times I think the conversation could have been a little more intentionally controlled and directed, but the willingness to explore also brought us to some textual connections and personal insights that we wouldn't have found otherwise. That being said Professor Barasch is a wonderful professor and really goes above and beyond to make himself and his expertise available to his students  I received better feedback on my written work and participation in this class than any other I've taken at Yale."

The texts are all super interesting and your understanding of them is greatly supported by the intimate and thoughtful discussion sections. This is a great course overall.",
                "Yes, very much so  it's super engaging and interesting, it brings together work that you should absolutely read if you're majoring in a humanistic discipline (and even if you're not) and Professor Barasch is fantastic."
