                "Strengths: this course allows students to be actively engaged in the lab and improves our presentation skills through the oral presentation and papers.\r\nWeakness: the actual research course itself doesn't really seem to play any role in my lab experience until the very end when we have to present and write. But it seems a bit weird having the course professors grade us instead of our own PIs since we never had the opportunity to talk with the course professors throughout the semester to get their feedback.",
                "Strengths are the information session by the instructors, such as how to give an oral presentation. The weaknesses are the lack of community-building activities and continuous check-in with the instructors. For example, it would be very helpful to meet with the instructors at least twice a semester as benchmark meetings to discuss how we are doing and what we need help on so that we can get continuous feedback during the semester rather than one at the end.",
                "There wasn't very much instruction or clarity regarding each of the assignments. We had to turn in research proposals at the start of the semester, but no feedback or even project approval was turned over to us. Although there had been a workshop on how to give science talks toward the end of the semester, it was a bit scattered. That being said, the flexibility of options for types of research that we could engage with was very diverse, and I think many of appreciated this.",
                "Strengths: independent work offering students plenty of decision making opportunities\r\nWeaknesses: only one check-in during the semester to discuss presentation tips for end of semester Powerpoints",
                "Strengths were clear guidelines and the fact that it gave you the opportunity to get more mentorship and a clear defined research project. I wish the course instructors would check in on us at least once, and give more of an indication that they read our final reports. I did not get any feedback from the instructors other than from Dr, Wolenski in the Q&A after my presentation. I also did not get to see any of the feedback from my peers.",
                "There was little guidance given to the students from the course professors, which made it difficult to navigate the assignments and projects. We also got little to no feedback on our work from these professors so the grades given felt arbitrary. I understand most of the feedback comes from our mentor and PI, but since the course professors are involved in assessing our work it would be helpful to get more feedback to justify the grades given."
