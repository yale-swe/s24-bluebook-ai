                "I learned how ancient rhetors used epideictic, deliberative and judicial forms of speaking to deliver their messages.",
                "I learned all about the art of speaking persuasively. I learned about Aristotle's view on rhetoric such as his categorization of the three different types of speech. I studied works and contributions from Quintilian, Cicero, and several other ancient philosophers and orators. I learned how to analyze speeches to find techniques that make them effective / ineffective. I loved seeing the development of rhetoric from Ancient Greece to Ancient Rome to present day.",
                "We learned about the history of Greece and Rome; the history of rhetoric as it has been practiced; rhetoric itself, as an art and a science. We read all of Aristotle's \"The Art of Rhetoric,\" too!",
                "I gained an understanding of rhetoric and speeches as practiced and theorized in Ancient Greece and Rome and how these evolved with time. I learned concepts that I can use in my own speeches (such as the steps of preparing and delivering a speech, the types of evidence and logic to include, how to evoke emotions on the crowd, etc) and that I can recognize in other speeches for analysis and understanding what a speaker is trying to accomplish. I also exercised my memorization and speaking skills by memorizing and delivering a speech for the class as one of the assignments.",
                "Knowledge and insights: The history of rhetorical practice and theory in Ancient Greece and Rome. The theoretical systems of Aristotle and (to some extent) Hermagoras, Cicero, Hermogenes, Quintilian, among others. The sociohistorical background and rhetorical concepts that are necessary to understanding the rhetorical situations that recurred in classical civilizations.\r\n\r\nSkills: We analyzed speeches by prominent orators in these civilizations, and we each delivered a speech of our choice at the end of the course, basing our preparation and delivery in the ideas about memory, emotion, and other rhetorical concepts that we learned throughout the semester.",
                "I now have a comprehensive overview of the history of classical rhetoric as a discipline from the time it was first conceptualized in Ancient Greece through the Renaissance! Although \"rhetoric\" has come to mean a very specific, typically negative thing in modern society, I have a newfound appreciation for the complexity of rhetoric as an art. The combination of in-class and essay analysis alongside the final speaking assignment also helped me develop my own rhetorical skills!"

                "Strengths: amazing instructor; creative, engaging lectures and activities; powerful readings with a manageable reading load; a truly wonderful introduction to ancient rhetoric and the classical world at large. \r\nWeaknesses: the one suggestion I would make is for the course to include a bit more historical context, especially when transitioning to Roman rhetoric, since this could help students appreciate the texts in their surrounding frameworks.",
                "Dr. Stoner is a great professor and very clear and knowledgeable in the area of ancient rhetoric and its associated texts. I enjoyed delivering a speech of our choice and receiving feedback on my writing.\r\nI believe that if I had more opportunities to give speeches and work on my speech crafting skills to the class I would have enjoyed the class more as a whole but still learned more about ancient rhetoric.",
                "Strengths - very interesting material, extremely applicable to daily life -- you will retain this information and use it whenever you speak in the future!, great professor and awesome teaching fellows. \r\nOne thing is there are usually no lecture slides so make sure you write quickly and keep up with the lecture!",
                "Dr. Stoner is a wonderfully committed professor; she's the kind of lecturer who has everyone's names down by the end of the first class and will respond to all your emails. My favorite lectures were the ones she divided into around three main topics. At the same time, I do think there was points in the middle of the course (i.e. when we moved from Greek to Roman rhetoric) when lectures began to feel a bit disjointed or veered into vague, seminar-style discussions. I think things got back on track at the end of the course, when we memorized and delivered speeches. I'm also still questioning whether Aristotle's On Rhetoric is the best reading for this course; while I genuinely enjoyed reading Aristotle, it was demoralizing to realize that this text has had very little influence on the history of rhetoric. There are so many other works we discussed in the course that I would have loved to read; perhaps we could have even done excerpts from several authors (e.g. Cicero's On Invention, Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria) instead of focusing on one text for the semester. On the other hand, I found the Kennedy readings helpful and enjoyed reading spotlight speeches.",
                "Strengths: great mix between study of rhetoric and study of Classical history; opportunity to deliver a memorized speech in class; great sections with the TAs; fair exams and fair grading; clear plan for the semester and for each class; ample office hours; helpful feedback on exams and papers.\r\nWeaknesses: N/A.",
                "The reading quizzes were a great way of keeping us on top of the readings (I would definitely have started slacking halfway through the course were it not for them), though Aristotle was sometimes a little confusing. The assignments were very useful in applying the concepts we learned in class in rhetorical analysis and argumentation, and their shorter length meant they were not a major burden and actually enjoyable. The speaking assignment was also a great addition.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Stoner is a wonderful lecturer. The super-quick reading quizzes at the beginning of most lectures helped motivate me to stay on track with the readings, and they were not stressful at allthere were typically two questions, only one of which you had to answer, and usually the answers didn't need to be full sentences (a one-word answer often sufficed). The format on the midterm and final was perfect, with just the right level of detail/specificity in the questions and not an unreasonable expectation in terms of remembering things, even though there were some passage ID questions. Dr. Stoner's feedback on assignments was very insightful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is not really a weakness so much as a suggestion, but I think this class would have benefited from more varied readings, both in terms of primary sources and secondary sourcesfor the former, more Quintilian, Cicero, Isocrates, and other theorists would have been good as an alternative to reading Aristotle's Rhetoric in its entirety (although selections of Aristotle are important); for the latter, journal articles could have supplemented or replaced parts of the Kennedy reading.",
                "I think the course's biggest strength is Dr. Stoner, who is a fantastic teacher. As you would hope for a rhetoric professor, she organized her lectures clearly and kept them engaging with humor, actually fun exercises, and interesting storytelling. She so clearly cares about her students, and created one of the best classroom environments I've had at Yale. The only negatives for me were that the readings were often kind of long and dry (though I'm not sure that could be changed), and that we never got much of a chance to try our hands at invention, arrangement, and style (i.e. rhetorical composition) on any of our assignments."

She cares very much about how her students perform and wants to make sure everyone in the class comes out of the class with better tools to speak, write and read ancient rhetoric. I will say that this class focuses more on Ancient Rhetoric than it does public speaking.",
                "Yes!! If you are interested in public speaking, history, Ancient Greece and Rome, debate, law -- fantastic class!!!",
                "If you're looking for a survey Classics course that doesn't require Greek or Latin, this could be a great option. The course focuses on rhetoric but also introduces you to a range of important Greco-Roman writers and thinkers. If your main goal is to become a better public speaker, however, this may not be the best option; we had one speaking assignment, but the course is primarily about the theory of rhetoric.",
                "Yes! Great professor and great analysis of the subject.",
                "Absolutely. The class content is very interesting (and useful) and Dr. Stoner is a phenomenal professor.",
                "Absolutely; the material is very interesting, and the course was designed in a way that was not really stressful (at least for me), despite the amount of reading and the assessments. I would only caution that this is very much a Classics course, so the approach to Aristotle's Rhetoric and other rhetorical treatises differs from what you would see in a Philosophy course, for example. It focuses more on the historical background and significance, the applicability of theoretical systems, and a general sense of those systems, rather than on a precise understanding of a philosophically charitable reading of theoretical systems and on philosophically evaluating those systems.",
                "Yes!! This was a fantastic course!! If you want to learn something (or a lot of things!) about rhetoric, education in the ancient Mediterranean world, and a bit of Greek, Roman, and Early Christian history through a fascinating and maybe not typical lens, this is the class for you! Dr. Stoner is amazing and makes what might sometimes be dry/dusty content both fun, interesting, and relevant to our own lives. I've learned a lot of things that keep connecting to my life and other classes in rich and surprising ways. Other than the readings being somewhat dry/long, I found the course load very manageable."
