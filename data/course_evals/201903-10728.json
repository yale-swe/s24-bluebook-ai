    "I learned a lot about the ancient classics of the Western canon simply by the reading list itself. In addition, Professor Hill has a lot of expertise on modern-day politics that he often synthesized with what we were reading.",
    "I learned the way history is structured.  I learned how the writings of Herodotus and Thucydides and Livy etc. set the stage for our time.  I learned that the problems we face today are not necessarily new and that we can learn much from history.  I also, because of our instructor, gained a huge respect for the art associated with the times we discussed in class.  Professor Hill always brought his \"A\" game and he was amazing.",
    "Professor Hill taught me how to see underneath social structures, and understand recurring patterns in history.",
    "I learned about the first half of the western canon. I learned to improve my writing and analytical skills.",
    "I learned how to build big arguments about history. I have a completely new understandings of intellectual history and national identity because of our readings and the class discussion. I was always amazed at what Professor Hill brought to the class both from his personal experience and how he reads the texts.",
    "Big picture thinking of history and identifying key themes.",
    "By the end of the course, you will gain an understanding of the the way historical and political thought developed throughout Greek and Roman history."

   "comments": [
    "The seminar experience was often mixed in this course as Professor Hill often spoke about issues that seemed tangential to the course reading, which made it more difficult for me to engage as I didn't have any background knowledge in these issues. That said, on a good day Professor Hill's insights on the texts were substantial and have given me ideas that I will continue to engage with throughout Directed Studies.",
    "I believe we should have a \"Directed Studies textbook for each of the 3 areas of study.",
    "Strengths: \r\n- excellent, knowledgeable professor\r\n- papers graded quickly and feedback given\r\n- interesting discussion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- perhaps not enough feedback on papers? Honestly it wasn't a problem though.",
    "The strength and weakness of this class is Professor Hills ability to take a blackboard and twenty minutes and summarize all of western history. Its brilliant, and I learned so much both in terms of content and how to build big narratives like that. This being said, there was less discussion in our section compared to other sections. But his ideas were so mind-blowing that I think it was really valuable to learn how to just listen.",
    "The ordering of the course makes perfect sense. It covers a more manageable amount of material than the other Directed Studies classes.",
    "very interesting insights and perspectives but not a conversation, more of a lecture",
    "City of God was an excessive amount of reading with not enough intellectual\/historical pay-off for the time demand of reading it."

    "I would recommend Directed Studies only if a student has accepted the advantages of breadth over depth and is prepared to sometimes feel underwater with many many texts. That said I think it has many structural advantages and the seminar experience is often really exciting.",
    "Yes I would.  Anyone would improve their knowledge and thinking by being in Professor Hill's class.",
    "Yes. This is one of the best HP sections in DS",
    "YES! I love professor Hill -- such a briliant man. DS students should try to switch in. He has such strong analytical skills and knows so many things.",
    "Absolutely. This section is extremely fulfilling. Make it a priority to understand Professor Hill's style as quickly as you can; once you do, discussions and papers will start to really come together for you.",
    "Yes! This class has taught me how to break history into arguments and structure my understandings of how events or writers progressed in the context of their predecessors and society.",
    "Yes, especially with Professor Hill.",
    "yes, very interesting and a chance not many people get to have",
    "Yes! The course was very interesting and made me look at the material in a new way."
