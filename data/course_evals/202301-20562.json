                "The course is rewarding if you put in the effort they expect. I think sometimes the deadlines could be a little more clearly explained and certain projects would have been more rewarding if we'd had more time to work on them",
                "It moves very quickly, and the homework being graded for accuracy rather than completion makes it somewhat stressful given that you have homework and quizzes every single day. Because of the pace, I'm always trying to memorize the new material and rarely have time to study old material.",
                "I enjoy the variety of assessments from oral presentations to video projects to written tests.",
                "Strengths: You learn a new language and are able to use it almost every day.\r\nWeaknesses: The course is quick intensive and you can burn out easily.",
                "I felt that the course was well-taught, and I felt like the projects were done in ways that allowed me to think creatively about what I had learned. However, I found that much of the work was simply busy work, and didn't feel like some of it was improving my understanding of the language.",
                "Strengths: Good balance between different activities; speaking, listening, writing, etc. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I have a lot of problems with the Chinese department, which were really highlighted to me this semester with Professor Li. First, while I appreciate the challenging nature of the course and how fast-paced it is, the class simply moves too fast to actually absorb all of the information being thrown at you. Everyone in our class struggled to keep up. You do an entire textbook lesson a week, a presentation every week, and have a test every other week. Unless you take literally no other classes and do nothing else at Yale, it's practically impossible to finish all of the larger assignments while also staying up to date with homework every day (learning new vocab words and grammar). The daily dictations (character writing quizzes) are so impractical; you forget the words you learned right after each day's quiz, and there doesn't need to be an emphasis on writing when we only ever type. Additionally, the weekly presentations reward sheer memorization over actual language skills. Instead of memorizing and performing a script, I think we would be way better served by these presentations if they were just a conversation where you weren't penalized for not saying exactly what you wrote down verbatim.",
                "Homework is graded too strictly, even a very good student would struggle to get a good grade. I also think oral presentation scripts could be printed out and tone/pronounciations corrected right on the copy and handed back to the students (as done in L1) so that the students can have their feedback right away, instead of having them on the dictation books, which we never have a chance to look at.",
                "The course could have provided more resources for listening comprehension outside of the videos that come with the textbook. Many students are looking for podcasts to supplement listening but have been unable to find good ones.",

                "YES! Taking Chinese was the best decision I made at Yale (for me personally, not my GPA). To get the most out of this class, you need to study outside of class A LOT. It will be a ton of work, but it is worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is motivated to learn Mandarin and is willing to dedicate enough homework time to preparing for it.",
                "I would, but only if they were very interested in the language.",
                "I would honestly not recommend Chinese to someone starting the language brand new at Yale. Taking the language has felt like a significant uphill battle, and basically requires you to dedicate 3-4 hours DAILY if you actually want to do well. I am really interested in learning about China and the language, but I have other academic passions as well that I have had to put by the wayside and sacrifice in order to keep up with Chinese. Unless all of the other classes you are taking are guts that you don't need or want to dedicate any time to, do not take Chinese.",
