                "I especially liked the asynchronous portion of the course, allowing me to learn freely on my own. I also liked the abundance of TAs that were in the course as they were a big help in my understanding of statistics. I also really liked the topic of the course as they allowed me to have a first impression of my planned future path.",
                "One of the greatest strengths of this course is that students can go through the content at their own pace using any of the 3 ways that the professors provide to learn the material. The problem sets are also well designed to practice the statistical techniques you learn in class. One way the course could be improved is to provide the peer tutors with access to the solutions to the problem sets. A few times, I went to the peer tutor office hours and they told me they could not answer my questions about the problem sets because they did not have the solutions.",
                "The group work aspect of the course was extremely helpful for reviewing and applying the concepts learned in class, though sometimes the specifics of which concepts from 100 reviewed in 105 were being taught and why was unclear."

                "Absolutely not. You will not gain anything new from 105, just take another 10X course. The last 3 weeks were just frustrating; it felt like I was banging my head on a wall because the teacher refused to teach, and expected us to figure it out. You will spend 3 days on a single problem because you are meant to wrestle with a conceptual and mathematical tiger and when you ask for help, the Jay Emerson will just tell you to ask your groupmates, who also have no clue what is going on.",
                "Perhaps not this particular concentration even if you're premed. You learn much less stat, medical applications are very vague. Would be better off continuing with any of the JDRS sections",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as the student would get a great introduction to statistics and a first look at papers related to the medical field. This course is also well-taught as the lectures were very clear and problem sets were difficult, but manageable.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is well taught and flexible to your schedule, and it provides a very helpful background to the statistical techniques you will encounter in everyday papers.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student if they have an interest in reading scientific literature in accordance with a statistics class.",
