                "The course had every-other-week problem sets, but I would have preferred shorter problem sets every week that could reinforce class material more directly. The quizzes were extremely difficult and did not reflect lecture material, even while being open-note.",
                "Lecture moved a bit slowly and the concepts were very jumbled around. The order of the slides was sometimes not logical and too many case studies were thrown in before I had actually grasped the basic theory behind what we were doing. Also, it sometimes felt like the professor went through the hard stuff really quickly and the easy stuff too slowly. However, section was incredibly useful and concretely took us through that basic theory. I think that if lecture just went through the no-extra-fluff version of what we had to know first and then complimented it with examples, that would be much better.",
                "R? U kidding me? How are we supposed to learn R in one homework assignment? Not possible. Would like to see the data analytics on the success of that plan. Unfortunately I still don't know how to code so that wouldn't be possible for me, but I imagine its low.",
                "the lecture is not very helpful in understanding the content, and many mistakes were made in presentations that were only corrected when a student pointed out their confusion.",
                "Good",
                "This course does a lot in one semester: probability, theory of statistics, and coding. Some more office hours towards the beginning of the semester to help those who have no background in statistics and probability would be helpful.",
                "The sections for this course were very helpful. I think the course was well-laid out: moving from probability rules to determining causality. The course moved a little fast, and the quizzes (meant to help student learning) were very difficult. The quizzes in particular could be improved.",
                "The strengths of this course are how the content is very thought-provoking and how the real-life applications help to make the content more understandable. The weaknesses are that the lectures are often filled with fluff content, and there isn't enough time spent going over R.",

The lectures were a little bit long-winded at times and it seemed like sometimes the topics being discussed weren't relevant or important to the course content that was on the PSETs or exams.

Sections are helpful, good notes, psets are good practice problems and the R isn't the most difficult. Each pset (we had 7) were on two week deadlines which was helpful, just pace yourself and you will do good on those. Exams are certainly difficult. Professor teaching is what wasn't pleasant, and midterm exam is very short time for many problems, might not finish.",
                "Strengths: good knowledge and information about R, good empirical examples\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture slides were extremely exhaustive and long, about 80-90 pages, so it was very difficult to review and retain information, could improve by making the information more concise and summarizing the examples provided.",

                "The course content is overall well-organized, with a clear breakdown of topics and a logical progression between topics with one concept building upon another. However, I wish we could receive more systematic guidance and practice on R. By the end of the semester, I learned certain commands and knew how to answer questions on the psets, but I still dont feel confident to say I know how to code in R. I also hope the teaching team could double check before they release the psets questions  there were several errors in more than one pset which caused some confusion and needed updates. Although I know it is hard given limited time and resources, but it would also be very helpful if the teaching team could return graded psets indicating where we did wrong exactly.",
                "this course was not taught at what i believe is an introductory level. the concepts were not thouroughly explained and there were not enough example problems or applications that were straightforward and mimicked exam formats",
                "The course is necessary for the major, but besides that, there are no reasons to take this class. The lectures were not organized well to facilitate learning. I learned barely anything in lecture, and often found it was more productive to teach myself than to try to figure out what was going on. The problem sets were too long, and they made very little sense, to the point that oftentimes the teaching assistants at office hours didn't know how to solve them. R was a major part of the course, but the professor didn't even know how to use R, so he DEFINITELY didn't know how to teach R, so nobody learned R properly.",
                "I think quizzes were very helpful for solidifying materials and the slides were well constructed. The lecture was not very engaging and led to most students not showing up.",
                "Strengths: applicability\r\nWeaknesses: Chan be boring at times, no feedback on problem sets",
                "More stuff on different models",
                "I really liked how our problem sets led us to reproduce results from various econometric research papers, and I think the course teaches important concepts. Sometimes I feel I did not get a lot out of attending lectures, though, especially because attendance was generally quite low.",
                "I thought that the comprehensive nature of the class was good, especially for someone who has never really taken a stats class before and doesn't really plan on doing so again in the future. Beyond that, though, the class was terribly weak. Far too much time was spent looking at real world examples while far too little time was spent developing intuition behind the actual methods that we were learning. And while it's certainly nice to see how the work you're doing can be applied in the real world, it's not particularly engaging when the class is as boring as this one is. I also thought that the lack of assistance with the R. programming language was a massive barrier to success in this class. There was virtually no help with it in lecture, making it feel at times that we were in two different classes and completely missing one of them. And this wouldn't have been so bad except that the problem sets relied heavily on R. This isn't to mention that Professor Altonji wasn't particularly well-versed in R himself, putting us into a dumb-leading-the-blind situation. The other stark weakness I found was the final exam. It placed far too much emphasis on things that were never explicitly discussed. And while every class at Yale is meant to be difficult insofar as that success requires, at least to some extent, that the student spend time really getting to understand the material and the intuition behind it, such parts are usually only a marginal portion of exams which are instead intended to assess students on the more concrete with a few of those more difficult questions sprinkled in. The final was nearly the complete opposite. I wouldn't have thought it such a kick in the head, but none of the previous finals were remotely that difficult and were frankly a terrible means of preparation because the exam was ridiculous and so out of line with anything that is normally taught in the class or expected of its students. I don't know that there was any reasonable way of preparing for that exam, especially in the midst of worrying about 3 to 4 other finals. There's so much more that could be said about the shortcomings of this class, but it's not worth my time. This class was a joke, a cruel and fucked up joke.",
                "I believe it could be more engaging and interactive. The peer tutors were the best part of the class. They helped a ton. The professor was very nice but just read off the slides during lecture. I feel as though I wasnt really being taught at all. Especially I think the r coding could have been taught better",
                "This class was truly horrible, by far the worst I've taken in the Econ department. However, on the one hand, the skills and material are interesting and undoubtedly valuable (I'm certainly utilizing these skills in other classes, research, and in life). On the other hand, the lectures were unbelievably dull and hard to follow, and the course itself suffered from deep disorganization; P-sets, sections, and exams were very disconnected to the lectures, teaching fellows had no idea what was going on in lecture, and there were all sorts of assumptions of prior knowledge. Content wise, the class is extremely important for any econ major, but there must be a better teaching team. This nightmare was the fault of the professor and the lack of coordination between TFs and professor.\r\n\r\nIt is important context for the reader of this feedback to know that I am a student that performed very well on both the midterm and final, so this feedback is not in any way my anger for getting a poor grade. I give this feedback out of a sincere hope that the Econ Department will fix the nightmare that was Econ 117 this semester so future students can have a better learning experience.",
                "Strengths: The material covered was interesting and relevant \r\nWeaknesses: The class was overall disorganized",
                "Very bad course. Material is poorly taught, assignments are unhelpful, and overall there was no cohesive set of ideas to the course. This is a class to truly avoid at all costs.",
                "This course was taught in a confusing manner, I would make class examples simpler",
                "The class was well organized. The teach assistants were helpful in organizing their sections and provided useful information on R and data analysis in general every sections. The lectures were not very good and it made it hard for me to get content from them. I didn't go to class that often as a result",
                "This course was not very engaging. Lectures dragged on and did not relate well to problem sets. Instruction on R code was also limited.",
                "Professor Altonji didnt teach much just read the slides off during lectures.",
                "Strengths: The content in the course is highly applicable in the data-driven world, which empowers advances.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The content was presented poorly so it didn't excite students and was difficult to learn. The professor is terrible and tends to attract less than 1/5 of the class for each lecture, leaving the students to learn entirely on their own.",
                "Strengths: Techniques learned are likely to prove useful in research, peer tutors like Annie and Josh were enormously helpful, Crossan the TA was awesome! \r\nWeaknesses: Most TAs dont really want to be helpful, Professor Altonji, though an accomplished researcher, was not a great professor, there was a conspicuous lack of transparency regarding grading, and it seem to be that we often were left to our devices when trying to learn material for this courses. When my peers complained about bad testing conditions and suffering from nausea in one of the testing rooms, the ED Discussion was restricted to prevent the feed from exploding with responses.",
                "Discussion sections were rather repetitive of lecture content and lectures, especially with introductory concepts, were rather slow. I enjoyed the difficulty of quizzes and tests, however that level was not matched by other parts of the course.",
                "Strengths are interesting content. Weaknesses are somewhat unengaging lectures.",
                "Professor was a bit confusing.",
                "Each lecture was just ridiculously boringand I am usually never critical about a class I have taken at Yale. A lot of the concepts/ideas just didn't connect with each other, and the lectures were not helpful in providing a good foundational understanding.",
                "Strengths included clear and engaging lecture slides, relevant and interesting problem sets, and the abundance of support from the professor, TFs, and peer tutors. I really enjoyed all of the real-world applications throughout the course. A weakness of the course was the lack of off-slide teaching during lecturesI wouldve appreciated more clarifications and explanations that were not written on the board.",
                "I think the assessment requirements were communicated well and that it was clear what material needed to be understood in order to complete the assignments. There was a nice sense of progression as new content built on top of previous material. Perhaps conveying this more clearly earlier in the course may be good for students to get a clear sense of the bigger picture of what the course is building up towards.",
                "Strengths: You will learn a lot; the slides are useful for review, and the PSETs are helpful. Office hours/peer tutoring hours are great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really; I would caution students to make sure they keep engaged and not fall behind.",
                "Strength: well structured, good professor\r\nWeaknesses: n/a",
                "The course did provide a pretty detailed look at many concepts within data analysis and economic research. However, there were several flaws within the course. Problem sets were made by different TFs each week, so the structure and level of difficulty was always changing, making time management much more difficult. The material in quizzes was often not covered well in class or in section. In addition, not nearly enough attention was devoted to teaching R. Although discussion sections covered examples using R, the 50-minute time constraint made TFs present the information so fast that it was difficult to follow. TFs in office hours would sometimes refer individuals to a lecture rather than explain and answer the questions themselves.",
                "Lectures have to be better prepared and more engaging.",
                "An intro course to the ECON major and a prereq should be taught by an engaging professor. Prof. Altonji was very nice but he drove me away from lecture with his lack of energy.",
                "I am an Economics major, and one thing that I love about the Econ department is that they have wonderful introduction courses. However, I am sad to say this class did not meet the standard I am used to from the Yale Econ department. Some strengths were that the lecture slides were easy to follow, and some of the peer tutors (particularly Josh) were very helpful. I also liked the quizzes for practicing the material, and it was nice to have tests take up a lower grade percentage than some of my other classes. However, there was lots of room for improvement. First, Professor Altonji's lectures lacked the engaging, easy-to-follow nature of other Econ courses, and the number of technical difficulties we had in class really disturbed my ability to learn. Way too much time was spent on the minutia of random economics papers, and I often left the class with no understanding of the actual topic of the day since it was not focused on for most of the lecture. Additionally, lectures often had long pauses or the professor would make mistakes, which is understandable but after a while really hurt my ability to learn the material. Also, if a goal of this class is to teach you how to code in R, there was not enough support for learning R code at all. I had no previous coding experience but was taking another class where I was learning R this semester, so I could get through. However, if I did not have that other class, I would have been very lost. This class needs to spend more time on R basic so students understand what they are doing versus just copying over code every problem set.",
                "Look. Professor Altonji is so sweet and nice that I hate to say this, but he is a not awesome at lecturing. (That's okay! Not everyone is!) It was really hard to pay attention, so I stopped going to class, and that was a fundamental problem. Frankly, the best teachers in the course weren't even the TFs, they was the peer tutors (specifically Josh Leffler, who should be the one teaching the class). As someone who has taken 5 Econ lectures at Yale--only one of which was well taught--I WISH the Econ department would stop employing faculty who are (I assume) good researchers but are terrible at the teaching roles they've been given. Just get some people who are good at presenting concepts clearly and make them teach the lectures. I genuinely could not care less if they have had a paper published or not. I think Professor Altonji would be a great professor for an upper level seminar where the students are more on his page. This class should not be for him."

The problem sets are also incredibly long.",

Macro and Micro are just focused on providing esoteric formulas for things we already understand intuitively in real life. But 117 actually provides pretty interesting case studies in the importance of understanding econometric methods.

He often blew too quickly past the real stuff  the how precisely to do something  to talk about examples in which these techniques are used in the real world. His examples were very interesting, and it was very impressive to see just how many of them he had either been in close proximity to or knew someone (another famous economist, like himself) who had worked on the example he was teaching. However, when it came time to do the quizzes, problem sets, and exams, nobody knew what was going on. By the end of the course, very few people attended lecture, not because they were lazy or checked out, but because it was more useful to teach ourselves the concepts alone or in group study. Introductory econometrics are very difficult concepts to grasp, and Yale needs to put more thought into the way this course is taught. It is a notoriously awful course, and it keeps getting worse. Everyone I know who does not need this class for their major dropped it within the first few weeks. I was considering an economics major, but as someone who is not as strong quantitatively, the necessity to teach myself these really difficult concepts forced me to Credit/D/Fail the class and stop considering an economics major.",

It was the least enjoyable learning experience of my life and by far the worst class I've taken at Yale. In plenty of classes that I've taken, I haven't particularly enjoyed them in the moment, but upon reflection once their over, I've recognized that I gained quite a lot from them. This is not one of those classes. While I definitely learned something, it was not remotely worth the pain that was/is ECON 117. And perhaps the worst part is that there are so many other classes that can teach you the exact same things without having to deal with this mess.
