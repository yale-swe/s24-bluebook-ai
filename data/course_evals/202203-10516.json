                "This class greatly increased my skills as a reader, specifically with the added tool of close-reading. Being able to take apart a piece of text, film, or poetry in a deeper way and challenge what was initially thought was something that allowed me to feel more like an intellectual rather than just a student. The question that this class explores alone was extremely interesting and prompted a lot of riveting class discussions.",

                "Critical thinking\r\nLiteral analysis\r\nClose reading",
                "I learned so much about how to think about and analyze literature in the context of the time of the writer and my current experiences. I learned how to analyze films, I was introduced to a seminar style class, and I was able to gain new insights with every text and with each of the instructors comments.",
                "Through my reading/watching of different texts/films, I learned more about how people have viewed the \"self.\" Additionally, I learned how to engage more in discussion based classes.",
                "I improved valuable reading comprehension and draft revision skills, as every assignment required significant attention and contemplation. By working alongside my professors and TF in the writing process, I began to understand the value of developing ideas instead of sticking with whatever initial thought popped into my mind. Close reading and analysis were integral to the course, and I learned how to analyze texts across different centuries and continents in a way that helped me understand the writers intention and the texts impact on a deeper level than ever before. I also learned how to propose new ideas, listen to others insights, and successful engage in discussion that was productive without ever reaching one conclusion."

                "Strengths of the course include its curriculum. The works that we explored and the selves that were studied were extremely insightful. The writing assignment prompts also effectively allowed me to grow as a writer with the weekly writing assignments.\r\nWeaknesses of the course included the dominance of some student speakers within a seminar format. However, that is not something that is course specific but rather a part of the seminar structure itself.",
                "The lab was a little silly",
                "This course (and the six pretty good series) has a lot of weaknesses. Its a mini Directed Studies, but we do not get the support of DS in my opinion. The first half of the semester was brutal with essays every week and lots of readings. This class is also 25ish people, meaning its a very large seminar and intimidating to speak up. The only strength is that it is an interesting way to learn and opens your mind to humanities and seminars, but it is a lot of work, especially for your first semester at Yale. Additionally, the professors feel very isolated from the course because the class is so big and there are two professors.",
                "Strengths: classes encouraged me to think out of the box when reading texts , and also improved my writing by a big margin\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: assumed knowledge of some literal texts that I didn't come across before college. Though the teachers did well to explain what they were talking about in some texts, I could comprehend other examples that assumed we knew or read the text",
                "There were so many strengths. The instructors were brilliant, and they led us to learn instead of simply telling us the answers. The course taught me exactly what it promised and more. I looked forward to every class, and I had the chance to really know my classmates through each of our views. As far as weaknesses, I found no weaknesses in the seminars.",
                "The course allowed me to read engaging texts and the discussions in class allowed me to think about the material in a new way. However, the large size of the class prevented me from speaking much and the class lacked small group discussions which would have been beneficial.",
                "The strengths of this class include the structure that allowed for multi-draft submission to aid in the revision process, the engaging and supportive professors/TAs who guided the discussions so that a variety of perspectives were considered and we were constantly moving in a different direction. I also think the class size and particular texts that were chosen stimulated discussion that was extremely valuable to me. The texts and films we were assigned always fostered commentary, and there were never really moments where no one had anything to say. I loved coming to class, and the only weaknesses I can think of only apply to the Friday Lab section."

                "Yes. This class was extremely fulfilling to me even as a STEM student. I came into the class intimidated and full of imposter syndrome. The support I received from Professor Ramachandran and Marta and the T.F.s was pivotal to my increased confidence. I now hold my opinions as a reader with conviction and feel more comfortable with approaching various texts as an intellectual.",
                "Yes",
                "Only if you take easier classes and are prepared to write more than you expect.",
                "Yes\r\n\r\nIf you look forward to improve in your writing skills, this is a very good class\r\nIf you're more of Stem and not into philosophy, reading, history etc and you'dwant a less heavy workload for your writing credit, I wouldn't advise it",
                "Absolutely yes. This was one of my favorite courses, and I always felt like I was learning and growing. The instructors and teaching fellows truly cared about my learning, and the material was endlessly engaging. The texts changed my perspective on perception of the self, and I saw film through a new lens. Everyone should take this course.",
                "I would recommend this class to people who are interested in more philosophical conversations regarding human nature and relationships.",
                "Yes! I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who enjoys discussion or who would like to improve their critical thinking skills. I would say that you have to be wiling to read a lot, but I dont think you have to come in as an avid reader to enjoy this class. Theres a wide variety of texts, genres, authors, etc, and you will definitely enjoy more pieces than others, but the beauty of this class is that the discussion is productive especially when you do not fully understand or agree with the content."
