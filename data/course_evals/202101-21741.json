                "I am pleasantly surprised with this class. I expected the class to be very technical based and more focused on teaching us skills and techniques, but I feel like I also learned a lot about my weaknesses and also what I enjoyed vs. what I found difficult to grasp for some of the sections. I have definitely come out with a more solid foundation of drawing and just what kind of things you can do with it and how it can be a way for me to express my thoughts or feelings. I initially only thought that good drawing meant a product that was perfect and looked really good but I learned that that's not necessarily the case."

                "It's difficult to teach\/learn drawing over zoom (I imagine it's easier to learn how to correct certain mistakes in person) but this class was still really great. I really appreciated the class environment where improvement and effort were valued over producing great work from the outset and where everyone was really supportive of each other. Also, building up drawing skills progressively was helpful towards putting them to use together at the end.",
                "In the beginning I thought it would be really hard to do art classes over zoom, but I think it turned out better than I had expected. I liked how Prof Hysen showed us a few lecture slides to give us a feel for the next section that we were going into and then gave us time to draw on our own and try to learn it ourselves. The great thing about this course is that there is a lot of flexibility in our assignments because drawing is a very subjective thing, and there's really no right or wrong way to do something. It was a little hard to get individual feedback during class as the professor cannot just look over at our drawings, but hopefully that won't be the case in the fall, but I do think that having individual meetings did help in giving that feedback."

                "Yes! I would definitely recommend taking it with Prof Hysen! She really wanted us to learn and get \"the feel\" for what we were drawing like actually trying to feel the shape of trees that we had to draw for homework. It was an interesting experience over zoom, but as the semester went on our class became much more comfortable with each other and really did some personal pieces for our final project with no fear of being judged which was pretty cool. I really enjoy art, so I found that the homework didn't really feel like hw but a really nice break from other classes! You do learn different techniques, but I think that the intellectual\/philosophical discussions were what made the class more insightful."
