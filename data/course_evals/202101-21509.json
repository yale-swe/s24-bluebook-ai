The topics are genuinely fascinating, and Miki explains everything so clearly and makes class sessions enjoyable. Exams were very fair, and while the p-sets were lengthy and included quite a bit of computation, the peer tutors are helpful.",

It did, however, convince me to take more high level proof based math, but this class does not teach those skills. I also think that the course depends a lot on who leads your section, so shop it and make sure that you will enjoy learning from them and their teaching style matches how you best learn math.",
