                "This course was very challenging for me. Transitioning from small-group, application-based calculus in high school to large-group, theory-based calculus in college was a big jump that I did not expect to encounter. I confronted a huge learning curve of transferring high school math skills into developing college math skills. I made frequent use of peer tutoring, review sessions, online resources, and office hours, and with the help of my FGLI mentor, made some changes to help me improve in the course. However, I did not feel incredibly supported by the math department throughout this process, save for my classmates and peer tutors. This is frustrating because many students in this course have taken the high school equivalent of this course before resulting in almost no curve which doesn't leave much space for students who haven't taken Calculus BC, or haven't had those opportunities, to be successful through developing their skills. I don't think the curve that weights the second midterm is sufficient in this regard. I feel more confident in my problem-solving skills overall as a result, and am glad to have taken this course.",

            "comments": [
                "This course offers a lot of content in a short span of time  I've learned a lot! Often, however, the lessons and topics feel a bit disjointed  it would be great to include some transitional elements so that we can better understand how the topics connect to one another. Additionally, the lack of support from the math department for students who have not taken the equivalent of this course before is disappointing. While I can't say enough about the peer tutors  they are INCREDIBLE  it should not fall to other students to teach course material that wasn't taught in class. There was also a lot of discrepancy between the instructors of the course, so much so that it was affecting students' learning strategies and understanding of the material as a whole.\r\n\r\nHowever, something this course did well was provide strong online resources (videos, concept checks, and explorations) that were able to help support students in their learning. personally, I use these frequently when I prepare for tests. Also, while my instructor's teaching style didn't exactly fit my own, my instructor was a wonderful human being who knew me by name and made me feel incredibly welcome to ask questions about any topic in or beyond the course.",
                "Like most of the math department this course gives an unreasonable amount of work on the psets, office hours are good though",
                "Overall very strong course, but the sections sometimes felt too slow paced and not super helpful.",
                "From what I have heard from crowd sourcing and also through my personal experience is that the biggest detriment to this class is that is taught majority by graduate students. This made it very difficult for me to learn because they seemed to struggle with simplifying concepts into teaching people with poor backgrounds in mathematics.",
                "I think one of the weaknesses is the disparity between sections, since some friends from other sections received helpful review materials (like worksheets, etc) and sometimes even learned concepts that we didn't learn in class, so I had to invest more outside-of-class time to catch up with my classmates.",
                "Perhaps better exploration videos before class",
                "Have some handouts instead of doing everything on the board.",
                "Strengths: The majority of the content was explained as to why certain things happened, the purpose behind each aspect, etc. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Explorations did not help too much with my learning, and the order of learning content was a little awkward. For example, like doing polar coordinates and areas at the very end, while we did approximations of areas at the very beginning.",
                "Strengths- problem sets and textbook were helpful for learning the material\r\nWeaknesses- didnt go into the intuition behind concepts so you were left to memorize it instead, didnt get enough practice with each concept in class- would like to have more practice problems reviewed in class",
                "Strengths- or is a great professor, definitely attend his office hours if you have the chance. He is very real about what material is going to be useful in the long run and will help you out. The peer tutoring hours for this class were very well organized and super fun, highly recommend. Lots of support.\r\nWeaknesses- easy to fall behind if you miss a day, lots of work",
                "The strengths of this course are the outside resources provided to understand the material -- nothing was more helpful than peer tutoring and office hours. The concept checks and videos were also extremely useful in preparing for exams. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, the course didn't do a very good job of introducing new material. The explorations were only surface level basics of the new material, but they didn't provide realistic practice problems for us to get started on. It would be preferable if there were more in-depth explanations as the course progressed because different professors have different ways of approaching new material, so a standard foundation would be helpful.",
                "This course does well in how it covers many topics and we do not repeat content often, thus engaging the students and continually pushing them. However I also believe that lots of the topics are quite unrelated to one another and so it is not very easy to completely change topics between lectures."

                "Yes, it will allow them to form strong foundation in calculus that could be a prereq. or, sometimes, essential for understanding courses later in one's Yale career. It is a very fun class and the rigor is moderate.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the teachers are accessible and peer tutors are extremely helpful in solving problems. I would also say that it's essential to have a strong peer support system to study together. This course is not one that can be easily done individually unless you have a strong background in calculus 2 already.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students as it seems to be a hidden gem in the maths courses which is good at developing knowledge and covering new topics, without being too high level or too fast pace."
