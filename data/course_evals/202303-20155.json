                "a bunch of case studies regarding intelligence agencies from past to present, presented under various overarching concepts",
                "This course was an interesting way to think about international relations. As a political science major, adding the intelligence aspect to my studies really allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of politics.",
                "The course gave me some in depth insight into what the intelligence community looks like while evaluating many controversies and contemporary issues in foreign policy. I was already very familiar with some of the topics in the course, but I feel that I certainly learned more than what I knew before.",
                "comprehensive review of major intelligence events in U.S. history; overview of the different intelligence mechanisms in the United States; exercises to investigate my understandings of intelligence/policy and opportunities to consider my own positions & choices in difficult situations",

                "This was an incredibly interesting survey of the American world of intelligence, both in terms of how the agencies operate and how the IC has functioned around recent events.",

                "I learned a fair amount about recent American military history, the overarching structure of the intelligence community in the US, various components of what constitutes intelligence, and the general form of intelligence memos. Worth noting all this information cAme at a pretty slanted perspective.",

                "I learned a lot about the field of intelligence, and it's really given me a new lens through which to view current and historical events. The course wasn't necessarily about learning facts, but more about learning how to think about intelligence questions, which often have lots of ambiguity.",
                "The course provides a great overview of the U.S. intelligence community (IC), its history, and many of its challenges. We reviewed several foundational case studies of intelligence failures (including Pearl Harbor, 9/11, and Iraq WMDs) and discussed different facets of intelligence, from open source to covert and clandestine action, interrogations, cyber espionage, the role of AI, etc. The class was also highly interactive for a lecture, helping me learn to think like an intelligence analyst. CIA, FBI, etc. used to be acronyms that didn't really mean much to me, but I now feel like I have a much better grasp what they actually do.",
                "I feel I gained a signficiant degree of knowledge regarding the operations of the intelligence community, the manner in which they operate with other agencies and how they operate within the wider governmental sphere as a whole. We learned a fair bit about how to analyze swathes of information and how certain manners of handling info can lead to wide-scale failure. Certainly an introductory course, but I felt I left with a solid understanding of the basics and an understanding of how to learn more.",
                "Gained better understanding of the US intelligence community and the way it functions. Learned historical contexts for the development of the intelligence field and some of its decisions over the 20th and 21st centuries. Developed critical thinking skills specifically tailored to intelligence problems and the unique challenges they present.",

I developed my ability to read large amounts of text and pull important information from it. I also learned how to think critically about what I would do as a world leader when faced with difficult/dangerous situations.",

                "The lectures were pretty confusing and it wasn't my favorite",
                "Strengths: Ted is an excellent lecturer, and the course is super interesting knowledge.\r\nWeaknesses: The Sections were extremely different depending on your TA, and grading was also very different.",
                "Strength: professor has a lot of relevant experience, can give modern insights to questions; Weakness: your grades depend on your TF - some are egregiously pedantic, others are more willing to give A/A-s on papers, so it does get a bit unfair and you have to get lucky with your section.",
                "This course was great but the material is so poorly organized.",
                "Strengths: Great professor, great TA, readings are manageable, lectures are interesting (but I think they could go into perhaps even more depth)\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been good if Professor Wittenstein went more in depth into his own experiences. he mentioned his involvement in some of the stuff in the syllabus, but I would have been fascinated to hear more about his personal experiences navigating the IC etc. (obviously there is a lot he cannot say, but I am sure he could have said more)",
                "strengths: engaging lecture & section both; very interesting subject material; hugely knowledgeable instructor; large lecture but still felt like a class family\r\nweaknesses: not very detailed feedback on midterm to better prepare for final",
                "Sections were the real strength of the class, but lectures would sometimes be too long (could be shortened or kept more engaging in the future).",
                "This course brought some amazing speakers and offered a high level of engagement with student.  Andy Makridis and Bridge Colby especially were excellent speakers.  I also appreciated how we immediately pivoted to analyze the situation in Gaza as soon as it happened.  It made the class feel in tuned and applicable to current events.",
                "This was an excellent course, exemplified by its high enrollment and high attendance. Professor Wittenstein's lectures were extremely engaging and the teaching fellows were all excellent.",
                "I think the class and section are great but I think that lectures rely too much on background so without having read all the readings in detail it is hard to keep up with the lectures.",
                "Strengths: covers a lot of content. Wittensteins personal history gives him a ton of credibility, and allows him to bring in super interesting questions. Can be as academically rigorous (or not) as you want. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: assigned so much reading that it was really difficult to keep up, even if you wanted. Was pretty easy to check out of the lecture.",
                "Strengths - expectations clear, slides helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - not much feedback/explanation on graded work",
                "This was a great class. My TA and section were excellent, as was professor Wittenstien. My only recommendation would be to change the reading. For example, giving us the entire 9/11 briefing is too much to feasibly read from tuesday to thursday.",
                "No weaknesses. This class is incredibly fun, interesting, and engaging.",
                "I wish the class covered a basic foundation of each historical event before delving into how intelligence played a role. I felt like we jumped into the material which is hard to grasp when you dont have prior knowledge",
                "I think the pace and structure of the course was great. It was organized thematically instead of chronologically, which made it feel like more of a course in thinking than just recounting events. The lectures were always engaging, and the reading was interesting. Sometimes, I felt like some of the readings were a little disconnected and that I was missing other context that might have been useful. I also thought that the final exam essays were really long.",
                "Strengths: The lecturesthey were very information-dense without ever feeling overwhelming, and Prof. Wittenstein is quite an engaging lecturer. Some of the readings (the 9/11 Commission and Senate Torture Commission reports in particular) are also extremely interesting. I also appreciated how the class pushed us to apply lessons from the history of intelligence to current events and problems in intelligence. I also really appreciated all of the speaker events that Prof. Wittenstein invited us to, which helped me learn more from practitioners. \r\n\r\nThe readings could've maybe been cut down, but that's a minor flaw.",
                "Strengths: well-organized; passionate instructor who knows the field inside and out; mixture of historical examples and present day issues; manageable workload and straightforward exams (no tricks)\r\nWeaknesses: lots of material on the lecture slides, so taking full notes during class can be difficult if you're not quick; sometimes difficult to figure out how to meet with Prof. Wittenstein for office hours",
                "This course is WONDERFUL!!",
                "Interesting content. Love the memos",
                "I really enjoyed the material!",
                "The content of the course was incredible and all very helpful in my understanding of intelligence. I loved all of the lectures and section because the professor was great and the content was fascinating. One weakness was that I wish there was more guidance on the expectations of what a good intelligence memorandum would have looked like.",
                "I think the course is well structured, and the professor always kept us up to date with any syllabus changes. His lectures were generally well-paced, not too fast nor too slow. I do think some of the acronyms and topics become convoluted and confusing, but that is the nature of the subject matter since intelligence is such a big topic.",
                "I didnt really enjoy the lectures, as I feel they could have been shorter. Also, the sections seemed a bit forced and not necessary for my understanding of the material.",

                "This course is not a gut. Focus up.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in the theoretical side of intelligence. A lot of the class was a little too theoretical and some of the case studies were less interesting to me, however, if you engage with this course you will learn a lot.",
                "Yes, I would totally recommend.",
                "please read through the syllabus thoroughly and gauge whether you will enjoy the topic for the most part beforehand. you can't really tell this just by going to the first 2 classes during add/drop period. some friends and I agreed that the course just got a bit boring later on, because it turned out we weren't really engaged in the nitty gritty details of what intelligence does.",
                "Yes, this course is super interesting and had a lot of great guest speakers. I would recommend for all those who are tangentially interested in international affairs and politics.",
                "Yes. This is a fun course especially if you are very interested in foreign policy. Lectures somewhat optional but I would recommend going. Assessments are fair and actually make you think. Well designed course. My TA was also excellent (Sinclair)",
                "if the title and summary of this course sound interesting to you, I'd go for it - lecturer and section leaders make the class very engaging",
                "Absolutely! I would take this class again just for my TF - Jarek. He was a wonderful man, who had a unique ability to make section exciting for all of us, no matter our backgrounds.",
                "Absolutely! Excellent class for any Yale student looking to get an insight into modern geopolitics.",
                "Absolutely. Whether you're a global affairs major or not, this is an extremely interesting topic and Professor Wittenstein is one of the most qualified people to speak on it.",

                "yes, amazing course! Prof is incredible, and workload is relatively low",
                "Yes I would. I think the class is perhaps a little overhyped, but its great as a fifth class. Pretty interesting, even if you disagree with some of the stuff thats taught. Super easy, and low required engagement if you get swamped.",
                "Yes, if they were interested in an intro course in American foreign policy",
                "Absolutely - it is the best class I have taken so far at Yale. You learn about a field you likely otherwise would not have encountered and discuss very interesting case studies and current intelligence questions and tensions.",
                "Yes! Great class if you are interested in the subject.",
                "Absolutely. Best class at Yale.",
                "Yes, its a fun and interesting course.",
                "Yes If they have an interest in the intersection of intelligence and historical events",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It has totally shaped the way I think about global affairs, and I'll continue to carry a lot of what I learned throughout my life as I process world events. The reading is a little bit heavy, but I genuinely thought most of it was really interesting.",
                "Yes! It's packed with relevant information on intelligence and is highly engaging without being stressful. I took the class without any intention of going into a career in intelligence and now am considering doing so much more strongly.",
                "This class was excellent. At first, I was not sure how I felt about it -- the first few classes moved fairly slowly, and covered a lot of relatively intuitive information. However, the lectures eventually became excellent. Many lectures within the middle and toward the end of the semester covered incredibly fascinating information and were incredibly engaging -- after understanding basic concepts regarding intelligence collection and the intelligence community, you are consistently made to consider the moral implications of various past intelligence cases, assessing not only its relative degree of success or failure, but also the societal cost in achieving that end. The lectures in my opinion lived up to their reputation, but the real delight was my TF in section. I felt extraordinarily lucky to have a person of such depth and caliber able to guide smaller group discussions and force each of us to provide our own assessments of course material, to leverage any disagreement against Prof. Wittenstein's perspectives, and to defend our learned opinions in the context of continual group conversation. The assessments were similarly rewarding -- given a frame of a few days, we ultimately had to present and argue our interpretation of the provided prompts, defending it in a manner consistent with how we would in class. This class was incredibly engaging and rewarding, lived up to its popularity, and is worth giving a chance.",
                "Would definitely recommend. I learned a lot about the intelligence community and the types of issues presented to officials who are responsible for intelligence decisions. I also found the information and analytical skills learned in this class extremely applicable to modern scenarios and current affairs, making it a great foundational course for anyone interested in pursing a career in intelligence or intelligence-adjacent fields, or generally for anyone who wants to analyze the news and US decision making more closely. Ted is a great professor who is both passionate and extremely knowledgeable about what he's teaching, and it allows him to bring a lot of personal experience to the course in a way that makes it super engaging. He was always willing to reorganize his syllabus to account for current events or changes in the world, and that made the class feel really present and in-tune to the outside world. Assignments are more than manageable and extremely straightforward, and I never felt overwhelmed by the work. Exams are the same, and structured in a way that makes it really easy to do well. A word of warning, though - the take-home exams always require more time than Ted tells you they do. He says you should be able to complete them in a couple hours max, but to actually properly answer the prompts at the right word length and with references to readings, you definitely need to carve out more time than he suggests that you do. The exams are still totally manageable, you just can't wait until the last minute.",
                "Yes definitely! I have a totally different perspective on a lot of current affairs and become a lot more prudent in my own decision making process. It also probes me to think about privacy and state surveillance, and level of confidence certain policies or speeches are based on.",
                "It's a little boring in the beginning, but the information at the beginning is important to understand the interesting topics later. There is also a considerable amount of work for the midterm/especially the final exam. Lots of readings that you need to do in order to do well on those assignments.",
                "Yes! The class was amazing",
                "Yes! An amazing class with an amazing teaching team.",
                "Yes!",
                "YES! Coming from a non-Global person, this course was fascinating. Workload was not high,  but you definitely have to put effort into the assignments to get an A. Great lectures. Really interesting material. Would definitely recommend.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class. It has been by far my favorite class that I've taken at Yale because I feel like I've learned so much. The topics, though often difficult, were all presented in a very approachable way. This class helped me clarify my career aspirations and become a better writer and reader. It also helps to exercise all of the critical thinking skills that are necessary in actually working in intelligence.",
                "Yes, this course is very interesting. It is definitely taught from a pro-US government perspective.",
                "Absolutely, super engaging and interesting.",
                "Yes, I would if the student has an interest in foreign relations and is comfortable speculating about intentions and reasons for successes/failures. The take-home midterm and final essays are heftier than I expected, so be prepared to have to spend a few hours on them. It was doable, but I went in thinking they would not be so time-intensive.",
                "As a straightforward class yes, but not really as a deeply rewarding educational experience.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to students of all majors, as the preservation of national and international security is of the utmost importance this century.",
                "Yes, really good class that had enough of a workload to challenge you and \"force\" you to learn/ engage w the material, but it also wasn't crushing or stressful."
