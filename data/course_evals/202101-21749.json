Learning and teaching photography over zoom is no easy task, and despite these challenges, this course was great! The lectures were engaging, the critiques were really helpful, and I learned so much while enjoying the process.",
                "AMAZING CLASS. TAKE IT. Having this over zoom was obviously not ideal, but I really loved this class. Ted is AMAZING. He is the most chill professor ever. Majority of my class was first time photographers and Ted never made us feel dumb. Taking photos in new haven was such a great way to explore parts of the city I had never seen and to meet so many new people. I learnt so much and really fell in love with photography.",

Most people in my seminar had no prior experience with photography so it was a great learning environment and we all helped each other out. Critiques were also well-facilitated, and I learned to hone my skills on a particular photo subject by the end of the course.",

Its entirely what you make of it, you can put in as much work as you want to get out of it. Photography is such a great medium to explore new places and meet people and this class will teach you everything from the technical aspects to just how to think about your photography and want you want to say through your photos. Ted is the best professor, he is so chill and just always so willing to help in whatever way you need.",
