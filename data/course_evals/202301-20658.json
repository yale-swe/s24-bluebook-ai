            "comments": [
                "Strengths: material was explained clearly in class, topics covered were interesting and built on each other. Weaknesses: a lot of lecture time was spent working through long examples, and because of the layout of the room, everything had to be copied twice, which effectively gave us half the time we would have had. There was also no syllabus published, which was inconvenient at times.",
                "strengths: pretty light workload\r\nweaknesses: professor is quite unengaging, lack of things you usually see in a class like communication, don't even think we had a syllabus, also final went terribly, most ppl couldn't finish at all",
                "Honestly, it needs to be completely reworked. The pace of the course should be faster, there should be more emphasis on the proof side because realistically right now it serves as just a slower more tedious version of the ENAS ODE and PDE class. Also, homework assignments should be graded and submitted online and there should be more than 1 ULA.",
                "The strength of the course was that the Professor is very experienced and therefore explained the material very well. The real weakness is that the content can be very dry at times and also very confusing, so you just sort of have to go with the flow even when things do not seem to make complete sense.",
                "The content of the course is clearly well-established and fundamental, but it is taught ineffectively. Our professor walked between two whiteboards every class, copying down what was on one to the other. This halved the useful time we spent in class, leaving us with many uncovered topics at the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: solving diffeqs is fun, it's kind of like sudoku or crossword / how well you do is proportional to how much you practice and that's it. There's not much brain behind the class, just hard work. But you do learn a lot of interesting historical background on some of the diffeqs while reading the book, and it's also very useful for other classes like Physics. Weaknesses: impossible to finish the exams on time (both midterms were 50 minutes in-class), un-engaging and very boring lectures because the professor kept rewriting everything on the second board, forced to print out PSets instead of using Gradescope. I also wish we got to cover systems of diffeqs which are a very important topic that I will now likely have to self-study over Summer because the class couldn't get to it in time.",
                "By the end of the class I did feel like I knew how to do most differential equations. Professor Moncrief was nice and pretty fair. Sometimes, however, he would skip over a lot of steps in class when doing example problems, and so I wished that he would go into a little more detail on how to fully complete a problem.",
                "The lectures were not engaging.",
                "Strength: The content itself is very straight-forward and the problem sets are taken directly from the textbook. \r\nWeaknesses: 1) There is very little communication about the grading distribution, dates of the midterms, and generally about the course until very last minute because Professor Moncrief does not use Canvas regularly to make any announcements. He would tell us the dates of the midterm the week before in-class, making it hard to plan out the semester if you have multiple exams and you would also completely miss the announcement if you happen to miss that class. 2) The midterms are quite difficult, especially because there are so many more questions than it is possible to finish in an hour. Everyone looked quite frazzled by the end of each exam. 3) This is not a weakness for the professor but for the registrar/admin. The room was way too small for the class. ODE is a pretty foundational course for many different majors and in every lecture, people were standing or sitting on the floor in the way back of the room without a desk, pulling chairs from different rooms etc.",
                "Just read the textbook by yourself. Lectures were super boring. The professor wrote everything twice because there were two whiteboard on opposite ends of the room.",
                "Good course but pace was a bit slow, could have had more on syllabus",
                "I would have appreciated if more information had been posted to the canvas page (including a syllabus, exam dates and topics, and other materials), and if we had used online submission platforms for problem sets like gradescope. Printing and delivering problem sets proved to be an enormous hassle.",
                "This class is a nightmare. No syllabus was provided (which I am pretty sure goes against Yale policy). Lectures are boring and it is difficult to understand his handwriting.",
                "The main strength of the course is that it closely follows the textbook so it is very easy to study for exams and review information. Not to be rude, the main weakness of the course was Professor Moncrief, whom I had trouble hearing during lectures. I had a very hard time engaging with his lectures, that went very slowly, even though I felt like I was not getting much out of them.",
                "Strengths: Pretty chill, professor is cool\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Had to submit on paper which was inconvenient for everyone (at this point everyone else uses either Canvas or Gradescope)",
                "Lectures need vast improvement. Psets need more thought.",
                "The course included great supplemental resources, with the textbook explaining all necessary course material, and videos also being available for developing understanding. Another strength of the course was its organization, as the introduction of topics was structured for a smoother understanding.\r\nA weakness of the course is that there was less chance for engagement, partially due to the amount of content. Having more opportunities for doing practice problems during lecture, and doing test practice could be helpful."

It's more trouble than its worth and you will regret having taken this class, during classtime and especially during the exams.\r\n\r\nIf an administrator sat in on this class they would be shocked that this was a class taught at Yale University. I wonder whether I should've just taken the course another local New Haven college or online.",
                "Only if you're really interested in ODEs or need it for some requirement. I didn't need the course for anything and took it as a 5th credit however this was not the wisest decision. The material gets harder as you progress and the midterm is basically a speed run which can be very stressful even if you know all the material going in. Lectures weren't super exciting as Professor Montcrief usually just writes notes from a notepad onto the board for you to take down and learn the material. I would say don't take the course if you do not really need to.",
                "I would recommend this in so far as it is fundamental. But maybe consider taking another course in differential equations if it is on offer.",
                "It is a very nice non-proof-based math course with weekly PSETs. Prof. Moncrief's two exams were fair--but hard--because they took much longer than the allotted time in class (i.e. around 60 min) so they are hard to finish within time.",
                "Only if you need it for the major.",
                "Not really unless a different professor is teaching it, because you'll have to teach yourself the material and you probably won't like this class and won't go to lecture, and then you won't do that well on exams because it's just impossible to finish them in time.",
                "If you need a math credit or are interested in ODEs then it is a pretty chill way to learn about it. I enjoyed having the chance to do some computational math after a lot of proof-based classes.",
                "No",
                "No, take 194 or just learn it by yourself. The textbook Boyce Di Prima is easily accessible and basically everybody uses it. It's probably just best if you self learn.",
                "Generally its taken as a less intensive math class as a way to fulfill a requirement. If youre looking for that, this will do the job. Not too challenging and honestly pretty interesting. At times instruction was a little unclear but for the most part, it was self-explanatory and was made clear by the professor. I think there were some practical issues with the course (2 whiteboards) which really slowed down the learning but that was out of the Professors control, and I imagine that will be taken care of.",
                "I found myself not always attending lecture because it was either difficult to understand the professor or I wasn't sure of what material would be covered in class. I was just a bit lost during the course. For those reasons, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this class for students who are trying to develop a rigorous understanding of differential equations. Although, for students who are interested in some of the aspects of differential equations (perhaps more so on the analytic rather than computational side) this might be a better choice than the ENAS class.",
                "Do not take this class unless you have to for your major.",
                "Yes, if Professor Moncrief is not teaching it.",
                "Yeah go for it! It's not a class you'll remember in ten years, but it's useful for a lot of things and it has a chill workload. I took this as a fifth class when a different one I wanted ended up conflicting, and I don't regret my decision. It was a nice way to brush up on calculus in a low-stress environment. Exams are open-book and open-note with integrals written on the board (though that didn't keep the second exam from being the only BRUTAL part of the class - a total curveball). I'm still optimistic that there was a generous curve, and combined with the homeworks being very easy to check (you can just plug your solution back into the differential equation) it's not hard at all to do well in the class. Professor Moncrief is also a legend, you gotta go to his lectures. So much deadpan humor. You won't regret it.",
                "Not unless you need it. Homework is lots and lots of tedious algebra with little insight. Lectures are worse than what you'll find on YouTube.",
