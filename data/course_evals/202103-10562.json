                "The course needs better organization to facilitate student-learning, including greater structure and learning goals. Each lecture should have a specific topic that we are going to learn about. The course felt as if it was more just talking about subjects without instruction as to what content we were actually supposed to learn about. The course left me feeling confused after each lecture, never knowing what subjects would be on a test\/quiz, and made me unsure as to whether I truly gained any neurobiology expertise from the course as I enter the NSCI major.",
                "Strengths \r\n- really interesting material with good lecturers \r\n- very applicable to real life \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- smaller discussion sections might have been more conducive to being engaged\/asking questions (there was only 1 discussion section each week, so it was basically like another lecture taught by a TA)\r\n- the grading is super stressful...the 1st 2 exams are so hard that almost everyone chooses to have their final count for their entire grade, but that puts so much stress\/pressure on that one test \r\n- I would've really liked PSETs and\/or more practice problems to gauge my understanding of the course material throughout the semester + to better prepare for the exams...no homework made the course less work in general, but a lot of high-stress studying right around exams, especially the final",
                "This course's only strength was the exam format. Open note and online was really helpful and efficient. The class had a lot of weaknesses. The professors were great people, absolute geniuses but not great at teaching. I walked into class understanding what was going on, and I left class confused about things I thought i understood already. This class would also benefit from problem sets or something to buffer the grades. 2 exams and a final is a bit tough.",
                "Because there is no homework, no one really reviews the material until the week before the exam, and suddenly everyone is super stressed. I would also appreciate more office hours with the professors, or having the professors come to the review sessions.",
                "Strengths were how depth we got into each topic and weekly discussion sections. Weaknesses were how our final grade was based solely on our performance on exams, the lack of overlap between exam questions and topics covered in class, the lack of transparency on what topics to know for the exam and the unresponsiveness of the professors regarding exam regrading.",
                "Strengths: TA Kathy Zhang and Peer Tutor Rebecca del Rio were so helpful in explaining everything.  \r\nWeaknesses: The professors sometimes made the material seem so out of reach to understand by not explaining things in the clearest way-- until I went to Kathy's discussion sections and Rebecca's office hours I didn't realize that this material is actually not that complicated.",
                "I think the course could use an initial overview to help students understand where we are going because I found it hard to connect some of the lectures.",
                "This course packs a lot of information. It was fantastic for neuro majors who are interested in the subject matter. Both professors were very good lecturers and yo can tell they really are passionate about this subject. However, there should be short homework assignments for this class. There is just so much content and no feedback on how students are performing in the class until the exams and by that time its too late to make up a whole unit of material.",
                "I don't think grades should rely on just two exams and a long final. There is too much content crammed into each exam. Perhaps three midterms in addition to a final, or monthly assessments could help. \r\nThe first part of the course was taught much less clearly than the rest of the course. If the first part concerning physics was taught with the whiteboard system, students would not have to focus so much on drawing while the professor is lecturing. \r\n\r\nThis course does cover a lot of difficult material in a small amount of time, but the instruction for the second half of the course is very clear.",
                "Strengths: the material is interesting, and ultimately, I learned a lot about neuroscience. The TFs and peer tutor were supportive.\r\nWeaknesses: The course felt extremely disorganized. Office hours with the professors were extremely difficult to get. The teaching style felt very scattered as often times, it was a lot of talking but without concrete diagram. There are no slides, so when the professor puts up a picture of a brain or does a demo, it is really difficult to follow, and not everything is posted on Canvas in a timely fashioned. The midterms were insanely difficult, which is fine. But, they take place on weekends during brunch hours, which meant I had to skip a meal for the exams. I wish that there were more consistent problem sets that factor into the grade rather than only the exams, and psets would help us understand the material better.",
                "Very organized class",
                "If there were regular quizzes or problem sets or anything that helped us to engage with the material more than just in lecture that would have been helpful.",
                "I really liked how broad this course was",
                "I'm having a hard time thinking of strengths for this course. The material was taught in a way that was very unorganized and difficult to understand, and the professors were very unaccommodating. At the beginning of the year I was very sick with strep throat and had to miss a few classes. Once I got better I emailed Prof. Forscher to see if I could schedule a meeting with him to go over the material I missed and he said no just get the notes from someone else in class. I know several other people who attempted to schedule meetings with the professors throughout the semester only to be turned away. The tests frequently featured material that was never covered in class, which is why the averages on exams were under 70%, and the exams are 100% of your grade. The midterms were timed exams given on Saturday and Sunday midday, which I'm pretty sure is against Yale policy. Overall, I found that this class was not well taught and the professors were extremely unhelpful.",
                "Wouldve liked to see more contemporary systems work, with more guest lectures in systems (eg Nick Turke-Browne on hippocampus and memory). I also think that the class covers a slightly older perspective of neuroscience and teaches it as canonical, when I wouldve liked to hear more broad perspective of the systems we discussed. While it isnt an intro class, it sometimes felt like one given the broad array of systems we covered in the class.",
                "I appreciated the worksheets that accompanied all the lectures, though clothe first unit of class went quite fast and required many diagrams that were confusing in notes.",
                "Strengths: topic is extremely interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: There is so much to learn within one semester and the professors are quite chaotic in how they teach it. It is nearly impossible to retain all the information.",
                "The strengths are that the TA review sessions each week were super helpful, but this was because the class was very confusing in the first half. I think the first half assumed a lot of basic electrophysiological knowledge which made it hard to understand what the prof was saying.",
                "Lectures can begin with how the instructor want to organize the materials and give a guide to key points we need to focus.",
                "This course is super interesting and covers a lot of course material. A strength of this course was the section for the first half of the course. Both professors really know what they are talking about."

                "I think the material is interesting but I am hesitant to recommend this course because of its poor structure. It's either 50% of2 midterms or 100% of the final so the grade has a possibility of not reflecting the students understanding of the material.",
                "I would not recommend it as an elective as it is very difficult. If you are a neuroscience major, I would recommend waiting until your junior or senior year to take the course.",
                "I would not recommend this course if you didn't have to take it. The material was interesting, but it felt poorly taught. The concepts were disorganized and hard to put together.",

                "Do not take this class unless it is required by your major. I struggled to follow along during lecture because there were never any slides and it felt disorganized, but then when I reached out to try to get help outside of lecture it was basically nonexistent. The exams were on the weekend which was pretty disrespectful and my grade ended up being 100% determined by my final which was very stressful.",
                "Yes! I learned so much by taking this course",
                "definitely do not take this class.  I am a neuroscience major, and I really enjoy the major, but this class made me question whether I should switch majors. I don't know a single person that enjoyed this class. The material was not well taught, the professors were not receptive to questions at all, actively avoided meeting with students, and were extremely unaccommodating even in times of COVID. For example, when people would ask Prof. Forscher questions in class, instead of answering or reexplaining he would tell them to look at their notes and it would make sense. At the beginning of the semester when I was sick with strep throat and had to miss class, I asked to meet with Prof. Forscher to go over the material I missed and he told me no, just get the notes from a classmate. One of my classmates had to email Prof. Keshisian 3 times to set up a meeting with him before one of our exams, and then he didn't even show up to the meeting. The exams were very difficult, featured material that we were never taught, and were held on the weekends. I have nothing positive to say about this class, do everything you can to avoid it.",
                "Yes, although I think theres more information in human brain.",
                "I really enjoyed the material but the exams were a bit terrifying. Go into it with an open mind and meet with various resources to make sure you understand the material.",
                "The course is very disorganized in some ways, because the theme between lectures is not usually clear. The only available materials are handouts, some of which are helpful, and the diagrams created in lecture. The textbook is sometimes helpful, but you read that on your own time. It is very hard to keep track of what in the handouts was covered and what was not. There is also no review session for the final. Professors lectured with the occasional diagrams which made it hard to follow. The course is very well taught, the materials are limited and exams are on weekends which is inconsiderate.",
