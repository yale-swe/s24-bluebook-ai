    "No weaknesses come to mind. The course is thoughtfully taught and utilizes a variety of methods and activities to engage us and help us learn. The teachers are very receptive to our feedback. We get a lot of individual attention, being that it is such a small class.",
    "This course's only weakness is the sheer amount of effort that has to be given to learning the language. It is taught incredibly well. Especially in this second half of intensive, we had the opportunity to learn from small excerpts of literature, songs, and short stories. I am definitely sad that this course is over.",
    "Strength: Absolutely wonderful faculty, who really care about their students. \r\n(Very Minor) Weakness: We had the same small groups for everything; might be fun to switch things up a little bit more often.",
    "This course was taught by great instructors who very much engaged with students. They were extremely knowledgeable and fun. Overall wonderful experience. Not really any cons- maybe that we could learn a bit more vocab but it's intensive so you have to mostly focus on grammar.",
    "This is one of the best language courses I have ever taken."

    "Absolutely. It's a wonderful and effective way to learn Russian. The pace is good to learn quickly.",

    "Anyone who wants to learn Russian, this will really teach you the langauge. It is well worth the work.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. Doing the intensive track really immerses you in the language, which helps the learning process. The professors are also worth taking the course for.",
    "Definitely take it if youre interested in Russian! The teachers are awesome and the workload is very reasonable.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Russian you have to take it intensively, if only because Constantine is a wonderful instructor. If you took elementary, then intermediate is a no brainer.",
    "Yes, anyone interested in learning Russian."
