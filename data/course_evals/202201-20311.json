It was really nice that the scope of the class extended beyond just films to include discussions of production companies, actor\/actresses lives, setting, fashion, and etc. I also appreciate that we did not gloss over so many of the problematic events and stereotypes of classical Hollywood. This was my favorite class of this semester.",
                "I learned about the history of the Classical Hollywood era, film censorship, and movie trends. I got to watch some incredible films that I might have otherwise not seen and comment on them. I received some experience in film analysis and research for my weekly film diary entries and my two papers. I learned to appreciate the subtle details and artistic choices made by filmmakers, especially in relation to their revelations about the characters, settings, or deeper messages.",

This was one of the most phenomenal classes at Yale and if I could do it all over again, I would! The assignments were challenging and fun, and I was excited to complete them every time!",
                "I developed key writing skills, fostered by feedback from TFs on papers and diaries, as well as experience analyzing films as textual mediums. For each film we wrote diary entrie with initial responses and this was helpful in articulating feelings into words. This was then further explored in papers, and my intertextual comparison skills were tested and reinforced. Overall, I learned more about Classical Hollywood, in both the good and the bad.",
                "This is the best class I've taken at Yale so far. I was never particularly excited about film, but this class exponentially increased my interest. I was able to watch classic films that I would have never watched (or knew) before this class. I have a greater respect for film-making, understand the issues in the industry that persist today, and appreciate the art a lot more.",

There aren't many weaknesses, but if I had to list one, I think the way the content was organized didn't make that much sense to me; it wasn't organized by genre or time period (one-off weeks aside).",

                "Strengths: the lectures are incredible---some of the best I've been to in all of Yale College--and the films themselves are wonderful. the class feels fun and inviting, and is clearly a labor of love for the professor and the TAs. this is definitely among the best courses I've taken at Yale and it really taught me a lot about film. Writing the film diary and the final paper was some of the most enjoyable writing work I've done at Yale. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish that the grading scale had been published earlier. Don't get me wrong, the class is generously graded with opportunities for extra credit (I think everyone can get an A with a good amount of effort), but the actual grading scale wasn't published until during finals period, and it would have influenced my approach for the class. The grading was also very inconsistent between TAs, with some being much stricter than others. I also wish that there were more available section times to make the class more inclusive to different students (even though obviously the times worked for me as I managed to take the class).",
                "Honestly could not think of any way, shape, or form of how this course could be improved. Perhaps the best structured course I have ever taken in my time at Yale. I was honestly pleasantly shocked by how amazing this course was.",
                "Professor Thomasson is an absolutely amazing instructor. Her lectures were fascinating and engaging and covered a wide breadth of material about Hollywood and different film themes. The films we watched were also very entertaining. No weaknesses.",
                "The overall course structure was fantastic. I really liked weekly lectures and section, with mandatory film screenings on Tuesday and optional screening on your own time. I wish there was a bit more direction of how students with minimal film background can explore their interests on their own. Students were encouraged to watch classical films on their own, but as a student without much prior experience, I didn't really know where to start.",
                "This is an excellent course, and one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
                "This class is incredibly strong and engaging, I can't think of a single weakness. Specifically, the Movie Memory Project was one of the most fulfilling things that I've done at Yale.",
                "strengths: course material about classical Hollywood is just too fascinating; the teaching fellows are excellent and really care about the films we watch; so many fun activities (jeopardy, treasure hunt, etc); the weekly film screenings were a highlight of my semester (it's so great to watch fascinating films on a big screen with other people who react with you)\r\nweakness: the course materials can be made to be more rigorous and intellectually challenging (for example, introducing key film terms at the beginning of the class and making students use these vocabularies in their discussions of films)",
                "I would argue that there is no weakness of this course. This course is probably the most fascinating course I have taken at Yale, and Professor Thomasson is probably the best lecturer I have had (probably the best at Yale). Every week the lectures would be centered around the film of the week, taking into note the history of film at the time, the actors involved, directors, policies, and more. In any case, I was always able to learn a lot because the lectures were spoken like a story, which made them highly engaging.",
                "This is an ABSOLUTELY awesome class! The content is very fun and interesting, the films are all great, and Professor Thomasson and the TAs are all amazing! I honestly don't think there are any weaknesses, this is course is a must-take!",

                "This course is totally unique. It is very intense and immersive: there is always more to check out and watch and read and do if you are interested. This can sometimes feel overwhelming if film studies is not your main focus, but it also makes for a very exciting experience. The instructors all care a great deal so if you are engaged, it will be rewarded with fascinating lectures, in-depth individual feedback, and of course, great films. If you are not engaged, you will be made to feel guilty and\/or out of place.",
                "I only have strengths to comment on. The lectures are incredibly well prepared, giving us insight on both the film of the week as well as the important developments in Hollywood during the time of the film's production and release. In addition to the weekly screenings, Cinephile Fridays gave us ample opportunities to watch and analyze defining films of the period. Discussion sections were prepared to generate thoughtful discussion on the films, as well as relevant trends in Hollywood pertaining to the film of theweek.",
                "Strengths: teaching was amazing. Some of the most dedicated teachers Ive ever met!",
                "Strengths: Professor Thomasson is the best professor that I have ever had. She is a beacon of kindness, and she loves to teach filmsomething that she is obviously very passionate about. She cares so much about her students, and her lectures are simply breathtaking. My focus never left while she was talking. The selection of films were amazing, meaning that all of them taught me something new about the classical period. Professor Thomasson offers extra movies for students to watch, and these were just as good as the featured films (I watched all of them, and Im super glad that I did). There were plenty of opportunities to work on my writing, and I feel like I definitively improved over the course of the semester. I also loved going to watch a new film every Tuesday. I absolutely love this class in every way, and all Yale students should take it. \r\n\r\nWeakness: There is not a lot. This class is crafted in a near-perfect fashionits brilliant. I do feel like section was a bit redundant some weeks, and I wish that Professor Thomassons lectures were just an hour and fifteen minutes twice a week, without section. This is being picky though, and I just wanted lecture to last longer because they were so great. I loved my section leader, but the lecture is where I really fell in love with this course.",
                "I loved the multimedia slides and the many opportunities to engage with the material outside the classroom, via Friday Film Club and bonus questions especially. But more often than not, the lectures felt like they were intended to wash over younot speak to you. Professor Thomasson would share a dozen fascinating details on a single slide but spend no more than 10 seconds with the slide on the screen. We'd sometimes devote nearly 20 minutes of class to watching clips, or even worse, just watching the ending. I lost track of how many movies (that were neither on the primary syllabus of Friday Film Club agenda) were spoiled for no reason other than to contextualize a clip that felt superfluous in the first place. I wish Professor Thomasson found other ways to make the films of this era feel vivid without giving so much class time away to clips and detailed summaries that do less to contextualize the era and more to wash away the magical allure of seeing a film for the first time in all its seemingly spontaneous glory.",
                "Its very well adjusted to student learning. Perhaps there could be more screenings for Cinephile activities.",
                "Strengths: Professor Thomasson and the entire teaching team are very dedicated, kind, encouraging, knowledgeable, and supportive. They're absolutely the best. Every lecture and section is enjoyable. The feedback on each assignment is incredibly helpful. The course is very extensive but well organized and moves at an excellent pace. The assignments are very helpful, and I love the freedom of the essays, where I can write about anything I want. Overall, a fantastic course -- one of my all-time favorite classes at Yale. Also, just being able to watch movies every week is awesome. Weaknesses: None.",
                "this would be an idea for another course, but if there was a course like this for new hollywood era, woah that would be an incredible experience.",
                "The strengths of the course were the professor, TAs, assignments, and chosen film. I absolutely adored Professor Thomasson's clear passion for this course and how serious she was concerning the course material. Both her and the TAs created a well-structured course that taught the students much about film. By not having examinations, Professor Thomasson allowed students to enjoy the course content without the pressures of intense memorization. Rather, students were able to demonstrate their knowledge by writing about subjects they were more passionate about.",
                "Strengths: amazing teaching staff who were always so responsive and kind. Each class was so relaxing and I think this is the most engaged Ive ever been. The class covered so much information but I truly really enjoyed learning everything.",
                "The course was phenomenal. The course material was well-ordered in that each week had a main focus that facilitated a gradual progression through the decades. The required films were excellent, and the optional films provided another opportunity to delve deeper into a particular genre or style. Having the film diary entries be weekly provided some accountability, although it could be helpful to have them due every two weeks or so as opposed to less frequent deadlines. Making PowerPoints available for later viewing might be nice, at least at the end of the semester. However, these details are minor in comparison to my positive experiences with the class.",
                "This course is all strengths is one of my favorite courses at Yale. Only thing I would suggest is moving screenings back to 730",
                "The care that Prof Thomasson and her stellar TAs put into the class is one of the class' biggest strengths. I feel the passion in the lecture hall and in section, which yields such a positive learning environment. \r\n\r\nI'd say the only weakness of the class is how discrete the different lectures can feel. The 40 years of Classical Hollywood are dense, and I wish we had more time in the semester to dig deeper and not just jump around the era.",
                "The strength was absolutely in the faculty. Professor Thomasson and Brian Peterson were some of the most understanding, helpful, and knowledgeable people I've ever met. Professor Thomasson made this course come to life. Every lecture was like listening into a story, and I was captivated for every second of it.",
                "Professor Thomasson is so passionate about the class that it clearly shows in all of her lectures. All of the movies are selected with a clear purpose and having a set time for everyone to watch the weekly film together was helpful and created a very good space to engage with the films. Allowing us to turn in drafts before papers were due was also helpful in providing feedback. Perhaps having a screening time or Zoom to watch the Bonus films would be helpful and allow more students to watch the film (though I know this would add more work\/pressure on Prof and TFs).",
                "Professor Thomasson is incredibly engaged with every single student in the class. I've never been emailed by a Professor who simply wanted to thank me for my work. She also structures the lectures extremely well. Professor Thomasson's lectures are her narrating her slideshows in a screening room in HQ. Every lecture felt like a movie screening. I loved every aspect of the class, from Professor Thomasson's enthusiasm to Team Jeopardy to the writing assignments. Best writing credit at Yale.",
                "Strengths: EVERYTHING! Prof thomasson is the best prof at yale\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none except maybe making more of an effort to understand\/reach out to students with less confidence in writing and helping them"

                "Yes especially if interested in film. Don't come to class with a gut attitude or else your TA will roast you.",
                "This is one of the best courses I have taken my four years at Yale. If you know basically nothing about classical Hollywood like I did it's even better. All of the films we watch are great, Professor Thomasson's lectures are like attending ted talks (in a good way), and the class is really structured in a way to both have students not worry too much about grades while at the same time making sure they seriously engage with the material. So if you're interested at all you should definitely take the course.",
                "100% yes - such amazing films (coming from a STEM major), engaging assignments, and great professor and teaching staff",
                "Absolutely. Take this class while you can, it's amazing and I think some of the films will stick with me for the rest of my life. I learned so much. I would just warn that you should only take the course if you know you can give it some amount of love and dedication, and can watch the films weekly.",
                "YES, this course is a must take for anyone who enjoys movies! The workload is heavy, but it is clearly laid out and fairly consistent throughout the semester. Additionally, the course is designed to allow students to explore the topics that interest them most, rather than having to cram for tests and focus on topics that they don't find interesting.",
                "YES! I took this course as a senior and it became one of my favorite classes ever. I found the writing assignments (film diary, midterm paper, final paper) enjoyable, and there is a lot of available support from Prof. Thomasson and the TFs. This class has been a joy!",
                "Yes! It was a great course and an enjoyable writing credit.",
                "Yes, absolutely.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is even remotely interested in movies, because knowing about the classical Hollywood era can inform how you understand and interact with the movies and other media today.",
                "YES! professor Thomasson and the TFs are amazing and knowledgable people; very manageable workload (only 2 papers and a film diary); classical Hollywood cinema is just too fascinating to not learn about; all of the films we watch are soooo fun and good! Just a really fun rewarding and relatively easy class!",
                "Yes! This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale if not the best. I'm a STEM major and came into this class knowing next to nothing about classic Hollywood and now have such an appreciation for it. Camille is so passionate, knowledgeable, and kind and really brings her love for the topic into every lecture. I was excited to go to the lectures and the film screenings. The movies you watch are absolutely fantastic and Camille's teaching really gives you a new way to look at these films. Even writing the film diaries and papers is not difficult because you have such free reign over what to write about and can write about things you are passionate about. If you have the chance to take this class, do it! You won't regret it.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Professor Thomasson is the best professor I have had and takes time and effort putting together every lecture.",
                "Yes! One of the best courses I've taken at Yale!",
                "YES YES YES Please take it! If you have any interest for film, this is a truly brilliant class, and Professor Thomasson is a gem!",
                "Yes! It's a wonderful course and the only reason you wouldn't take it is if you don't get in!",
                "YES YES YES-- take this class before you graduate!",
                "Yes! The course is very interesting, and you get to watch a lot of classical Hollywood movies. Before taking this course, I thought that classical movies would be boring, but the films that were shown completely blew my mind. The class is highly engaging!",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone and everyone (although it's hard to get in). Students learn a huge amount without ever feeling overwhelmed by work, and Professor Thomasson is an incredibly engaging lecturer who is invested in each and every student's success. The screenings provide an amazing opportunity to see a carefully-curated series of films on the big screen, and the line-up changes frequently based on student feedback. Overall, regardless of major or area of interest, I think anyone would be lucky to take this class.",
                "Yes. As I wrote above, if you are engaged, you will have an amazing experience in this course. The lectures are very captivating, assignments are interesting, the movies are fantastic, both the professor at the TAs are very into teaching. However, it is a very specific vibe, and if you're not into it, you may end up feeling out of place.",
                "Absolutely take this course. I looked forward to going to lecture twice a week--they are incredibly interesting, and Professor Thomasson is an amazing lecturer. Actually getting to watch all of these films in a theater is an experience I will always remember.",
                "YES!!!! Great class! Very interesting yet not too hard. You get to learn a lot about movies and how they are made and why. I look at film differently now. Rather than just focusing on narrative, I can appreciate how the cinematography adds to the experience. Be warned that the class requires a lot of writing that you have to dedicate time to but the TFs are pretty easy on grading :) so that makes it low stress",
                "ABSOLUTELY! I regard this class as the best class that I have ever had the pleasure of taking. I learned so much, and each lecture was so interesting that I didnt want it to end. This is far more than just a writing credit. Do yourself a favor and take this course.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Professor Thomasson is always so supportive and knows what she is teaching so very well.",
                "Definitely. Its a popular class for a reason. Professor Thomason and her TFs are extremely invested in making the classroom an intellectually stimulating and fun environment. The class jeopardies are a blast; the lectures are delivered with an engaging narrative style; and the movies are really just great. Apart from one, I truly felt great pleasure at being exposed to the movies in the class. I probably wouldnt have watched them otherwise. In terms of what I left with, I now have a movie diary that I can always look back on. I also not have a deep love for black-and-white films that literally only exists because of the content and passion present in this class.",
                "Yes, definitely! The teaching team is amazing, and the material is extremely interesting and accessible. I'm not a film major, but I was able to learn so much in the class and keep up with the course. Absolutely fantastic course. A must-take!",
                "Yes, it's a chill class where you get to watch movies and reflect on them! A really great way to get exposed to films you might not otherwise watch, and discover new directors \/ genres.",
                "yep! this is a lecture course suitable for students of all backgrounds",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The teaching staff is very passionate and clearly knowledgeable about the course content. They have created a course tailored to the students' best interest and they care very much about the students. The professor and TAs are incredibly helpful and are more than willing to provide you with guidance if needed. There was never a boring day in this course!",
                "Great Class!!! Highly Recommend",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. The class work and lecture itself is not too demanding, but it is so interesting. I really enjoyed completing all of the assignments and the teaching staff made this class truly enjoyable.",
                "I already have recommended this course to other students. I feel like anyone with even a slight interest in older films will emerge from the course with a deep appreciation for them and a rich history of the period in which they were produced. The professor and TFs make learning and developing original ideas so captivating that students cannot help but be motivated to work hard in the class.",
                "i loved this course. its getting more and more popular every year for good reason. professor thomasson is amazing. we watch such great movies throughout the semester that this class doesnt feel like a chore. 10\/10",
                "Yes definitely! Prof. Thomasson and the TAs are absolute gems!",
                "ABSOLUTELY. It does not matter your major, background with film, or particular artistic interest everyone should take this course.",
                "Absolutely. This class is such a joy to attend and engage with. The films we watch are true classics, and the history we learn is incredibly rich.",
                "Yes, yes YES!!! This is definitely going to be one of my most memorable Yale classes that I will ever take. If you are able to get into this class, I absolutely recommend it as a writing credit and just as a class to deepen your knowledge of the entertainment industry.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material is very interesting and very well taught\/organized. I loved having the film screening time built into my schedule and really enjoyed discussing the films and other material in section.",
                "Yes! Everyone take this course if you can! Even if you aren't particularly interested in film (like I was). You will have to commit time to watch the films and write diary entries about them. Make sure you're prepared to put in the time and effort in them (it IS a writing credit).",
