By reading pilots, listening to Professor Tracy's phenomenal lectures, analyzing scenes, and writing a pilot of my own, I developed a sense of what it takes to write for TVbut better yet, I built up my repertoire as a writer. I was taking a fiction writing course at the same time and notice a massive improvement in my short stories; their narratives became more streamlined, their scenes tighter, and their dialogue punchier. I attribute all of this to Professor Tracy's course. Even if I stick with fiction, I'm so glad I made this foray into screenwriting.",

Professor Tracy is dedicated to helping each student grow as a writer, and his classes contained the perfect blend of lectures, discussions, flash-writing exercises, and writers' rooms. This course is also super helpful if you're hoping to enter the TV-writing business; Prof. Tracy organized Zoom meetings with Yale alumni who are working on upcoming TV shows and frequently gave advice on how to make it in the industry. I wished we could meet more frequently instead of once a week, but that's a necessary evil of most creative writing courses. I wonder what would happen if we'd had assignments due more often (i.e. aside from work for our pilots) and on other days of the week. What if, for example, we had a writing exercise to submit every Wednesday (the way we each wrote a teaser after our writers' room). I worried that after doing the week's work for Monday, I forgot about this course a bit until the next Monday came around. Other than that, though, ENGL 461 was perfect!",

Compared to other TV or film writing courses, this one (and this sequence) really clearly and practically teaches the skills to get a compelling story on the page and prof. Tracy clearly knows what hes doing. Would recommend",

Even if you're not planning to enter the TV industry, this course will revolutionize the way you approach creative writing. Highly, highly recommend!",
