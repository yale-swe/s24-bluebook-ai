                "Strengths: The texts, movies, cortometrajes, and artworks used in the class are really good, as are the major themes of the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: L4 de-emphasizes vocabulary and grammar in place of culture and applying what has been learned already. I have since lost vocabulary and grammar structures from previous courses. Also, I think that the course picks some works that are really generative for thought but we didn't get to discuss them because we had to focus on the technical aspects of production, like film angles or brush strokes. I feel like in both Spanish and English I'm much more likely to talk about racism against Afro-Latinas than a panorama in a movie, so I hope that the class puts less of an emphasis on technical analysis of how the works were made.",
                "I think each assignment was pretty well-crafted and the class assignments (surprisingly) rarely felt like busy work. The content, especially the first unit on cultural and gendered representations of witches, was pretty interesting. For these reasons, I liked this class a lot more than my former Spanish classes which focused much more on linguistic conventions and grammar rather than conversational and interdisciplinary applications of the language. In terms of weaknesses, I don't think I learned that much from the projects. They were definitely creative and kind of fun, but I think some of the projects (especially the TikTok and the artistic intervention) were just fundamentally strange as school assignments and I didn't improve my Spanish or learn much from completing them.",
                "Strengths - personal interventions and artistic projects designed around the course; weaknesses - the curriculum per class often times is not completely finished.",
                "Interesting material, not too many tests on vocab, more on writing and material. These are all strengths",
                "The class was very well organized and we were made aware of expectations before every assignment. The professor was also very forgiving when it came to missed deadlines. However, over all, he was the harshest grader of all of my Spanish professors so far."
