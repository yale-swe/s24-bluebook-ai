It wasn't the most in-depth course, especially when it came to the biochemical explanations behind the biological processes we covered, but it also did not suffer from being too broad. We had lectures that gave us the bigger picture and then focused on specific cases through the papers discussed in our section. I also developed the ability to approach and analyze papers across different subjects and time periods, with an emphasis on understanding each unique scientific context.",

                "The grading system is horrible. 10 MCQ quizzes should not determine 50% of your grade. My discussion section leader never once asked for anyone's name so I have no idea how he was assigning participation points which are worth 25% of our final grade.",
                "The module system is perfect. It's a great way to distill the lectures into palatable chunks. My only comment on the module system is that maybe a quiz every two weeks is a little much. I would much rather than a quiz every three weeks, and you do not have the option of dropping one, rather than a quiz every two weeks with one dropped. It would also increase the number of lectures we could have! The added component of discussing a research paper was amazing. It was a treat to engage with primary literature and discuss it in journal club setting. This class represents what I love about biology, and the caliber of education I was hoping to receive when I came to Yale, a very enjoyable course!",
                "The weakness of this class is the class itself. Prof Dellaporta does not teach well, he goes by important concepts very fast OR accidentally teaches them wrong. Prof Gendron, I will say is a better lecturer, but he does tend to speed through important and complicated biochemical processes that his portion of the lectures cover. The real horror of this class is Special Thursdays, there is in fact nothing special about those special Thursday quizzes. The quizzes never tested you on your knowledge, but were made to actually trick you. Many of my friends and I felt that even if we knew the material, the quiz questions were structured so poorly that the questions would confuse us and we'd end up choosing the wrong answer even if we knew ALL the concepts. Sidenote, For almost every quiz Dellaporta wrote, there were mistakes in the questions and we would get a freebie question here or our TAs would have to give an announcement during every quiz. Also, his slides had incorrect information on them frequently as well. I regret taking this class and stressed over it the entire semester. ALSO, another frightening aspect of this quiz was the special Thursday that was the grading for our discussion sessions with our TAs over that week's specific genetics research paper.  The papers themselves were interesting (sometimes very dense) but the issue is that you do not know your grade for any of the 6 discussion sessions that count for 25% of your grade. Prof Dellaporta does not release the grades at all and you are left guessing. You can ask your TA and they will tell you 'You're doing fine' and that's the most you'll get in terms of where you stand in the class with that grade. \r\nDon't take it!",
                "Feel like the quizzes could have been better prepared and structured; there were errors for most quizzes we took, and it just felt a bit disorganized",
                "The strengths of the course were that there were ample review sessions, especially for quizzes, which were super helpful. Additionally, the course was recorded, so it was nice to go back to lectures for review. One of the ways this course could be improved would be by modifying the grading for section, which is graded on a 1-5 schedule. You are expected to contribute multiple times in order to get a 5, but given the fact that we also take a quiz during section, unless you talk over your classmates, this is simply not possible sometimes.",
                "Strengths: great professors, fascinating content, well-organized lectures (typically, not always), opportunity to improve abilities to critically read scientific literature and learn about methods of studying the topics discussed in lecture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the bi-weekly quizzes are definitely stress-inducing, as it feels like there is always one around the corner and not a lot of time to grapple with/process any difficult topics (as in, you always have to be on your A-game for this course)",
                "Course material relation to quiz not clear",
                "strength was Dellaporta, he knows his stuff. liked my ta a lot and felt like the corse was overall well organized. Gendron is okay",
                "Strengths: A strength is the distribution of quizzes throughout the term, for while the quizzes were high stress, it helped to distribute the workload and keep me on track in terms of learning the concept. Another strength would be both professors, who I thought were both really good and explained the content fairly well. Weaknesses: A weakness of the course would be the range of papers we read in discussion section, for some were too complicated for us to understand without background knowledge on techniques.",
                "I liked the layout of the course. It wasn't too stressful yet I still felt like I was learning lots. Both lecturers are great, just somewhat different. I really enjoyed how Professor Gendron would ask questions of the class and provide demonstrations. He was very engaging. I felt that some of the lectures/modules were a little rushed and packed with information, whereas others were slightly repetitive. I generally felt like the quiz sections were interesting and helpful to my understanding, and all of the readings were relevant. Overall, I really enjoyed the class.",
                "Dr. Gendron was the greatest strength of this course. He had sooo much energy it honestly made me jealous. He always kept us on our toes. This course's weakness is definitely its lack of transparency though. We weren't provided with averages for a majority of the quizzes and our discussion section grades were never made available to track our progress and identify the areas we need to prioritize/focus on. In other words, at no point in this course did I have an idea of whether I was doing well or not which really annoyed me. This concern was met with an unsatisfying \"ask your TA\" despite our TAs being given little to no information about our quiz averages or discussion section grades either.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe examination framework for this course allows students to focus on recent material, enhancing their ability to learn the information without being overwhelmed by weeks worth of lectures. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe questions we were quizzed on were often more in-depth than what was explained in the lecture. Also, the online homework software was helpful, but the style of questions did not prepare me for the examination. The combination of these two weaknesses left me surprised and confused during the special Thursdays.",
                "i loved the first half of the course. Dellaporta is a great teacher and is so fair. He is really great in making sure we understand what he expects of us and clearly loves being a teacher. I really think the class dropped off though toward the second half. Gendron is really kind and I appreciate his effort to try to make the class engaging but I did not feel prepared to take the quizzes and felt like his information was not well organized. I really wish we could have a continuous structure in the class.",
                "I like how the course was structured and don't really think I would change anything",
                "Unit quiz versus midterm was nice, special Thursday format was good. Quiz questions should be reviewed, the wording was often unnecessarily confusing. Papers for section seemed beyond the scope and confusing at times",
                "Strengths: not a super stressful course organization (most of the grade is just weekly homework and bi-weekly quizzes), the professors are generally pretty engaging, the content is interesting and the papers you read in discussion are relevant, the TFs are really helpful in review sessions and in section\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lecture isn't always super clear and the quizzes are not always representative of the lecture material",
                "I liked how the quizzes were biweekly, it allowed me to stay on top of all relevant material without having to stress about a large cumulative final",
                "The two week modules were very helpful and well designed because they allowed for a more focused curriculum.",
                "Strengths: interesting topic\r\nWeaknesses: There are six quizzes with 11 questions and the questions are very hard and even the TAs have to really think about them. Oftentimes, the wording of these quizzes were poor so that it would be between two answers (even the TAs agreed they weren't very proofread). I didn't think the quizzes were very fair because they are 50% of your grade.",
                "Strengths: interesting content throughout, really valuable for other biological study. Professor Dellaporta writes quizzes which really challenge you to think in a broader sense of what you're learning, and Professor Gendron's lectures are engaging and well-organized to be understandable. The course format is quite friendly in that you get to be done with content after you've taken the quiz, the Achieve homework is more for you than for anything else, and the journal clubs were pretty accessible because everyone was in a similar boat with understanding the papers. Quiz review sessions were incredibly helpful in outlining what was most important to know.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Dellaporta's lectures could be a bit hard to follow because they often weren't packaged into segments outlining exactly what we were learning and what this was helping to explain. Professor Gendron's quizzes were pretty memorization-heavy, which made them a little bit less helpful in really internalizing content.",
                "I found some of the lectures engaging (although this could be conflated with my inherent interest in some of the topics). Both lecturing professors had good charisma, and it was also helpful that lectures were recorded for later reference or in the event that a student would have to miss class and/or attend remotely. \r\n\r\nI thought that the homework did not serve a purpose in preparing for assessments in the class, especially since there would be lectures for which the professor would deviate more significantly from textbook contents (which would be on the homework but not on quizzes). I also found that the quiz structure for this class was a bit stressful, as new material from a Tuesday lecture would be featured on a quiz",
                "I like the biweekly quiz format, and I liked the discussion section because I had a great TF.\r\n\r\nThe quizzes in the first half of the class were so convoluted and difficult to decipher with questions often repeated or the same as the practice quiz questions.",
                "The course is well taught mostly.",
                "This course is built off of the central dogma of biology and I believe it could replace the intro bio courses. That being said, this course fails to install core principles of real-world genetics due to its failure to fit the different concepts together and its failure to review quizzes and allow students to learn from mistakes.",
                "weaknesses: badly worded quizzes",
                "This course and the instructors provided no transparency when it came to grades. While the syllabus outlines how the grades were distributed, grades for the discussion section were never posted and each section leader was not aware exactly how they would have to grade the sections. Communicating with the professors about grading was hard and never helpful. The entire grade for this class was based on five quizzes and discussion section grades. And each quiz was graded differently because of mistakes found in the quizzes. I think this course needs a better structure and more transparency between the students and professor, especially considering this class has been taught for over 20 years.",
                "The strength to the course was when the textbook was well aligned with the lectures. It could be improved if the answers to the quizzes were given after the quiz and how to arrive at the correct answer was explained. This way, we could learn from the quizzes.",
                "Great textbook, peer tutors, TAs, profs, lectures, homework, etc. Whenever I had questions about content, I know I could get them answered.",
                "One strength of this course includes having no finals and midterms and instead 6 biweekly quizzes throughout the semester that account for 50% of your overall grade, and the professor drops your lowest quiz score. Another strength was having discussions on papers that covered concepts covered during class, which was a good way to be more exposed to relevant research. Lastly, the Achieve homework assignments weren't too bad and emphasized concepts we learned in class. Weaknesses include hard quizzes with a lot of trick questions and questions that have contradictory information that makes taking the quiz more stressful than it has to be. Also, the class isn't curved on a traditional basis in that the lowest quiz score being dropped is the curve, so you have to make sure you score high on every quiz possible. Lastly, I wish there were more practice test questions so I could understand where the gaps in my knowledge are and understand more of the nuances of the concepts we learned (which came up on quizzes often).",
                "The biweekly quiz and discussion session system worked well for me. I preferred this style with more assessments throughout the semester as opposed to larger tests.",
                "Strengths included the professors' expertise and engagement. The peer tutor sessions were also very helpful, though I think I would have appreciated if there were more in-person options. I thought the availability of the textbook was helpful for quite a few of the units. Overall, I enjoyed the structure of this course and how it was divided. The quizzes could be challenging, but each covered an attainable amount of material. Since we covered so many different topics, I appreciated the division of the assessments. \r\n\r\nMy one main criticism is that the Achieve assignments were a hit or miss for me. Under Dellaporta, they were definitely emphasized, and were often very lengthy and took up a lot of my studying time. However, I think I mainly benefited from the extra practice and I appreciated the bonus points. However, as the course went on, the achieves were hardly ever mentioned in class and began to diverge from what we were learning. This was especially apparent with some of Gendron's lectures, which deviated from the books and thus led to Achieve quizzes that included information we did not at all cover. Since it was a paid subscription, I think this platform could have afforded a bit more focus. \r\n\r\nAlso, the review sessions were very unstructured and it seemed like the expectations were unclear for some of the TFs. Sometimes there were only a couple of review questions and no way to fill the rest of the time, so maybe they should start with a review instead then questions?",
                "I really liked that this class had biweekly quizzes instead of a midterm and final exam. I think it really pushed the students to consistently study throughout the semester and review our knowledge as we progressed through the course material. That being said, on almost every single quiz we took in this class there was some kind of typo or error, sometimes just something small that could be easily clarified but other times a bigger error like the same question being repeated twice or many possibly correct answers. This was very frustrating and something that I think could have been easily fixed if the professors or TA's read through the quiz even once before passing them out.",
                "Strengths:\r\nInteractive lecture in person\r\nMultiple professors\r\nHelpful review sessions hosted by TFs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nUnclear grading rubric that changed multiple times throughout the course from day 1 to a couple days before grade posting",
                "The main strength of this class is the content and teaching. However, there was a vast difference in the teaching between the two professors. The day that Professor Gendron began his first lecture it became apparent to me the most-likely generational differences in how lectures are taught. Today, most of us have very short attention spans, and his lectures took that into account. He always had the summary of textbook sections to read, practice problems, and took breaks which I found very helpful. His lectures were much more clearly organized than Professor Dellaporta's. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness is the structure of assesments in the class. While the grading formula is generous, I do not think the quizzes are an honest or fair way to assess or promote student learning. Instead of promoting learning, all they do is sort students based on who can answer multiple choice questions decisively and quickly. While I understand the value of complex, application-based problems, the number of mistakes throughout the quizzes made an already challenging task even that more difficult. I am a naturally indecisive person, so, when faced with problems where the answers did not match up or make sense, watching the TAs furiously try to figure out the errors during the quiz itself, I found it hard to focus and answer the already challenging problems. \r\n\r\nEven then, aside from discussion and Achieve assignments, there are really no other opportunities to test and get feedback on how much of the material you understand. Especially towards the beginning with some of the mathematical questions, I think the class would really benefit from doing regular problem sets in addition to the quizzes. Given how heavy the material is, exams would not be a good option for students, but I do think working in homework which matches the difficulty of quiz questions and students can work on together would benefit everyone in the course and provide more interaction between peer tutors, students, and TAs.",
                "I think the first 4 or 5 lectures of this course were almost pure review from previous classes. I found myself just waiting for the course to really start - it was as if we didn't touch new material until about a month in. I struggled to take interest in it for this portion because it just felt like another intro class. Once the new material starts, though, it's pretty interesting. \r\n\r\nThe grading system of the quizzes is a bit harsh. There are only six quizzes throughout the whole of the course and they determine nearly your whole grade - the only other things counted in your grade are discussion section participation and homework completion, which everyone does pretty similarly on, so the quizzes are the main differentiator. Because these quizzes carry so much weight, your final grade can end up being determine just by a difference of one quiz question, which I don't like as the quizzes are multiple choice and often had typos, repeat questions, or questions with heavily debatable answers. I would prefer if the quizzes were short answer. \r\n\r\nAlso, discussion section participation carries a massive portion of the grade. The issue with this is that there are too many students in any one discussion section for each of us to have a proper chance to participate. We are able to present the portion of the paper we are assigned, but that is all we have time for. In my section, even with just presenting the paper, we went over time almost every single week. There is not enough time for each student to participate any more than that, so participation should not be worth so much of the grade.",
                "Strengths: Achieves and discussion sections really do help to facilitate student learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of problem sets kind of hinder students' ability to practice quiz-like questions. However review sessions offered in the beginning of the course, and practice questions embedded in lectures in the latter half of the course, do help offset that a bit.",
                "I thought the course content was unorganized and the expectations for what was expected on the quizzes didn't match up with the home work or the  practice problems in the text book."

                "Yes if you're a bio major. Grade is based on 6 quizzes, and to do well you just have to watch the lectures and go to the hour long review sessions before each quiz and study the night before. Definitely not a gut but also not heinous. Concepts in the second half of the course are much more interesting, first half is mid. Good info to know if you're going into bio research or med school.",
                "Yes if you need it for your major.",
                "Absolutely! Even if you do not plan to use this as one of your core courses for the MCDB major, I think every biology student should know about genetics, and this course does a great job of teaching it in a very digestible and clear way. The workload is also very reasonable, and the quizzes are extremely straightforward so long as you keep up with the lecture material, attend office hours, and ask questions.",
                "This class is okay, I felt like I did not take away nearly as much as I did from other core classes such as microbiology. The quizzes I felt were usually fair, but they tended to have a lot of mistakes on them that were distracting when taking the quiz. No feedback was given throughout the entire semester for discussion sections, which made it hard to determine how you were doing. Papers in discussion sections often covered topics that were never discussed in class or were not related to the material covered in class which often gave people who were working in a genetics research lab a great advantage in participation relative to most other peers. Overall this class is low workload, but it was not particularly exciting or enjoyable.",
                "I would not recommend this course even to my worst enemy. It did not facilitate healthy and productive learning. All I did was stress and work hard, and even then with the way the quizzes were structured, my knowledge of the course was not reflected based on the quizzes. Take another core course.",
                "This class provides solid foundations in genetics that is useful if you are pre-med.",
                "Yes, if they enjoy genetics or need to take the class as a requirement!",
                "I absolutely would if they are interested in genetics and genuinely enjoy biology courses here. If someone is simply looking for an MCDB class to fill a credit, then no I wouldn't recommend it, because you have to put the work in to do well and if you don't enjoy the topics, I can imagine it would be awful. I, however, really loved the content and felt that much of it will serve me in my own research and career path.",
                "If need MCDB core course this is fine",
                "You're probably taking this as a prereq or to fulfill MCDB requirements, definitely not  as intense as other MCDB cores",
                "I would recommend this course to MCDB majors or other science majors interested in genetics. There are a good variety of topics covered, the professors are both engaging lecturers, and the workload/stress is not too high. A fair amount of topics are review from bio 103, so it might not be the most engaging for a small number of students. The second half of the course does become the ellen show, but for the better honestly.",
                "Yes, this course was not too stressful since the special Thursday quizzes and paper discussions are every other week, which allowed us time to learn/study/digest the content and the lectures were well organized.",
                "Yes, I would. I think that the material is extremely applicable and interesting. The professors do a great job of taking more obscure/abstract topics and pairing them with real world examples to better your understanding and further your interest in the course.",
                "The course content itself is very interesting; I didn't know I was going to enjoy it as much as I did. However, the lack of feedback and inability to track progress made it difficult to know what to prioritize. If anything, I would take this course to be taught by Dr. Gendron since it was always fun coming to class when he taught.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, but only under the assumption that you will need to go more in-depth than the lectures (on your own) in order to feel prepared for the quizzes.",
                "If you're interested in science it is a cool course otherwise I wouldn't take it. Not for students exploring STEM courses.",
                "Good MCDB major course",
                "I would recommend to another student, I'm not an MCDB major or pre-med and I still found the class useful without being too stressful. If you need an upper-level MCDB class or are just interested in the content I would recommend it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend to a fellow MCDB student looking for an interesting elective!",
                "Yes especially if they want to major in MCDB.",
                "No, unless you are willing to spend a LOT of time reviewing lectures slides and lectures. I would rewatch all of the lectures before the quizzes and still not do as well as I'd hoped.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course -- genetics are fascinating and even more important than it may seem before starting the course. This was my favorite class this semester; it was interesting, formatted in a way that made learning the point rather than regurgitating information, and engaging in lectures. The content particularly toward the start could be organized slightly more effectively, but this was a fantastic class that connected many dots in complex biological systems.",
                "I think I would only recommend this course to a student who wants a basic overview of genetics, and if such were the case, I would recommend that they audit the class. The class proved needlessly stressful and fostered unnecessary competition among students on the quizzes and within discussion sections, although this is likely a consequence that was not intended.",
                "Its ok for an MCDB core class. I really liked the second half of the lecture.",
                "Not really, if not needed for major.",
                "Yes, a good intro class, but be prepared to learn on your own if you want to work in a genetics lab.",
                "not unless uu have to",
                "No, I did not enjoy it despite being very excited about the topics of genetics. If you already are coming in with an extensive biology and genetics knowledge, which I did not, then you might find this class more enjoyable.",
                "No. Often times, especially at the beginning of the semester, the lectures were very confusing and hard to follow. Also, the course was centered around biweekly quizzes, to which we were never able to see the correct answers, so it was hard to learn from them. If there was a gap in my understanding, after the quiz, it could not be corrected.",
                "YES. I went in unsure of doing a BS in MCDB and left super inspired. I even joined a genetics lab. Please take this course if you have any interest in genetics!",
                "This course was OK. It could've been improved by giving students more questions that were representative of the biweekly courses. I felt like we didn't get enough of a heads up about what material we would be tested on exactly until the Wednesday study hall sessions (which were NOT recorded!) right before the Thursday morning assessments. Also, many of the quizzes we took had questions that were later debated over by our TFs and tossed because they were not \"good\" questions...sometimes we even had questions that were duplicates of each other on the actual quiz. Overall, I felt like the organization of this course was a bit messy.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they want to have a good foundational background on genetics and if they're premed, but I would not recommend this course to the average student if they are just looking for a science credit.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in any field of genetics. I was dreading a couple of units on topics I didn't like, such as developmental genetics, but the professors were both so engaged in the content that I was still interested. Even in spots where I was reviewing past topics covered in the bio sequence, they were taught in a manner that was fresh enough that I still felt I was gaining more insight. And for the more difficult and novel topics, the professors made sure to emphasize and re-explain as needed.",
                "I would recommend the course to other students pursuing knowledge in genetics.",
                "If a student really wants to learn genetics or if it is required, then you should take it. However, I do not think it is organized to facilitate learning given the difficulty of the quizzes and the frequent mistakes in their writing, not to mention the very little feedback on the quizzes received (My TA didn't always have the quizzes to give back, and when he did give it back, the answer explanation was often not clear).",
                "The grading system of this course is tough. You have to do near perfect on almost all of the quizzes to get an A, which is, of course, difficult and unfair of you to expect of yourself. The content is interesting but I feel like I didn't actually learn that much. The second half of the quizzes are very rote-memorization based and not very conducive to learning. I think it's worth taking if you're an MCDB major for the core requirement but otherwise it's not very worth it.",
                "Yes, it was an informative course. You can get a lot out of it, just be sure to utilize office hours of both your TAs and professors."
