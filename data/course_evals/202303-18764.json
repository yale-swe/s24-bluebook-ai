                "The strengths were there were lots of resources on the canvas page. I was neutral about most things but maybe some weaknesses are that we just did the same thing every week so it got kind of boring but that is usually what happens in a basic math class",
                "A lot of pests, not much practice that isnt graded",
                "Strength was that it had very helpful review sessions and the homework had crucial feedback. I liked that the homework problems were similar to ones we covered in class or would see on tests. A weakness would be how the lectures were structured.",
                "Strengths: Hayou Wang was very attentive to student inquires and learning in his sections. Weekly problem sets, explorations, and peer tutoring hours were also very helpful in solidifying that understanding. I particularly liked that explorations had multiple attempts, so as to make the pre-section learning experience stress-free and engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This course was very fast-paced and structured, which I liked.",
                "I thought that the course was pretty well organized with each lecture being relatively clear and easy to follow. One area for improvement would be for there to be more organization for good practice problems. In reviewing for the exams, I often felt like there were not many practice questions in the textbook when I struggled on a topic",
                "I found the structure and pace of the curriculum to successful facilitate my learning. I did not find the explorations on canvas to be particularly helpful",
                "I think the problem sets and the practice exams were really good. The lecture could be better.",
                "Overall the notes were very helpful. I think the course goes very in depth into the topics so can get very complicated but I appreciate the daily explorations and cheat sheets for the exams because I feel like it is set up to try to encourage understanding and learning for students."
