One of the biggest strengths is that every student is required to do a service project and engage with the Deaf community which is incredible valuable. ASL classes are also typically very tight-knit which provides for a great classroom environment every day. Weaknesses - Sometimes the service projects are a big hectic to organize.",

The course was engaging and constant because it meets every day, but I never found it super overwhelming. I think one of the things I might have liked would have been more guidance on expectations for formal presentations. I felt like I learned the most in the more conversational aspects of the course.",
