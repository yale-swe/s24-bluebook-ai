                "Strength is 1000% the professor. He's a legit renowned documentary-maker with a lifetime of experience, and actually talks about film as a filmmaker would. He has an enormous archive of hundreds of interesting works (many made by himself), always makes screenings engaging and fun, and was really good at  communication outside the classroom. No weaknesses I can think of.",
                "Strengths: You get to see a lot of different kinds of videos from different places and eras and perspectives. You have the opportunity to show your work to a group of people who have something to say about videos. It's a chill atmosphere, and Michel is fun to be around. He'll also probably change the way you think about what a documentary is and what it might be for. \r\nWeaknesses: It's a long, early class. Also, there aren't really regular assignments; you provide your own motivation and direction.",
                "It was a nice course for engaging with works of nonfiction in a relaxed atmosphere. Perhaps a bit more in-class conversation could improve the course.",
                "The strengths of this course were Michel as a professor and the weaknesses were the lack of focus on the techincal aspects of filmmaking"

                "Yes, learned a ton about documentary films and Professor Auder is a gem.",
                "Yes, it's one of the best film classes I've taken at Yale, because the professor exposes you to many new ways of representing your ideas on screen WITHOUT the pretentious lectures forcing you to appreciate a genre that you don't enjoy. The best part of taking this class is discovering the handful of films on the syllabus that really resonate with you. It will broaden your perspective on documentary-making and help you understand your own filmmaking style.",
                "Take this course if you're interested in video art and/or experimental film. The volume and range of videos that we watched were HUGE and unfiltered. Michel is a fascinating filmmaker and a very kind man. He gives everyone the opportunity to come to their own conclusions about the films, while also providing witty comments on big-picture ideas about what film is, what it can be, and what work it does in the world. It's a fun time. Note: This class is literally only as much work as you want to put in. It's worth it to go to class and pay attention (despite the long, early hours), but don't expect to be guided through how to make a documentary. Just make stuff!",
                "Yes, but I would recommend going into this course knowing that it will be pretty relaxed. It is definitely the kind of course from which you get out what you put into. If you do want to make the most of it, however, there are many opportunities to share your work.",
                "Yes. Take the course for Michel.",
                "Yes you watch cool stuff you would not get to see otherwise, and it will change your understanding of what documentary can and should be."
