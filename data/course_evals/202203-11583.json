                "I cannot recommend this class highly enough. If you are even slightly considering this class, PLEASE apply and take it if you get in. I took this as a second-semester senior, and I can absolutely say that this was in my top 3 best Yale classes of my entire time in college. I will say that I think this is especially true because this was my first\/only art history class. If you have no prior experience in art history, this is a perfect class -- it will make you feel on top of the world, with the sheer volume of knowledge and information you learn! Be prepared to walk into any contemporary art gallery and KNOW what you are talking about.",
                "Yes! Pamela Lee is a great professor and she has such a wonderful way of presenting information in an engaging way. Her knowledge on the subjects are very clear, and her enthusiasm for the course made everyone in the seminar grow invested as well. The Washington DC trip was also very meaningful. We were able to see many artworks in person and learned about pieces for our final paper."
