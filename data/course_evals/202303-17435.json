                "I learned more about indigeneity and indigenous epistemology in relation to food and water systems.",
                "This course helped me develop skills to think critically about food, colonization, and Indigeneity and all of their intersections. It also pushed me to think creatively about learning, knowledge, and knowledge production through discussions and also class projects.",
                "Reading academic texts, finding patterns within colonial strategies to write themselves into institutional memory as naturally occurring in order to present colonization as something that was fated to happen, and not a violent choice, how to apply learning into actionable steps via a final project",
                "How horribly persistent the legacy of colonization STILL is in the food industry at every level.",
                "I really appreciated the ability to extend our learning beyond the classroom by working on the farm. I learned a lot on radical pedagogy just from how the class was taught. There was also many useful assignments that served as checkpoints throughout the class.  In addition to being able to practice my skills in reading and writing about theory, this class taught me histories of violent systems of power and resistances to such violences. In high school, I was taught that history ended with modes of exploitation. This class is powerful and necessary in teaching modes of revolt alongside exploitation."

                "Incredibly manageable course load with weekly readings and assignments. The professor provides a flexible turn-in policy that gives students extensions, no questions asked. I never felt the need to cheat or shortcut in this class because I truly wanted to dedicate the amount of time required.",
                "I think a big strength of this course is the engagement with the Yale farm. That is such an enjoyable and rewarding aspect of this class, you get to be outside working with your hands while applying material you learned in the readings. I also found the class discussions super valuable for deepening my understanding of the readings. I think the format of this course was perfect. I don't think I have any recommendations for improvement, for me this class was so well run and organized.",
                "The main strength of this course is Professor Hobart and her ability to engage everyone in the classroom. She is incredibly genuine, thoughtful, and knowledgeable. She has become one of my favorite professors at Yale since taking this course!",
                "STRENGTHS: Professor Hobart is amazing. She perfectly balances lectures and seminar discussions and takes the class on a little journey every class. She really leads you through the literature on the topic of indigenous food sovereignty and lets you synthesize and decide for yourself. She exemplifies that one can learn extremely rigorous and academically demanding content while also feeling welcome, loved, and supported in the classroom. The course content is also really fascinating and extremely intersectional - highly recommend it for anyone interested in sustainability, food, and indigenous sovereignty. No weaknesses, I wish more people could take this class!",
                "I felt like the whole course was a strength: the readings, discussions, visits to the farm, assignments, papers. It was also really engaging and felt like a gift to participate in!",
                "Every session was focused on discussion, and everybody in the class was so intelligent and articulate."

                "Yes, this was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. This is a history, indigenous studies, food studies, philosophy, political science, anthropology course and more. Through really profound discussions to weekly meetings on the farm, this class was a great introduction to the lasting legacy of settler colonialism and current realities for Native Americans. Through this class, we are given the space to learn together, heal together, and grow together in such a welcoming environment.",
                "For sure. I think there are a few people I will recommend this course to because it covers a wide array of topics. We dove into some areas I had no idea were related to Indigenous Food Sovereignty, yet once we finished our discussion, it all connected for me. I believe this course has some of the most complex readings I have encountered at Yale, and once I was able to understand them, I felt extremely empowered with knowledge. This course was overall, extremely rewarding.",
                "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to other students. It is one of the most intellectually stimulating classes I have take while at Yale.",
                "YES! Everyone at Yale should take a course in the ER&M department - this is a great seminar option that doesn't require a lot of background knowledge in the field. As a pre-medicine student, I thought it was super interesting and academically rigorous to think of race outside of science (as opposed to HSHM classes, for example) and also health equity from a food and indigenous sovereignty perspective.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It completely shifted not only what I think but also the way I think it. It forced me to be very critical, not only of assumptions or ideas about the world, but also how those come to be and who gets to make them. It was also a really lovely learning environment that made me feel comfortable, trusted, challenged, and responsible.",
                "Yes I think everyone at Yale should take this class. Whether Indigenous or not, exposing yourself to Indigenous thinkers makes students make sure that just learning about issues is not the endgoal, but instead putting what you learn into everyday action.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the material. It was eye-opening for me.",
                "Yes, we need more classes like this! Professor Hobart was an absolutely wonderful and understanding instructor, who is deeply committed to her students and making learning more accessible. Very warm to everyone and very understanding that we were all coming in with different levels of knowledge on the class. Definitely organized the class to be very discussion-based so that we were all learning from each other rather than promoting teacher-student hierarchies. Deeply appreciated her form of teaching! \r\n\r\nI really appreciated the ability to extend our learning beyond the classroom by working on the farm.
