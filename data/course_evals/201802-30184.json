    "Honed in on music theory, learned a bit about race and gender critical theory.",
    "I didn't know anything about Jazz before this course, so I learned a lot.",
    "This class will teach you about Jazz almost in lieu of civil rights history. It is a brilliant way of teaching jazz and the civil rights movement.",

    "Strengths - Instructor had us engaged during every lecture and did not assign work that couldn't be done",
    "It was a perfect course. A fair amount of work and time commitment. Would highly recommend to other students.",
    "This course is excellent. Very well structured, and Prof. Duffy makes it all an exciting narrative.",
    "The material was all very interesting, the readings were all relevant and fun, and the pace was just about perfect.",
    "Good course.",
    "The strength of this class is that the professor is an expert on the subject and he emphasizes learning more than grades which is always a good learning environment, especially over the summer. If you are looking for an interesting class to take that is not too heavy but still keeps you engaged, this is the way to go."

    "Yes, for Any students needing a good and engaging summer class. This is the perfect fit",

    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely would recommend. The music is great and Duffy is the man.",
    "I would definite recommended this to another student. My one word of caution is that the required workload is less than that of a typical in-person course, so a student must work hard to get the most out of all the readings and materials.",
    "Yes, I would, good class to explore a topic you're not that familiar with.",
    "Absolutely TAKE ITTTTTTT! Duffy is a hero."
