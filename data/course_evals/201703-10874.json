    "ECON 111 with Prof Marnix Amand is a really great intro macro course. He is a fantastic and engaging seminar professor - so if he's teaching the seminar again, I would definitely take it. The course goes way beyond the AP economics curriculum, and Prof Amand teaches a really interesting version of macro that's infused with a many international examples.",
    "This class was useful to learn basic macroeconomics and how to apply it to current phenomenon.",
    "Gained understanding of how economists build and use models, how and why monetary policy\/fiscal policy actions are taken, and major macroeconomic events like the 2008 crisis.",
    "Knowledge of basics of macroeconomics, how economics can affect policy, how lot of world affairs can be explained through economic modeling, how economics sheds light on \"controversial\" political issues"

   "comments": [
    "The seminar is fantastic - you really get a good understanding of the material because it's taught with a lot of student engagement (semi-discussion style). It's really easy to ask questions and get instant feedback, and you never feel bored, detached, or lost.",
    "As a seminar, the class was taught very well. Professor Amand is a great lecturer and the classes are both engaging and enlightening. Though he puts up the slides online for review, the lecturers are important to attend to understand the context and meaning behind the concepts in the slides. There are weekly problem sets and online quizzes but both do not take up a lot of time. If anything, I wish there were more exams rather than just the one midterm and final as a 50 percent final is a little bit daunting.",
    "Lots of help available, homework solutions and lecture slides always posted. Really clear lectures and every new topic builds upon previous ones, which helped understanding. Could be improved by adding\/suggesting more review exercises for the exams.",
    "Marnix's lectures are amazing!!! Just be sure you pay attention in class because not everything is on the slides.",
    "This class is the best class I've taken this semester. Professor Amand is very engaging lecturer and he structures the content well and makes you want to come to class. He is very comprehensive in his explanations and the class is structured as a lecture, although it is the \"seminar\" class. I liked this because I can participate and ask questions in class while still having the luxury of a \"lecture-style\" course."

    "y e s s s, take for Marnix if you can, but also for the cool and enlightening subject that is macroeconomics. The workload is also pretty light, with a weekly pset and midterm\/exam, with high gains in macroeeconomic understanding.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you're looking to really get a good grasp of macro, take the seminar over the lecture. It's extremely engaging, more difficult, but very rewarding. You learn so much over the course of the semester and Prof Amand is a great professor.",
    "I absolutely think any student should take the seminar above the lecture. Though the seminar has a worse curve, the amount I have learned is amazing. Professor Amand is great at answering questions and holds weekly office hours to help with problem sets. This class was so much more interesting because of its seminar format. The lectures were both engaging and enlightening.",
    "I would really recommend the intro macro seminar - lectures were really engaging and there were lots of opportunities to ask questions. The things you learn might seem simple, i.e. really logical and comprehensible, but they can be used to understand economic events happening in real time, which is really cool.",
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely. This course made me interested in pursuing macroeconomics as a potential career option.",
    "YES! Marnix Amand is a great professor! This course really changed my perspective on what economics really is and is very engaging.",
    "YES! Engaging and wonderful. All the topics end up relating to one another and help explain relevant current events. It's a great course to introduce macroeconomics."
