    "General overview of environmental orgo with a lot of brief topics. Good introduction to multiple areas in the field.",
    "We learned about many different topics including organic molecule partitioning (air, water, equilibrium), sorption, biological uptake, nucleophilic substitutions, reactive species, an overview of basic chemistry (like IMFs), photochemical reactions, & many others topics! It was a  jam-packed class & felt very overwhelming at times, but interesting.",
    "I learned a lot about environmental organic chemistry, both quantitatively and qualitatively.",
    "I gained a good overview of lots of environmentally relevant chemistry with real world applications.",
    "I learned about how organic chemicals and pollutants partition in various environmental systems along with the different factors that contribute to this."

   "comments": [
    "Early on in the course, it was very confusing as a junior undergrad for we did no examples in class and the textbook was horrible, but as it when on, prof fortner listened to our request and started doing examples in class and explaining things a little slower, making the class much more enjoyable.",
    "The lectures were hard to follow sometimes & the problem sets were incredibly difficult. The exams were much more fair given the apparent difficulty of the class. The course was originally listed as \"Water Chemistry\" & I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the class was actually on environmental organic chemistry. I believe the class could be improved by having more printed notes which listed basic formulas or important information for each class. This could help the students better follow along. I felt in this class that I couldn't see the forest from the trees, but I know I learned a lot of material that will be  applicable in future classes!",
    "This class is wonderful! It need no improvement in my eyes.  Reasonable and informative, as well as fun and interesting!",
    "Strengths: This course did a great job of introducing me to a lot of dense material that I had never seen before and helping me make connections to real world applications. The course outline was well organized and the class itself was very fair and struck a manageable balance of a workload and material difficulty. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures themselves were a bit all over the place and hard to follow. Coupled with the fact that the textbook isn't well organized and the PSET questions which were all taken directly from it were unclear, this could get overwhelming at times. This could be easily solved if lecture outlines were posted before class so that topics and problem solutions could be more clearly understood and if some PSET questions were written by the professor himself rather than just taken from the textbook.",
    "A weakness of the class is that at the beginning there were no problem examples given in class, but Professor Fortner was open to feedback and adjusted to course to give problem examples during class time. Another weakness is that the TA was very slow in grading homework assignments so we didn't get homework grades back until the end of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "The course is not for everyone, but if you are interested in the topic, it's a great overview of many area in environmental engineering.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you are an a chemist  or an environmental\/chemical engineer. It is very difficult & covers specific information that is only useful in those fields.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to both engineering students and non-engineering students.",
    "Yes, if it isn't already required for your major and you care about the environment (and especially water quality) it is a great engineering elective. I do recommend you have somewhat of a chemistry background beforehand and perhaps certain chemistry courses should be prerequisites. I was well prepared having already taken Thermo, Orgo, and PChem but my peers that hadn't taken these (especially Thermo) were more lost."
