Especially towards the end, I feel much more confident in my abilities as a writer of dystopias, which I was weak in before this class. I also learned a lot about what an ideal is, how it can be applied, and why they may be faulty.",

                "The strength is Maria. She is the most passionate, caring, supportive, and attentive professor you will encounter at Yale, doing anything she can in order to help you and advance your learning. The only weakness is that she may be a bit disorganized at times, might move meetings around and change class assignments and readings very last minute. But given the low workload of this class it is totally fine.",
                "The course has an excellent selection of readings that balance all times, places, and types of Western dystopias and utopias.",
                "This course was great! I loved everything about it. I do wish I had more guidelines on the assignments. I never knew if what I was doing was correct, so I really don't know what to expect for my grade!",
                "It is interesting and varied. it could have been more organized and we could have received better and more consistent feedback.",
                "The course could have been more standardized and organized, but otherwise, I enjoyed it.",
                "Strengths: You learn how to think in a interdisciplinary manner; Read a lot of texts that I believe everyone should read; Maria makes every class engaging and fun; Makes you better at presenting skills. Weaknesses: Sometimes the readings were too long.",
                "The strength of the course is the creative projects that get you to interact with the readings in an interesting and novel way. Sometimes, the course did feel a bit unstructured. But the environment was always encouraging, and Maria welcomed discourse and differing opinions.",
                "This course is incredible! Its rooted in historical context around the development of different utopian ideologies, and combines history, philosophy, and many other disciplines to provide deep understanding of utopias and dystopias throughout history.",
                "The class lended itself to a lot of interesting discussion, which was a major strength of the class."

She is a great professor, very knowledgable and caring, and you will really develop your creative thinking by learning from her. All Yale students should get to take a class with her before they graduate!",
                "Yes! It was a great course.",
                "Yes. It is interesting and fun to discuss the readings and do the presentations.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who wants an interesting and engaging history seminar.",
                "Yes! It is a fun course where you learn how to examine the world around you through many lenses. Also, the professor is amazing!",
                "Yes! I think the course was very interesting, but I wouldn't classify it as a history class. It is more of a class on different utopian thinkers and theorists with a slight foray into dystopias. If you're interested in learning about that and reading some older works that don't always make sense, I think it is a class definitely worth taking. Maria is a very kind professor, and I enjoyed re-reading some familiar documents and books with a different perspective.",
                "1000%, Maria is absolutely incredible, and creates such a wonderful environment in the classroom to promote discussion from a diverse set of perspectives. I learned so much and loved the readings and assessment activities.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course. The Professor is amazing and is truly invested in her students learning. The course material is really interesting and so applicable to our current world."
