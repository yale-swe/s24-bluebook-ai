                "I learned about French language and culture through our textbook readings as well as through our Tlcom sessions with French students. I also gained a lot of conversational skills, as each class we were asked at least once to speak with the person sitting next to us, which helped me speak in French without the pressure of making mistakes in front of a large group of people.",
                "Learned about the grammar structures and words behind the French language. It was a daily class that struck students with new materials everyday and really helped me grow as a French speaker.",
                "I learned a lot this semester! I feel much better about my level of French!",
                "You learn loads of French grammar, vocabulary, and culture. Being able to think quickly in French and speak conversationally is also a big skill stressed in this class.",
                "This course helped me develop a higher level of fluency in French, as well as being a great foundational review of basic grammar and vocabulary. This course is a great way to establish/re-establish foundational French skills.",
                "Greatly improved my skills at French in reading, writing, and conversationally. \r\nThis class also helped me improve my confidence in speaking French.",
                "Reading, writing, and speaking at L2; grammar exercises, pronunciation correction,  bi-weekly conversations with French students, opportunities to engage with the French language as it relates to our daily lives, etc."

            "comments": [
                "This course was highly engaging and there were a lot of things that made it more desirable to go to class every day. The professors listened to our feedback and we saw changes to the way information was presented immediately after we brought something up, and having the ability to bring these things up with my instructor made all the difference to me. Because we could have that relationship with the instructors, I don't really believe that there were any weaknesses by the end of the semester. I thought compositions and the final skit were both great ways to tie French into our own personal interests and made assignments significantly more engaging.",
                "There is a lot of work! But it is super helpful for all the exams. I wish there was an asynchronous learning day each week as other languages tend to have.",
                "I think the homework assigned on the online website was too much and we learned more from written homework on paper or typed! The class however was great since it met every day and we spoke a lot of French!",
                "The biggest strength was the professor, Madame DeVos. She was an incredible resource for helping people at all levels access French in a rigorous but not demoralizing way. For the assignments themselves, sometimes they seemed unnecessarily time-consuming. The general course curriculum was also a bit disorganized at times, with assignments being moved around or posted with very short notice. This was generally outweighed however by the professor's higher concern with actual learning over success on paper.",
                "Strengths: in-class time focused on speaking and listening as well as grammar, which kept the class engaging and helped us gain fluency. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There seemed to be some inconsistencies between what we learned in class and homework/tests, though I believe this is because the curriculum was new for our year. While some homework felt a little like busywork, it was never unmanageable and Professor DeVos made sure students could complete their work without being overwhelmed by the course.",
                "One great strength of this course is the daily French practice; by limiting classroom discussion to French, students quickly learn how to talk around words or grammar structures that they do not know in the language. I also really enjoyed talking with the French students every other week; you speak with the same person each time, so you become comfortable with them and are able to expand your casual conversational skills. The workbook exercises within the new program do not always make sense, but the program is generally helpful. There are many grammar and pronunciation modules that break down new concepts."

                "I would recommend this class to another student. It helped make me so much more confident in French, and the homework assignments from the book are great for clarifying what was covered in class that day.",
                "Yes! It completely changed the way I spoke French and made me more fond of the language even though I have had some negative experiences with it in the past.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who seriously wants to learn French. It is not an insignificant amount of work and forces you to really engage with the material. If someone is willing to really try to learn the language, and not do the bare minimum, I would recommend it but advise them that it is challenging at times.",
                "Yes, Professor DeVos is a wonderful teacher and really helped me to re-learn foundational French. While the curriculum could feel chaotic at times, she always worked to smooth over any bumps and prioritize qualitative education over quantitative assessment.",
                "Yes, it is an interesting and fun way to learn French that goes in depth on the grammar rules and oral productions. Work can be a little overwhelming at times, but Mme DeVos is understanding so 100% take the class with her. Exams are weighed appropriately but online portions are a little daunting sometimes.",
                "I would definitely recommend it! I hadnt taken French in about 10 months before taking FREN 121, and the class offered a great transition into Yale language courses. The course is very accessible and Mme DeVos is so kind. She was always willing to help us in any way possible and recognized that our stressors/lives were larger than the classroom. Through her compassion and dedication, she made learning French a very enjoyable and low-stakes experience."
