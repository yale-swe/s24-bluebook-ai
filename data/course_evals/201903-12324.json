    "I have learned so much about the history of the United States' energy use. I never knew just how far impacting the choices of the government and corporations on which energy sources are used and distributed were on every part of our lives. I learned what energy sources we used through history, how we used those energy sources, and what effects those usages had on our health, culture, economy, power, and politics. A skill I have improved upon is writing from primary and secondary sources. Also, I learned how to be more empathetic to those around me and consider all that goes into people and their actions.",

    "In this course, I learned a lot about how to write in a historical context, specifically through the research paper. It challenged me to work on my research and writing skills during my first semester which was very helpful. We wrote the paper in stages which was ideal to get advice and learn during the entire writing process.",
    "I learned a lot about the development of US energy, the social and cultural implications of energy transitions, and about themes of gender, power, industrialization.",
    "I actually found this course very interesting and learned a lot about energy history in the U.S.",
    "This class was a great overview of energy history, especially the energy justice and equality aspects of it. Sabin was really passionate about what he taught and wanted to pass that on to the students. It covers everything about why the energy system is the way it is today, the environmental problems the pathways have caused, and like I said the justice issues that have developed with each energy source. I learned a lot about how to construct a historical research paper, particularly the research aspect of it. This class was super helpful for exploring the available tools offered at Yale to do these kinds of projects.",
    "We learned all about energy and energy transitionssocial, cultural, and economic impacts, why they happen and what they entail, and what tie ins they have with the modern day. You gain a really comprehensive understanding of how interconnected history is, too. Many movements that are in a surface level separate turn out to be profoundly tied to issues of energy.",

During my first semester at Yale, I was lucky enough to experience a dive into a major component of national and global history, as well as learn how to be a historian with the help of my TF.\r\n\r\nThis class covers energy from pre-colonial America to the present day and analyses it in a historical context. A student learns the significance of energy in shaping America into the country that it is today, as well as social aspects of energy throughout time, such as energy justice and energy transitions.\r\n\r\nAside from content, this course does a good job of introducing a student to writing historically. It's a writing-based lecture\/seminar, and a great opportunity to fine-tune your writing skills; I had no idea what counterfactualism or presentism were until I took this course, and they're both really big issues in historical writing that every student needs to address.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think Professor Sabin put the course together very well and I am not sure what more could be improved. I so very much enjoyed the tour of New Haven, it was a great way to learn about the history of the city and see some of the things we were talking about in class (for example, the dam Eli Whitney used) in real life. I thought the movies we had to watch outside of class were inconvenient but they were definitely interesting and insightful.\r\n\r\nActually, one thing I would have appreciated during the semester would be Professor Sabin weekly publishing his notes and thoughts about the material we read. The notes he had about the material were often much more profound and insightful than what I could come up with, and I could only write down or absorb so much of what he said in class.",
    "Course covers interesting and pertinent moments in history. All the work can be directly linked to our current situation today which made it engaging and important. The course is structured so that students sit in groups of 10, so that sometimes we are listening to a lecture and sometimes we are having discussions which I really enjoyed. However, sometimes the content can seem trivial or irrelevant.",
    "Readings were manageable, but many of the lectures were slightly repetitive and some lacked very impactful information in my opinion.",
    "Strengths: The readings were super interesting. Sometimes they were long and difficult to get through, but they were always very thought-provoking. \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures weren't particularly engaging, maybe because of the setup of the classroom. It was in a collaborative room and participation was encouraged, but people weren't super engaged and didn't participate a lot. The lectures touched on the readings, but didn't really provide a tangible timeline for important events in American history, which I would have liked. Prof. Sabin would mention events and when they happened, but not go into any detail about what they were\/their significance. Also, I feel like we glossed over some really important periods of history, and spent a ton of time talking about other periods.",
    "Strengths: interesting to consider social and political sides of energy, thorough topics and really interesting readings. Weaknesses: firstly, I think it was excessive to have a final paper that was over 15 pages as well as a sit down final (not too mention a very long one). I also think the general format of the \"leminar\" was a little tricky, since we didn't really get a great lecture-style overview of information from Professor Sabin but we also didn't engage with peers extensively. I think the course could be improved by being strictly a lecture where Sabin gives a contextual overview of the readings (that were usually pretty specific to one aspect of a larger theme) and then have the engagement and participation be from section.",
    "Strengths: My TA was awesome, very helpful when it came to improving my writing. Some of the readings were very interesting, and they can often overlap with contemporary issues. We had a special guest, Steven Mufson, who was very insightful and interesting. Professor Sabin also introduced us to the Yale Library and Zotero, a citing tool that I will probably use for the rest of my time here. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sections were only made available on Thursdays for some reason, which was annoying when scheduling. Also, sometimes the readings and discussion questions don't seem to connect to what were talking about. The lectures were boring and hard to follow; we'll rush though something, and then we're asked what our thoughts are without getting a chance to think. The readings were also very long sometimes, and its hard to get through some of them. Also, there's a final paper AND a final exam (although there's no midterm, just a short paper). There are also unnecessary field trips and movie screenings, but you can honestly just skip them. Most annoying part of the class was the fact that the final was on the last day of the semester.",
    "Interesting material and I enjoyed the small writing assignments.  The leminar style of the course could be improved; I understand it is meant to promote discussion but that is what sections are for; itd be better if Professor Sabin kept lecturing the whole time and left discussion to section",
    "Strengths: The readings are varied, relevant, and fun if you're interested in climate change, environmental policy, and human interactions with the environment more broadly. It was the homework that I looked forward to doing! Section was really strong. I also appreciated the format of the small tables because we were encouraged to get to know people.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture didn't add much beyond what I got from the readings, and it definitely felt like a large portion of the class wasn't doing the readings as consistently. When we had table discussions, it was often a little awkward because it was clear that lots of people hadn't done the reading. I appreciate that Professor Sabin tried to get people engaged and talking in lecture, but I think speaking into a microphone in a class of this size made volunteering to speak seem intimidating.",
    "The content and the readings in this course were fascinating. The energy field trip gave me an opportunity to explore New Haven and learn about the course in the context of where I am living. Additionally, the two movies were a good way to synthesize the course material in a new way. However, I wish the material had been presented in a different way. I felt like I didn't get as much out of the lectures as I wanted to.",
    "TEAL room has to go: the tech never works and the seminar-feel in a large room just doesnt really work. Overall, the course was great. Lectures were interesting and all of the readings were very doable and provided a lot of good info. The semester-long paper made tackling a 12 page paper easy and the final was also very fair.",
    "Strengths: Course material is very interesting, the readings were well chosen, and I enjoyed being in class. Paul Sabin is super friendly and teaches well.\r\nWeaknesses: For a WR, I feel that my writing didn't really improve (I get that this is a gut WR but whatever). There is also no grade feedback whatsoever, so as I am writing this I still have 0 grades on Canvas so like hello what is my grade lmao",
    "I think that the course covered a large amount of information and provided the tools necessary to be successful in the class. Sometimes it was hard to engage in the material during class time, I think the presentation of slides could have been better, because a lot of the gaps in class where we discuss with partners weren't as helpful as just learning from the slides. I did like the set up of discussing broader themes in class, not just being talked at.",
    "While lecture at first felt unorthodox and unnatural due to the seminar approach of asking students to talk to each other and answer questions, I felt the approach encouraged better participation and engagement in lecture.",
    "Interesting readings, good format for sections",
    "This course is extremely well-structured and walks students through history creating a clear timeline and focus on big ideas. The main themes are evident throughout the course and the readings were very applicable, engaging, and diverse.",
    "I though this course did a great job of being engaging with all of the assignments and interactive class. I maybe could have used more lecturing at times, however.",
    "Not super engaging but set up well for conversation, I would say an average class",
    "Strengths: readily available information and teaching staff to guide you\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were disorganized, and your grading\/overall opinion of the course largely depends on the TF you get",
    "Strengths: Professor Sabin clearly is one of if not the expert on the field. It's very multidisciplinary, so students from non-history majors are easily able to incorporate their knowledge to the class. The content is extremely interesting. The course website is well done. The workload is manageable, more than a lecture but way less than a seminar. My section was great. Enjoyed the guest lecture. \r\n\r\nThe okay: the \"leminar\" (lecture-seminar) format grew on me as the semester progressed, but it's definitely not for everyone. Class is comprised of 20% history majors and like 80% STEM looking for a WR, and you can view that in many ways. \r\n\r\nCons: The TEAL classroom was bad (almost entirely due technical issues). Big disparity in TA grading. Professor zooms through slides and doesn't post them till right before midterm\/final, which hurt my own note taking -- either go slower or regularly post the slides",
    "The course is well structured with a clearly outlined schedule and easily accessed readings for each class. Additionally, the writing process for the final paper was well structured and made the last few weeks of the course more manageable than they would have otherwise been. However, having both a final paper and final exam, even with a spread out writing process, made finals period exceptionally stressful, so finding a way to rework the requirements a bit (midterm and final paper, etc.) would be appreciated.",
    "The lecture style is very discussion based which well facilitates engaged learning. Every week was a different focus\/energy source, which at times felt like not long enough to fully understand the nuances that Prof. Sabin talked about.",
    "Strengths: dedicated professor and TAs, they were very accessible and engaged. Class expectations are clear and the course is well structured. The course modules were extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the workload at times. Having a final research paper and final.",
    "Weakness was this course was taught out of order which was confusing and the slides he used were very unhelpful",
    "There were lots of readings, which is a plus and a minus. On one had, I could always find an in depth reading about certain topics I had questions about, but sometimes it felt unreasonable to have so much reading for each class meeting. The primary sources that he had us look at on the class website were very helpful and helped reveal more of the personal-side of each period we discussed. I loved our in-class discussions, as they were organized in a way to always bring different, often smart, ideas onto the table. We also were assigned weekly blog posts which helped facilitate communication among my discussion section. Because the course was a WR credit, we had a long essay due at the end of the semester, but the very structured calendar for working on the paper made it feel like a lot less of a hassle that it really was. The final was tedious, but that is to be expected for a writing credit course.",
    "Strengths: Interesting readings, engaging class discussions, assignments are challenging yet interesting, greater insight into the overall research process (Helpful for other classes), Professor Sabin is a great guy!\r\nWeaknesses: Since it was covering such a broad spectrum, I felt we were unable to focus on some important topics for a long enough time.   Also, I wish I could use my laptop to take notes because I was not able to keep out with the speed of the lecture at times",
    "I think the topics of the course are extremely interesting and relevant. I think that the structure of the course was pretty disorganized.",
    "Strengths: good overview, engaging material, interesting readings, balanced workload\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could get boring\/ it was hard to delineate what was important from big information dumps during lectures",
    "This course was sort of a lecture-seminar, which made it, as far as I know, a very unique experience where I got to know my peers and teacher while soaking up as much information as I would in a normal lecture.\r\n\r\nThe only gripe I have was the room it was in. It could use some retrofitting when it comes to tech, but I believe that it's already been addressed.",
    "I liked the structure of the class  it was a mixture of lecture and discussion. I think possibly discussing the readings more in class and discussion would be helpful to understanding that and create more of an incentive to read.",
    "The content was very well-organized. However, I was not a huge fan of the TEAL classroom, and I think I could have gotten a lot more out of this class in a seminar setting.",
    "This course has great material. That is the highlight for the course--- the material is interesting. The lectures are not engaging. You merely go over the readings, making the lectures seem boring and pretty pointless. The TF sessions are much more engaging. Additionally, this course is a deceptively huge amount of work.",
    "Professor did not abide by initial syllabus  and frequently changed the syllabus"

    "I would definitely recommend this course. I learned so much about our country's history that I never knew was so tied in to our energy usage. The class was insightful for every day life and I feel I am a more knowledgeable and a better person from taking the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The content is extremely useful and important, but information that is not seemingly obvious. The structure of the course works very well, and it is the ideal amount of work for a WR credit.",
    "If you have an interest in either the history of American political economy or climate change, this course covers both quite well.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot in a different classroom setting.",
    "I think if the setup of the class changes to either be a lecture or a seminar, then yes. As it stands, it's a weird class size (~60) in the TEAL classroom, where participation is encouraged but people didn't really participate much. The readings were fascinating and the content of the class is really interesting, I just don't think the class is organized very well.",
    "I would but I would warn them that there is an unexpected amount of work required from the course. The readings are interesting but definitely lengthy, and the weekly canvas posts take a good deal of time to be thoughtful and complete. The second half of the course also definitely ramped up the workload as we had both a final paper and a final exam.",
    "If you're interested in American energy history and the environment, yes. If you just want a writing credit, probably not",
    "Yes, chill writing credit where you see american history in a new light",
    "Yes, but only if you are already interested in the material. If not, the lecture didn't keep me super engaged, so it was only because I really liked the readings and thinking about environmental issues that I feel like I got a lot out of the class.",
    "I think I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in energy studies because the content is very interesting and is very prevalent in our current society, however if you don't focus well in lectures, I would advise against taking the course.",
    "YES!!! Professor Sabin is phenomenal, he is very knowledgable and is very good at discussing subjects and their significance and the themes that connect each topic we discussed. The class field trip was also super interesting (touring New Haven). Overall, this was my favorite course this semester.",
    "Yes-if you are interested in the topic. This course is very enjoyable, so I would recommend it overall.",
    "Personally, I would not recommend this course to people who are not interested in history. I had a lot of trouble staying interested in the course, but I could tell that was just because I am not a history person, so I think it would be unfair for me to say that I wouldn't recommend the course just because it wasn't for me. I think other people really enjoyed it and gained a lot from it, particularly environmental studies students. It provides a lot of good information for that area, but as a STEM major needing a writing credit it got a bit tedious.",
    "This was a CR\/D for me. I attended half of the lectures, which were leminar style in HLH17. Leminars are distracting and inefficient--I'd rather just be lectured at or fully commit to participating in a seminar. Professor Sabin is an entertaining class leader and those lectures that I did attend were engaging. The topics discussed were diverse through the semester which kept things fresh.",
    "Go for it. Sabins great, its interesting but not a terrible time commitment. The readings can be kinda long, but thats about all you need to worry over.",
    "Yes, you will learn about the most important events in American energy history and analyze the political, cultural, social, and economic factors surrounding them.",
    "Yes! This course was very interesting and engaging. The class was as difficult as each student wanted to make it - class was not mandatory and readings were assigned but not specifically tested on them. Students may have chosen to do as much or as little work as they desired to do, and the tests and essays were only loosely based on the class material. However, this class seemed less grade-oriented for me than most classes. If a student is passionate and engaged with the material, they can get a lot out of the class.",
    "Yes, it is extremely interesting and I think gives very important insights into climate change which is really important.",
    "Yes if they need the credit",
    "Yes - the information was very interesting and the teaching fellows are very nice. Collaborative environment. Just know your grade depends on your TF",
    "Overall, I would. I love the topic and content, Professor Sabin is a genuinely nice guy and an above average professor, my TA was great (albeit intense), the workload isn't bad (max ~100 pages of reading a week, a midterm essay, a final essay, a final exam).\r\n\r\nDon't take this course if: you hate Leminars, you're looking for a WR gut (there are easier ones for sure, although this one isn't bad).",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking for a writing credit and\/or EVST majors looking to fulfill class requirements. The material is fascinating and varied, and Professor Sabin is clearly an expert in the field. The course provides a strong background understanding of energy transitions and historical US energy systems, and has therefore contextualized and improved my understanding of similar material in other courses.",
    "Yes! It is incredibly interesting and definitely makes you reevaluate the way that you think about modern energy reliance and the energy industry as a whole.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in energy or history. I am somewhat interested in history so the material is interesting but I struggled to keep up with the courseload because Im not interested as much in energy. But I still managed to power through and make a decent grade.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the course material was quite interesting.",
    "Yes because it is very niche yet very important. There can be no steps forward in climate change mitigation if you dont understand how we got to this point.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who truly is interested in American culture. I wouldn't say it is a gut class due to all of the writing and reading, but it definitely becomes much easier if you are already interested in the subject. Class is always fun, and Sabin's lectures are always voice-recorder worthy. There are also a couple of interesting movie viewings, as well as a \"New Haven Energy History Tour\" on a weekend during the semester which was entertaining, if not a bit strange.",
