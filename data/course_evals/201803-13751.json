    "- I gained a substantial amount of knowledge of Russian history. \r\n- I improved my writing abilities. \r\n- I improved my abilities to form oral arguments and defend them.",
    "This was a very interesting foray into this period of Russian history. You develop a good capacity to prioritize reading and self-guide your engagement with the course's material according to your own interests. This is a good exercise particularly in understanding historical debates in the secondary literature.",
    "Excellent course, learned lots about the period! I improved my writing and research skills."

   "comments": [
    "I think the strength of this course comes from the assignments, the two essays are very manageable and allow you to engage with any topic you want. It is a good degree of freedom. I think that Professor Antonov leads discussion well and knows how to balance his own presence in them with students' contributions. Oftentimes professors are either too involved or not involved enough in discussions. Prof. Antonov was just right. I also think that the source selection was diverse and interesting and allowed for an understanding of the critical debates in Russian imperial history. \r\n\r\nI recommend going forward that more primary sources be included on the syllabus. The only deep engagement with these, other than as quoted in secondary literature, was the midterm paper in which you perform an analysis on a source. Some sources to go along with the secondary readings each week would be helpful in engaging with these Russian figures and ideas on their own terms.",
    "Excellent course!"

    "Absolutely. This is a fantastic course on Russian history. You learn SO much and the seminar is great. The readings are very informative and fascinating.",
    "Yes, absolutely. You will benefit as an historian from the essays and feedback as well as the deep dives into the secondary literature.",
    "Yes! I was a big fan and I already have recommended to friends."
