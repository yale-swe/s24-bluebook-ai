                "This course is excellent. Well designed, thoughtfully taught, and engaging. The personal attention Nathan gave was amazing, as was his pedagogical care, ensuring that we each were learning the material and also developing our own ideas and intellectual trajectories in sound design. The material is diverse and interesting, relevant and together forms a good basis of the sound design.",
                "Strengths: The projects are fantastic; the readings are pretty interesting, especially The Dramatic Imagination; the critiques are really thoughtful; and Nathan is such a wonderful and brilliant professor and designer of sound. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I didnt love watching the tutorials on how to use the DAW software in class, which we only did twice or so. Id rather we learn the software on our own then just use class to think though it conceptually, which is what we did the majority of the time and what I preferred."

Of course, we had to focus directly on sound output from a device rather than in a live space, so the type of aural experience was a bit different than a theatrical one, but nonetheless Id made it easier to really focus on the sound through the headphones. \r\n\r\nI didnt love watching the tutorials on how to use the DAW software in class, which we only did twice or so.

                "Absolutely. Nathan is a phenomenal teacher and mentor. This class helped me not only to learn about sound and greatly improve my own abilities as a designer, but also to understand and appreciate the many other components of a successful theater production. The course is a wonderful mixture of practical advice\/application and engaging artistic discussion. Even if you are not a sound designer (many folks in this class were not) its absolutely worth taking. It was supportive, fun and incredibly helpful. I will be referencing discussions I had in this course for years to come. A wonderful experience overall!"
