                "This class was my first exposure to proof-based math, and I'm really glad that I took it this semester. I really appreciated the bottom-up approach of this class, where we proved fundamental concepts and built upon them to uncover more sophisticated results. We learned about the foundational concepts in linear algebra such as linear transformations, row and column operations, determinants, and eigenvectors in a rigorous and complete manner. While this class is challenging, I believe that it is great preparation for higher-level proof-based math classes.",
                "Learned standard introductory linear algebra (topics available on canvas syllabus). This course assumes a beginner's understanding of proofs (if/iff structure and techniques such as contradiction, induction, contrapositive, etc.), but can be easily picked up with practice. This is a solid class to develop your logical thinking without getting into too much pure math, and some of the concepts covered (linear independence, determinants, eigenvalues/vectors, etc.) is very useful for other STEM classes.",
                "I learned major topics in linear algebra, but I also learned how to write clear proofs implicitly through the grading on problems sets and exams.",
                "I learned linear algebra from a theoretical standpoint. This was my second time taking a lin alg course; my first had been less theoretical & more focused on MATLAB. This was something new & certainly challenging. Learning lin alg always gets me thinking abt the versatility of mathematics  the many ways you can teach it & the many ways you can apply it.",
                "practiced proof writing, covered fields, vector spaces (subspaces, linear combination and independence, bases, dimension, Steinitz-exchange Lemma), linear transformations, matrices and their properties, solving systems of linear equations using matrices, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization, inner product spaces, Gram-Schmidt process",

                "Strengths: The flow of actually learning linear algebra was pretty good and everything built on top of each other. Weaknesses: The class moved wayyyyy too slow. This is not an intensive class, we had less homework than 225 and it didn't feel \"intensive\" anywhere.",
                "I thought the course was a little disorganized, but the graders/ULA were very nice. Ebru also lectures well in my opinion.",
                "Ebru is great, but it's a pretty standard class so not much change is needed.",
                "Very solid course that is what it says in the description.",
                "A strength of the course is the undergraduate learning assistant office hours. These office hours offer assistance on the problem sets, which are challenging, and review for the exams. A weakness of the course is that the problem sets take large amounts of time to complete.",
                "it's a pretty normal linear algebra course, only weekness is that it was a 9:25 am for 3 times a week",
                "The strengths of this class are the professor's engaging teaching style and the office hours which are invaluable for getting help with the problem sets. The weaknesses of this course are the variability in test difficulty (e.g. sometimes they are manageable, other times they are extremely difficult) and the uneven pacing (e.g. we spent weeks on determinants and less than a week on inner products and orthogonalization). I would recommend making the test difficulty more consistent and adjusting the pacing so that all topics get an appropriate amount of coverage.",
                "The class is taught very well - from the ground up and with great detail. I also like that this class taught me math that seemed abstract and general at first, but had interesting specific matrix and geometric representations.",
                "The strength of this class is the peer collaboration. I made many friends through this class, as we would study together for tests and discuss class topics together. One weakness of this course is the grading and feedback of the problem sets. I still struggle to understand how I missed some questions, and it affected my confidence in solving some problems in problem sets.",
                "I love that Ebru posts lecture notes (even organized by date), as I can sometimes miss or miswrite something in my notes and going through lecture notes really helps me while studying for exams. Her lectures are engaging and generally not confusing. Psets are challenging but never impossible (I usually had to phone a friend though); Gradescope grading can be very delayed though. Max (the ULA) was GREAT  super helpful & approachable/reachable.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Toprak is passionate about the subject and covered the topics rigorously, lectures were engaging, Dr. Toprak was helpful both in class and in office hours, ULA review sessions before exams had good practice problems\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none"

                "Yes, honestly this year's 226 class might have been easier workload-wise compared to 225, it is a great way for a student interested in the Math major or adjacent to meet others with the same aspirations.",
                "Definitely if you're a math major (or adjacent), it's barely any more difficult than 225, you can pick up on how to do proofs very quickly, and it's not much more than 225.",
                "Yes, it's a very fun course that teaches math well!",
                "Yes, absolutely. Ebru teaches so well and covers the topics so clearly, homeworks were very helpful. Downside was that the final exam was really hard, but the problems were very interesting to think through and I really think Ebru is an upside over taking 225.",
                "Yes! Amazing introduction to proof-based math. Don't take alongside other hard courses, as the p-sets can take a couple days to complete.  Having previous linear algebra experience will not advantage you in the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who have already taken linear algebra. If a student has not taken linear algebra, I would recommend taking Math 225, which offers a less intensive introduction to the course material.",
                "If you are a math adjacent major, yes. Otherwise, no, because the skills you learn are not super applicable to other fields. Also, if it is 9am again next year, please be cautious because you will skip class if you are not a morning person.",
                "I would recommend this class to a student who has already taken linear algebra in high school and would like a more rigorous treatment of the subject at Yale. The content is very rewarding because it allows you to grasp concepts best answered by proof-based math, such as why the determinant is characterized by certain properties or why linear transformations and matrices are isomorphic to each other. Note that the class is very self-selective and and as a result, the curves are either non-existent or a lot lower than they would be in MATH 225. Nevertheless, the professor and ULA are both very nice and supportive and will help you succeed in this class if you choose to take it.",
                "Yes. Even if you don't intend on pursuing pure math in the future, it's a good experience to take either this class or MATH 225 (very similar, depends on your prof) since linear algebra is quite different from, for example, your average calculus class, in that it works a different, more logical part of your brain. Also, some important concepts in this course (ie. linear independence, determinants, eigenvalues/vectors) show up in doing calculations for other classes, like CS and physics, so it's nice to get an understanding of what they fundamentally represent. If you're absolutely sure that you would rather just learn how to apply linear algebra to compute problems then take MATH 222, but I still highly recommend giving this class or 225 a try.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to people of stronger logical reasoning and more experience writing proofs, as I found this class enjoyably challenging. I would not recommend to students who lack one or both of the above skills.",
                "Yes; linear algebra is beautiful & Ebru strongly believes in that! Personally, I found the course challenging, but the challenge is a good type that stretches your brain.",
                "Absolutely, the professor is great, the class is interesting, and linear algebra is fundamental for quantitative fields.",
                "Absolutely! I learned a ton from this course and Id already taken linear algebra in high school. Definitely would not recommend you take this course if you havent already taken a linear class, but if you have this course gives you a deeper understanding and extends many of the essential ideas in an intro linear course. If you are thinking of skipping taking a college linear course, dont!!",
                "Yes if this is your first proof-based course. The proofs themselves are not hard, so you get time to learn how to write proofs."
