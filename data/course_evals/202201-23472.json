I felt it was a safe space to share opinions, even if mine were contrary to someone else's.\r\nWeaknesses: felt like too much reading at times.  Sometimes, the journal entries felt more like a chore rather than a reflection.  It would help if these were not every week.  Spent way too much time on ancient philosophers for my liking.  We also never got to roleplay the NJP.",

Peer-to-peer discussions were always insightful and exciting. instructor was excellent.\r\nWeaknesses: Due to high amount of coverage, some schools of thoughts were covered superficially."

It could be interesting in the future as I've heard they are now giving out Yale College graduation credit for this course.  If that is the case, then the course should be broadened so other students will find it interesting.  The time slot is not very fun though (7:00am), so be warned."
