The most valuable part of this course was the discussions with my peers during our meeting time - we fleshed out many ideas and positions that I will continue to think about far beyond this course. \r\nI also developed better writing and critical analysis skills, as well as improved my verbal communication skills.",
                "I learnt to draw connections between the LGBTQ+ movements and legislations between various countries. I also learnt to apply WGSS theories to the real-life politics of different countries. The insights I gained in this course were manifold, but my main takeaway is the critical lens through which I now view transnational LGBTQ+ advocacy and the LGBTQ+ ideals and politics of the Global North.",
                "I learned a ton in this course. Not only content about sexuality in all of these places in the world, but frames of thinking. I learned so much about queer liberation and inclusive social justice movements around the world. Truly so much!",

                "Strengths: Very balanced in terms of reading, writing, and discussion; great professor and classmates; wonderful learning environment; everyone took the material seriously and cared deeply about the issues we discussed\r\nWeaknesses: I wish it met more frequently! We never seemed to have enough time",
                "Strengths: \r\n- fostered a genuine curiosity and love for learning \r\n- the class environment was second to none, students and the professor alike were extremely kind and respectful \r\n- the discussions allowed everyone to participate at the level they felt comfortable with \r\n- the class surveyed different regions of the world \r\n- the professor is very insightful and challenged our thinking \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- at the beginning of the semester, the class could have involved a few more free-flow discussions, which happened toward the middle and end of the semester and was great",
                "Strengths:\r\n- the readings in this course are AMAZING. I learned so much from them.\r\n- Prof Reid created such a wonderful, inclusive classroom environment and the 7 of us became quite close\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I didn't love the weekly response papers - I felt that to make a strong enough argument about a reading I had to disagree with it and I didn't disagree with one reading a week. Maybe we could have one or two papers in which we make an original argument with research (like the final paper but shorter). We could also have weekly or every-two-weeks canvas posts about the readings. I find that this works well in other courses. \r\n- I loved the supplemental add-ons to the course: the videos and Paisley Currah (!!) were great. I just wish we had adjusted the readings schedule to accommodate these? We ended up not being able to fully discuss all the readings and I would sometimes forget about them by the time we discussed them 2 weeks later.",

                "100%! This seminar is one of my two favorite courses taken at Yale. Professor Reid is a phenomenal course instructor who fosters a generative learning environment and is truly curious to learn more about the way his students think. The syllabus allowed me to expand my understanding of LGBTQ+ politics to other regions of the world. Additionally, the assignments always allowed me to write about topics that I was genuinely interested in. Finally, this course is another one in the WGSS department that really helped me question and adjust the way I think.",
                "Yes! This is a great Yale course. The content was super interesting and the workload is manageable. I loved doing the readings - they were great. You learn so much about worldwide activism, the history of queer activists movements, and knowledge about power dynamics within them to be aware of. Super great course and Prof Reid is great.",
