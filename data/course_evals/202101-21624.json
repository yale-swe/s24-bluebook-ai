The weakness is that there was a lot of extra writing, reflection, exercises and warmups during class that were very time consuming and not as helpful/applicable beyond the class. Unfortunately the nitty gritty work felt like 20% of what we did and everything else felt like 80%.",

However, I'm not sure I would recommend it for people who have a good deal of experience. Oliveras is a great teacher when it comes to working on scenes and songs, but there was a lot of extra reflecting, writing, and other activities that took up a lot of time and weren't very useful for what we did in class.
