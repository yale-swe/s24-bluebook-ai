                "Strengths:\r\nProfessor Escoffery gives me goosebumps every time he plays. He comes from the old bebop tradition, but is of course well-versed in every aspect of jazz and its theory. Assignments are all reasonable and help you learn a lot. \r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nVery few. Only wish class wasn't so early in the morning.",
                "The course is extremely strong. Professor Escoffery is very talented and beyond that, is eager to share his knowledge. Because of the setup of the class, it is not the strongest environment for practicing technical skills on your instrument, but that is not the goal of the class and can be done individually in a practice room. The goal of this class, which is achieves strongly, is to improve musical knowledge and more specifically jazz improvisation skills in a way which can be applied individually.",
                "Could use more written resources as all the theory was verbally communicated and if you missed something there was no way of knowing. More in class playing would be good, sometimes we ended early and instead we could have played at least",
                "Strengths: Professor Escoffery is an excellent teacher and explains the music theory while also giving us very practical performance skills so that we can play this important music and use it in our own expression. The music curriculum at Yale could be improved by offering more jazz classes like this one and more opportunities to study and practice jazz."

                "Yes its a fun chill class and you are forced to do transcriptions which are essential for jazz.",
                "If you are interested in jazz and have some background in improvising, definitely! This is an excellent course that gives students both theory and practical skills. Yale should really offer more jazz classes."
