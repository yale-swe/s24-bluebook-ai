                "This class gave me so much insight into the plethora of global lyrics, of all the various forms, voices, and perspectives they take. I learned how to analyze poetry in a way that takes into account the meaning of lyrics, rhyme, translation, and other literary forms. It allowed me to breathe a new life into the poetry and to find my voice through each poetry exercise that challenged me.",
                "Through this class, I gained a much better awareness and knowledge of poetry from different time periods and parts of the world. My previous experience with poetry had focused primarily on western poetry and modern poetry, so it was great to expand my awareness of different types of poetry, especially formalist poetry.",
                "I read poetry from different time periods and literary traditions, and I learned the historical, political, and cultural contexts they were written in. I also practiced comparing different poems and their translations, and I thought deeply about what lyric is and what makes it different from other poetic forms.",
                "I learnt to read poetry quickly in volumes as well as up close; I learnt to engage with different poetic forms and traditions; and I wrote my own poetry.",
                "How to close read and analyze poetry from across time and space, how to write poetry in a plethora of styles, how to engage with lyric from multiple angles and through a global lens",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge about poetry and about different traditions. I learned to pay attention to things that I didn't necessarily know to notice before. Importantly, I learned that \"bad\" poetry is still poetry...",
                "I learned how to analyze poetry by starting with simple observations then digging deeper into why the writer may have chosen a certain structure or rhyme scheme for their poem. I also learned to experiment more with writing poetry."

            "comments": [
                "The strength of this course is how we engage deeply with all the poets that we read in the classroom the exercises that push us to understand the forms that we are reading, and the class discussions that bring this poetry to life. It made me learn that reading poetry can be as simple as likes and dislikes, and the music of hearing it being read out loud. All of the poets that we heard from were also wonderful and well-chosen. Each one brought their own diversity and unique approach to form and lyrics that made reading them such a great experience.",
                "This class was excellent overall, and I really enjoyed the syllabus and the style of teaching. I would have liked to have had more poetry assignments to have the chance to try out different poetry forms for myself, but the flexibility on the final project gave me that opportunity to try writing poetry. That's also more a matter of personal preference rather than an inherent strength or weakness in the course.",
                "Strengths: 1) Professor Ramachandran and our TF Jae are some of the most amazing teachers Ive met at Yale. They were incredibly knowledgeable about the poems we read each week, and they always displayed such great care and appreciation with their language when we talked about the poems. Above all else, Prof R and Jae cared about us first as people and were always understanding about what students were going through and what was happening in the world; they genuinely wanted us to take care of ourselves first as well as enjoy the class. 2) It was a once in a lifetime experience to meet the guest poets that came to the class, and we even had the amazing opportunity to eat dinner with them (completely paid for by Yale). 3) The poetry exercises were so fun to do and really pushed us to practice and experiment with the forms and subjects we were learning about in class. 4) The course content was incredible! I was genuinely invested in the poems we read each week and I never wanted to skip class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NONE",
                "No weaknesses. It was an extremely enriching class especially with the poet guest lectures, class visits, and dinners. I was able to reflect seriously on poetry and lyric in a way I never have and I found a great many poems and poets I loved. Writing our own poetry with a focus on process and not product was also an excellent addition to the curriculum!",
                "A big strength is the creative work involved! It was really special to be able to practice some of the things we learned about by writing our own poetry.",
                "The Franke Lectures were a great way to gain more insight into poetry and the different ways people think about and write poetry. I also think the diversity of the syllabus made the class very engaging. I especially enjoyed learning about ekphrasis and erasure poetry."

This class was made for everyone and all experience levels with poetry. Regardless of if youre an experienced poet or someone curious about poetry with little experience\/knowledge, this class is accessible and fun for all! I learned so much about poetry and the world!",
                "Yes absolutely! Prof. Ramachandran is a wonderful discussion leader and our engagement with the material was always so surprising and rewarding.",

Great professor, interesting material, and unique opportunities to engage with guest speakers. Additionally, as a person with an interest in creative writing, this course offered me the opportunity to write my own poetry in conversation with the material, which allowed me to engage with the work we read from a new perspective.",
                "Yes absolutely, professor Ramachandran is an incredible teacher."
