Through tracing the development of Detective Fiction I was able to watch the progression of tropes, themes, and societal attitudes. This course also improved my writing skills and elevated the level of my seminar discussions.",

My only complaint would be how quickly we had to move through each text (not that the reading was rushed, simply that discussion could have always gone further). That being said, I understand that as the course spans centuries it is important to include many texts and there is not unlimited time in the semester. The pacing and scope of the assignments was good and the lack of prompts allowed for papers to focus on areas of interest rather than conforming to a predetermined idea.",
                "Great books and positive discussion!",

                "Absolutley. Such a fun course, the work didn't even feel like work. Learned more about how to read closely and catch important themes, while also learning about a very interesting genre.",
                "Absolutely! This course is incredible. One of my favorite Yale courses.",
                "Yes, it was so fun! Professor Grimstad picked some great materials to study and really knows how to maintain discussion.",
                "Yes! It's pretty fun, the material is fun, and professor grimstad obviously loves the genre.",
                "Yes - it was a lot of fun and a great way to learn a new skill",
                "Absolutely. Professor Grimstad is fantastic, and he really puts his all into making his class an interesting, thought-provoking, and enjoyable time. Even for someone who isn't necessarily so into detective fiction, it is thought about in such a way as to discuss important themes and ideas that can be more general. If one does like the genre, it is all the more fun and novel. It is simple in its style: reading, thinking, and talking, with some papers along the way. It is not too much work, and it is worth doing the work because that is the only way to ensure you get the most meaningful experience.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student. I think that the accessibility of the texts and the nature of \"lowbrow\" literature allows for all people to engage with the work and the richness of the materials provides ample room for deep analysis. The discussions in the class were substantial and enjoyable, and the content was fascinating. Also, because of its specificity, this course fills a niche that no others would. Unlike many other English courses that can have overlapping syllabi, Detective Fiction explores a fairly untapped area of literature in terms of study. The texts were engaging, exciting, and manageable and the discussions were substantial.",
                "Yes, I would. I would especially recommend this course to those who love mystery novels and movies and want to get a better sense of the genre. The readings were interesting and the class discussions were engaging. This class was probably the most enjoyable one I took this semester.",
                "Yes!! If you have any interest in detective fiction, this is a great course to take (especially with Paul Grimstad!) The discussions are so interesting."
