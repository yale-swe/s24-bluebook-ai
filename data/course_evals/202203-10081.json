I gained a good sense of different anthropologists' contributions to modes of approaching the field of linguistics.

                "I loved how Prof. Kockelman engages with the material and thoughts. I learned so much from just listening, and it fit my learning style very well.",
                "If you're interested in the content, it's great. The content is also broad enough that you can definitely find lots of interesting things there, you just need to be happy with the occasional heavy-duty linguistics reading/language. I enjoyed hearing about Q'eqchi' and would have liked to explore more different cultures in detail, but overall think the course was very well organized.",
                "Professor Kockelman is a gem, highly recommend taking a class with him. He has a great mind and it was interesting to see his connections between all of our readings, which at first seem somewhat unrelated. Even though the class is a seminar, it felt more of a lecture at times. I was happy just listening to the professor for the most part. The work consists of a reading response each week, and then a 12pg paper at the end of the semester. I felt a little unprepared to write that, so I would have liked a smaller paper where I could have had some of my ideas challenged.",
                "Overall great course. The professor is the best - super nice, passionate about the topic, and funny. The class could be a bit more interactive - its stated as a seminar but really functions more like a lecture. However it's interesting material if you like the readings.",
                "Kockelman is amazing! Truly a gem of a professor. The material is rlly interesting. Every seminar/lecture follows on seamlessly from the previous one. The workload is so reasonable. The grading is ideal / nothing to stress about.\r\n\r\nSeminars can sometimes feel a bit lecture-y. Great, on the one hand, bc class always feels productive (no awkward silences / lack of conversation structure). Bad, on the other hand, if you're not a confident student. If you want to contribute to discussion you have to make yourself heard.",
                "Strengths: The professor is really excited about the material which makes it more exciting to learn about.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At first it can seem like the material is really advanced, but you just have to stick with it. Also there wasn't a lot of guidance on the final paper or preparation assignments beforehand.",
                "Dr. Kockelman is an engaging lecturer + uses diagrams that makes the content easier to understand! He also frequently makes connections between the readings that will help you write your final essay. I also received detailed feedback on my submissions and final paper outline.",
                "Strengths: I loved the format of the class and how we discussed in class the readings we did for homework--it really reinforced the information and made class more understandable. There were plenty of opportunities to engage with the information during class and provide examples or ask questions, even though the class was mostly taught in lecture format. I found it really helpful that Professor Kockelman connected the different readings for us and put them into conversation with one another.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the readings were just too long, and I felt like I couldn't get much out of them because of their abstractness and use of terms that were basically foreign to me. Sometimes I felt like what we were discussing went way over my head when we learned about the mathematical side of linguistics (linguistics is very mathematical). To be fair, this was my first linguistics course.",
                "Strengths: final paper was fun to write (and I hate writing), having to do the final essay outline as a homework assignment was a really good idea\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings are pretty dense, having to do readings over breaks"

                "yes! especially if you love thinking about thinking",
                "Yes - if you're interested in linguistics and anthropology then it's great. It's not as intense as other linguistics classes, but some readings are definitely a little technical. Professor Kockelmann and our TF Spencer were both great, the course was well organized and not stressful.",
                "Some really interesting texts that I'm glad I've read. I would definitely recommend you take something with Professor Kockelman, if only for his amazing laugh. Sometimes it would take us by surprise, two hours into the class, and everyone else would start laughing too. It's too hard to describe so you'll have to take the class to find out what it sounds like.",
                "Definitely! The grading system is interesting in that there are really no real grades until the final paper. Reading notes are graded on completion. So you have to maintain your knowledge and notes so you can perform well on the final, because its 40% of the grade. Overall though its a good anthropology class , combines two important aspects of the field, and you get to learn from someone who is so experienced in the field!",
                "Absolutely. One of the best classes I've taken here. Just such a damn good class.\r\nThe course is engaging and well-organized. You actually retain + deeply understand all the material as the weeks go by. Never had that with any other class.\r\nAlso Kockelman is just the goat. Big-shot academic AND a phenomenal teacher. Rare. Don't miss out.",
                "I would. I was really interested in the subject, so I found the course fascinating, but I could see how someone who wasn't as enthusiastic might have difficulties engaging.",
                "Yes! Definitely recommend this course if you are interested in formalizing your understanding of structural linguistics.",
                "Yes. The only homework until the final paper is to write up and submit notes on the readings before class each week (highly consistent). If you are interested in gaining an overview of linguistics from an anthropological perspective, I highly recommend this class.",
                "Maybe it was because Im not an anthropology major and this was my first anthropology class that I didnt enjoy it, but it was really boring. And the discussion was primarily between students and the professor, rather than among ourselves, so it was hard to participate. Prof lectured for the majority of the class and then people would ask him questions, so it wasnt super engaging"
