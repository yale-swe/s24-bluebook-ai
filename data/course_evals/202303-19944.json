                "One of the greatest strengths of this class is its syllabus and the readings it places focus on. Majority of the texts are written by or about people of color and center underrepresented narratives in academia. I felt that the selection of literature was great as someone interested in ethnic studies, history, and race. The professor is another strength of the class. I feel that Professor Baynes-Ross is incredibly knowledgeable and insightful and that I learned so much from her alone. A weakness of the class is its structuring of writing assignments. The first essay was very challenging for me because instructions were not clear and students were expected to do work completely alone and with a quick turn around time to gauge our writing levels. However, I feel that this made it very hard for me to complete the assignment to the best of my ability. The two papers that followed also had an essence of 'do it on your own' and I often felt very lost and unsupported in my writing/research. Sometimes the feedback on my writing wasn't very clear and seemed to lead me in several different directions which was frustrating."
