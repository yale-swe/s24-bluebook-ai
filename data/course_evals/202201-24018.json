Almost every case\/ story that was mentioned\/ part of the reading was new knowledge to me, which I find quite embarrassing that the US would go through so much to ignore and erase their abusive ways towards the Asian community.",

                "You read lots of legal texts throughout this course. As such, it gives you both a historically and legally grounded understanding of Asian American history. It also gives you familiarity in reading legal jargon, which ended up being helpful for my other classes as well."

                "Definitely loved the topics and awareness that this court brought me, although it was hard at times to get through the material. Moreover, it was tough going through the readings each week when they were so similar in the way that Asians were treated. Some readings were repetitive.",
                "The structure and content of the class was amazing. The readings plus other forms of materials (videos, podcasts) were chosen very well and really gave a complete story of Asians and U.S. Law. I also loved that Professor Tanaka was not afraid to push back on points made by students. The weaknesses of the course was that sometimes the discussions became repetitive and sometimes we ran out of material to discuss.",
                "Loved having a guest speaker \r\nLove our organic discussions \r\nWould like to see more south and south East Asian materials",
                "The courses scope is definitely its strength. We cover an incredibly large time frame as well as range of topics. I think discussions could be a little more focused, however. Sometimes reading such a large breadth meant we didnt spend too much time focusing and analyzing each text."

                "Yes, I think so much of Asian American history is ignored and erased, and with the lingering effects of the pandemic having such a negative impact on the Asian community, I think its so important to learn about the past.",
                "Yes! I love this course. I think that everyone should learn Asian American history considering how the public schools do not teach it. I learned a lot of things that I did not know, and I considered myself to be fairly educated on the topic. The course was really well organized and all the readings were interesting. The readings weren't too overwhelming and there was a nice balance of court opinions, articles for law reviews, podcasts, videos, and news stories. I think the material is really relevant and Professor Tanaka is really understanding and nice.",
                "Yes, great way to learn and discuss Asian history and understand the Asian experience",
                "I would recommend if you want to learn more about the law! You read a lot of legal texts and gain a lot of familiarity in those fields. But if you want a more historically grounded class, it might not be the best class for you."
