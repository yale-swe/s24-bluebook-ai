You also develop the skill of how to read and comprehend research papers. In addition, you how to conduct some of the experiments in a hands-on environment.",

We primarily focused on models of language representation, from the symbolic to neural networks, and looked at how a variety of linguistic structures, from individual sounds to grammatical sentences, were stored, activated, and used in the mind. We looked at developments in the field of linguistics by examining research, which allowed us to understand past perspectives and how they have evolved over time. I also gained an appreciation for all that is yet to be discovered in cognitive science and the significance those developments would have."

Homeworks were hard but really improved my understanding of the content. \r\nweaknesses: nothing outstanding, but the class is notified of a homework 1-2 weeks before they are due, so it's hard to plan ahead and know when to expect homework.",
                "This course covers a lot of really interesting material, and the professor is very engaging. Two weaknesses: 1) there is an overwhelming amount of material at times, and lecture can move quite fast, and 2) the assignments are not very transparent, for example we did not know the schedule of assignments ahead of time and we never got to look at our grades exams because Prof Frank reuses questions from year to year. This lack of transparency made learning more difficult.",
                "The course is well organized, but the lectures can be a bit boring. Also, having both a final exam and a final project felt like a lot.",
                "The material is presented in a good way and it can be engaging at times, but sometimes the content isn't that interesting and becomes boring/dull. The concepts can also be difficult to grasp but the homeworks help.",
                "Not what I expected. No clear or definitive conclusions were drawn, and I can tell exactly what I got from this course. The lectures were also very disorganized, starting some classes in the middle of lectures. The lack of organization and structure made it difficult to follow and prepare for each class.",
                "strengths: great professor, really engaging\r\nweaknesses: slides aren't always clear",
                "This course could be improved by making lecture recordings accessible earlier, rather than publishing them a couple of days before the final. A strength of this class was the use of interactive examples to help keep students engaged and learning.",
                "Could be interesting for students very interested in Linguistics---if you are just taking this to see if you like CogSci/Language do NOT take this course.",
                "Strengths: very in depth \r\nweaknesses: only for someone who is very knowledgeable and interested in linguistics. I took this as part of the cog sci breadth requirement and regret it - not for intro level students.",
                "Readings could be cut down",
                "The course is well-organized, I think. The lectures follow a logical sequence though somehow I don't know what the main takeaway of the course was. That might be simply because of the nature of this young discipline, as claimed in class. One thing that could definitely be improved is the assessment of the assignments. The grades and comments are often released later than the next assignment is due, so there is no room for improvement.",
                "The course is genuinely interesting and lectures were well done. I also found the PSETs engaging, although grading could be confusing/ lacked opportunities for partial credit. Overall ran smoothly, though.",
                "The course covers many different topics and sometimes it feels like it moves a bit quickly. However, it provides an interesting and comprehensive intro to linguistics through a cognitive science perspective.",
                "Sometimes the information seemed to be over complicated and made it harder to learn the actual concepts because prof was using difficult vocab",
                "It's a really great course. It covers a wide range of topics that all work to unpack what language can tell us about the human mind.\r\nWeaknesses: I don't know if it was necessary to have both a final paper and a final exam. Perhaps a larger paper due sometime in the middle of the semester? Having the two biggest assignments/assessments of the whole course due within four days of each other was a little tough.",
                "The lectures for this class are always in incredible. There is always something new to learn and blow your mind. However, sometimes they can feel clouded by the mass of details you need to learn and remember for the exams. Another strength is that there are a lot of TFs, so there are always office hours and discussion section to go to for questions and supplementary learning. And another weakness is that the homeworks sort of pop up out of nowhere, as there is no set schedule, so you never know when they will happen, so you can't plan.",
                "The course did well at going in depth in the content.",
                "The strengths of the course are the engaging and well-structured lecture material. Professor Frank is a very enthusiastic lecturer, and I loved the ordering of the studies he presented; it felt like unfurling a problem through each lesson.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are that I felt as if section could be made more interactive.",
                "Some studies are kind of hard to follow and lectures sometimes felt like we were just jumping around but the professor is very enthusiastic about the topic which made this course a little better",
                "Strength: professor always had good energy\r\nWeaknesses: Office hours were not that helpful, I oftentimes left feeling as confused as when I came. Lectures covered too much material and didn't designate enough time for each topic",
                "The use of current research papers instead of a textbook was very effective and makes a lot of sense for the subject. This can definitely be applied to other classes Ive taken!",
                "I found the content of the course to be interesting",
                "The material is very interesting, but often the 75-minute lectures had too much information. It would have been a lot more enjoyable if we had been assigned TFs and had two 50-minute lectures and a section (instead of having optional sessions that were a bit disorganized).",
                "the material is truly incredible and i feel like one really learns a lot in every class. i feel this is both the strength and the weakness of the course, in that i wish i had more time and assignments and quizzes to appreciate the material.",
                "Amazing overview of the field",
                "I think this course is taught well but there definitely are a lot of difficult and confusing concepts that I think would be helpful if they were reviewed an extra time or two to clarify the topic better. But I do think the weekly sections were helpful in doing that at times but I would have liked more review of the challenging concepts in class. I think the assignments were also challenging but a helpful check in to see what we were understanding and what was still confusing.",
                "This course was very thorough and in depth with its content, but there were too many terms and concepts to memorize that it got overwhelming at times",
                "I thought the content was interesting but the overall structure of the course was confusing.",
                "I think there were good resources available to improve my learning in this class, but they seemed generally underutilized. For example, discussion sections were optional, but I often gained more from attending them than just going to lectures. Additionally, the study guides provided to us before exams were comprehensive and extremely useful but also lacked a lot of information, meaning the extra work you did was often an educated guess at what mattered most. Also, I would have appreciated a clearer syllabus and expectations, with set dates for lecture topics, homework, and exams."

                "Yes, if you're interested in linguistics or language and cognitive science.",
                "If you like linguistics then sure. I didn't know if I would or not so I took the course and discovered that I don't really. I kind of regret taking the class but also it wasn't that bad and I can understand how others would find it interesting.",
                "No. If you need a linguistics course, there are probably better ones. This class did not live up to its name well. And if it did, it was too poorly structured and organized for me to understand anything.",
                "Yes, definitely. Professor Frank is articulate, kind, and funny. He makes lectures very engaging.",
                "If you truly love linguistics or you are planning to credit D the course, yes. If you're not fully interested in the content or linguistics does not come naturally to you, it's hard to stay engaged and keep up, as some of the content is very technical.",

                "Yes definitely. Learned a lot of interesting stuff.",
                "Only if you think you will be engaged in learning about linguistic structures and experiments every week. It is easy to lose motivation and cease to get much out of the class. Prof. Frank is very nice and actually does a good job making lectures as interesting/engaging as possible, but it is still tough to stay focused if you're not too interested in the topic. The workload is low, though dates for homework assignments are not decided ahead of time, but you always have several days to complete them. The midterm and final were maybe the most creative exams I have taken here; they required application beyond memorization and were somewhat difficult but curved.",

                "No. Only if you have background in linguistics. I have background in cognitive science and found it very difficult.",
                "Yes especially if you love the subject",
                "Yes, if you are interested in linguistics specifically. I took the course as a way to better understand cognition and LLMs, and think I probably could have done without some of the depth in certain areas. Overall a great introduction to an interesting field; would recommend.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in learning about linguistics.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "If you are interested in cognitive science or linguistics, then absolutely. Or honestly, even if you aren't, this class offers a good introduction to both and Bob Frank is an incredible lecturer, so if it sounds interesting, take it!",
                "Yes, it's a very interesting course for anyone, no background required.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The workload is manageable, but you come away having taken in clear takeaways about the nature of cognition and language which you can apply to future linguistics or cognitive science classes.",
                "The exams are hard but if you are interested in linguistics this might be an interesting course.",
                "I don't think so. Lectures had some engaging material, but were largely repetitive and rushed. While there was not a substantial amount of homework, it was challenging as it often covered a topic that we barely touched on in lecture",
                "I would recommend the course to students who are interested in cognitive science AND linguistics. Despite this being an intro course, it's not easy and the grading is on the harsher side. Aside from the exams, the class is very enjoyable.",
                "for cognitive science prerequisites, yes",
                "I would recommend this class but it definitely has some challenging concepts so as long as they are okay with that then yes I would recommend this course.",
                "If you are very interested in linguistics, then yes.",
                "I would recommend for someone who is interested in the topic",
                "As someone with prior experience with linguistics and who wanted to take this course to expand and deepen that knowledge, I greatly enjoyed this class. However, I could understand how someone primarily interested in cognitive science would struggle with what we covered or find it boring. It mainly applied linguistic ideas in a cognitive framework, and sometimes we would learn certain linguistic ideas without the cognition aspect, or it wouldn't be incorporated for a while. In my opinion, I felt like there was a good mix of topics that excited me and those that I could have done without. Still, I do feel like I had an understanding of why we were learning everything that we did. It was also a class where I did not have to devote a huge amount of energy to understanding what I learned and perform well on assignments. I really only needed to do work leading up to the exams. So I would recommend if you are remotely interested in linguistics, its relation to cognitive science, and want a relatively low work course.",
