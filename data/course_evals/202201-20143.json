                "I enjoyed learning more about the practice of studying history and working with archival documents. My spoken and written academic French also improved by taking this course.",
                "By reading an incredible diversity of French literature from the 17th century, I gained a great deal of understanding for the myth building process of Louis XIV.",
                "I thought that this class was going to be like one of those guided tours you go on as a tourist, through the Chteau de Versailles. Instead, this class taught me vastly more than that, including the political and social ramifications of the Chteau, how it played into the role of King Louis XIV as the all powerful Roi Soleil, it's role in the advancements of French technology, how it was important to famous writers and women at the time, I could go on.",
                "This is a great course if you want to learn a lot of fascinating information about Versailles and improve your French speaking, reading, and writing skills.",
                "I grew immensely through this class: first, I've never spoken more in a French class! This was my first advanced French course, and I was relieved by how welcoming (small, but mighty!) a class environment Prof. Schuwey created. We covered so many elements of XVII French society, a vibrant hub of (always political!) creation: the perils of Court Society, the propaganda campaign that elevated Versailles to a supernatural level of cultural hegemony, the tightening tides of Catholicism (and resistance), the webs of communication that redefined peoples relationship to power. Also had the chance to write about personal topics of interest! Plus we got to visit the Beinecke and handle (with our hands!!) documents we had already gotten to know online!"

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Prof. Schuwey is a fantastic teacher. The discussions we had were active and insightful, and I thought we got a good mixture of reaching our own conclusions while learning from existing literature/research. \r\nWeaknesses: The number and specificity of the assignments made it difficult to choose a topic of particular interest and pursue it in depth. Although in theory the first two papers could've been synthesized in the final paper, without advance knowledge of what is to come in the course that would be difficult to achieve. It might've been helpful to have just two papers (so that the midterm could've been longer, and allowed for more considered research), or to have a more open-ended final.",
                "This course is very interactive and exposes you to a lot of different texts. It has no real weaknesses.",
                "I think that the reading responses were really helpful to the thought process of the class. The reading material was at the perfect level of difficulty and really helped better my French skills. The format of the small seminar was amazing because it gave each student plenty of time to practice speaking and to say everything that they want without being stressed about it like in other seminars.",
                "Our class discussions were always really interesting and lively. I found the weekly paper assignments a little tedious once every two weeks would be better, especially since there are three essays.",
                "ONLY STRENGTHS: A brilliant professor who always makes discussions captivating and engaging--the height of participational pedagogy! An awesome reading list that is expansive, thematically diverse, and not just men (lots of brilliant women writers!)all the while, still very manageable! Challenging writing assignments that were fascinating to research!"

                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. Prof. Schuwey brings a lot of passion to the subject, and each week revealed new ideas to explore. The workload was pretty heavy, however: a page-long reading response a week, two midterm papers, and a 10-page final 1.5 spaced. It's all interesting, but I'd recommend taking this in a semester when you have a lighter courseload.",
                "Absolutely. This is a very engaging course and the professor makes it an incredible learning experience.",
                "Yes. The content of the class was so interesting that each paper that I wrote was so enjoyable that it didn't feel like work - it felt like pleasure reading in fact. Learning the secrets of the Chteau including the magic of its operation and the inner workings of Louis XIV's mind and how everything fit together in ways that make you gasp was so cool that I'd gladly take this class again because one semester is barely enough time to scratch the surface.",
                "Yes. I didn't have a special interest in Versailles before taking the course yet I found the readings and our discussions to be extremely interesting.",
                "YES! This class is EXTRAORDINARY! Every single class session \"one-up'd\" the next. Professor Schuwey is a brilliant instructor who cultivated vibrant, collaborative and invariably critically-minded discussions that did justice to the necessity for close reading. When you're looking at, for instance, an Aesop-inspired tour guide by Perrault, a curated collection of letters by Mme de Svign or a perennially celebrated (but at the time, censured) play by Molire, the need for a critical eye iscritical! Don't be fooled by the seeming aged benignity of Versaillesthats a myth among many others. All of the fascinating documents Prof. Schuwey shares with us have a distinct agenda embedded within the political, cultural and gender/class dynamics of the XIV century. GO AND TAKE THIS CLASS."
