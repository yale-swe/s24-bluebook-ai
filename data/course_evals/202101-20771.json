I'd never taken a history class like this that was focused on an entire ocean region; it offered us the ability to look beyond national boundaries and think critically about how those boundaries were constructed and larger patterns, or breaks from patterns, in the region over a long timescale.",
                "The Indian Ocean World helped expand my knowledge on trade, diaspora, religion, labor and so on. It provided me with some extremely useful readings and discussions that helped think through some key concepts such as the relationship between connectivity, exchange of knowledge and nation building among others. I have developed a keen interest in South Asian Studies due to the readings provided by prof. Amrith.",
                "Prof Amrith focused on the big ideas of the Indian Ocean, dipping into specific historical moments or issues, but keeping the content intellectually broad and therefore accessible to all majors. I learned how to think about the important region of the Indian Ocean, but even more to think about history is recovered, constructed, and manipulated.",

Topics included religious encounters, empires\/colonialism, labor, port cities, gender\/family, nationalism, decolonization, cultures, and geopolitics. Lots of broad lectures followed by parsing more complex, specific material.",

                "The Indian Ocean provided a very compelling framework to learn about history. Each week's topic and lectures tend to be quite broad and general, but that is to be expected from a survey class.",
                "I thought this was a fantastic class -- good readings, great lectures, engaging conversations, a really interesting and important approach to think about telling and understanding a regional, oceanic history. I appreciated Professor Amrith's lectures with lots of opportunity for conversation and student input, and the optional Wednesday sessions were great to get the feel of a seminar in a larger lecture class. I wish that we'd talked about the readings a little more in lecture or section; they were interesting!",
                "This course has touched upon so many different aspects of the Indian ocean world that it has proved to be extremely useful for an expanded understanding of interconnectivity.",
                "Interesting material but somehow many of the ideas we talked about in class seem a little generalized",
                "Strengths: great teaching staff that was very flexible and accommodating.\r\nWeaknesses: there were a lot of mini recorded lectures that ended up substituting live lectures. I think this won't be a problem post-COVID, but the mix was kind of weird.",
                "Strengths: Professor Amrith is a fantastic lecturer. Course addressed topics that I had little knowledge of beforehand, not too difficult, super thought-provoking, addressed a variety of topics that raised important discussion. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Would have preferred a beginning that provided a bit more background on the basics. Wish it was a bit less expansive: I loved learning about everything but sometimes it felt like too much ground (or sea) to cover. That said, its hard to argue what to cut, because there was so much fascinating stuff and cultures I never had any interaction with: Plantation societies, Victorian values translated to odd legal codes, military history, Cairo Genizah, Mosque architecture... it makes me feel like Im on the bachelor and cant decide who to cut. But overall it would have been better (I think) to prioritize a bit more depth and a bit less breadth. Still a great course though, highly recommend. Also, would appreciate if slides had spelled out the proper nouns of places\/people - because many of the names\/places are not English language, it's sometimes difficult to spell correctly and then I cant look it up later.",
                "Great overview of many themes, and prof Amrith is so smart and thoughtful",
                "Strength: Prof. Amrith for sure. Amazing professor who actually cares about students and the content. Another Strength: the content is amazingly interesting and the workload isnt too bad. \r\n\r\nWeakness: online lectures are just always tough, and the readings could be a little dense sometimes.",
                "course was really facilitated well geographically and temporally, because this is a huge and broad course but was tabulated well",

Prof. Amrith was also very empathetic and helpful which helped  in absorbing the weeks' readings and coming to class prepared.",

Both of these decision speak to how generous and considerate Professor Amrith was when designing the class, taking into account the exhaustion of the pandemic."

I came in knowing very little about the Indian Ocean world and came away with a much better understanding of the themes and patterns that have shaped and continue to shape the region. We didn't focus much on specific dates and events, but I now have a long-scale, sweeping sense of the region and was exposed to a vision of historical analysis beyond area studies or studies of particular countries. It's a great class if you're interested in history that transcends national borders and instead focuses on places and how they both influence and are influenced by human activity.",

His lectures are fun to listen to, the ideas and sources and stories he brings into class are intellectually interesting and impactful outside of the classroom. This class is welcoming to those who are not History majors.",
