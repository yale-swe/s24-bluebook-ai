In terms of skills, I think the class really emphasized groupwork in class, PSets not so much even though I know that is the intention. Patience was a huge factor in getting through those Problem Sets and persistence to watch every Pre-class lecture video (or if you missed one, to go back and watch it after class). \r\n\r\nLastly, time management. whilst I'm sure this was not the intention, I sometimes did not read the textbook pages prior to class as in this first semester, time was really hard to juggle (sorry!). However, watching the pre-class videos, going to nearly all of the lectures and then coming back to the textbook before exams to review / take notes seemed to have worked (I think!)",

                "Professor Miki was very good.",
                "The course was very fast-paced, but review sessions before exams helped with absorbing the material. Problem sets could be long and frustrating at times, but there are peer tutoring hours available almost every day, and the peer tutors were all very helpful.",
                "Strengths: \r\nthe pre-class videos were really helpful for me in being able to keep up with lectures and take notes. The material is presented in a continuous manner so its clear how the concepts connect to/build off one another \r\nWeaknesses: \r\nTheres a lot of content so I think your professors ability to explain things clearly matters a lot. My professor was great at this but I think other sections had a harder time.",
                "Strengths: Miki Havlickova was THE BEST teacher. She had the best resources to study for the final and taught everything in a clear and concise manner.",
                "The weaknesses are definitely the teaching staff. I have Miki, who was an incredible teacher, but I heard other students constantly complaining about the grad student they had teaching them, etc.\r\n\r\nThe strengths are the nightly study halls that took place in person. I learned so much by going to those study halls. Also, the videos we watched before class made by John Hall were incredibly useful for revision for tests and for learning the material.",
                "Please make it more application focused. I know ENAS 151 exists but for the love of god this isn't even 'proof based', there's nothing about proofs and it doesn't prepare you any more for a proof based track than 151 does.",
                "Some of the PSets had unnecessarily hard integrals (stuff that took 2+ pages) but didnt serve any purpose to better understanding content. Otherwise, very well taught!",
                "My professor, Miki, was amazing. I also enjoy having access to both pre class components and ximera. Great resources.",
                "Very useful but challenging course. You have weekly psets, pre class quizzes and three exams. I definitely recommend it if you are willing to put a lot of time and effort to get a good grade.",
                "Strengths are definitely how organized everything was especially for my section. Sure, having to watch the pre-lecture videos before every lesson was tedious at times especially when a lot of similar material was then covered in class, but this helped a lot when coming to the midterms and final as I think I had a decent grasp on the material prior to revision. Furthermore, I was thankful of the fact that the course wasn't just a trawl through a textbook, but rather sections were removed / orders were changed (although I did appreciate the existence of a textbook to structure the course!)\r\n\r\nI can't think of a clear weakness, except for the fact that PSets were often too difficult / tedious considering the questions I then faced on the exams (hopefully I did well on those!). I spent a lot of time on PSet integrals / drawing diagrams that I felt could've been better spent consolidating, and ended up having to rush through the final few PSets when finals period started as I instead spent the time practicing past papers / review session material.",
                "Strengths: The material was logically ordered. There were numerous office hours scheduled. Many people are in the course, so it's easy to find study partners.\r\nWeakness: This is a fast-paced course. Some topics might not make sense until reviewed in preparation for a midterm.",
                "The addition of videos and pre class quizzes as alternative forms to learn the information improved the course. The course is conceptually difficult to grasp at times and people who had weaker teachers struggled more, but it was helpful to have the videos to lean back on when confused.",
                "In general I really enjoyed this course! I wish that for reviews there were more opportunities to check questions with the person leading the review.",
                "I really enjoyed this course, but I don't think the pre-class readings were necessary. I felt that watching the videos alone was enough for me to understand the material.",
                "Professor was extremely engaging. Class was excellent. Games and activities in class were good instrumental  in learning.\r\nReview sessions could have been more helpful-more engaging",
                "Tons of resources available to students outside of lectures: videos, textbook, past exams, flowcharts, illustrated guides. Miki Havlickova is amazing at explaining everything; from what I've heard, your mileage may vary based on your section lecturer. Problem sets could be time-consuming some weeks but were helpful to practice and really solidify the material.",
                "Strengths: teaches multivariable calculus, a large number of options for how to learn (eg. pre-class videos, textbook reading, optional practice problems) which students can choose to use or not as they need. In my section we also did a lot of interactive learning (working in groups on problems, \"turn to your neighbor\", question/answer polls), which was helpful for engagement and made class more fun.\r\nWeaknesses/how to improve: honestly I'm not sure. There were times I wasn't so engaged, but that was more because I was already familiar with some of the material than because of the class itself.",
                "Strengths: the professor (Miki Havlickova), intellectual challenge, the skills you learn feel relevant to social science and STEM majors. Also, very well organized.\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of the kids have already taken the course, which can be discouraging as the course is difficult and watching them not give a lot of effort is a bit painful.",
                "My professor is great! I'm not really into math, but she makes this course so interesting. I always feel that time flies in this course and I always learn so much. My professor explains everything very carefully and offers lots of opportunities for everyone to get engaged in this course."

                "I would definitely recommend you take this course with Miki Havlickova. Her lectures are great and help you understand the material on an intuitive level. Understanding this math really helped me out as I concurrently took PHYS 180 on topics such as moment of inertia, center of mass, and force fields/conservative forces. The class size is also pretty small, which is great.",
                "Yes, but I've heard that other teachers were not as diligent as Professor Havlickova",
                "I would recommend someone else take this course. Granted, Im a bit biased because I greatly enjoy math and physics, but I think it is a very useful class for application in equations with multiple variables which is applicable in a wide variety of areas such as creating mathematical models for business, etc.",
                "Not at all. Genuinely awful curriculum, but if you absolutely must, you have to take it with Prof. Havlickova. I did and I still struggled, but she is by far the best prof.",
                "Honestly, I doubt anyone takes calc 3 if they dont have to - but they should! Its super interesting and provides a great culmination of all the math youve been taking up until now.",
                "Id recommend it to anyone interested in math or any math-related majors (extremely important for Econ, Physics etc.)",
                "As far as I can tell, my positive experience of the course has really been shaped by my instructor, Professor Havlickova. I do think I have some interest in mathematics, but sometimes I would find a lot of the material to be loosely connected and unfortunately not as engaging as I hoped (through my own fault completely). I would recommend the course to someone who is curious about multivariable calc or is interested in a Maths/Stats/CPSC etc. major. If you are taking the course just as the next step in your maths learning, I would not recommend the course as strongly, even if it is really well structured. I don't regret taking MATH 120 by any means, it is rather that I know others in my position (of being unlikely to major in these maths-heavy subjects) have had not so positive an experience .",
                "Yes, I would. It's a great introduction to mathematics at Yale. It was encouraging to see that a lot of things we calculated have applications in the real world.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who likes math. It is conceptually difficult to grasp at times, but it is an interesting course if you want to continue studying calculus.",
                "Yes! This is a great way to learn math!",
                "Yes! However, I think the quality of this course depends greatly on the instructor, and because 120 is an intro-level course, many of the teachers are grad students who don't really care about whether you are learning or not. I would recommend that other students 'shop' multiple sections of this course to find the professor that they like best.",
                "Yes, but success seemed very dependent on comparability with the section professor.",
                "Yes, if you need multivariable calculus for physics or math it's a very good way to build that secure foundation.",
                "Yes, but I would also recommend strongly considering linear algebra, especially if this student has some familiarity with multi already- I took this course over linear algebra, and I think that was the right choice for me (lower workload was nice, and having a very solid and intuitive grasp of multivariable calc seems useful for physics), but if a student was interested in higher-level math I might recommend they lean the other way.",
                "Have to take it with Professor Miki Havlickova, she is an absolutely phenomenal teacher and makes the content much more manageable and easier to understand. The course is still not an easy one and will require effort, but I enjoyed it mostly because of the teacher. I also think that if you are a STEM or social science major that this course will be useful for you.",
                "Yes absolutely if Miki is teaching! She's the best professor ever. I'm never into maths before but she makes this course so interesting."
