                "I think the strength of the course is definitely the professor. Prof. De La O is very passionate about the topic and thus, class discussions are always quite interesting and informative. As for weaknesses, I think the density of the readings every week were a bit much given that they were all substantial research papers. Furthermore, many times class discussions would simply be reiterating exactly what experiment was used in XYZ reading or such, and there potentially could be a greater focus on overall theory instead of regurgitating just the readings' content.",
                "Discussions were very interesting! It helps you think like an academic in political science where you really get into the way a study was conducted, the nuances of studies, etc. the Professor always gave very clear and specific feedback on essays which is helpful\r\n\r\nNot too many weaknesses, the class was really interesting.",
                "Strengths: The topics for each module were very interesting, and the readings were never boring. Ana was a great professor.\r\nWeaknesses: Seminar tended to be dominated by one or two voices, and participation is a significant part of one's grades, so it often felt as if people were competing to talk."
