                "We learned about different models and trends of adolescent brain development, and we read many papers that supported those models and trends. Specifically, we learned about teen fear learning and risk taking behaviors, sensitivity to rewards and peers, how the brain is either adaptive or maladaptive. We also became familiar with some important brain regions and their functions/development during adolescence. Finally, we connected these studies to the justice system and legal implications for adolescent brain development.",

                "I learned a lot about the adolescent brain for sure. I wasn't very excited about this course at first because i felt like the adolescent brain is such a specific time frame, and not an overwhelmingly exciting one, to be studying. But it turned out to be my favorite class. I learned a lot about circuitry, and how to read scientific papers in a way that made sense to me. I learned how to summarize and synthesize scientific papers. I learned how to work with my classmates really well during the debate. I think I gained a lot from this class.",

            "comments": [
                "Professor Casey is thoughtful, thorough, and a passionate lecturer. The pace of the material is definitely manageable, and the assignments are engaging!",
                "Prof. Casey is great and a strength is how wonderful and nice she is. She really cares about her students and you can tell. The one big weakness for me was the exam structure. We have three exams they are 20%, 20% and 25% of our grade. Each exam is 10 multiple choice questions and 10 true/false AND THAT IS IT. So 65% of your grade is made up by 65 multiple choice or t/f questions. I have terrible test anxiety and often show case what I have learned through my writing. Even on an exam if I have an opportunity to write short answers and essay questions they are far stronger. I felt like I was not given the opportunity to showcase what I know or how I learn because of the assessment style in the class, it was really hard for me to do even remotely well on the exams. Prof. Casey would also intentionally trick you on the wording of the questions, and have the questions be a bit unclear.",
                "Dr. BJ Casey is amazing. The course was formatted wonderfully and the topics were super engaging. Zero complaints.",
                "Strengths \r\n- super interesting material, easy to understand and also very applicable to many fields of studies / life in general \r\n- pretty low workload\r\n- amazing, very caring professor \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- the grading system caused a lot of stress because it put a lot of pressure on the exams (each exam question was worth 1% of your grade, and you could only get 5 points off in the whole semester to get an A, etc) ... unforgiving",
                "Strengths of the class was organization, supplemental readings were directly related to the course work, lectures were engaging. Weaknesses include being a 9am. My brain was simply not awake sometimes which just made me retain so much less - I wish the class was recorded so that I could rewatch things when my brain wandered ( I also have attention difficulties sometimes ).",
                "The professor is amazing!!",
                "I think the professor and TF were the biggest strengths. Professor Casey was caring, compassionate, and excited to be there everyday. I may never have a better professor than her. Another strength was the wide variety of assignments to accommodate everyone, no matter their personal strengths. There were small essays, a drawing, a debate, and exams. Everyone is good at different things and I felt like this was a really fair spread of assignments. A weakness is definitely the grading scheme. I feel like a 90 should be an A- not a B+, that is pretty standard, so it is unfortunate that the grading system for this class is skewed a bit. It was also unfortunate how the exams were only 20 questions, so if you miss even just 2, you are in the B's.",
                "strengths: clear course material on slides; know what is expected of you in the class; exam review sessions + review of answers following exam",
                "While the material for the course was very interesting and you gain a lot of relevant insight about the adolescent brain, the structure of the course made it difficult to do well which made the course unnecessarily stressful. Because each point that was deducted over the course of the semester was equivalent to one percent of your grade, this put a lot of pressure on us throughout the course and made the learning experience less enjoyable.",
                "I loved this course. The only slight change I would make is the grading scheme. I feel as if the threshold for A, A-, and B+ are a little too high",
                "I loved the course! It was well taught and well structured. I just wish the exams were short answer. I missed a lot of points that I know I could have gotten had I been able to explain myself.",
                "this class was very well organized.",
                "The strengths of this course lie in how Professor Casey continuously drove home the important points of the course and the implications for certain findings were always explained during lecture. I don't find that this course had any weaknesses, it is really a fantastic class.",
                "Strengths of the course were the engaging material covered, the insightful discussions within the class, and the manageable assigned readings. Some weaknesses of the course were the lack of opportunities to engage with my peers and have engaging discussions.",
                "The grading was tough in that each question was 1% off of your grade, and you needed a 95% to get an A.",
                "Strengths: course lectures were very informative and I appreciated that in the beginning of each lecture there was a mini review of last class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some projects like the concept map and debate were emphasized but I wished they were worth more of our grade for the amount of effort we put into them. Exams are only multiple choice which could be a strength for some but very much not built for people who are bad test takers.",
                "-I think the grade cut offs are a bit harsh, but other than that wonderful and fun course",
                "Interactive and engaging",
                "This course is very cool and I think the setup with the exams and debates and concept maps could be a strength for some people and a weakness for others.",
                "Strengths: engaging lecture, good number of assignments\r\nWeaknesses: questions on tests unnecessarily tricky, wish that they were just short answer so that students could demonstrate knowledge.",
                "I appreciated having the reading responses as they encouraged me more actively engage with the material and prepared me well for class. I thought that the exam format (and generally workload) was very kind and Professor Casey was very considerate of our other coursework.",
                "This course is strong in that the material is highly interesting. There is a correct balance of readings, assessments, and tests. However, the grading scale of the course (95 = A), was overly harsh given the circumstances of this year. Compared to the test grades from the year online, our class' average was close to the lowest grade from last year. As a result, the Professor had to give points back on the tests that skewed the grades. I would have preferred if the grading scale was normal and no points back on the tests.",
                "I thought that the course sometimes missed some depth that I was hoping for. We learned a lot about the adolescent brain, but sometimes the content missed going a bit deeper into why it is important, what we can do with that information, or what the implications of that are. \r\n\r\nI also thought the exam structure was a weakness of the course. Having only 20 question exams that were all multiple choice and true or false took away any opportunity for students to fully demonstrate what they had learned from the course. I would study several days for the exam and most of the content I studied would not show up on the exam. I would have preferred more questions especially for the final exam and some free response questions! The debate was a little awkward with so many people on each team -- it was entertaining but I don't think it actually deepened my knowledge much. \r\n\r\nProf. Casey is great and she does try her best to make the course engaging and fun! The content was interesting and I really liked that we were finished with everything by the start of reading week -- took a lot of pressure off so that I could focus on other courses that had deadlines and finals during reading and finals week.",
                "The course has no weaknesses. I like how we can do reading responses for the topics that we prefer rather than having weekly assignments. Another strength is that the review session before each exam was really helpful.",
                "I thought the more creative and different assignments like the concept map and the debate actually helped me engage with the material the most out of any of the assignments. And the lectures were also very informative and relatively easy to follow.",
                "This course is fun, engaging, and has a wide variety of assignments that can fit a range of learning styles. Professor Casey is the sweetest and is very knowledgeable about everything in the course. Her anecdotes combined with relevant research make this class worthwhile.",
                "The lectures were very clear and I found that I retained information more easily because of we would usually do a brief review of last week's lecture before the current one. The reading responses were a great way to engage with the course material, and because we had options of topics, they were usually pretty interesting to write. I thought the debate was quite fun and a low stakes way to synthesize the information we've learned from the semester. I thought the exams were both a weakness and a strength. The questions were straightforward and I didn't have a hard time figuring out how to study for them. However, because there are so few questions in the exams, there is very little room for error. It would have been nice to have slightly longer exams or maybe exams where there is some possibility for partial credit.",
                "This course was very interesting. I would have been improved if the class was a little smaller, there was a lot of content that could have been expanded upon. I really liked the readings and Dr. Casey was a very thoughtful and engaging lecturer.",
                "Strengths - well organized, manageable workload, engaging lectures\r\nWeaknesses - the debate was a somewhat confusing assignment, and stressful without any real feedback given or real knowledge gained by the process",
                "lectures went by so fast but in order to get all the info it needed to happen that way. liked the idea of the debate. the cut from 10 reading responses to 5 was very helpful.",
                "Strength- the material was engaging and BJ Casey is an amazing lecturer \r\nWeakness- the reading responses was more work than the points they were worth"
