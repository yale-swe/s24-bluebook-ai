I did not know a lot about this topic before, and it was really interesting to have an overview of a topic that is very prevalent in my life but I didn't realize how prevalent biomedicine and living in a world of biomedical futures is until I took this class. This class also allows you to have a new perspective on what it means to learn because grades are taken out of the equation, so you literally do everything in the class just for the sake of learning, which is very refreshing.",
                "This class definitely changed the way I perceive the world and the values I hold",
                "I learned about the literary works and life of Michael Crichton, as well as the development of biomedical technologies, ethics, and potential futures. In addition, I learned how to approach assignments more broadly and very much benefitted from the relatively open work options available to me. My greatest insight is that a lot of individuals at this university are struggling in some way, and this course gives a great outlet for expressing and thinking about such struggles.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of public health and how some of the fear and distrust against medicine came to be. More importantly, I thought it was super interesting how science weaves into media and feed into the public. Loved this class!",

Besides that, the practical skillsbeing able to engage with a class healthily and on your own terms, setting boundaries, expressing yourself creatively and challenging yourself to write or create things you normally would be too scared to doare all amazing and facilitated by the amazing TAs and Joanna Radin.",

This course teaches you amazing things about history of medicine and intersections of politics, science, health, and people, but it also teaches you to care for yourself. If you don't know how to \"take a breather\" this class offers incredibly interesting topics while allowing you to take time for yourself if necessary. You take this class to think about what you are learning and how that maybe affects how you see yourself as well as a bunch of other things. This is a truly great course.",
                "I learned a lot about how to how society treats the abled and the disabled. I learned about how biotechnology is on the rise and how it is changing and how that may affect our civilization. Also, I learned that it is okay to take care of myself.",
                "This course uses the work of Micheal Crichton to explore a period of history, philosophy, politics, and science through may lenses and opinions. You will learn so much about the world and international relations, domestic affairs, art, literature, celebrity as Professor Radin tells and retells the same story from different angles. To be honest, this class has been one of my very favorites at Yale. I feel like it has radically changed the way I am thinking about the world and what I want out of my education. It is both interesting and challenging if you give it the time to engage.",

                "I learned SO much about the ways in which science, technology, media, industry, and culture are all woven together. It's hard for me to pinpoint very specific things I've learned in this class, but it really expanded the way I think about science communications over time, which is really cool. It also just allowed me to bring my own experiences and understanding to the material in a really cool way. I also really like Michael Crichton's books now which is a development.",
                "One of the most unique aspects of this course was how it took a multitude of current-issues and lined them in the scope of biomedicine and technology. I developed a stronger understanding of what biomedicine, and biomedical technology entails, and this course allowed me to use modern phenomenons like astrology and the works of Michael Crichton to conceptualize such topics.",

                "All professors should be like Professor Radin. She and her teaching team are the greatest strengths of this course. They allow students creative freedom in our reading responses & final projects, yet still, manage to keep students' engagement with the course high. If I could take this class again, I would. No weaknesses.",
                "The strengths of this course are that there is room for everyone's opinion - you don't have to tailor your work towards what the professor wants to hear and I think that speaks very highly of Professor Radin. Additionally, I think the link between science and humanities classes was clear in this class.\r\nA weakness is that it's hard to get used to working without the motivation of a grade, but eventually I got over that.",
                "Strengths: Everything! The way the class is designed is to actually learn and not worry at all about the grade. No weaknesses",
                "the teaching staff care about you. they show a lot more interest in who you are than how well you did on a pset. the course was flexible on how much you could accomplish in a week, never expecting kids to sacrifice their mental well being to stay up reading. the reading workload varies a lot through the semester, some weeks there's only 50 pages, others there were over 300 pages. you get out of this class what you need. if you need a break, you have a break. if you want to learn about the history and possibility of biomedicine, you'll have more readings on it than you ever thought imaginable.",
                "Strengths: low workload assignment wise, everyone-starts-with-an-A policy, cool material, awesome teaching team, recorded lectures, makes you think in a different way\r\nWeaknesses: way too much supplementary reading, professor Radin sometimes got her historical facts wrong",
                "Strengths: Low workload allowed us to feel less pressure about grades, the Otherwise project gave us a lot of freedom to play around and talk about an issue that really matters to us, and the lectures were very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think a weekly email or check-in with all the students would sometimes help with the organization of the course.",
                "We covered A LOT in this course and while that was good, I think that sometimes there was too much. I wish we went into depth when it came to more regenerative technologies that mimic Frankenstein. I also which we touched on Afrofuturism earlier on in the semester.",
                "i didn't figure out the main theme of the class until near the end of the semester - i think thats just the nature of the course and the first time it was taught, but it was really a very lovely course. the expectations were that you could just do as much of the reading and assignments as you felt were possible and if you couldn't, then just communicate that. this style of pedagogy was very forgiving and lent itself to better discussion, as those who felt able to engage with that particularly reading helped to guide the discussion.",
                "Prof Radin is so great, she's a wonderful lecturer and is super approachable. I wish that the class had perhaps focused on a few themes instead of talking about new themes every week.",
                "I really liked the course - both the lectures and the sections. If I had one suggestion, it would maybe be to include more full-length works by other authors (besides Crichton). I really liked Butler's Parable of the Sower and the discussions we had about it in section, and would have liked to read more of her work or that of other authors.",

                "the professor and teaching fellows were all amazing and very supportive of the students. additionally, i went into the course thinking it was focusing solely on michael crichton, but learning the material through a critical lens that encouraged discussions on race and gender and their role in the shaping of science fiction really helped contextualize michael crichton and science fiction throughout the 21st century.",
                "Strength: Prof. Radin and the amazing TA team!!\r\n\r\nWeakness: too many readings :(",

                "This course was very flexible in terms of what work needed to get done and when which was helpful in terms of the level of stress I was under during the semester. The readings\/lectures were also very interesting and engaging",
                "Absolutely everything was perfect! I loved how caring and considerate the teaching team was.",
                "I like its structure. It is very engaging and has a great focus on showing how everything relates to our lives\/world",
                "The readings at the beginning were a little hard to get through, but I found them significantly more engaging as we continued on in the semester. I think the readings overall were very well chosen, and I can't remember it feeling like I was reading something just for the sake of having an assignment. It was nice that we anchored everything in fiction, and I understood that while we were focusing on the impacts of Michael Crichton, the scope of the course was much broader. I also appreciated that we didn't put him on a pedestal and discussed the nuances between what could be considered positive and negative about his impacts on culture and science. I really liked the end of the course. I think talking about other authors' manifestations of otherwises created a necessary contrast from Crichton's work, while enabling us to see where Science and Technology Studies could go from here. On a related note, I enjoyed the final project- it felt like a creative, fitting, and reasonable culmination to the course.\r\n\r\nThe entire course was structured to be accommodating to students' needs and health. I appreciated this so much, and Professor Radin's understanding was a welcome change as I got acclimated to my first semester of college in a pandemic.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness I can think of is that the assignments were difficult to grasp, and I found that the broad prompts never really conveyed exactly what we were supposed to accomplish. My TF was very helpful in offering direction, though. Perhaps the last assignment before the final project could be changed in particular, because that's the one I felt like I got the least out of. Also, I feel like for someone who isn't as interested in the material, it could be easy to get lost or not get as much out of the course.",
                "It was a really fascinating class. The content was super interesting. However, I felt like the organization of the class could be better. It was sort of hard to follow along sometimes because there was not really a timeline of events in which we could follow (the lectures weren't organized based on chronology or anything).",
                "It is such a good class!! Truly an amazing lifesaver class but also so interesting!! Strength: focuses on our mentality which is hard to come by.",
                "I think the otherwise project is very interesting, I just wish there was a broader overview of the project and what would be expected of us (and what the purpose of the project is) before beginning it and picking a topic. I didn't really understand the point of the project until halfway through the assignments, and I think if I knew what the end product would look like, I would have chosen something different to think about or taken a different approach to the problem I decided to think about.",
                "A really understanding class, wish there was more discussion outside of section",
                "While Im never a big fan of section, it was good here due to the openness of the lectures and assignments. Other than that it was all strength, from Professor Radins remarkably wholesome meditations to the flexibility in both coursework and prompts. The TAs this year were also kind and engaging. Overall I highly recommend this coursewhile its instructions are a little vague at times, its a lovely, fair, and interesting course.",
                "I think that this course could have benefitted from being pared downit's awesome to jump around as much as we did but it felt sometimes like we were just grazing the surface so much instead of really digging into any one thing. If there were fewer readings and a little less covered, I think it would have felt a little more grounded.",
                "It is well organized and the readings are engaging. I feel like if the sections were a tad smaller, people couldve gotten to know each other. Many people in my section didnt know names even at the end.",
                "The strengths of the class are numerous. It rivals the fundamental understanding of how a university should teach its students and helps students grow in so many more ways than just the course material.",
                "how much grace and care professor radin gives to her students!",
                "Strengths: The teaching team. Ange, my TA, was incredible and left detailed feedback and comments on the assignments, and Professor Radin is one of the  most brilliant professors in history and STS at yale! (she is also a fantastic lecturereach lecture was really interesting and not the kind that you want to fall asleep during. Additionally, the course readings were really easy to access and were all organized by week on canvas, so you just had to download them there. The course material is another strength; although the wide range of topics was eclectic and diverse, ranging from military history, science-fiction movies, biography, medical sociology, STS genetics, spirituality\/religious studies, radical care politics and Afrofuturism, the themes tied them together in a way that was both fascinating and honestly sometimes mindblowing. Also, the care that Professor Radin and the TAs expressed for our own wellbeing was beyond compare. Weaknesses: None",
                "I think it could be slightly more structured so that the relevance of the otherwise project is a bit clearer to the texts we read. Nevertheless I really enjoyed the otherwise project.",
                "Professor Radin and the TAs!!! I'd never heard of Michael Crichton before this and it quickly became my favorite class just due to Professor Radin's engaging lectures and pure excitement for the topic. Professor Radin's approach to education was also one of the highlights of the class. Despite not \"having\" to, I ended up spending lots of time on assignments because the professor's empathetic ethos motivated me to.",
                "Strength - very flexible and discussion sections were very engaging.\r\nWeakness - none",
                "Strengths are that the topics are amazing and captivating and the teaching staff is incredible.",
                "I really liked the flexible format of this class. I felt that i could engage in the material as I wanted which felt more powerful than ever. Honestly, no weaknesses to share. I would've taught the class the same way.",
                "This course is suited towards students who are interested and will buy in. All of the assignments and readings are optional (or you have to complete \"something\" but that is very loose). This can be excellent for students who are interested in self-directing and engaged in the material, but I imagine that if you are not into the class, it becomes very easy to let it slip by and still get a good grade. If you are taking the course for this purpose, don't. Professor Radin is looking for students who are going tot engage out of desire, not those trying to get an A. There is way too much learning to be had for this to become a gut. \r\nThe course is incredibly well structured so that the readings and lectures do not repeat each other but add. Each lecture offers a different perspective from a similar period of time. For example, one lecture might be US politics from 1960-70. The next class might be philosophical debates from 1960-70.",
                "Strengths: Prof Radin and the teaching team were incredible! They fostered such a positive and healthy learning environment that took the pressure off grades and refocused it on engaging with the material. For the first time at Yale, I was able to learn for enjoyment rather than stress about grades and being evaluated. I felt more willing to take risks in my writing and my thoughts. Beyond the material, this class taught me the importance of advocating for and taking care of yourself. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I felt a little lost for the first few weeks of class and didn't really understand why Crichton was so important to this course. When we started reading A Case of Need, it started to fall into place and make sense. I think clarifying this connection sooner would have helped.",
                "Strengths:  The TFs and Prof. Radin were incredibly understanding and were wonderful resources for further discussion and exploration on the topics discussed in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You get as much out of this course as your put in. Unfortunately, without grades, students naturally spent less time in the classroom and on producing meaningful work.  We didn't receive comments on our work until very late in the semester. Also, there is far too much reading (each week had an entire book and 70+ pages of articles).",
                "This class is incredible! I do think you have to be somewhat open-minded (or become more so throughout the class) to enjoy it, because the history is very much taught weaving together, with overlap, and loop-di-loos, but I think that's more honest to the material anyway. The TAs and Professor cared so much about our feedback and understanding and were so passionate about the material. They 100% prioritized learning over testing which was really cool and allowed me to explore academics in a new way. At the beginning it was sometimes hard for me to follow the timeline of what we were learning (as we would jump around a bit) but I got used to it and then I really really loved it.",
                "I appreciate how flexible the course was in terms of assignments, however, in the future, I would appreciate more guidance on the Otherwise Project.",
                "strengths - open ended assignments, encouraging prof\/TA team, \r\nweaknesses - maybe during lecture, have more little discussions so that the students can get to the chance to hear from people not in their section",
                "strengths: dr. radin is an excellent professor who can connect seemingly unrelated topics together to form a larger, greater picture of our society over time. she is especially amazing because she is a professor whose actions reflect her teaching and advice. she is without a doubt the greatest strength of this course because of her ability to organize a variety of historical events in a digestible manner that still allows students to think and question rather than memorize.\r\nimprovements: perhaps a timeline that is updated with each lecture can be a helpful way to organize events for each lecture. i found it difficult to connect all the historical events that were covered, but this is also because i am not experienced with a historian's mindset. in this way, i personally found it more accessible to organize my notes by timeline + a few key details, but this might be easier to do if a timeline of events were posted as the first slide of each lecture."

                "100% yes. Please take no matter your major.",
                "Yes! Professor Radin is sneaky in the way she teaches you and gets stuff to stick in your mind. It's so incredible to be able to learn in a non-competitive environment, and to surprise yourself with all the knowledge on not only class material but on how to read and digest media.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
                "i think all stem kids should take this class. we all need a break from stem courses and this is a good one to help reorient students about the bigger picture and how their majors have effects on humanity.",
                "Yes definitely  a good fifth class or way to engage with fiction in a non-English class environment",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course! This course provided a low-stress environment for me to learn about biomedical futures and the works of Crichton, and discussion sections consisted of engaging conversations spanning a wide variety of topics.",
                "Yes, absolutely, especially for STEM students. You will learn a lot about the faults and racist history of the American medical system, and understand how important humanities is for scientists and doctors.",
                "Yes. Professor Radin is wonderful and cares deeply for her students. Her lectures are always enjoyable and interesting and I loved doing the work for her class.",
                "DEFINITELY - this course was amazing. Prof Radin and the teaching team are the most wonderful and considerate and they just wanted us to learn and engage as we felt fit. a wonderful course - i very much enjoyed reading the texts and completing the assignments",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who would want to learn something new and cool and express themselves and their own ideas.",
                "Yes, I think this course has something for everyone. I would especially recommend this course to any student who 1) wants to have a fun survey of Science and Technology Studies concepts 2) wants to have a space to critically evaluate their own life 3) read some fun books and learn about some wacky people. The course is really what you want to make of it, if you want to go hard and dig deep into the readings you absolutely can, but you can still gain a lot just from the lectures.",
                "yes! this course is very creative in terms of how to think about the readings, and the discussions sections are facilitated to allow freeflowing ideas. the final project is also really open so you can target your interests (e.g. art\/music) towards it.",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course; it has really changed how I think about technology, sci-fi, Cold War-era science & geopolitics, Michael Crichton, etc etc...",
                "Yes. This was a new class that I dont think had previously been offered at Yale. I previously took a class with Professor Radin and really enjoyed her lecturing style. This course was no different. The readings for the class were engaging and I always enjoyed discussion sections.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely. This class was thought-provoking, interesting, and applicable to anybody interested in STEM fields or humanities. It is a class that truly is at the intersection of science and humanities and looks at how they intertwine. The lectures were interesting, and discussion sections were very enlightening.",
                "Yes. One of my favorite at Yale.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class, if not for the content, which was super interesting, for the different model of learning and grading that made me think feel respected as a student and gave me a lot to think about outside of class.",
                "Yes! Amazing course and a wonderful blend between STEM and humanities",
                "I would if they are interested in science and technology studies and the role of technology and culture in our world and created worlds.",
                "I absolutely loved this course, and would definitely recommend that others take it. Professor Radin did an incredible job of exploring the themes in Crichtons films and novels, and applying them to the real world. Truly one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "Its very enjoyable if you like Crichtons work.",
                "Absolutely! Radin is awesome",
                "Absolutely, the professor and TFs worked together to create a healthy work environment and were very understanding",
                "Yes! Please take this course!! It was so good and Professor Radin is a delight as a lecturer and person.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It was among the best courses Ive taken throughout my time at Yale.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! Professor Radins teaching style and empathy for her students is unparalleled! Best prof at yale!",
                "Yes. This is a great class where you take a lot away from it without feeling overwhelmed\/stressed.",
                "Absolutely. I came at the course being interested in science fiction, and I think you get a lot of that if that's your sole interest. But I also learned about science and technology studies, radical care, medicine, and a history of culture through a super unique and valuable lens. Professor Radin is amazing, and is literally writing a book about Crichton, so she was speaking with the people we were learning about throughout the course. She CONSTANTLY emphasized radical care, and the course is taught to enable us to start to manifest our own otherwise ways of healthy learning.\r\n\r\nOne thing is that a lot  of the work is self-motivated, though, so if you think you won't read a lot of the material, you might not get a lot out of the course.",
                "Yes, it is very low workload and is just an interesting class to hear the lectures. I think that if you aren't interested in the course material though, it is not worth your time, even if it is low workload.",
                "YESSS!!!!",
                "YES! super interesting and a good humanities credit for people who are not humanities inclined. It also makes you think about the world a little differently so it helps to broaden your mind as a student, which is the whole point of going to school!\r\n!",
                "Yes 100% the entire course cares about you and learning in a way other Yale courses dont",
                "I would recommend this course in every sense of the word. I love this class and everything about it. Especially as a distributional requirement, this class is accessible to everybody and is a joy to participate in.",
                "Yes! This course is a must take. Lots of support from the TAs and Prof Radin. Honestly, this is one of the only things I look forward to sometimes in a busy week.",
                "This is an amazing course, and Professor Radin truly cares for her students. Really interesting topics and readings, you really get what you put into it though",
                "Yes, I definitely recommend this course to anyone, no matter if you are a STEM or humanities student, or anywhere in between. Professor Radin is amazing and I would jump at any chance to take a class with her.",
                "Yes! Professor Radin is awesome and her philosophy on teaching is wonderful. It's a great time even when it feels a little chaotic.",
                "Yes. It goes down pathways many other classes ignore.",
                "Yes !! Professor Radin is wonderful and the class is a breath of fresh air for what you assume all courses are normally like.",
                "Absolutely absolutely recommend. This is a class that everyone should take, but ESPECIALLY STEM and pre-med students, as well as students interested in Science Studies. This is one of those classes where you don't have the pressure of an intense final exam that you have to memorize things for, but you end up actually learning MORE because of the wide range of readings and lectures and how they challenge you to think deeply about topics and themes rather than memorizing dates. Although there is quite a heavy reading load, you don't have to close read everything and you also don't end up discussing everything due to the wide range of readingsJoanna described it as a kind of a \"choose your own adventure\" syllabus, which is absolutely what it is!",
                "Take this class! Take any class with Professor Radin!",
                "Yes, the workload was the perfect amount to compliment the lessons from class.",
                "I would tell any and every student to take this class. You learn a lot about yourself as well as the world when you do this. Plus, Michael Crichton!",
                "Yes! This class covers a wide range of material fitting for many interested. It is flexible and welcome individual interests to be applied. It is a class that teaches you how to better treat yourself and gives insights into the world that i would argue everyone should have.",
                "Yes but only students who are going to give it the time. Readings are optional, and if you are not going to do them, you will waste the class. There is SO much to learn, and the only regret I have is not doing all of the readings all of the time.",
                "YES!!",
                "Yes. Professor Radin is a radical feminist who cares deeply about her students. This semester, she enabled our participation to be entirely self-directed as long as we communicated with her. She is a bright light on Yale's campus and I hope other profs follow her lead.",
                "If you want a chill class",
                "Absolutely! Really fascinating readings and lectures that have definitely changed the way I look at the world. There is a lot of reading but expectations are very clear that you read whatever you are able to read and no more. There is a clear dedication to students' (and teaching staffs') wellbeing which is really refreshing. I think this class is what you make of it, which is really special, but I always loved coming to lecture and the readings were interesting enough that I would do (most) of them even if they weren't strictly required. Can't recommend this class enough!",
                "Yes, I would. The topics are extremely interesting and cover a wide array of subjects, which is something unique to occur in a class at Yale.",
                "YES! This class was created to turn your perception of a course at Yale on its head. You start the class with so much support and encouragement. You are told you will succeed, which just makes you work harder and better because you can believe in yourself and what you are researching\/creating. You are given the freedom to create a final project that answers a question you've been struggling with personally in the world. You are given the freedom to structure your learning in a way that prioritizes your health and wellness and ability to learn and absorb material. The content is relevant and fascinating. We read works from many different eras and groups of people that address many different issues that are important today!",
                "absolutely recommend. no matter what you decide to major in, this course is a must-take, especially if dr. joanna radin is teaching it. this is a course that will allow you gain key insights about our perception of the world and its history while prioritizing self-care.",
                "Absolutely!! Professor Radin's focus on self-care helped me to actually engage more with the material. I was able to learn about topics that I was interested in purely because I was interested without any focus on assessments or memorizing random facts."
