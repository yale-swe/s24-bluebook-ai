                "I developed skills in introductory Arabic. I learned all of the Arabic alphabet, how to read Arabic, how to create Arabic sounds, and talk with others. The Arabic language has numerous dialects, so it was also interesting to learn about some of them and their differences while also focusing on Modern Standard Arabic. Now, I can read and understand Arabic---including completing reading comprehension questions.",
                "By taking Arabic, I developed a deep understanding of the Arabic language and culture. I learned how to read and write in Arabic, as well as the correct pronunciation and spelling of words. I gained an understanding of the languages grammar, syntax, and syntax structures. I also learned about the different dialects of Arabic and the nuances between them. Additionally, I gained insight into the rich history and culture of the Arab world, including customs and religion.",
                "In Muhammed Aziz's Arabic class, much of the material was focused on learning the alphabet, basic vocabulary, and reading comprehension. His class also forced me to approach language differently thing high school. Coming into Yale I knew a bit of French so Arabic really challenged me in terms of vocabulary, structure, and grammar."

                "It went really fast but it forces you to learn along the way",
                "The strengths of this course was the teacher and textbook. The textbook was very helpful in explaining a lot of the \"why\" and \"how\" of different grammatical tools in Arabic; the teacher was also very helpful in explaining unfamiliar concepts from the textbook. The teacher also brought much energy to each class with his humor which I (and I know others) appreciate----and very helpful for those like me learning a new language for the first time. He was very approachable and help foster an environment where I wasn't afraid of making mistakes---and instead learning from them. I think a way it can be improved is the pace; I feel the pace of the class was extremely fast to where it was difficult for me to keep up. I believe if the pace was slightly slower, I would be able to have a better grasp on foundational concepts (especially grammar and certain vocabulary words) in preparation of advanced Arabic.",
                "I really enjoyed the asynchronous days as it gave us time to work through the course at our own pace. And although the class was a lot of work, I appreciate how flexible Aziz was in terms of scheduling and such. As for improvements, I would have liked to review material we learned earlier in the semester at some point in the course even if it was only briefly."

                "Yes, I think this course is very good for anyone who is starting Arabic. The workload is manageable, and the instructor is extremely helpful in explaining the language.",
                "I would definitely recommend this caveat to another student with the caveat being they need to be willing to put in the work. Aziz doesn't intentionally make the class more difficult than it needs to be but there is an inherent difficulty that comes with learning a new language. Also, the small class size made the teaching very intimate and our class really bonded. Compared with the other, bigger first-year classes, this class was overall more enjoyable.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in learning Arabic. It does an excellent job at starting from the bare basics with the alphabet to the point where one can write paragraphs in Arabic and engage in basic conversations with knowledge of a great deal of vocabulary in both MSA and Shami. Moreso, I firmly believe the best part of the course is having Dr. Aziz as the instructor as he does an amazing job of teaching Arabic and goes out of his way to help students out when they are struggling while maintaining a great sense of humor."
