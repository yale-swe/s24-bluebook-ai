    "I learned a lot about when to use the different verb tenses in French. I also developed my speaking through the discussion of important works of French literature such as l'etranger by Albert Camus.",
    "In this class my french only improved. My writing and reading skills especially have increased remarkably since when I finished French L2.",

   "comments": [
    "I think the books and the movies are the strength of the class because they lead to good class discussion and they make the students utilize their French vocabulary in different ways. I think the main weakness of the course are the MMP's that follow the film Jules et Jim. They do help us learn but a lot of the things seem redundant.",
    "There are no weaknesses, I think the balance of books and movies we read was adequate.",
    "A focus on speaking in the classroom, I felt as though there was not much of a focus on speaking, writing or forming sentences.",
    "I feel like the French speaking portion of the course should be emphasized a little more because I still feel that speaking and listening was a weakness for everybody.",
    "Heavy workload that doesnt always feel valuable, class would be stronger if there was more time for students to practice speaking the language instead of just memorizing"

    "I would, it is a good way to conclude the language requirement.",
    "Yes! It was a very effective and engaging and ENJOYABLE French class and I highly enjoyed it."
