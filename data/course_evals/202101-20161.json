The works in the class range a broad period, but often have overlapping messages and themes which can be helpful in developing a deeper understanding of the dualities of American history. The professor is extremely passionate about this subject and is both driven to push each student as well as understanding of their varied experiences.",

I feel like the reading selections are probably the strongest part of this course. It could possibly be improved by offering more ways to interact with the material discussed in class."

It will teach you many of the skills you will need as you continue to take literature classes. If you are not an English major but you are still interested in literature, I would still recommend this class as it is very engaging and the seminar format allows you to engage with the material a lot more than in a lecture course.",
