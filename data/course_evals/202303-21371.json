Also, there is limited guidance offered on writing.",

This is an awesome introductory philosophy course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We go through a lot of topics in the span of three months, so we aren't able to go very in-depth on any of them. We also didn't talk as much about writing strategies as I might've liked.",
