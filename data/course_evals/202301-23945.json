                "I enjoyed the structure of each class under Professor Sippel. It was nice to have each lesson parallel with what our course book was teaching. I dont think there was any weaknesses.",
                "The class is extremely well-structured for learning  each day is well-planned with different activities (small group and whole class discussion, vocabulary review, free-writing, watching and responding to German-language videos, etc.). We studied new vocabulary on Quizlet every week and had pen pals at a gymnasium in Nuremberg. \"Asynchronous\" Wednesday classes consisted of watching and summarizing episodes of a language-learning TV show, reading and responding to articles on Canvas, and sometimes other activities (we read a short story by Kafka and poetry by Theodor Storm). I didn't mind this structure or the work, but I found the independent work in the textbook (a new one was used I think starting this year) to be unsatisfying. The Ubungen assignments felt like busywork. We had to fill them out on paper (I think a digital interface would have helped a lot) and then grade ourselves, which was dull and time-consuming.",
                "The Ubungen feel very much like busy-work that doesn't provide an equal payout in terms of knowledge growth for the amount of time it takes to do them. I would feel much more productive and capable in my German if I had redirected my Ubungen time to just repeating the Quizlets.\r\n\r\nAlso, GMAN 110 had a better email exchange format than GMAN 120. New topics every week meant that we were never replying to questions asked in the response emails of the previous week....i.e. no longitudinal conversations.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The course is very thoroughly planned. All assignments and class content for each day are clearly laid out on the syllabus.\r\n- The instructor was engaging, caring, and adjusted to students' individual levels.\r\n- The seminar style format of the class facilitated interaction between students, who were all very friendly and interested in the class content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The workload can at times be overwhelming. For instance, there are days when more than one assignment is due. It is not easy to stay on top of deadlines."
