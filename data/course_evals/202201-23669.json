                "The main strength to this course is the professor, Professor Schenker. She is a wonderful, kind, engaging professor who always looks out for her students. I never was bored in class. Vocabulary, grammar, and content exercises in class were well organized and explained. Assignments were spread out through the semester to make sure we were never doing too much work at once, which I really appreciated. The course focuses on a very specific history, but in being in such a small niche we really got to learn a lot about the youth movements we were studying. Take it!",
                "Its a great course!",
                "Amazing course! No weaknesses",
                "The course was very incredibly well organized and engaging. There was fantastic incorporation of sources from a variety of media sources, such as readings, videos, movies, etc. Classes were discussion-based and assignments were relevant to class material. No weaknesses!!",
                "Strengths\r\n- really engaging teacher and teaching style\r\n- varied classroom and homework content\r\n- inclusion of research into the class work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- none",
                "Strengths - great professor, diverse teaching materials, interesting subject matter \r\nWeaknesses - none",
                "The course is IMMACULATELY designed and organized. It is designed to keep students constantly engaged, and while it can be a high workload at times, always is rewarding.",
                "This course involved very interesting material and an aspect of German history which I knew close to little about. One aspect of this course that felt a little stressful was that there are frequent reading checks\/deadlines\/Flipgrid assignments.",
                "The in-person language course is much better than the Zoom one; it was much easier to participate, as it felt like there was much less pressure whenever a student wanted to speak up (on Zoom, only one person can really speak in a room at a time, but in the in-person class it felt easier to have real conversations, or even answer a question in front of everyone, without the pressure of knowing that you were the focus on everyone's screen!). The reading was usually not too hard or too long, and the novel we read was engaging. The only thing I might change about the class is the percentage of the grade that is attributed to the final project; it is worth 30% of the class grade, which made it very stressful. It would be terrible to do well all semester and then get a sub-par grade in the class because of a few mistakes made on the final project, though I'd also like to say that I haven't seen this happen and it's possible that Professor Schenker accounts for this.",
                "Could discuss the evolution (or lack thereof) of the German education system a bit more",
                "Strengths:  Theresa is one of the best assets the German department and Yale itself have. This was such an interesting class where I learned so much and was never bored of the material. Assignments and expectations were always perfectly clear.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the workload was difficult to handle, but Theresa was always really accommodating and understanding. Anytime students expressed concern with how much reading there was to do, she would split it up for us and put us into groups. She would also, of her own volition, make assignments optional or cancel them during times like midterm weeks."
