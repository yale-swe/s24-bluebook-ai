Through taking this course, I developed a more comprehensive understanding of Asian culture in its historical discourse and diverse contemporary forms. This course challenges a lot of my previous understanding of Eurocentric approach towards Asian culture and history. The assignments of this course were also excellent, which helps me developed a close relationship with the course material and offer me a wonderful opportunity to conduct research on a topic of my choice."
