                "Lot of lecturing with no visual aids - focus for 2 hour seminar required. Mix of grad\/undergrad students which is very nice",
                "Strengths: Trigger (the main reading for the semester) really covers a lot of ground and the class is structured so that we really understand what theoretical concepts like \"new archaeology\" and \"diffusionism\" mean. It also emphasizes the importance of theory in archaeology and why we, as scholars, should really put a lot of mental effort into what frameworks we build our scholarship upon. The course was much more \"leminar\" format in the later half of the course and that felt most conducive to learning rather than a straight seminar format that it kinda began as. Assignments were interesting and well communicated (with presentations of our findings). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: LOTS of reading each week. Readings can be super dense because of its theoretical focus.",
                "I think this class had a nice conversation component. Maybe less readings would have encouraged me to do more of the readings.",
                "Updates on weekly reading could be announced and done more timely.",
                "We had very good weekly readings along with the texts that I thought aided in understanding the theories from the viewpoint of the time in which the theories were popular. I also liked that for our projects we looked at the history of archaeological theories in other countries rather than solely focusing on the United States development of archaeology. \r\n\r\nThere was a considerable amount of reading that was not always possible to keep on top of in detail, but assigning certain readings to various students to lead the discussions helped during the course of the semester.",
                "At times, it was hard to determine the purpose of each class, which basically comprised a long-form lecture from the professor followed by a discussion of readings. On the other hand, the sheer volume of information covered was impressive, and I walked away with a solid understanding of how archaeology developed as a discipline.",

However, the material is not always the most engaging and it can be easy to become bored or unfocused if you aren't super invested in the material.",
