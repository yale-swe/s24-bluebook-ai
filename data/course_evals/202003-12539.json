                "I learned so much about Japanese\/East Asian history and the unresolved historical issues that continue to affect contemporary life.",
                "So much! We basically took an in-depth look at the last 75 years of Japan's postwar history, from the immediate postwar in 1945 to present-day recessionary Japan. We learned both about the broad themes of national forgetting in Japan concerning its former empire as well as the role of the Cold War and Allied forces in this rhetoric and about the individual stories of everyday people who were lost in the cracks of this overarching, dehumanizing narrative from comfort women and former non-Japanese imperial soldiers to war orphans and repatriates to Japan. Definitely if you take this course you will come away understanding so much more about Japan and East Asia as a region today and learn about the often not talked about era of colonialism and imperialism in 20th century East Asia."

                "I really enjoyed how small the class was and the weekly themes that the discussions were centered around. Mixing readings with historical and contemporary films was also very refreshing.",
                "the course was a very in depth look into post-war Japan, would love more focus on visual materials and even a short lecture in the beginning of each session to ground us in a topic for those that arent too familiar with Japanese history",
                "Strengths: I loved the variety of materials that were assigned each week! From films, both documentaries and fiction, to the super interesting readings, from more theoretical pieces to ethnographies, to official government documents. I enjoyed the great diversity of materials we covered each week! I also appreciated how Professor Yukiko made the seminar environment so inviting and open and warm yet also a place to really dig into complicated and deep issues. Professor Yukiko is an amazing professor and so knowledgeable and creates both a fun and enriching classroom environment. And she really encourages creativity and thinking outside of the box, especially when we were writing our papers which was difficult because it was so open-ended but also so great because we got to really experiment with different writing styles and write about what spoke to us. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps a bit more guidance as to what is expected of us in discussions, presentations, papers. But I also recognize that the open-endedness was to really make us stretch our minds and utilize our creativity.",
                "The professor is very passionate about the theme and all the topics discussed were very relevant and eye-opening. The perspectives, especially the anthropological approaches, are very unique, and I enjoyed coming up with creative endeavors for my projects. The materials were pretty interesting as well."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student regardless of whether they have taken many courses about East Asia or not. It's a course that will really teach you about how the region we know as East Asia today has come to be as well as shed light on the issues that still pervade East Asia today from the issue of comfort women to Zainichi Koreans in Japan to controversies over Yasukuni Shrine. And it will introduce you to the wonderful discipline that is anthropology and really allow you to learn and study in a way that really stretches your creativity and sharpens your analytical skills while also informing you about the lives of everyday people. And Professor Yukiko is a joy who really encourages her students to stretch their imaginations and embrace the sometimes uncomfortable complexity of all that we learn.",
