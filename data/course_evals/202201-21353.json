                "I learned a lot about the intersection between musicianship and service. We covered philosophies of musicians and non-musicians alike, and reviewed great examples of how we can use artistry to serve in our own lives.",
                "The course material is a great combination of theory and practice. We started with some philosophy (Maxine Greene, John Dewey, Paulo Freire), learned about the history of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and possible futures for public funding of community art (look up the Peoples WPA whether or not you take the class, its super cool), read about the formation of classical music as it relates to colonialism and white supremacy, and read about/read the writings of organizers (MLK, Grace Lee Boggs, Paul Robeson). We also got to hear directly from Prof. Ruth about his work of over two decades as the founder and artistic director of Community MusicWorks in Providence, and we had some Zoom guests join us to talk about their related work.",
                "I gained a lot of perspective on the different roles an artist can play on society. The class really broadened my understanding of what it means to be an artist/cultural worker and it helped me understand that art and social justice are connected in more ways than I thought."

                "Cant think of any weaknesses!",
                "Two things that are strengths if you like them: the mix of School of Music and Yale College students is refreshing and makes for good variety of conversation. Class discussion is very open-ended, with Prof. Ruth more facilitating us than instructing us. This ties into some of the ideas around transforming pedagogical relations that come up in Paulo Freires writing and other course material. If you dont mind it when a class starts to feel like a reading group, then this is a plus.",
                "Strengths: The readings were also a manageable length and I appreciated that the reading responses always had a question that asked us to reflect on how the content related to our lives as opposed to the normal write about something that was interesting. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is the deadline for reading responses. Having it be noon the day of class (since it met at 4) instead of the night before could have been helpful."
