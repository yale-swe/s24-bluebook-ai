I also learned more about the little errors in my grammar that have not been touched on before.  I think this course overall though really pushed me out of my shell with Spanish, as I am generally nervous about my fluidity speaking, and it really encouraged me to speak more, even if it wasn't always well."

                "I think this course emphasizes cultural learning, which I enjoyed because it gives students a greater appreciation for the world around them. I liked the asynchronous days and how many group projects there were. I enjoyed that we looked at multiple forms of media (books, movies, articles, etc) because they were each very insightful and helped illustrate distinct aspects of Latin American culture. However, I think the amount of daily homework was often overwhelming for myself and others in the class. I was told multiple times that \"you're always doing Spanish homework\". This would be fine if the homework was regularly engaging but more often it was busywork that didn't have a large impact on what we were learning in class.",
                "I really liked all of the projects and thought it was a great way to learn the language.",
                "Some work feels like busywork, but the projects are very engaging.",
                "I think the strengths of the course are the engagements with students that helped me to meet more people and interact with other Yalies in a Spanish-speaking environment.  I think a weakness is the amount of work due every day.  In lieu of exams (which is very nice), there was daily work, which was sometimes really difficult to manage if it was time-consuming.  I think a lot of students in my class did not put forth their best work because of the time crunches."

                "I would recommend this class for the content but not the language acquisition. I don't feel that I really improved my Spanish skills, rather that I just kept using the same four tenses over and over with the same vocabulary. Any verb tenses outside of imperfect, subjunctive, and preterite came from us primarily, and we didn't learn more complex sentence structures. I loved the content that we did and thought that the cultural elements were great, but I don't think that I'm much better at speaking Spanish than I was at the beginning of the year.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes if they are trying to fulfill their language requirement because it is a good class for that, but I don't think its a great class for someone just interested in spanish.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course for students advancing through Spanish and who also want to engage in good discussions about the Spanish-speaking world and different problems within and outside of it.  I think it does a good job of encouraging students to grow with Spanish and learn more."
