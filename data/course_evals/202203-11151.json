                "This class was very engaging with student participation and very well-structured syllabus that helped build the foundation for the language.\r\nA weakness was that we don't get to practice speaking and using the grammar concepts in daily conversations.",
                "This course was very engaging, and I enjoyed learning something new on a daily basis. I appreciated being forced to learn in multiple ways listening and reading comprehension for homework, memory recall in writing characters daily, and extemporaneous speaking during the class itself. I also liked that this course taught grammatical structures and vocabulary concurrently; I think that vocabulary is frequently prioritized in beginner language classes often to their detriment, especially if the language is very structurally different from \r\n\r\nSometimes feedback would be very delayed on homework, so occasionally I would not realize I had been making the same mistake in my homework assignments until after I had done a weeks worth of assignments (and would miss the same thing. It was also difficult to correct scripts for memorized class presentations because of how late the assignment would be graded the night prior.",
                "This course is well-designed and organized. I felt that Chinese L1 exceeded my expectations and my instructor was wonderful.",
                "The class atmosphere was very engaging and supportive, and I learnt a lot more than I expected from a beginners class."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning an East Asian language.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student; although I can only attest to the experience I had with Zhang , Im sure that any student in another section of L1 Chinese would feel the same way. It is a great introduction to Chinese that helps you learn phrases that are not too juvenile that they seem irrelevant to everyday life, and I would argue that the approach to teaching grammar in tandem with vocabulary is imperative for effective learning of Chinese (or any language, for that matter). Although I was frequently warned about the workload of this course, I dont think it was overwhelming, and the amount of work was appropriate for the amount of growth and learning that occurred while I took the course. If one happens to consistently have a block of time free every day, it is well worth it to take this course.",
                "Yes. Although the workload is heavy, you do get what you put into it and by the end of the semester, you will be able to speak Chinese. It is intense, but necessarily so.",
                "Yes! I learnt so much and it was really fun. Im confident speaking in the language."
