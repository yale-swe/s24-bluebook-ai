                "I learned how to read primary sources and relate them to larger historical events. I also learned how the Holocaust, which I thought of as a very specific phenomenon, had more sides than I realized. It was the gas chambers but also peasants killing their neighbors with pitchforks. It was deeply anti-Semitic but also weirdly secular.\r\n\r\nA major takeaway from the course is that, if you look at a variety of sources, it's really hard to put everything into a neat argument. It's so complex.",
                "It was a good course for history majors because it developed skills in terms of reading and understanding sources such as testimonies",

                "Very in-depth insight into the historiography of the Holocaust. I developed skills in writing and discussion. Analysis of historiographic material globally as well.",
                "Learned a lot of the history leading up to the Holocaust and during the Holocaust. We also learned about Holocaust testimony and discussed the meaning of testimony and why it differs from empirical evidence."

                "Professor Dean is a great seminar leader because she listens to what students have to say and is sincerely trying to have a conversation. The syllabus is also really strong: everything fits together.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes felt, however, that the stakes aren't high enough for people to fully engage with the class. Most people don't do most of the reading and, honestly, I didn't either. \r\n\r\nI think Professor Dean is so charitable that she sees every comment as an insight and never exposes people when they don't know about the reading and say things that are shallow. This is nice but also makes it easy to skate by.",

                "I'm a STEM major and so this was my first history\/writing class I've taken in a few years - but because the course material was very self-contained and only required basic background knowledge I felt like I could participate fully in the discussions. Also, 2 papers is really not bad at all for a WR - would definitely recommend.",
