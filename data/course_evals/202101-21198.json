                "Food and its purpose in society, media, and our daily lives. I re-considered the role food has in terms of its purpose and how we use to socialize with others. The diversity in the coursework also exposed to me to the various roles food has in our lives, and I enjoyed being able to examine food in a more diverse way. I enjoyed being able to examine food from Asian to Soul food in the Black South, and my favorite unit was on labor and food, where we examined the actual cost of putting food on ables. \r\n\r\nI also learned how to write. My first ever paper I submitted to Yale in the fall I got a C-/D+, so I intended to take this course to become more confident as a writer. I even had doubts whether or not I could pursue a major here at Yale since I couldn't write. As the spring ends, I can definitely say that I can write, and in my last research paper for this class, I jumped all the way to a B+ with high compliments. While many people would say a B+ is mediocre, I was thrilled to see my growth and understanding on how to write at a college level. Professor Berry's guidance, instruction, and encouragement allowed me to understand where all my faults where, and while at first, it was an extremely difficult journey, I can definitely say it was worth it. I feel so much better about writing essays for future classes here at Yale, and I am glad I took this course.",
                "I learned how to write college level essays that go beyond the five paragraph essays that I learned in high school. Additionally, I learned about different ways to structure papers and that the writing process is a long but fun one.",
                "I learned how to write research papers by taking this course: from properly citing sources to putting evidence in conversation with one other.",
                "I learned how to better my writing skills, learned about lots of US food culture, and had great discussions pertaining to workers, the food industry, eating habits, etc.",

                "Strengths: the diversity and thought. I truly believe many faculty members at Yale should consider making a syllabus with even near the same amount of diversity. It was diverse not only in thinking about food from various cultures, but also in media and presentation. We watched movies, wrote essays, read newspaper articles, research papers, poetry, and examined pictures. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course Reserves was very difficult to handle and sometimes access. I feel like uploading readings as a pdf would just make it easier (besides the VPN for movies). I often got the wrong readings by accident, or had to try and find it myself through google.",
                "The strength of this course was definitely Professor Berry. She always came to class with an energy that was infectious and made every student want to engage. The readings / media she assigned were also extremely interesting; they made me laugh, cry, and think about different ways that food interacts with us (labor, society, identity, etc.) The course could be slightly improved with more writing instruction from the beginning (we did more as the semester went on).",
                "Strengths: the professor is extremely organized and very respectful of students' time; the course material we had for homework was FANTASTIC: we were reading cookbooks and food science and food polemics, and it was enjoyable to do the homework; discussions around food included topics that I had never considered much before; we did check-ins at the beginning of each class that helped you get to know your classmates; you will grow as a writer: even if you think you know how to write a research paper already, the writing skills practiced in this course are very useful to re-cover or to hone your existing skills\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: maybe covid was responsible for this, but sometimes our discussions did not flow well because of lower energy among students",
                "Everyone was very engaged and I enjoyed being in this class. I think some of the readings were difficult to obtain with course reserves, which has nothing to do with how the class was taught. if possible, putting all the readings in files in Canvas would be great. Also, Andie's comments were very specific and helpful in improving my writing.",
                "I really enjoyed the various mediums of reading/viewing/etc. that we analyzed in class. Even more, the large, class discussions were amazing!!"

                "- breakout room sessions for smaller discussions were a good way to facilitate virtual engagement. Especially ones that included 3-4 people instead of 1-1 groups\r\n- Canvas collaboration tools for workshop assignments made the workshop edits and notes very seamless\r\n- the professor included some audio homework assignments with podcasts and speeches to give us time away from screens, and those were very nice",

                "DEFINITELY take this course. Prof Berry is incredibly kind and is focused on improving your writing. While at first, you may find assignments and readings difficult, all of it culminates into a full understanding at the end of the term. I did not expect myself to use the ideas from readings at the beginning of the course at the end, but to my surprise, I did use them to form my research paper. The diversity in the course readings is unparalleled to other courses at Yale, and I felt like learning about foods from Asia to the Black South enhanced my understanding of food in society. I really think other professors should consider a diversity not only in readings from other cultures, but also by including movies, podcasts and graphics. Utilizing various mediums to examine food helped culminate into my final paper where I decided to use food and art to communicate about war. This writing will not only improve your writing, but Prof Berry is genuinely a kind and good person. The first low grades will hurt, but honestly, choosing good professors make classes worthwhile, and Prof Berry will help you become a better writer to get better grades at the end.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in food and improving their writing.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I was very confused coming into college at the writing expected of us in all of my classes, and I think this class provided me with the tools I need to understand what those expectations are and meet (or even exceed) them. This class also introduces you to helpful library resources and encourages students to go to writing tutoring (which I finally started using and which helped immensely). The topics offered in 114 are also pretty interesting overall, so picking one that interests you is a good way to increase engagement.",
