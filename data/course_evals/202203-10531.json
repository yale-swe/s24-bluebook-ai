                "I really value the opportunity to study with talented Yale School of Music students for free through the lessons for credit program, and I have greatly enjoyed my four semesters in the program. \r\n\r\nHowever, based on what I have heard, the teachers seem underpaid! I think that a raise should be considered as the teachers seem to be making far less money than what they would earn from private lessons.",
                "The strength is that you get a very trained vocal coach from the School of Music and they have so much wisdom to offer. The weakness is that you dont get a lot of variety in terms of what type of music you get to sing which feels a bit restrictive.",
                "I wish I had more help reading music because I still struggle with it a bit",
                "The opportunity to have weekly one-on-one lessons is amazing.",
                "Lessons were always clear on their objective and kept me engaged. Only thing I would improve on is letting the applicant be assigned to their teacher quicker, but that may have only been a problem for my instrument",
                "I like the option of having different lesson plans to choose from.",
                "n/a",
                "Really, lessons are catered to you (the student) -- my teacher was incredibly skilled at figuring out what sort of help I needed most and structuring our lessons around that. The only weakness I can think of didn't have to do with teaching but just with communication -- I wish the information about the end-of-semester jury was made clearer earlier (i.e. how many pieces, how to prepare, etc.).",
                "This course is great for the serious musician who would like to improve their playing and work with a very good teacher.",
                "Strengths: I was given the opportunity to learn lots of new music that I maybe wouldn't have learned otherwise\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have appreciated more opportunities to select repertoire jointly, and I would have appreciated more opportunities to discuss the music in a more open and free-flowing way.",
                "This course is very strong. I think my studio could benefit from having one more studio class per semester.",
                "It was wonderful.",
                "There should be more flexibility in the types of music you can work on. Classical music is fine, but it really limits the relevance of the course as a lot of people want to sing other types of music.",

                "Yes, you should definitely take this class if you want to study musical performance for free at Yale, most likely with a graduate student. Do be aware that you will be required to take some music theory courses along with the lessons, though, and the extra one credit from lessons on your schedule can  artificially inflate your schedule load and make your dean less likely to approve your schedule. Your experience in this course will ultimately depend on your specific private teacher and on your dedication and commitment to your craft.",
                "I definitely recommend for any singer regardless of skill level. You really learn very good technique that helps you improve pretty quickly and for most people, you get to sing in a style different from what youre used to.",

                "Yes, it helps your singing and confidence soooo much!!",

The opportunity to take lessons with a Professor is incredible and I also loved the studio class performance setting where you got to know the other people in your studio, and also have the chance to practice performing what you have been working on.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who loves music and their instrument. It was a very nice course and I hope that more people take the course.",
                "Yes. If you want to take violin lessons at a high level, you should be taking lessons for credit. They are free and the instruction is very high quality.",

                "I would recommend it if you're willing to put in the work!",
