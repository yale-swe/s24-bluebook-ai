                "Looking back I enjoyed the class. To keep it real, lecture can be very boring at times. But Prober is an expert in the field who really enjoys the material, and he cares about the class. He's there on cell or by email all of the time, and cares about his students and their well beings. Material is also interesting if you take the time to learn about it yourself.\r\n\r\nCons: I have no idea what my grade is in the class. Class isn't well structured; poorly defined criteria for psets, presentations. If the TF is Tom, prepare to put in a LOT of work. Lots of points taken off by TF for silly reasons that don't make sense. But the class is 110% doable, I'd say go for it.",
                "The course's organization made it tough to follow. Concrete units that divide the course into definitive subtopics might help with this.",
                "I think because it was online, it was hard to focus sometimes. I enjoyed Professor Prober and it was an enjoyable class, but my focus levels werent always there.",
                "I think the course was very educational and the projects were good.",
                "The online environment made the class slightly less than fully engaging. But, the smaller seminar made the class much more interesting than a lecture style class.",
                "The course's strengths include being engaging, current, and generally, something that you'd like to listen to even if not as a part of the class. We also got the rare opportunity to hear from experts in various fields about the new and exciting things being explored in these fields today. A thing that could be improved which is relatively minor is the structure of the problem sets for this course. There weren't many, but I felt they were sometimes overly robotic with a good amount of 'google' questions (although notably this was especially the case for the first pset, and decreased each one after). I liked the questions that were critical thinking based on information learned in class which I felt were much more useful and engaging."

If you want to learn, all the opportunity is there in the world for you to learn more about applied physics. Our class wasn't APHY majors so interest level was low, but if you can take this class with a friend or have a passion for this stuff I'd recommend it. If you have four credits on your worksheet, just add this one. Easy credit to get here at Yale",
