As just one example of what I learned from this course: I think about my own mouth sounds and positions with so much more precision than I did before, and that has enabled me to improve my music production skills as well as understand a little more of what exactly I don't like about hearing my own voice. Moreover, I've been able to be more open-minded and receptive than previously about other people's accents and pronunciations, bettering my ability to accept things I hear as vocally alien.\r\nThis course encouraged me to hone and apply various skills ranging from technological comfortability to better use of citations and backup in verbal conversations."

                "This class was full of fun facts and interesting theories. The lectures were, at times, dense and challenging, but the material covered was generally interesting and engaging. Professor Frank is a very good lecturer, and office hours/review sessions were always helpful. I believe this class could be improved by focusing more on theories of linguistics as opposed to specific phonetics/tableaus. At times, I felt we did not take the time to delve into these topics but were still expected to know the ins and outs of them. I also think this course could be improved if Professor Frank delivered all of the lectures.",
                "Sometimes I felt the course went a little too deep into the material for a course that should be introductory. The 4 homeworks were also somewhat long, which was not an issue for me but could clash with your schedule. The tests were fine, though.",
                "No particular weaknesses come to mind.",
                "The course was very very broad yet still very deep, which made it rather difficult at times.",
                "Strengths - very useful overlap between lectures and readings. Good preparation for exams. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes homework instructions weren't clear.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- extremely well organized material\r\n- lectures made easy to understand and follow by instructors and TA's\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- pacing of content could be improved\r\n- having a final exam during the exam period as well as a final project seemed a bit much in terms of workload",
                "Overall, the course is great.\r\n\r\nLess scientific articles or reading studies might be good, but finding material that synthesizes findings might not always be possible.",
                "Strengths - Professor Frank is very good at explaining material -- you can tell he's supposed to be a professor. The readings were long and dense and had lots of technical jargon, but you didn't even have to do the readings (I stopped after a few weeks of trying) because Professor Frank explained them so well in class. The PowerPoints were helpful for review, and the exams were pretty fair.\r\nWeaknesses - The assignments. They weren't on the syllabus, so we were given a week's heads up (not enough time for planning when all other classes has their assignments posted on the syllabus). They kind of just dropped out of thin air, and towards the middle/end of the semester, we'd have assignment after assignment with no breaks in between. It would have been better if they were more spread out. They were also SUPER hard to understand and EXTREMELY time consuming.",
                "The course was well-taught and there were many opportunities to ask questions in class and in office hours. The material was very engaging and I loved how the material was presented in a way in which we could \"discover\" with the professor if experiments provided accurate results or if results needed further rebuttal to be countered.",
                "Strengths: The material was interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The homework had vague instructions. Also, there was a lot of application questions, which was a skill that wasn't necessarily taught.",
                "I thought that the course was well-organized and the topics discussed were interesting. Based on personal preference though, there were some topics that were not as interesting as others.",
                "Strengths are the material - super interesting. Professor Frank is also very kind and helpful\r\nWeaknesses - homework and exams. Did not really reflect what we learned. The material in class was covered quickly always, the homework was sometimes very abstract and we didn't receive clear feedback. When we got to the exam, it didn't really reflect what the material was about and felt underprepared for it",
                "This course NEEDS to have an organized schedule of when assignments are assigned and due because the professor just throws them out at random times giving us no chance to plan around our other assignments.",
                "The only weakness was that some of the homework assignments took much longer than expected. But overall, the material was interesting, the lectures were engaging, and the expectations were clear and reasonable.",
                "Bob Frank is the biggest strength of this class, he makes learning fun!",
                "a huge downside is the fact that it was very technical, and there was little big picture take aways. exams were also very vague and graded harshly.",
                "The course was extremely engaging, lecture wise. The material was presented incrementally and intuitively, and I almost never felt lost or confused. I think some lectures dragged on a little more than others, but overall it was interesting.",
                "Well structured and taught. Strengths: exams felt like the perfect difficulty. They were relevant to course material and the readings, and sometimes required inference/extra thinking. Weaknesses: a few lectures felt slow and hard to follow, especially with the class as 75 minutes. Most lectures were well paced and stayed engaging though.",
                "The lectures were clear and interesting, as were the expectations for reading responses and the exams. The homework problems were a bit more sporadic, and we didn't really know when they would be assigned or how much time they would take. In general, they were quite confusing (in their wording), but were interesting once you understood what was being asked.",
                "I feel that the content of the course is misrepresented. As a cognitive science major, I often found myself missing cognitive science related content. I think the teaching team spent a lot of time building a foundation in the general linguistics topics like phonetics and structure and grammar, but not a lot of time on bigger cognitive science topics like acquisition and nativism. I think the class would have been more enjoyable had it centered more typically cognitive science related topics.",
                "Strengths: really interesting concepts, and I liked the casual but fun nature of the final essay project as a blog post! The reading responses were fairly easy to complete, and the TA team was very quick to respond to emails. Weaknesses: some concepts were hard to understand even on recorded lecture when I could go back, so I can't imagine how it would be in-person or live lecture when you can't pause and process the material. Syntax lecture unit was extremely difficult to understand, and it was hard to know what was going to be tested since there was so much extraneous material on it. The homework assignments were also hard to answer, so much so that I almost dropped the class before one was due because it seemed so impossible to complete. Luckily, I continued through once Prof Frank started teaching again, and I'm glad I stuck with it. Review sessions were also really early, so I couldn't make most of them.",
                "Its a lot of fun and the course is neatly organized. Cant really think of weaknesses.",
                "Strenghts: there were always resources for help and TA's to meet with. The class was very organized and slides were always concise.",
                "Strengths - great introduction to cognitive science of language, a lot of material covered\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes the lectures were a bit hard to follow, a lot of jargon used. Can be improved by making lectures more engaging",
                "Problem sets (called homeworks) should have been assigned earlier. We generally found out about a week before a problem set 2 that it existed and had about 5-7 days to complete the whole assignment, with little understanding of which weeks they'd be assigned. As someone who falls behind (a lot) on recorded lectures when there is no looming deadline, I found myself binge-watching lectures until 3 am the weeks we had homework assignments (yes, my fault, but a heads up would have been nice). Otherwise, the course was well organized and engaging! Exams were fair.",
                "This course's main strength is the passion that Professor Frank has for the material. Despite this, it has some serious weaknesses - many of the assignments are bizarrely difficult and require skills that are not taught in class. The course is a review course, but the exams focused on minor areas that weren't given prominence in the lectures. To improve this class I think the Professor either needs to make it a class focused on acquiring deeper knowledge of fewer areas, or design exams for a review course.",
                "I would have liked the study guide for the midterm and final to be given to us at the beginning of the semester, it very clearly outline important topics we should look out for.",
                "Very hard to understand",
                "The PSETs were too hard compared to what we learned in class. Also, too much linguistics focus when it shouldve been more cogsci.",
                "The strength of this course was the lectures and the setup of exams/homeworks. Weakness was the times available for office hours, as it was hard to make them given other course schedules",
                "Strengths: engaging professor, interesting material, helpful and understanding teaching team (they respond to emails really fast, and do it thoughtfully)\r\nWeakness: the syllabus wasn't up to date which made it hard to plan ahead sometimes",
                "The major weakness was how detailed and time-consuming the homeworks were. The phonology part of the course was very dry sometimes. Lastly, the syllabus was not very helpful.",
                "This course was very informative and covered a broad range of topics. Lectures were quite one-sided, however, and could have benefited from more interaction with students.",
                "This course was taught beautifully. Professor Frank is an amazing lecturer and he always make materials that are difficult and new to be become digestible with great slides and examples.",
                "Weaknesses: lectures can lose you real quick and then you never catch up until you rewatch it on recording, the homeworks were few but were very tedious and annoying which caused unnecessary stress, the final exam and project felt a bit crammed at the end of the semester\r\nStrengths: professor is very kind and helpful when he's available",
                "The reading responses and homeworks were really helpful in clarifying and applying the content from lecture.",
                "Strength: Very interesting intro class for anyone who is curious about linguistics or about human cognition. A great social science credit for non-social science majors.\r\nWeakness: At some points the materials get a little confusing. This is partly because the studies/experiments we learn about don't always have conclusive results, so sometimes I found myself wondering what exactly I should take away from the various case studies. But this is probably just because we still don't know enough about our cognitive system."

                "Yes, this was the first cognitive science course I took at Yale and it gave me a new perspective on things. Though the workload is on the lower side, I would not call it a gut, as you still have to put in the work to understand the topics and how they all fit together.",
                "I think the content of this course is somewhat different from what I expected going in, but nonetheless really informative and educational. I would recommend this course to students who are truly interested in both cognitive science and linguistics, but maybe not if they are only interested in cognitive science.",
                "Not unless you are already REALLY interested and knowledgeable about linguistics. About half the course went over my head as someone with just psyc/cogsci exposure.",
                "Yes. This course is really, really interesting. Changed how I think about language.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is motivated to learn about intricate processes that occur within the mind that help us understand and formulate language. If you are bilingual, that could be a strength or a weakness depending on if you switch between languages often.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student unless you know that you like/you'll like linguistics. I took this class as a potential cognitive science major, and I'm leaving the class with serious doubts on whether that's the major for me because I really did not enjoy it. I'm not sure if other people enjoyed it but for me personally I did not enjoy it and would not recommend unless linguistics is your thing. there was a lot of really technical information and the homework assignments were also very technical and complex and hard to understand. and do not be deceived by the first week of the material of the course. that stuff was actually pretty interesting, but once we got further into the course it became more linguistics heavy rather than cognitive science heavy. I do hear that this course is not representative of the other courses in the major though.",
                "I would recommend the course. The course material was interesting and provided insight for those who are language enthusiasts or interested in cognitive science.",

                "If the student was interested in the nuances and intricacies of all things language then yes.",
                "Overall yes. Bob frank is very kind and a good professor, there is interest information. Definitely take it if youre interested in Cog Sci / linguistics / psych. It's still a good intro class even if youre not sure what youre interested in, but mostly helps students in these areas",
                "I would only recommend this course if you are willing to take on the erratic workload and also see TAs about the homeworks because you will be lost without help.",
                "Yes, if they're interested in cognitive science. Prof. Frank is an excellent lecturer, and this is the perfect intro course to both cognitive science and linguistics.",

                "I would recommend this course to someone if they already know they are interested in linguistics. The first lecture was an inspiring introduction to the field, but the majority of the course was spent studying nitty gritty topics like phonology and grammatical categories. If grammar trees and tables about syllable structure seem enjoyable to you, it will be a worthwhile experience. If you're taking it as a gut, you will probably find yourself needing to spend a lot more time on these topics than you might have hoped. Still, it would be a very interesting experience.",
                "I would only recommend this close to (prospective) Linguistics majors or Cognitive Science majors with a linguistics related depth theme.",
                "If you are interesting in linguistics or NLP, yes!! The last unit on neural networks and context-free grammar gave me a lightbulb moment which reaffirmed my passion for linguistics. The concepts of grammar and syntax were also really interesting just for general knowledge! As a cogsci major, it was amazing.",
                "yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student (especially if it's for a pre-requisite) since it gives a good introduction to many different topics in linguistics",

                "Although I really enjoyed the material, I'm not sure I would recommend this class. The assignments were complicated, long, and required skills we were not directly taught in class. The exams were overly specific and challenging. However, the content and Professor are great.",
                "Only if they are up for a supreme challenge",
                "I would absolutely not unless you have a strong desire to learn about linguistics. Even in that case, Id still caution against it.",

                "If you are looking for an interesting class to take, even if you arent this major, I would take it! you do have to be engaged in order to understand the material, but if you do the class is straightforward and fun!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone with even a passing interest in linguistics. The course offers a wonderfully comprehensive look into several key linguistic principles and does a fantastic job making them accessible and engaging. I would also easily recommend the course to potential Cognitive Science majors with any interest at all in language or, to a lesser extent, cultural psychology.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in cognitive science of language, Prof Frank is a great professor and he makes the topics very accessible!",
                "If you are not interested in phonetics or phonology, this course can be too boring at times. However, most of the topics were very interesting to learn about, such as the effects of language on perception, theory of mind and language, etc.",
                "Yes, especially if you want to get a working knowledge of what language really is and what its components are. A really interesting feature of this class was putting names to things I did subconsciously while speaking English!",
                "Definitely take it if you are whatsoever interested in language or cognition. I came in blind and I learn so many things!",
                "I would not overall, as a cog sci major I am just glad it's over. Course material is interesting, however the few but tedious homework assignments gave me too much stress for no reason. I spent a full 2 hours of TA office hours on the last homework just to end up right where I started (except exponentially more frustrated) since I received a bunch of \"if I answer that, it will be too much of a give-away\" even though I had literally no idea how to understand the problem that we were working on. This class was much better when recorded since you could rewind and repeat if you missed something (which was often for me). I ended up just tapping out of live lectures since I got lost easily and watched the recordings later on. Exams are ehhhh and the project actually wasn't bad if you liked your topic. BUT, having a big final project due during reading period and then an exam the following week got me stressing a lot on top of my other classes. It was a little too easy to forget about this class due to the sporadic-ness of assignments and such. If you want an intro linguistics or cog sci class, please go elsewhere. This class was rough for me even as an experienced cog sci major. This is the only class I regretted taking this semester.",
