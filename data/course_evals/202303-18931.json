Topics include: linear algebra (which you have ideally learned before taking this class), Lagrangian\/Hamiltonian mechanics (which you have also ideally learned before taking this class, although it's a little less necessary than linear), the double slit experiment (showing that classical mechanics is broken), 1d potentials and scattering, the harmonic oscillator, the uncertainty principle, symmetries and conservation laws.\r\n\r\nI think this course was particularly good at helping me develop an intuition for the math of quantum mechanics.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Doable course, problems are very straightforward, Shankar tells you exactly what you need to\/don't need to know. Amnesty option to base your grade 100% off the final is amazing. Weaknesses: Last 4-5 Psets were graded after we had already taken the final, which made the feedback on them fairly useless by that point. Too much time spent on linear algebra review at the beginning, which made the later topics feel a bit rushed.",
                "The professor was extremely unorganized and wasnt good at all.",
                "I think the general consensus among the people I talked to was that this course moved too slowly at the beginning. Everyone remembers linear algebra and classical mechanics--we don't need to spend 5 weeks reviewing it. That being said, the course does accelerate after the first midterm and starts to get pretty interesting once the quantum mechanics is actually introduced, and the explanation of quantum-related phenomena was surprisingly intuitive.\r\n\r\nThe learning goals were a nice complement to the lectures, and the problem sets were a good length on the whole. I wish we either spent more time on path integrals or finished angular momentum, because the end of the course wasn't very satisfying (I know it's coming in part II, but it still felt a bit awkward to end in the middle of a topic).",
                "Incredible course, very well structured to facilitate student learning. Only weaknesses are that I felt we went way to slow for the first few weeks. We spent so long developing math formalism and classical mechanics that I was bored and felt like I was losing time that we could have been doing quantum mechanics. The pace towards the end of the class was much better though. I look forward to PHYS 441.",
                "Very slow at the beginning",
                "This course was very organized, and I really appreciated the materials being provided from previous years such as lecture videos and Learning Goals sheets. This course definitely facilitated student learning of the material despite the material being difficult.",
                "Strengths: lectures went at a fast, exciting pace, but there was ample time built in for us to ask questions. Professor Shankar is good at putting himself in students' shoes as far as remembering what it's like before you know quantum mechanics. Plus the material is really interesting! Weaknesses: sometimes, the lectures could be a little hard to follow---for example, introducing new notation verbally but not writing down the definition, which could lead to confusion if you missed the crucial moment where it was said.",
                "Professor Shankar has been teaching this course for a very long time. This has advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, he knows the material very well, and the course is very well-organized. There are also many resources available for students (textbook, videos, learning goals sheets) (the learning goals sheets are incredibly useful), and the resources all follow the same plan\/material. \r\n\r\nI'm actually a big fan of the two midterms. The first exam came at exactly the right time, and pushed me to shore up my understanding of the early material. Once I understood the basics, the rest of the course flowed naturally, and I found myself following along with lectures rather than being left behind.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that Professor Shankar sometimes states conclusions without the necessary support, then goes back and fills things in, which can make lectures a bit confusing at times. This is well-compensated for by his encouragement of questions during lecture, although during the first few weeks of the course I often found myself confused at the end of lectures, and Professor Shankar sometimes left before my friends and I had time to ask clarifying questions (even well before the end of the class period).",
                "A strength of the course is that it is well set up for student learning. Professor Shankar provided recorded lectures from a previous year with built-in practice quizzes, as well as very good lecture notes which also included practice problems. The textbook was also an excellent reference, and since Shankar wrote it himself, it aligned perfectly with what we were doing in class. Shankar spends a lot of time in the beginning of the semester reviewing classical mechanics and introducing all the new math he will be using, and does a great job making sure everyone is prepared for QM before jumping in. Despite all this, I think the course management could have been a little better. While the workload was never unreasonable, it was difficult to know what to expect each week. In general, Shankar's email responses are quite brief, and he tended to leave a lot to the TAs. We got review sessions for the first midterm and the final, but there was nothing at all for the second midterm. We got a practice exam for the first midterm and there was no pset due that week, but there were two psets due the week of the second midterm which did not have that much to do with the material on the second midterm. Although it wasn't very difficult to find practice problems, it would have been nice if the course was a bit more organized. There was also a homework that was mislabeled, and then was labeled confusingly afterward, so that a TA had to fix it at the end of the semester.",
                "Warning: It is HARD. The textbook is one of the most confusing things to read and can take forever just to figure out what is trying to be said. For both the midterms and our final exam, we had one or multiple problem sets that had not yet been graded, with one of our midterms being the same date that we had TWO problems sets due that were on material that would be on the test, not even giving us a chance to review the material after it had been graded. Notes were provided for lectures, which was helpful for reviewing, but the notes also had practice problems that sometimes didn't have any solutions or sometimes had unhelpful solutions, such as one solution that just said \"Read the book.\" Prof. Shankar wants you to ask him questions, and you definitely should ask him all the questions you have, but he doesn't create an environment where you feel particularly comfortable asking questions. He would sometimes make comments that basically said that we should already know or well understand the topic that he was talking about, which made it difficult for me to feel comfortable asking questions about those topics. I would have asked many more questions and understood the material better if this hadn't been the case.",
                "The lectures were generally informative and Professor Shankar is a funny, engaging lecturer. He's obviously a true expert in this material and has been teaching the course for a long time, and it showed in the quality of his lectures. If we didn't understand something during lecture, there were lots of resources available to review the material, including lecture notes, the textbook (written by Shankar so very similar to class material), and past recorded lectures. This semester, he offered two midterms, which placed less burden on each individual midterm. I think the pacing of this class was improved, as a large amount of time was spent reviewing material that most students already knew. Later in the semester, harder quantum mechanics content was covered much more quickly, and I would have better grasped the material if more time was spent on this material rather than on the review."

As long as you use all the resources available to you (of which Shankar makes sure there are MANY: LaTeX typed lecture notes, pre-recorded lectures, office hours, past\/sample exams...) you will be fine and you will also learn so much! You will need to dedicate time to this class but if you do it will certainly pay off in the end!",

                "Definitely! Pretty much exactly what you'd expect; solid introduction to quantum mechanics.",
                "Yes if interested in quantum mechanics. I don't know much about PHYS 439, so I can't do a direct comparison, but it's hard to imagine the course being better if we'd had to move more quickly and fit everything into a single semester, instead of spreading the material out over PHYS 440 and 441. The class isn't perfect, the beginning of the course especially (at times during early lectures I found myself confused about linear algebra, which I had already learned last year!), but in general, I'm quite happy with how this class went. I feel like I understand the material more or less completely (not always the case with physics classes), and I'm looking forward to 441 next semester.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course. For all its faults, the material is very interesting and Shankar is a very talented teacher. The course moves very slowly at the beginning as Shankar makes sure that everyone is prepared for the rather mathematical treatment of QM he gives. He is a theorist. Be sure to check if 440\/441 or 439 is right for you.",
                "No I wouldn't. I don't think it is taught the best, with the textbook being indecipherable and the lectures being confusing to follow. I also feel like he relied to much on math at times to explain what was happening when it would have been useful to give an explanation of what we were working with or what was happening that the math explained. It also really sucked whenever a solution would just say something like \"read the book\" without providing even where in the book to look.",
                "Yes. I think that quantum mechanics is essential material for any student in physics (or a related field), and beyond that, it's incredibly intellectually interesting and challenging. Shankar is the best lecturer to deliver this material, having written the textbook, and the lectures are informative and engaging. Based on my understanding, this course is probably best taken in sequence with 441, in order to study such interesting things as the hydrogen atom, applying what was learned in 440. Also, students should be proficient in linear algebra to be best prepared for this course."
