                "In general, I like the way this course is delivered. It would be somewhat better if the details of certain proofs are emphasized.",
                "Strenghts: Course is well-designed; professor is enthusiastic about the material and teaching; lecture notes were great; Prof. Shin is the heart of the class; a good Hu credit for CS or MATH majors that don't wan't to take an usual Hu course.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are long and most people weren't engaged (e.g. working on other psets).",
                "Grading felt kind of arbitrary at times; the class was really interesting but it was impossible to know what reason you'd be scored down on assignments.",
                "Professor Shin is a fantastic teacher, and her oral exams are a great way for students to know if they truly understand the material.",
                "Strengths: Sun-Joo is a warm and charismatic lecturer who cares about the class and her students. Her handouts are detailed and makes it easy to follow along. Course material is super interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: some lectures are student presentations of varying quality. If you want to actually learn the stuff the student groups talk about, read the textbook instead.",
                "The content and the professor are fantastic. I'm so glad I took the course. I also think the pacing is a bit uneven. The week before the oral exam, the week of the final exam, and the week of the presentation are pretty intense. The rest of it is pretty chill.",
                "The course in on a very niche subject so there are not that many materials online but the professor does a good job at providing the necessary materials in class.",
                "Sun-Joo was an engaging teacher who explains content clearly.",
                "Strengths: Interesting and fun lectures, problem sets, exams, and presentations.\r\nWeakness: The preparatory materials for oral test could be richer, especially for the one uncovered during classes. Maybe there could be some practice exercises given before the actual oral test."

                "Sure. Material is interesting, professor is enthusiastic, and it's a great Humanities credit for STEM",

                "Yes!",
                "Yes! If you're interested in the foundations of math or formal systems generally, this class is essential. If you have a math background this class will not be difficult, and the material is very interesting with a great lecturer. Workload is also pretty low, with the exception of preparing for the oral exam\/if you're doing a presentation.",
                "Yes if youre interested in the material, want a lower-workload credit, and are prepared to take a risk with your grade. Prof. Shin is a good teacher and really nice overall, although her exams (written and oral) can become exercises in reading her mind in a way that nobody would expect from a definition-theorem-proof kind of class.",
                "Yes!\\ The handouts for the course are well organized. The textbook is also useful and helpful. BE AWARE that the oral exam and the final are both quite time-intensive. The problem sets are more relaxed, and there are not too many of them. The content is also really cool. I'll admit -- I don't quite understand all of the technical details of the last two lectures of content, but I thought the class overall was really interesting. Some background in math or the prerequisites for the course is probably a good idea.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone with a solid proof background. If you have not been exposed to the theory of computability before, it may be a bit confusing at times. But if you have a strong proof background and are willing to put in the work, it will be a good class.",
                "Yes, though I would like to see more OH\/discussion sections.",
                "Yes. This is such a fun class. The course materials are VERY engaging and the assessments were organized in a very fun and intriguing way."
