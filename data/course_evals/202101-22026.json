Each class (or almost each class) we'd spend time discussing or being lectured about a particular writer, their life, and their journey in the \"Orient,\" from people like Voltaire, Guatier, Delacroix, to more obscure like Denon. French people sure liked to make trips to the fantastical Orient (aka the Middle East and anything not deemed 'Western') and like to bring their biases with them. The questions provoked by Orientalism and the concept of the Orient are complicated ones, especially with French's colonial history, and so it was very fascinating to survey all of these various forms of writing -- travel journals, philosophical tales, fiction, non-fiction, travel notes, and even paintings and plays. I've also honed my analytical skills in general, but also in French. My writing and thinking in French has definitely improved.",

                "Strengths are that you receive a wide and varied breadth of information, and I felt like I learned a lot about French writers and artists who were looking to the Middle East for inspiration. \r\nWeaknesses: I don't know if it's because this semester was particularly difficult, but this class sucked out my soul. Be warned: the readings are all a bunch of French white guys who don't know what they're talking about, and it's aggravating to have to read stereotypes week after week without any critical examination. I felt like the professors saw no problem with this given the way that they taught the course. There was hardly any interrogation of the power dynamics between France and the Middle East; the professors seemed to suggest that they were historically on an equal playing field even though colonization happened because \"France borrowed some things from the Middle East too.\" It felt like a very tone-deaf class to me personally, and I wish that I had known beforehand that we were just going to read a bunch of white French men. When I say that this class made me want to never pick up another book by a white French man, I mean it. If I never hear Voltaire's name again, it'll be too soon. I would rather drink ten jugs of Yale Spa Water mixed with 5-Hour Energy than take this class again. I would rather lick ten people's face masks than take this class again. I would rather eat ten copies of the book Les Miserables page by page than sit through this class again.",
                "Perhaps not as much opportunity to speak but this is probably due to Zoom",
                "I liked this course a lot. The workload is extremely reasonable and I liked the variety of texts we read. Sometimes, it did feel like we were going through the texts so fast we couldn't appreciate them enough",
                "This class had quite a few strengths, but on the other end, quite a few weaknesses -- however, I think a lot of the weaknesses stem from the Zoom format, and that this course was taught by two brilliant professors who seemed to be at odds rather frequently. The selection of readings was fantastic -- never did I know there was just so much stuff to read about French people and the Orient. When Madame Sanjabi actually had time to speak, I held onto every single word she said. And yet the breadth of the reading list also inhibits any great deal of close reading or analysis, because you spend anywhere from half a class to only one class discussing one particular author or one particular work, to the detriment of actually deeply learning about or analyzing the piece. Both professors Sanjabi and Girard are brilliant, without a doubt, perhaps of the most brilliant at this university, and so listening to them speak about these writings was a joy and a delight. And yet there was little room for discussion, if at all, and when there was room, no one had anything to say, because we had not adequately addressed the readings. Girard teaches in a very 'French style,' wherein she lectures for the majority of the class; Sanjabi is the opposite, she asks questions, provides a little context, and entertains a discussion. The class time was unevenly divided between the two professors, so I spent most of the time bored or not paying attention, simply because we never really got into the meat of these readings. Travel journals and travel writings are incredibly difficult to ground oneself in, and then being asked to write about them in paper assignments is a monumental task, one that I felt wholeheartedly unprepared for. This class could have been so much more, and yet I felt like I missed out. The level of engagement was fairly low, with a lack of participation to boot -- but also, there was nothing to say, nothing to ask. Class also frequently went 10-15 minutes over time, which could be quite frustrating. We also spent waaaay too much time going over the biographical details of the authors/writers, and too little time actually discussing the texts. Sanjabi got cut off on a few occasions, so we didn't even discuss some of the poems we read; and frankly, I lost interest during those periods, which was almost every class. I took away bits and pieces from each class, and it pains me to say, but I don't think I gained a lot from each class.",
                "Strengths: breadth - this course covers a LOT of content on Orientalism from all the time periods we cover; free choice for presentation topics with input from the professors on your plans\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: felt more like a lecture than a seminar. Most of the class was the professors presenting on the content, giving little time for student input. We did not have many discussions.",

However, the professors were super bad with technology, and this was mostly a lecture class. The slides were boring and I could not focus no matter how much I tried. I thought this was supposed to be a seminar but it was basically a lecture.",
                "A class that is advertised more as a seminar based discussion course, as opposed to a lecture course, should be taught as such. With Zoom being unfamiliar territory for, specifically Professor Girard, we spent most class time staring at her PowerPoint slides and being spoken to, rather than participating and discussing the readings and works at hand. This can make any class, and especially a Zoom class, drone on and on, since we expected to be speaking, asking questions, diving in to the texts, and in turn, were being lectured at for most of the class. I understand that this is a teaching style and I'm not asking either Sanjabi or Girard to change their teaching styles, but rather to adapt to the monotony of the Zoom classroom. There are ways to be more engaged, and a lack of technological proficiency can hinder that engagement greatly, coupled with a never-ending monologue on the part of one of the professors."

Our class was quiet, but I truly feel like we didn't have enough context to have a productive discussion. The readings were difficult without any vocabulary/contextual help. If the subject REALLY interests you, go right ahead. Otherwise, there are many other classes that you can take in the French department.",
                "Yes. Especially given how little the French department engages with the francophone world outside France",
                "Definitely! It is an amazing french course to take",
                "With great reservation. This combo of professors could've been a dream team, but alas, it was not. Uneven, competing teaching styles does not a good class make. The texts are difficult to parse, and there doesn't seem like there's much to say. Oh, another racist Frenchman with stereotypical depictions of the Orient! Woohoo! Now, I won't say that all of the readings were like this, because some of them were not. In fact, the stuff by Voltaire was incredible interesting, as were some of the travel journals, even. But paying attention in class was a struggle. Participating felt like a chore. Learning really felt like a chore, actually. I love both of these professors with my whole heart, having taken classes with both of them. They're not only gems of people, they're diamonds at this university, and it is a privilege to study alongside them -- so that would be a reason to take the class. And yet over Zoom, it was a nightmare. If you like art history, then you might have appreciated some of the lectures a lot more than I did (and I say lectures because there was virtually no discussion element in this class save for when Sanjabi took up the mantle -- I savored every minute that she did), but if you're here for the literary analysis stuff, you might want to look elsewhere. This class is undoubtedly an incredibly important foray into a particular subsection of French literature and history that isn't always taught, as it isn't among the 'conventional' literary canon in France, so it is a significant course in that respect.",
                "If it wasnt virtual, I would recommend it. Also, if you want to learn about the formation of the imaginary orient by the french, than this would be a useful course. I would also recommend coming to class with questions to facilitate participation and engagement.",
