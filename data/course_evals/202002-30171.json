   "comments": [
    "I developed a greater degree of confidence in my ability to translate texts in Spanish. Whereas before I felt intimidated to translate and cite sources in a second language, I now feel comfortable in doing so. The course was also particularly helpful in exposing me to idioms and verb conjugations that had been tricky for me to understand in the past.",
    "I developed my knowledge of basic Spanish grammatical rules, verb conjugations, and vocabulary. I also developed the skill to read, comprehend and translate Spanish language texts. This has given me new insight into the Spanish speaking world.",
    "I gained the ability to read Spanish texts with a degree of ease and fluency. Without any background in Spanish, I was able to lay the groundwork for an understanding of grammar and vocabulary. The course taught me valuable strategies for translation and for grasping the meaning of a text. By the end of the course, I was able to understand and translate Spanish texts into idiomatic English."

   "comments": [
    "The best feature of the course was receiving detailed feedback from the instructors. There were some discrepancies between the start of the course date and the actual start of the course, so we were not able to interact with other students on the forum-based discussions as much as I had originally hoped. However, I am grateful that the instructors thought to include them.",
    "The course syllabus was very logical and the lessons and assignments logically built upon one another. I would have preferred this course to have been in person so I could have better learned how to pronounce Spanish words.",
    "I thought this was a wonderful course. I think the course leaders did a great job of teaching grammar in a clear and accessible way and provided thoughtful and helpful feedback on assignments. I also really enjoyed the texts we read, which were challenging but helped me to develop reading skills quickly."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - the course gave me an excellent introduction to the basics of reading Spanish-language texts, but was also manageable and clearly taught. I also very much appreciated the self-paced nature of the course.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any student wishing to translate Spanish texts. This course will provide the basics to a student who has just started Spanish, and it will also equally enrich the understanding of any student who is returning to the language after a break or limited initial instruction.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to graduate students who need to fulfill their language requirements. But I would also recommend supplementing it with additional Spanish practice.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I felt that it was very helpful for graduate students hoping to build reading proficiency relatively quickly.",
    "My reading skills improved immensely over this relatively short period of time. The instructor(s) were extremely helpful with all questions or concerns. The feedback was generous and motivating. The organization of the course material was excellent. The range of texts was perfectly balanced and intellectually challenging. I would highly recommend this course."
