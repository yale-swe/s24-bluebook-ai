                "It's taught entirely in French which is both a strength and a weakness. Immersion in the language definitely helps you pick up on sentence structure and vocabulary, but I often found myself translating what the instructor said in French to English, and filling in blanks to make it make sense. The only issue was this made me make false logical assumptions, assuming certain articles meant things they didn't and such.",
                "Classroom participation is encouraged and helps facilitate the learning of French. There is also daily homework in an eTextbook that mostly lines up with what we learn in class. The oral portion of the tests can be difficult at first because the electronic format is not similar to the classroom environment whatsoever.",
                "Strengths: Professor Ngame has a really excellent teaching style and ensure students really understand concepts prior to moving forward. I enjoyed the cadence of the course and the fact that from day one everything was in French\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was a bit of confusion regarding deliverables and I would have appreciated a more solid syllabus at the start of the semester. Additionally I felt some of the early listening portions of the exam were a bit out of our capabilities that early in the course"

                "Sure, why not. It's a very strong introduction to French. It just simply only applies to those interested in taking French.",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone interested in and committed to learning French at the college level. Even though it is an introductory course, it is difficult compared to some of the other languages offered.",
