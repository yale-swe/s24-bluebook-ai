                "Strengths: content was very good and engaging, problem sets were interesting \r\nWeaknesses: could never tell when recorded lectures would be released or quizzes assigned",
                "This course is very good if you want to learn Java in a small period of time. There were ample resources to help you as well. There were office hours all the time even late at night and I really liked using Ed discussions. However, in my opinion this class moved way too quickly. There were was too much information to learn that it felt like I was constantly sprinting from one idea to the next, instead of fully understanding the previous information. This made it quite challenging.",
                "It was very difficult for me that the lectures were released on Fridays and then we had quizzes on them on Monday, forcing us to watch the lectures over the weekend. I didn't hate the flipped-classroom approach to this course, but the fact that the lectures couldn't be done during the week was painful.",
                "The problem sets were very enriching and covered a variety of interesting areas of application with Java.",
                "I feel like the recorded lectures were quite helpful, but I didn't find the discussion sections to be quite as helpful. I feel like sometimes we were thrown off the deep end to complete certain practice problems, which is really difficult to do considering the short time we have in sections. Instead of going right into practice problems, I feel like the TAs should explain the concepts more in depth as some students may not have understood the material strictly from the recordings.",
                "The class moves extremely fast, especially if you're someone who has no experience with programming. The TAs are amazing and are always super helpful in section and in office hours. The recorded lectures were very well organized. Still, the distribution of time spent on psets will vary significantly from person to person, because plenty of people taking the class already have coding experience. There are also recorded lectures to watch outside of section and much time will be spent on homework.",
                "I enjoyed the section format of the course, as it really allowed students to get involved with the material and collaborate with other students to understand everything. The class was amazing and extremely helpful as far as teaching people to code, but the main area for improvement is the workload. Between the problem sets, the lecture videos, and the quizzes, I was spending approximately 10 to 15 hours a week on this class, and that made it a bit tougher to manage my time. I completely understand that the depth of the material covered necessitates that students spend a sufficient amount of time on the subject, but I think changes as small as capping the pre-recorded videos at 30 minutes instead of 1 hour will go a long way in giving students some time to work on other things. Additionally, I think it would be helpful if references to the textbooks were provided throughout the semester, such that students know what chapters to look at when trying to understand a concept in more depth.",
                "The strengths of this course would have to be the office hours on discord and the optional sections that the TAs host. They had a bunch of times throughout the week which allowed most students to come into office hours at least once per week. The weaknesses that I would say this course had would probably be the lecture videos. Normally the videos were supposed to be uploaded the Thursday prior to next week's sections on Monday and Wednesday, but throughout the semester the lecture videos were uploaded Saturday and Sunday which made it rushed to learn since the material is expected to be understood by Monday. The only improvement would be uploading the lecture videos earlier.",
                "Weakness: moves too quickly and there are way too many assignments, so it's hard to really understand what's going on in the class. I felt like I was just doing assignments and from midterm on, I would often get stuck on assignments for hours and relied on TA help.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe one strength I can say (though it leads to a major flaw) is that the psets were very interesting and well thought out, but they, for the most part, do not belong in this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nThe class constantly impeded learning. \r\n\r\nThe first mistake is to start off beginner programmers with Java. Java is a terribly clunky and complicated language to learn as a beginner.  \r\n\r\nThe class often impeded learning. There was a major disconnect between what we were learning in class and section and the psets. The psets were overcomplicated, long, and not actually good for learning the material. In particular, the psets often went outside the scope of the class. It's better to master the basics first before moving on to applying basic concepts and learning about something outside the scope of the class. \r\n\r\nThe class if not conducive to learning for beginners. Even though it's supposed to be a class for people who have NEVER been exposed to programming, it seems the course organizers foolishly thought it was a good idea to make it challenging even for the people who have had plenty of programming experience. This was a pity, as lots of actual beginner programmers dropped out of the class by the midterm. As I said, the psets are overcomplicated and should actually provide exercises so that students can thoroughly learn a concept and use it in different contexts. Instead they were behemoth projects that could take upward of 15 hours, yet not actually make you learn the concepts well. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure why the lecture were often posted late. I'm also not sure why they were often much shorter than the allotted time that the lectures are supposed to take. Usually, but often not, all the lectures would be posted on Friday (sometimes much later) when in a usual semester they were to be shown on Monday and Wednesday. The usual lecture time for each week ought to be 150 min, instead it was sometimes much less. In general, the material was rushed through both in lecture and macroscopically in the course. That is, the topics up to 2D arrays (the midterm) probably could have been spread out for the whole semester in order to ensure that beginner students were really mastering each concept, and the Object Oriented programming stuff could have sprinkled in here and there. Instead, this class offered a terrible, discouraging introduction to programming for any actual beginner to programming. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend you not take this class as a first introduction to programming, unless the class changes dramatically and the organizers realize that there no doing one any benefits by structuring the class the way they are, and instead get experience on your own or maybe start with CS50.",
                "It is a lot of work. But that is a strength. The TA availability is awesome (so are they) and the course is design so that you get back what you put in. I'd love if they put up the lectures a bit sooner and had a more set schedule, but overall the class was fantastic.",
                "I liked that the course was self-paced, with asynchronous lectures. However, I felt that one weakness was the quality of feedback on the homework, as the graders didn't leave many notes or explanations. However, there are a LOT of office hours for this course, so anything you need can generally be addressed easily.",
                "I wish the communication was a little bit better.",
                "It was hard to participate when the format so heavily relied on recorded lectures. But it was nice to be able to prepare for class on your own time.",
                "The organization of this course is a major weakness. While the problem sets are honestly pretty entertaining but time-consuming, the professors were at times difficult to reach. I was lucky to have section leaders I really liked, but some of the TA's would consistently give me wrong information in office hours. This course is a good intro to programming, it just needs better organization.",
                "I thought the course was very organized",
                "Great course",
                "Strengths: really good survey of compsci topics, Java is a really easy language to pick up",
                "i liked the course a lot, not much to say",
                "Strengths: Wonderful TAs and professors were helpful in one-on-one meetings.\r\nWeaknesses: Sections. I think there shouldn't be extra activities; rather, I think section time should be used for problem sets. Additionally, problem set solutions should be posted. They weren't, and I didn't know how to check my work or get viable solutions without pestering the TAs or professors.",
                "At times, when I went to office hours, the TAs told me that they had never learned java before in the classroom and/or didn't really understand what we would learning themselves. This made it take hours longer than necessary to complete the coursework. These TAs were also teaching our in-person sections, and it often felt they did not understand what was happening (the answer to a lot of questions was I don't know).\r\nThe lectures need to be improved and cannot vary in length so much that it is impossible to budget time. Also, the TAs should have better training.",
                "This class seemed way too involved for an intro class at some points",
                "It was very inconveniently set up, video lectures were never posted at the same time, and it was hard to figure out where any information on the course was posted. All in all, I was often left very confused as to what I needed to do each week. Although we were told that every week there would be a quiz on the lectures, sometimes one just wouldn't show up, and it was very stressful trying to figure out whether one would be posted on short notice. Also, needing to watch recorded lectures over the weekend was unpleasant. This is, however, a great basis for learning programming/java, the organization skills just seemed a bit lacking.",
                "Strengths: I think this is overall a good introduction to CS. I had some background is CS-ish things (MATLAB and R), but no true programming experience; I found everything understandable. I enjoyed the lectures and the psets overall. \r\nWeaknesses: I have two major complaints. First, the psets often demanded a knowledge of subjects other than CS. N-body (knowledge of college-level physics) and GuitarHero (knowledge of music) come to mind (these probably *could* be done without prior knowledge, but certainly are *much* more difficult -- you'd have to do a lot of physics learning). CS has a reputation that it's for \"mathy\" people and that it's really hard to break into if you don't have a coding background from high school (that's the reason I waited until my senior year to take it; I was scared). Please don't make the class any more difficult than it has to be for people without strong STEM backgrounds by making the pset require an understanding of material that's not directly relevant to CS. My other comment here is just that I think people who are professors of or getting degrees in CS really underestimate how difficult, for example, the N-body problem is for someone who isn't that.\r\nSecond, the lectures were posted *very* late. The idea was lectures would be posted Monday, we'd have the week to watch them and take a quiz due the following Monday, and have section on those lectures that second week. However, the lectures would often come out Saturday, meaning we'd have 48 hours to do the quiz. We'd never know when they'd come out, so we'd have to keep checking and checking, and when they were finally released. Sometimes, we'd get told Monday that the lectures were just posted, and the quiz was moved back to Wednesday. This meant we had to rearrange our schedules for the week, on zero notice, and that section wouldn't make sense (it was supposed to be a review of lecture). \r\nAgain, overall a good class; don't get me wrong. But these things need to be improved.",
                "Psets overly cumbersome at times.",
                "Strengths\r\n-Very well designed psets that were fun to work on\r\n-Lots of office hours\r\n-Lots of different kinds of assignments and ways to improve your grade\r\n-Appropriate emphasis on broader programming concepts rather than Java specifically. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-Psets tended to be more difficult than the practise activities in section",
                "The problem sets were very interesting, real-world applications of Java and were very fun to code. The lectures were also very clear, and engaging. Some lectures covered a lot of new information in a short span of time, but it was still easy to follow. The discussion sections were also helpful to cover any areas of confusion in the lecture and learn from other students in the class. One weakness of discussion sections though is that the problem sets we had to code collaboratively seemed too difficult for the limited class time.",
                "It was entirely virtual, and while on the surface that may seem like a non-problem for a computer-based class, it most certainly was. Having no easy way to display or share code privately or otherwise, receiving constructive feedback was often incredibly difficult. Group projects were thus particularly loathsome.\r\nThe strengths of this course include easy-to-understand guidance on how to learn how to code in java and write organized, understandable programs."

Also, the problem sets being pair programming mostly throughout the whole semester made it so students can meet other students to collaborate to finish the problem set.

Because we were put into breakout rooms to do them, sometimes you would get a partner you clicked with, and other times it was essential individual work time. I feel like breakout rooms are always better when bigger.",

                "recorded lectures were good, felt like the discussion sections were a bit unnecessary",
                "The recorded lectures were good for content, but they varied in length. They were never posted until Friday, and we had to complete a quiz Sunday night which made the length differences difficult for allocating time. Also, sometimes they would forget to post lectures and move around quizzes which just became more confusing.",
                "section run by TAs was not engaging",
                "Having recorded lectures to watch over the weekend was very unpleasant, I would have rathered a different weekly schedule.",

                "Having recorded lectures that had to be watched in advance and mandatory section during scheduled class time made the class a far greater time commitment than it was supposed to be.",
                "The recorded lectures were very helpful since I was able to watch the lectures at my own time and at my own pace. The virtual discussion sections were very helpful, but it was difficult to follow others code and add to it in a group project without being in person. The break out rooms were effective for coding the discussion section assignment, since we can work with other new students in the class and learn from each other. Sometimes the assignment was too much to code within a limited class time, especially since it covers new topics."

                "I would recommend this to another student who wants to understand if they like computer science or learn Java. You learn a lot. However, make sure that you are able to spend a lot of time for this class. I don't know if this was specific to online learning, but with recorded lectures and sections 2x a week, I was in class for about 4 to 4.5 hours a week. The problem sets were also quite brutal and time intensive. Some took me 15 hours, with my standard being 8-10 hours per problem set.",
                "Absolutely! I came into this class knowing almost nothing about programming, and left having the basic knowledge to build my CS skills in many other areas - other languages, topics, etc. The amount of assistance you get from the ULAs is incredible and super helpful!!! They truly helped me work through my coding/debugging blocks on the various psets and understand what went wrong so I could fix such problems on my own later.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student regardless of their future aspirations because the foundational skills and knowledge in Java could be helpful for learning other programming languages, and it could be a lot of fun for anybody who loves to solve problems.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I had already taken AP Computer Science A in high school and wanted to refresh by taking this course. Many people skip it, but I think a lot of extra material was covered here than in high school, and was taught way more in depth. The professors were very articulate in explaining topics, which I appreciate. To those people who are thinking about skipping the class, I would recommend you to take it.",
                "Yes, as long as you have time to work on psets. You will learn a lot in a very little amount of time, especially if this is your first time programming. Office hours are super helpful.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone hoping to gain an introductory experience with Java. I came into the class with no coding experience and can now code entire programs in the language. I  would say, however, that time management will be important for any student planning to take this class  they should prepare to dedicate a substantial amount of time to the class each week. But, in the end, it's time well spent for the amount of knowledge and skills that are gained.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Java was a pretty cool language to learn and the projects that are done here are a good level of difficulty. The end product of all these problem sets is amazing and rewarding. This course helps you build problem-solving skills and gives you the java knowledge to apply to projects that you would like to pursue outside of the classroom.",
                "Not unless the course removes 3-4 assignments and spaces the rest out more evenly throughout the semester. The amount of work detracts from actual learning.",
                "I would not. This was a terrible experience, and the class needs to change in order for programmers starting with no experience to actually benefit. The psets are overcomplicated and don't actually help learning the material, the work load is discouraging and burdensome ,and for no good reason. You're better off getting programming experience on your own or starting with CS 50, unless they change the course and actually start catering to beginner programmers.\r\n\r\nThis course suffers from a grand picture of itself. It should really just aim to be a thorough and evenly challenging intro class focused on ensuring that programmers with no experience learn basic concepts thoroughly. If an introductory class such as this is paced reasonably, with appropriately difficult and time-consuming assignments, and with a healthy expectation of its students, then there will be a healthy challenge to the students and good for learning, but not so over-challenging and time draining that its a discouraging experience.",
                "100% for non majors. Knowing how to program is very important and even greater than that, the logic and practical thinking included increases problem-solving abilities.",

                "Not unless they have a very easy semester when they want to take it and are ready to dedicate a lot of hours every week",
                "I would recommend this course as a good starting point for learning how to program, however I would advise any student to be wary of the organizational issues of the course. Due dates were often shifting and hard to keep track of.",
                "Yes, overall. I came in with a bit of background in R and MATLAB and felt that I learned a lot and that the class was at the right level for me.",
                "Potentially- if you have absolutely no background in programming (like I did). However, I do not know how this course compares to other intro options such as CS50. Also, if you would like to acquaint yourself with a language other than java, this is not the course for you.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student that wants to learn how to code, especially in a language used widely in the world. The problem sets are very interesting, and allows you to understand how Java can be used to create programs that can be used in the real world e.g. Hangman. Additionally, the final project is a great way to learn how Java can be used to create your own creative project.",
                "If someone's interested in learning java programming or just generally how to think about how to solve problems and work with a computer, this course is good. I would not suggest taking it in an online format, however."
