                "I learned a lot from this class. My critical thinking and analysis skills most certainly improved, as did my general knowledge of Austen, Bront, and the other authors we studied. Our class discussions were truly incredible - Professor Trumpener is always able to excavate so much from the texts we read.",
                "Contentwise, I was exposed to a wonderful new world of books and authors that I had not explored before. It was an amazing curation of fantastic authors taught by such a supportive and engaged professor. I learned so much about social values, courtship rituals, as well as writing style in the time of Austen, Bronte and beyond. I also definitely honed my writing skills and really enjoyed the attention Honglan and Professor Trumpener gave to working on our prose.",
                "We dealt directly with each of the texts, dissecting them and investigating them to an extent that I have not achieved before this course. We did not use secondary sources as our approach into each of the novels, which was new for me but also extremely rewarding. It allowed us to really use our own thoughts and consider our own impressions from the texts, while many Yale courses consider that component as secondary with other critics' thoughts guiding the discussion. Even as a senior in the English major, this course absolutely helped to improve my critical thinking and close reading, while also thinking more generally about thematic and linguistic connections between the novels we read. We investigated the style and historical contexts and themes of each novel until I felt I had a significant understanding of each of the texts and authors.",
                "I learned so much about how to analyze and talk about literature both from Professor Trumpener and from my peers. Also I got to read some fantastic books, and whether they were completely new to me or old favorites, I learned so much about the texts and the authors.",
                "This course gave an amazing introduction into some classic English and American women writers and also improved my writing and critical thinking about literature. We learned about some of the common themes that carry from Austen and Bronte into more contemporary work and the course is set up so you gain a wealth of knowledge about these authors' body of work.",
                "This class is really wonderful! I learned so much about Victorian literature, contextualizing Austen & Bronte's writing alongside other women writers of the moment, examining the geopolitical and artistic valences of the works, and close-reading + writing effectively. In particular, I learned a lot from Professor Trumpener's astounding knowledge on the assigned reading and this time period, her generous comments and feedback, and her incisive guidance during discussions. If you are looking to fulfill the 19th\/20th century requirement\/take any English class really, this is a strong, strong choice.",
                "The discussion format of this course really helped to give me insight into how different people can read the same text. This course was especially helpful in expanding my ability to formulate and develop an argument on my own. I also gained valuable experience in weaving secondary sources into my writing."

                "The strengths of this class were Professor Trumpener and the class dynamic. In the middle\/end of the semester the workload did get pretty heavy, but Professor Trumpener made the appropriate adjustments, which we all appreciated. I do wish that we spoke more about the historical context of the novels we read, especially regarding contemporary politics.",
                "There was a high reading load in this course. The content was very enjoyable but difficult to juggle with the other high reading load classes. Professor Trumpener was extremely understanding and adjusted the reading schedule in order to make things more manageable, which certainly helped. However, I think splitting the class into two shorter sessions a week would be very useful in the future, to keep students engaged with the materials and to have more time to discuss such exciting works!",
                "The main strength - Professor Trumpener. If you have the chance to take a course with her, do it. Another strength was her choice to really focus on the texts themselves and let us consider them for what they are rather than requiring us to read a bunch of secondary sources and critical reviews of the works to frame our thoughts. At times, the reading load felt a bit heavy since we were reading an entire novel in between the weekly class meetings, but Prof Trumpener was very receptive to our concerns and worked with us to lessen the load a bit toward the end.",
                "I thought this class was great overall! I know some of my peers thought the amount of reading was somewhat overwhelming, but I viewed my reading for this class as a break from my other work so I did not mind it all! I just wish I could do another semester of this class with more books!",
                "There was definitely a lot of reading, but Prof. trumpener was very responsive to people's concerns about the quantity. But honestly, during COVID I really found it fun to read a novel a week and I had more time without too many extracurriculars. I felt like the discussions were overall very productive, but I do wish we had more opportunities to watch the movies or actually visit the British Art Center (which is just a pandemic issue) because I felt like that would have broken up the reading a little bit.",
                "Professor Trumpener's devotion to her students, brilliant insights, and generous feedback + support is a MAJOR STRENGTH of this course. I really feel that Zoom seminars are very difficult (it is impossible to replicate the true intimacy of the seminar format online), but Professor Trumpener was incredibly thoughtful about and effective at cultivating an engaging community of scholars this semester. She is really a gem! Another strength of this class is the syllabus - it is pretty expansive, and I really enjoyed returning to some classic works (Jane Eyre, Pride & Prejudice) while exploring new (to me) literature (The House of Mirth, Rebecca) . The only weakness is that the reading became a little heavy during some weeks around midterm. Professor Trumpener has been very, very open to feedback, and we discussed this as a class."

                "Prof. Trumpener was great about giving us a break around halfway through the 2-hour weekly seminar, which really helped everyone take a breath and reset before diving back into discussion.",
                "Professor Trumpener's attitude and knowledge about the prose really motivated me to stay engaged and ask questions. The small class size was also helpful to giving everyone a chance to speak and stay engaged. I thought the discussion format was also great but again, I think 2 shorter classes would be helpful for individuals staying engaged throughout the class. I also liked the times where we honed in on small snippets of the text or went into breakout rooms to have smaller, more casual chats it was great to feel like I was getting to know the individuals in the class.",
                "I thought that this class translated well to a virtual format. We experimented with keeping our mics on for the whole class and while it didn't cause any problems, I do not think it added to the class experience and was a little bit stressful for me because my family was always coming in and out of the room.",
                "I think the discussion flowed pretty well without using the raising hands tool which sometimes creates awkward pauses, and I think some other activities and use of multimedia would have been helpful for increasing overall engagement. I would have even gone to Zoom movie viewings outside of class time if that was an option.",
                "Prof. Trumpener is incredibly understanding and thoughtful - this is exactly the kind of teaching approach needed during the pandemic. I was really moved that she noticed that reading a book a week was becoming difficult with some of the longer volumes, and that she fielded the class for feedback to make adjustments to the syllabus. Although I did not participate in Honglan's writing workshops as much as I would have liked, I also really appreciated this option for managing the longer writing project."

If you're doing this for a senior seminar, the course is centered around one long paper at the end of the semester, so make sure to make time for that throughout the semester so you don't get overwhelmed! It was also super helpful having our TF, Honglan, to guide us through the process.",
                "YES, definitely. The content, the instructor, and the seminar structure was amazing. It was a course that I looked forward to every week.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course. As a senior English major, it is the best English course I've taken at Yale - possibly the best course I've ever taken. Professor Trumpener is such a great facilitator of discussion, the novels on the syllabus were all interesting in their own way (a difficult feat to achieve since there is usually at least one generally boring one!), and the premise of the course was clear in the framework of both the discussion and the texts themselves. It is a lot of reading, but that is what you want from an advanced English course.",
                "Yes! If you love Jane Austen and Charlotte Bront this class is a must! Also Professor Trumpener is the best. She is so knowledgable, and she is also just a really kind person.",
                "Yes definitely! This was such a fun class and allowed me to read books I love in an academic setting.",
                "YES. A resounding yes. I have already recommended Professor Trumpener's classes to several other students. I was really putting off my 19th\/20th century credit, but this class is truly a gem in the English department. The syllabus, the teaching, the fieldtrip (though virtual), the intimate group, and the guided essay support made this one of my best classes during the pandemic semester. Professor Trumpener is brilliant at pushing her students to think in different and novel ways about some classic work; she incorporates knowledge about art history, book history, colonialism, early feminisms, mystery as a literary device and genre, etc.... into our conversations. This is not simply a class on Victorian courtship novels! It is really a class about interrogating the literature and contextualizing it. Professor Trumpener and Honglan also give incredible feedback on the essays - sentence-level comments! The dedication and effort from the teaching team is really moving. Last, I always love the small group discussions of English seminars at Yale, but the experience is really shaped by the instructors' guidance. Both Honglan and Prof. Trumpener are generous, encouraging class leaders. I felt very comfortable voicing my thoughts, as well as revisiting them (and even changing my mind!) in this class. If you get a chance to take this class, please do not hesitate!!!",
                "Yes, Professor Trumpener is amazing, and she does a great job in facilitating discussion and promoting different avenues of thinking within the class."
