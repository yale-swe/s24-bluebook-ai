Perhaps more importantly, I think I also learned some very interesting and rewarding skills regarding geometric and physical interpretation of the material in this course. I found these insights to be the most illuminating and they were what made the course super engaging for me at the end of the day.",
                "I learned how to view and think about surfaces in 3D, along with how to integrate and dedicate in 3 dimensions.",
                "I learned differentiation/integration in 2D, 3D, and 4D spaces, including Green's, Stoke's, gradients, etc.",
                "I've taken a Math 120 equivalent course in high school. This class was basically a review for me. I enjoyed the smooth sailing. One insight I gained was how all the fundamental theorems of calculus are related to each other and are very similar. The p-sets were challenging and fun.",
                "I learned multivariable calculus, and learned how a lot of things in math are intertwined together. I developed an understanding of problem solving and how to use different little things to solve the big problem.",
                "How to evaluate functions more visually and to think more conceptually.",
                "This course introduced a new branch of math and how to think in higher dimensions. It taught me how to utilize resources and work collaboratively.",

                "This course extended my understanding from single-variable calculus and taught me valuable skills in quantitative thinking.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: synchronization of the course across all sections, videos were informative and good to reference back to, practice exams\r\nWeaknesses: lectures struggled to keep up with the pace of the course at times, the lack of weighting of the final grade towards problem sets made them feel pointless at times",
                "I would say the one weakness of the course is the length of the PSETs leading up to the thanksgiving break are unreasonably strenuous. Otherwise I couldnt think of a better way for the course to be designed.",
                "I think one of the biggest strengths of this course are the pre-class videos posted to Canvas. They give every student the chance to preview the material before it is taught in class which I think allows for deeper understanding. These videos are also super clear and well explained, with a good mix of theory and computational examples. And, of course, you can always re-watch them whenever you would like if you are struggling with a particular topic. I think another strength of this course is that the sections are broken down into much smaller enrollment numbers, which I think allows for a better learning environment in math, and it certainly felt like a smooth transition from my high school single variable calculus class. One disadvantage that this creates, however, is that not everyone has the same instructor, and so many of my friends felt that they received better or worse instruction based on who their section instructor was. I do think that the Canvas videos do a good job of balancing this out, however.",
                "I really liked how it was structured so no changes.",
                "The course has \"just the right amount\" of challenge in Psets and exams: enough to keep you thinking and learning, but not overwhelming.\r\n\r\nHowever, the pre-class videos and quizzes do the exact opposite of facilitating learning for me: I have to do them anyway because they count towards the grade; but I end up learning the same thing twice, the first time through a video in which I receive no feedback about whether I understand the material or not, and the second time in class with the belief that \"I've already learned it\" and thus not paying full attention. I wish the pre-class videos could be optional.",
                "I think it could go over more stuff, like Jacobians. Also there was no reason to skip definitions such as \"simply connected.\" Otherwise I think the course is great and light.",
                "The course was well taught and the weekly problem sets were nice for homework. The strengths were it was well organized and well run. There weren't any weaknesses of the course, except maybe since the pre-class videos covered the same information as every class, sometimes I wasn't motivated to attend class.",
                "Strengths are the way the course it taught at times, weaknesses are that the course could combine more computation along with the conceptual side of things.",
                "While there are plenty of resources present to help fill any gaps in understanding, I often felt I could get by without them and hence didn't feel like utilizing them much.",
                "Strengths: Large amount of resources provided to students for practice and concept review which can be extremely useful for them\r\nWeaknesses: Course content got a bit borinh at some point - honestly would have been more interesting if the content was taught in a more application based way as opposed to the way it was taught",
                "The course is well-organized and provides a lot of support for students, whether through office hours, practice exams, allowing notes sheets, or review sessions.",
                "It was odd how there was an asynchronous aspect in addition to the lecture. I think the pre-class videos helped me understand the material better, but they sometimes wouldn't align with lecture material. I found Ximera to be extremely helpful.",
                "Ian Adelstein was an amazing teacher. I have nothing negative to say about him.",
                "Strengths: pace, psets, exams\r\nWeaknesses: no point really in the pre-class quizzes",
                "I really appreciated that students enrolled in Math 120 were divided into several sections instead of being in one large lecture hall. Given that we were in smaller cohorts, it made it easier to ask questions during class and gain feedback from the professor. Another strength of this class was the offered peer tutoring. I actually really enjoyed going and completed essentially all of the p-sets there. I was able to get the help that I needed from the peer tutors and I could collaborate with my peers also taking Math 120. Also, something else that I appreciated in the course was the pre-class videos. I found it super helpful to familiarize myself with the content before class, so when Professor Adelstein taught a concept in class, it was not the first time that I was being exposed to the concept. A weakness of the course was the pace!! I feel that if I had more time to absorb the information, then I would have been able to master the content much better, however I do understand that we were under a time constraint.",
                "Strengths - the weekly check-in videos taught and the in-class lectures solidified the new concepts. How it could be improved - assign a few practice problems from the textbook per each topic for more practice in learning the subject rather than just having it applied in the problem sets."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. The course helped improve my mathematical thinking skills, extending them to another dimension, and gave a solid foundation in multivariable calculus. The course will help students, even if they don't use the calculus skills, think analytically in a variety of settings. Though, if not needed for one's major, one should only take this course if interested specifically in multivariable calculus/3D mathematics.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend it.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student because I had such a good experience. I think that it is a very smooth transition from high school single variable calculus and that the material is very manageable. I would also encourage students who want to take this course to try to engage in geometric interpretation of the material and try to lean into some of the theory and not just focus on computation. I think that the class will be much more illuminating for those who do.",
                "Yes absolutely",
                "Take this since it's required by so many majors anyway, but don't take it if you just want an interesting math class. This class is very focused on computation and is exactly like my high school math classes. If you are looking for a more proof-based or concept-based math class, don't take this. At the end of the course, I feel like I can do fancy integrals, but I still have zero intuitive understanding about curls and Stokes' or the proof of any theorem. The teaching quality also varies greatly between instructors, and it takes some luck to get the best out of the class.",
                "I would recommend it. It is a pre-rec to many majors and classes. Take it early. It's not hard so you can stack up your other classes during the same semester.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student since I believe you get out of with what you put in. Although the content is difficult to understand sometimes, if you continue to work on it and solve problems, you begin understanding the concepts and how to solve problems. The content is also not too crazy.",
                "Maybe, only if the student is highly prepared for math.",
                "For those pursuing majors which require it this class is nothing to fear. For those that aren't this class can be fun but won't be as easy as math classes in the past may have been",
                "Only if needed for the pre req or as a major requirement. The course concepts intrinsically have very limited utility for most majors. As a Computer Science + Economics major, I wasnt sure half the time where I was going to use most of the stuff taught in this class. I dont really see myself doing vector line integrals or using the stokes theorem at any point in my future, as these concepts are largely related to the field of Physics (where a lot of the methods taught can be used to calculate quantities like flux, volume, work done by a force, etc. Unless you absolutely need it for the major, take Math 118 instead (much more useful for CS+Econ/just Econ/social science majors).",
                "Yes; this course was very challenging but also rewarding. Although it was one of my most difficult, I felt the most supported in this course than any of my others, and I believe that while the workload is tough it is manageable.",
                "I would recommend it to a student who needs it as a requirement. It's definitely a heavy, conceptual-based class to take just for the fun of it.",
                "Yes, I love this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, however only if math applies to their academic major/path. It isn't necessarily a class to take \"just for fun\" because it is intense, and certainly requires a lot of time, effort, and energy. That being said, I'm glad that I was able to take it.",
                "Yes - it really helps to solidify calculus for real-life applications, and complements previous calculus courses in the concepts that are taught."
