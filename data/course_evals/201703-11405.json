   "comments": [
    "This course covers the main production of Christian art and architecture in Europe from approximately 250-815. This is a wonderfully engaging course, and the readings are very engaging. There was one term paper, a midterm, and a final exam. Beyond that, readings can be done in anticipation of sections, instead of daily for class. The TF and professor were very helpful - so if you have any questions about your paper, definitely talk to them about it.",
    "Through this course, I not only improved my knowledge of history, but also of how art changes in response to different historical empires.",
    "Writing, history and art",
    "I gained insight into a period of art history that is not as widely discussed as other periods of art, as well as a more thorough understanding of the social, ideological, and political movements that shaped early Christian art. I also developed an improved ability to discuss and identify major works of early Christian art. Taking this course gave me a greater appreciation of Byzantine art as well as art history in general."

   "comments": [
    "The only weakness of this course, which I can think of, is that the class is taught as a lecture instead of a seminar. Only seven students were enrolled, and professor Nelson was great about engaging students with questions and answering questions. However, I feel that more discussion could have been even better. The TA, Chelsea, was wonderful and incredibly knowledgeable - she led really wonderful sections that felt truly useful. Professor Nelson is a fantastic lecturer - he gets often distracted but in a very endearing way that enlivens the course more than anything else. The workload is perfectly manageable. However, no review sheet is given for the midterm and final, so you shouldn't miss class, or you will likely regret it.",
    "I loved this course! I would not change anything about it.",
    "The course covers a lot of material, so it really requires the student to keep up with the weekly readings as well as to be present in class every week. The class is successful in providing the student with a thorough understanding of Byzantine art. Even though the course is set up as a lecture, it might be helpful to involve the students in more in-class discussion. However, the discussion sections with the teaching fellow is helpful in sorting through major ideas for students."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in art history, history, or religious history - I would likely not recommend this course as a first art history to a student who doesn't have some familiarity with classical art or the dates that are covered (roughly 300-800).",
    "I absolutely would! Great professor and great course.",
    "Yes I would. I learnt a great amount and it was very enjoyable",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a friend. Its subject matter concerns not only significant works of art but the historical eras that influence them, so it offers a wide range of subject matter. The class also allows the student to get more hands-on visual learning with its trips to the Yale Art Gallery and the Beineke Museum. It is challenging, but it does not preclude students who are not art history majors from learning from and enjoying the course."
