                "There are a lot of readings and you have to understand them all in order to write your reaction papers. However, professor Gee listened to feedback well and reduced the number. We spend a lot of time just talking amongst us students, which I liked, and everyone had thoughts that led to debates and further probing of topics.",
                "I thought this course was really great. I sometimes wish the readings were more varied. Though I liked that class was self-guided, I sometimes wish it were a bit more structured. Sometimes I find two hours of uninterrupted discussion difficult to track, so I wished we changed tactics/gears a bit more.\r\n\r\nI also wish we devoted more classtime to discussion of interventions. Sometimes it felt as though we were all so deeply on the same page about the material, that we could have devoted our collective passions to creating solutions/brainstorming ideas/debating those ideas. I was sometimes frustrated/immobilized by the same trends we would stumble upon every class.",
                "strengths: lots of amazing class discussion, interesting content, enjoyable and thought provoking assignments, amazing professor !\r\nweaknesses: maybe better readings/ less reading some weeks",
                "The readings can be on the heavy side some weeks but overall the weekly reading reflections help to stay engaged with course materials and thoughtfully contribute to discussions. Professor Gee is extremely knowledgeable, kind, and considerate and is great at facilitating discussions",
                "Prof Gee is INCREDIBLE! This was the best ive taken at Yale. Our class discussions were so engaging and we become like a close group of friends",
                "Professor Gee's penchant for allowing the class discussion to move fluidly in any direction a given students' response chose was a major credit to the success of this course. It allowed the discussion to be far more granular and far more based in \"reality\" rather than the sometimes too abstract/difficult to understand realm of scientific literature speak. Professor Gee is also a very engaging and thoughtful instructor, whose lessons, points, and relationship with the class left everyone feeling understood, appreciated, and empowered.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the course that I might suggest an improvement for is the initial reading response. I think for many students this response was the most nerve-wracking, mostly because it was our first real grade and our first real \"assignment.\" To go along with the idea of proposals that this class left us all in (which is a state of mind I still find myself responding to situations with), I propose that Professor Gee should make the first discussion paper a \"practice grade.\" Meaning, students are still expected to complete it with the same degree of care, thoughtfulness, and attention to detail, but they don't have to worry about this paper being the grade that will be \"dropped\" because it may inevitably be lower than all of their other papers. The idea here is to allow students to receive direct feedback on their structure, ideas, content, and general approach from Professor Gee without the worry of their performance negatively impacting their grade. If having a specific number of graded papers is necessary for the core structure of the course, perhaps Professor Gee could consider including an extra paper, maybe a week earlier, or ask students to write a concluding response paper just based more broadly on the conversations they've had throughout the semester.",
                "I found it intimidating to speak in the discussion.",
                "This is a really great class. The reading load is relatively high, but it does end up being worth it.",
                "Wish there were fewer reaction papers",
                "The course was very engaging because of the discussion-based format and it was easy for everyone to jump in and share their ideas.",
                "DYLAN. Dylan Gee is THE professor. She is kind, warm, incredibly rigorous, thorough in her feedback, clear about her expectations, flexible with your needs, excited to see and get to know you. She was truly one of the greatest professors I've had in college; she is a true gem. Low key if she doesn't get tenure.... we riot girlies. We riot. \r\n\r\nIn all seriousness: Dylan fostered amazing discussion. Sometimes the coursework did feel like a lot (e.g. weekly reading responses). But she was willing to pair readings down when we asked her to. Furthermore, I felt like her assignments were all genuinely helpful and contributed to my understanding. I sometimes found the jumpstarts unhelpful, but when we mentioned that to her at midterm she immediately changed he approach, in a way that helped immensely. She is SO GOOD. So SO GOOD."

You got to develop an actual policy proposal that would have implications at Yale!",

If stress is not something you think about much in your daily life, I would encourage you to take this course because I think it might broaden your perspectives.\r\nIf you already have a particularly nuanced concept of stress, this course might not enlighten you much. Though, I think Professor Gee is well worth spending the two hours a week with and the final project is a great exercise that's adaptable to your own personal interests.",

                "ABSOLUTELY. You will learn a lot from Dylan. She brings a level of humanity to the sciences that I have genuinely never encountered in a classroom. That doesn't mean she's a pushover; quite the contrary. It means she knows we want to learn, AND that we are people with lives influenced by so much more than a grade or a class. She understands stress; that means she understands Yale. This class won't necessarily teach you anything massively eye-opening in terms of science. but it will hold you accountable to thinking about your own stress, and how to dismantle systemic forces that create and engender and perpetuate stress. Do it."
