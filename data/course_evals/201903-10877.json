    "It is difficult to say what knowledge, skills, and insights I developed by taking this course. So much time was spent trying to figure out what was going on, that I never really felt that I learned any one topic to completion.",
    "I learned more about the communications and control part of electrical engineering, including transmitting information, compressing data, and optimizing values.",
    "I learned a hodgepodge of information about the mathematical tools used by EE's",
    "I learned about error correcting codes and about shortest path algorithms.",
    "I learned about various topics relative to electrical engineering and systems, including classification, routing, sampling, Fourier techniques, and different methods to relay information.",
    "Learned a little about a lot of topics, including encoding\/decoding data, error detection\/correction, probability, Internet architecture, Fourier transforms, machine learning, and more. Developed skills in Matlab as well.",
    "I learned how to apply mathematical concepts to the field of electrical systems and communication, and I learned the basics of encoding, computer networking, and controlling signals.",
    "I understand the basics of signals and signal processing, machine learning and cryptography.",
    "I learned a lot about different controls and computations within electrical engineering.",
    "A wide coverage of topics for computer engineering. You will learn s base level of how information is valued and protected as well as an introduction to Matlab programming.",
    "The course covers a broad range of topics including probability, data compression and error detection, graph algorithms, signals theory, and basic machine learning. Each topic was connected to practical applications in communications, though the depth rarely felt sufficient for any practical work. Occasional \"labs\" taught Matlab skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course as it was presented seemed to alternate between giving very high level overviews of topics (which were too general to be useful), and going into nitty gritty mathematical details in areas of probability, statistics, and differential equations, that were not prerequisites to the class and usually left us confused. I believe that the class could be improved by picking one approach or the other. Either keep it high level and have the course serve as a topical introduction only, or fully commit to making it a mathematical course and list the correct prerequisite mathematical courses. But as it was taught this semester, the class tried to be both and failed at each.",
    "A strength of the course is the the topics we cover are very cool.\r\n\r\nHowever, the course is definitely not designed to facilitate learning. I feel like this is the type of course that you power through the psets while not fully understanding the material, then forget what you learned a year later. The subjects we learned, in terms of compression, were very abstract. Complex math equations and calculus were thrown in without context or explanation of how those equations are derived. Then, we are supposed to apply the equation to complete our p-sets. If Professor Hu could explain what each equation means when she introduces it, explain what EACH variable is\/means, then leads through a problem that applies the abstract concept we learn to the equation, I would be able to understand the material better. \r\n\r\nExamples, examples, examples. Most of the lecture should not be on difficult math and abstract concepts, but should be grounded in what it actually means and how it applies to data\/communications. I highly encourage Professor Hu to lead us through several problems on the board or even better, in the slides so we know how to do them when we approach them on the homeworks (sometimes I go through the homeworks and am like, what??). The few times that we have done examples, Professor writes in small slanted handwriting in a corner of the board, as if the example is insignificant, when examples should be the most significant. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Matlab labs were interesting. They taught me a lot better on how to use Matlab, and to see how the code worked in applying what we learned in class was pretty cool.",
    "This class was a mess. Lab assignments were terribly because we were not taught any of the code once. We were responsible to look up and teach ourselves everything, or go to office hours to learn it. It felt more like a statistics class a lot of the time. I came in expecting the class to be interesting, but I was very wrong. I thought learning about networks and systems would be more about the actual systems and transfer of data between them not learning about hypothesis testing and maximum likelihood estimation. We weren't taught Fourier transforms or and transformations, we were shown a video and told that because some students were taking differential equations that she was going to just skip over it. Same for convolutions.",
    "The material is interesting but a lot of the times I had no idea how to do specific questions because they were so confusing when touched upon in lecture. The math required sometimes were so complicated and I had not learned how to solve them before.",
    "Strengths: Wenjun is a very nice professor and always willing to meet to answer questions and explain concepts. She is well-organized and her lecture notes are great. The grading of homework and lab focuses on completion, which allowed us to actually try to understand the material as opposed to stressing out over the accuracy of each part. Weaknesses: Some of the concepts taught in class are difficult, and in lecture, if you don't understand one part, it's hard to follow the rest of the lesson.",
    "Lectures were a little dry, but the subject is really interesting",
    "The topics covered were very interesting and essential for various disciplines within the field of electrical engineering. However, I felt that there was an excessive amount of abstraction and formal definitions that eventually made relatively simple concepts hard to understand. The course could be improved by simple and more concrete examples of complex topics in both lectures and in the class notes.",
    "The course information was very interesting, but I would have preferred more interactive lectures.",
    "Professor Wenjun is undeniably smart, but almost inaudible, even with a microphone. Also, I learnt more material on my own than in class.",
    "This class was interesting with the first half class material being extremely interesting but the second half not being as interesting.",
    "The course covered many interesting topics and ideas. \r\nThe course struggled with lecture time and relevance of homework assignments.",
    "The course's broad scope made it difficult to understand any particular topic deeply, though this issue may be unavoidable given this course's place in the EE curriculum. Topics that were covered so briefly they could not even be evaluated might be better expanded or eliminated. The problem sets were well-designed and helped show how we were expected to apply to lecture content. Labs were useful for learning Matlab, though questions sometimes seemed repetitive and unnecessarily time-consuming. The term project was an interesting addition, but ended up seeming just like a slightly extended lab that provided little insight into the course material."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. Only take it if you need it for your major. It is not structured\/taught in a way that facilitates learning of the topics it claims to be teaching.",
    "While I recommend the topic and the subjects we learned, I do not necessarily recommend this course unless you are an EE major. The course material was way too difficult and abstract to understand; the TA sessions are the biggest help to get through the problem sets.",
    "Absolutely not, I would argue for someone who is was required for to find a way out of taking this course.",
    "No-- I don't think there was another course where I was so confused about the material learned in class this much. I just never learned some of the math. We were assumed to have known how to do certain calculations while the course never stated we need to know that math",
    "Yes",
    "Unless the student is planning on majoring in electrical engineering, unfortunately, I would not recommend this course. Even though the topics are very interesting, they are also fairly complicated, and unless the student has any previous experience with probability, math notation, and linear algebra, it is very easy to get lost in the course.",
    "It's an EE requirement and that's probably the only reason you would take it. This has all the makings of a good course - really interesting topics, doable homework, fair exams, and lots of resources. It would be a good course if only the material were taught better. Wenjun is really nice and helpful and clearly wants her students to understand the topics, but her lecturing ability is just not good enough to make this class enjoyable. Lectures are often dry and confusing despite how interesting the topics are. Fortunately, there are a ton of resources online that make learning on your own possible.",
    "I would in fact recommend this course to another student because it provides foundational knowledge about the topics that made and transformed our digital world.",
    "Yes.",
    "I wouldnt recommend this course unless someone is interested or needs to take it. The class was hard to follow at sometimes and forced students to learn most of their information on their own",
    "It is required for the EE major. So they must take it",
    "Only if you need it for the EE major or have a very strong interest in the variety of topics covered. The range of topics covered by the course was interesting, but left me feeling that I didn't have enough depth of knowledge to do anything useful with what I had learned. Lectures covered the basic material well, but finer points and examples were often unclear. The assignments were generally well-designed, and were essential to understanding how we were expected to apply the content, but the Matlab \"labs\" sometimes felt repetitive in the material covered by each question."
