We also learned enthalpy/entropy correction and how to handle combustion, on top of equilibrium analysis. It was very broad, but I felt like I understood pretty much all of it.",

                "A better understanding of Thermodynamics along with a better intuition for problem solving even when I do not necessarily have the exact formula to solve an issue. In other words, I was able to adjust to a wider range of problems without having to rely on prescribed methods.",

                "I genuinely feel like I learned thermodynamics well from this class. It was a good balance of theory and application, with real numbers in the problems being refreshing compared to so many engineering classes that are 100% theoretical. I do wish that the course pacing were planned out a bit better, though, since we had a few classes where we did not get through all of the content during the course period and were told to read the posted notes, but then we had a lot of time in the last week where there wasn't explicitly content to cover. I think that this is just a product of the professor teaching it for the first time in this department, though, and will probably be corrected pretty easily.",
                "The strength of this course was the small class size and access to Dr. Barratt who is very knowledgeable. There was lots of support and help if you asked for it.",
                "This course was very well organized by Professor Barratt as there was a lot to learn in such little time. Dr. B is very knowledgeable in the material and offers insightful comments during lecture about applications and the interconnections of the material with other engineering fundamentals and subjects.",
                "Strengths - Dr. Barratt, lecture notes & additional powerpoints, spacing of homework assignments \r\nWeaknesses - I think we sped up quite a bit in the last few weeks of the course, and so I don't have a strong understanding of the theory of some of the topics, even though I know how to handle the problems.",

                "I took this class as a chemical engineering major, despite it being in the mechanical engineering department. Honestly, from what I've heard about chemical engineering thermo, this version is much better. I had also taken physical chemistry before, which covers a lot of the same topics, but I got a much deeper understanding this time around. That is probably because chemE/Pchem are purely theoretical, relying almost entirely on derivations. This course assigns problems about real power plants with actual numbers, and is much more applicable to us as engineers. Plus, the smaller class size (we had about 10, while Pchem was a big lecture) was also conducive to better learning. So, I recommend you take this version of the course if you are deciding between the three types of thermodynamics.",
                "You must take this course if you are a mechanical engineer.",
                "Yes - thermodynamics is so important for engineers and it was nice to learn about psychrometrics, air conditioners, and power plants. I definitely learned a lot, even as someone who wasn't majoring in chemical engineering.",
                "Yes, it's an interesting class because of its connection to important real-world systems like power plants, refrigeration, jet engines, and more. Prof. Barratt is very sweet and understanding when it comes to accommodating his students. Exams are hard, but fair.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot from the class and really enjoyed the material.",
                "Only take this course if you have to take thermo. It's poorly taught and the topics don't feel like they really apply to anything. If you have the option of taking the chem e version of this course I would recommend doing that instead."
