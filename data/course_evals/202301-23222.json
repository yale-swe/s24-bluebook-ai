                "I gained a vast skill set on how to read cell biology papers",
                "I gained insight on how to read and analyze papers, as well as how to do my own background research so that I can get a better grasp as to how cell biology methods\/experiments were done.",
                "Made significant progress in ability to read and interpret scientific literature, learned a lot of cell biology and experimental techniques that are not discussed in MCDB lecture courses",
                "I learned so much about different experimental methods, some that I had never used or heard of before. I also got a lot better at close reading research papers. All great things for research and med school.",
                "I learned how to decipher a scientific paper and how to understand many biological concepts (actin, autophagy, etc). The class taught me scientific techniques. Also, how to explain a scientific figure aloud.",
                "I became much more proficient at analyzing papers and understanding the reasoning behind the materials and methods. I gained an understanding of what makes a landmark paper.",
                "I learned a tremendous deal about how to read scientific literature, understand how data is presented, and how to think about scientific inquiry and research in an in-depth, profound way. One of the absolute best parts about this course is the historical context and narrative that Professor Mooseker brings into the discussions. I felt I really got a wide survey of the field of cell biology, and that is an incredibly unique and amazing opportunity this course offers. Professor Mooseker also included anecdotes from his time within the field, and I learned a lot from that. I was very grateful to get a spot at the last minute and would highly recommend this course!!",
                "I feel that this class built greatly upon the backbone of the biology I have learned at Yale. I really enjoyed course content and the expansion upon different techniques applied and to investigate the evolution of these molecular mechanisms."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The papers each week were fantastic to read and digest. Dr. Mooseker's engagement during class time was simply remarkable. We went through each figure together, and he drew names from a hat so that everyone was 1) held accountable for doing the readings and 2) had a chance to explain the paper to the group. By the end of class, everyone had contributed to the discussion. Although the cold call could be scary because you never knew which figure you would have to present in front of the class, it was great for holding me accountable for reading the papers in order to fully understand the science. Also, Dr. Mooseker actually emailed the author of the paper each week and shared their insight with the class. We got to hear how each paper impacted their lives and what they have thought since then!\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think the group project at the end could have been a bit better organized. I would have liked to have everyone assigned groups instead of having to form their own, and it would have been nice to have every group present their paper in front of the class. However, this was the first time that Dr. Mooseker did this, and he has already expressed some of the changes for the future. This is a 10\/10 class, plain and simple.",
                "Strengths: Straightforward format, allowed for discussion amongst peers, furthered understanding of cell biology principles, and delved into materials\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the sheer amount of papers and knowledge we had to read was sometimes overwhelming. I wish we only chose one paper or there was a \"pre-class lecture for it\". I also struggled with the methods a lot, and since there were so many methods, it was hard to understand which ones we should know and which ones should be emphasized. I wish we had pre-class videos on the methods too.",
                "strengths - professor mooseker is so kind, engaged, and understanding and you learn so much from him",
                "A big strength was that prof Mooseker is extremely knowledgeable and will be able to answer any questions you may have about papers. A weakness may have been that the course focused on the cytoskeleton a lot towards the end, which is not my favorite topic in biology.",
                "Excellent course, only small suggestion is it would have been nice to have access to Mooseker's slides that contained background information to aid us in understanding the paper before class",
                "I loved having the space to talk and learn about science in a way that is fun. The cold-calling was rough at first but you get used to it after a while.",
                "Strengths: read many papers-good overall look at cell bio and techniques used, a chill class with low workload, engaging-participation \r\nWeakness: cold calling however this did force us to read the papers and therefore was good in that sense also made the class more engaging and the conversations were deeper due to everyone coming prepared",
                "Strengths: Professor Mooseker is an incredible professor with an amazing wealth of knowledge in the field of cell biology. His ability to break down complicated concepts and methods is next to none. However, what makes this class special is his connections with the authors of the landmark papers we read. The insight and context they provide enrich our reading of their papers. Weaknesses: No glaring weaknesses. Everyone has a chance to participate in class and there is no pressure to be correct. In the future, we talked about having everyone get a chance to present a landmark paper of their own. I think this would be a beneficial learning experience.",
                "This course is very well organized, and the papers were well-curated by Professor Mooseker. I really like how Professor Mooseker structured each class session with his PowerPoint sessions and guiding questions as we moved through the papers. The students were engaged, and the reading load was more than manageable (1-2 papers per week--sometimes 3 but they would all be shorter in that case). In terms of improvements, I think the size of the class made it a little bit more difficult, at least in the beginning, to develop an organic sort of banter and discussion. Eventually, we were able to get to this point, especially in our final few class sessions where students would chime in with their thoughts. In that way, it felt more engaging and like a \"journal club.\" The last few classes were especially fun. I wonder if maybe either using a different seminar room (a smaller one where students would be actually around a table and closer together) would help with this. But overall, no major weaknesses. The class was really fun and interesting, and Professor Mooseker was always so insightful.",
                "I thought this course was well structured in a way that allowed students to speak, allowed students to present on their chosen papers, and allowed students to ask questions about different approaches in methods applied."

                "Yes, I recommend it because it is a good prep for graduate students or people going into research. Good to know techniques and prior literature. The class was engaging and allowed for a lot of participation.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student seeking to learn about the historical underpinnings of modern cell biology research. If you are involved in research, learning about the simple yet elegant methods the landmark authors employed in their papers will inspire your own investigations. Also, this class is great at helping with scientific communication, which is an invaluable tool for anyone going into research or medicine.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend Landmarks!!! This is a tremendous course and a gem within the MCDB department and Yale College. Professor Mooseker is a brilliant, supportive, and passionate instructor. I was so happy to have been able to get a spot in the course at the last minute, and I would highly recommend taking this course if you can get a spot. I went in not knowing a lot about the field of cell biology and cell biology research, and even so, Professor Mooseker made the class an absolute delight. The class is a rare and incredible opportunity to get a wide survey about the field of cell biology from a \"landmark papers\" perspective. The class was as much about the history and development of the field as it was about the research itself. Professor Mooseker provided anecdotes, historical context, and personal insights from his time in the field; this was such an amazing opportunity itself to really see the history of a field in such a manner. Even if cell biology is not your primary field of interest, I would still recommend this course: you will learn a great deal about scientific communication and how to read\/discuss scientific literature. This has been a highlight of my academic experience at Yale, and you will not regret taking this course!",
