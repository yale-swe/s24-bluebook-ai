We applied the knowledge gained to find flux, work done, force, mass of an object, volume, area, etc.",

                "Strength: Professor Smooke releases all the upcoming homework problem numbers for the rest of the summer on the first they of the course, so students who want to work at a faster pace, can work on their homework way before it is due.\r\n\r\nThe slides are also immediately released on the first day of the course, and all of them have pre-recorded videos. On the day of the class, Dr. Smooke would go over the material, which was really helpful. We would ask him the questions we had from the pre-recorded course or the current lecture, which made the course very interactive.  \r\n\r\nWeakness: It is only a 5-week course. You have to be on top of your work every week. The material isn't very difficult, it's just you'd have to cover 8-13 chapters per week (due to the fact that the course is only 5 weeks)",
                "Since the class was online and over the summer, it was super fast paced, and somewhat hard to follow, but Professor Smooke was a great professor and supported us along the way",
                "Strengths: Prof. Smooke is amazing. He is just super nice, understanding, and always willing and available to meet one-on-one and expalin. He also tries to make the material fun. I liked taking it over the summer, because it finished quicker and the suffering was shorter. \r\nWeaknesses: the TA was very kind, but she didn't know much about the material and wasn't really good in explaining. I also wish we did not practise problems at class, but I think that because of the pressing schedule fo the summer session, we didin't have time.",
                "Strengths were the fact that we had prerecorded lectures to watch and the live lectures were also recorded so we could go back and review.",
                "Excellent prerecorded lectures and the professor engages with the students and material during the lectures.",

Despite the intense amount of homewrok (60 problems a week over the summer), I have never learnt so much and genuently enjoyed solving the problems. It looks mmuch more scary than it is. It was a great way to get done with that class before my sophomore year.",
