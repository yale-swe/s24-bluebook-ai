                "I really think it was a lot of material to cover in a single semester. I wonder if a semester of quant gen and a semester of pop gen would better serve the material. I often struggled with the wording of questions as I typically could argue one way or another on an answer, but I think that improved as the class progressed.",
                "Going through problems in class was useful and showed how to apply the concepts that we were discussing. I also liked the paper discussions, but they might have benefited from small group discussion instead of the whole class.",
                "I found this course really interesting, and I think that it covered a lot of really useful concepts. Specifically, I really appreciated learning about the different statistics in population genetics because I had seen a lot of them before but didnt have a complete understanding of what they represented until this class.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I think could be improved is adding more ways to earn partial credit on the exams. Sometimes it was stressful to not be able to show my work, and I would make a small mistake and then lose a lot of points on a question."
