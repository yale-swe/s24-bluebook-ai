                "In the first part of the semester, we analyzed forces and moments in bodies at equilibrium, and we spent a lot of time on truss analysis. With the exception of trusses, much of this first part felt like a review of earlier physics classes, with a lot of FBDs.\r\nIn the second part of the semester, we learned about deformation, including stress-strain diagrams; deformation due to axial loads, torsion, bending, and shear loads; wide-flange beams; deflection of beams; and buckling of columns.",
                "This course built upon PHYS180. I learned to use force and moment equilibrium equations to solve problems. I learned about the method of joints and method of sections. I learned how to solve for internal forces and use that information to pick materials.",

I expected it to be the same difficulty level as PHYS 180, which I took last semester, but for whatever reason it was significantly more challenging for me.",

                "Strengths: Lectures were clear and informative, tests felt reflective of the material on the problem sets. \r\nWeaknesses: a lot of problems in the problem sets rely on information from the textbook, outside of lecture notes, which made it hard to determine what would be tested in exams. Lectures were very occasionally a bit disorganized, it was also sometimes hard to hear the professor.",
                "Strengths: Well organized to facilitate learning and the course follows a good progression.",
                "This course is very straightforward and well taught.",
                "This course was extremely strong. Dr. Qiu's lectures were clearly laid-out and taught, and her notes (which she posted for the class) were a fantastic resource. The course environment was cordial. I found all of the policies to be fair and not stress-inducing.",
                "professor wasnt great, content kind of boring",
                "Instruction for this course was well-paced. We spent many more weeks going through the first few units than the last few but spending more time on the foundational concepts was helpful in increasing mastery before progressing to more difficult concepts.  The problem sets provided a variety of example problems to help students understand the material. \r\n\r\nThe course could be improved if more example problems were provided to help students prepare for exams. While exam review questions were provided, they were limited in quantity. Additional problems would allow students more focused practice and may lead to more effective preparation than students searching for problems in the text themselves. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if the solutions to the midterm exams were posted on CANVAS, students would be able to use these to prepare for the final exam.",
                "The course was well taught, though it was unavoidable that the material could get a bit dry.",
                "This course covered a lot of useful material, and I felt that I gained a good understanding of each unit. However, there was not much of a synthesis of concepts, where we used multiple concepts all together. This will probably come in future courses though.",

                "Strengths: The course was well-organized, and it followed the textbook closely, so I could reference the textbook for anything I didn't fully understand in class. The problem sets and exams all felt very fair. \r\nWeaknesses: There was one assignment where we had to go out and find a real truss to analyze, I wish that there had been more assignments like that. That being said, many of the problem set questions did indicate the applications of what we were learning, so it didn't feel too abstract.",
                "Professor Qiu is great. Her lectures stick to the point and are pretty clear. The workload is totally manageable. If you need help with the material, you have to be proactive and ask for it, but help is available if you ask. I think the course could be improved with more office hours.",
                "The course moves in a very linear and straightforward way but it could tie in more theoretical background and real world applications.",
                "Outside of lecture, the course was very well made. The lecture itself was not helpful in my learning of the material, I found it much easier to just read the book to understand these topics. I think if the lecture was better organized, skipped or went faster through unimportant details, and gave us reasons as to why/what we are doing in each chapter it would have been better.",
                "The course was at 9am. I missed many, many lectures. This is my fault. That said, the course could be improved by video-recorded lectures.",
                "The psets were very good for practice since it gave you harder problems to work with than you would see on an exam",
                "Strengths: Teacher is very kind, I actually love the textbook (I read every relevant chapter), hw hits a perfect balance to challenge us while not being overwhelming\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Recorded lectures, please implement this for future students. The classroom we were in was set up with the equipment to do it."

The workload is about standard for a mechanical engineering class (kinda heavy).",
