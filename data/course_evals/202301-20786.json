                "Lectures are very, very hard to follow. Prof. Aspnes has no slides which makes it extremely difficult.",

                "The topics were generally interesting. I would have liked to have one or two coding assignments on top of the proofs that we completed.",
                "The problem sets were interesting and required inspiration, and the curriculum material was written clearly. There could be more concrete examples and implementations given in lectures",
                "Strengths: \r\nContent is extremely interesting, and Prof. Aspnes does make the class enjoyable. \r\nPsets. had interesting problems. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nPacing of the lectures was sort of all over the place.",
                "Great psets!",
                "The course is designed to be easy to teach (for someone who knows the material very well), with it seems very little consideration for ease of learning. Lectures proceed at a rapid-fire pace, rushing through the content identically to how it is presented in the online notes and content is often disconnected by months from problem sets. For this reason, about 8 of the 60+ students enrolled in the course attended lecture after the first 2 weeks, and among those about 5 (including myself) were consistently paying attention rather than doing homework for another class. \r\n\r\nLectures Need More Focus: work through 1-2 examples showing every step rather than 4-5 examples, 3 steps at a time. The instructor includes lots of historical background to the methods used in examples, unfortunately many of the algorithms and techniques used in the examples were \"motivated\" with \"nobody actually uses this anymore\" alongside some dates and authors. \r\n\r\nContent Needs More Reinforcement: 3 problem sets were issued throughout the semester to form the sum of grades for the course. With assignments covering months of material at a time, and no practice problems given for students to work through themselves on the material since it was introduced months ago, I could expect to open each problem set with only a vague idea of where to get started in relearning the material that was introduced, never used, and long-since forgotten.\r\n\r\nThis Course Needs a Real TA: The ULA that joined on for this course hardly ever showed up to their office hours, and had not prepped or been prepped for the assignments to any useful degree when they were present. \r\n\r\nCollaboration Needs More Structure: Collaboration is encouraged in problem sets, which is great if you had friends in the class going into it because the 4 other students that were paying attention in class were already working together. \r\n\r\nInstructor Office Hours Need a Larger Space: OH with the instructor were a great resource for understanding material if a problem set had not yet been released, but were packed full (in office) whenever a pset was out. Asking basic questions in a public-format style, in a room full of other students many of which were enrolled in more advanced probability courses alongside this one and seemed to have a better grasp of the material, was discouraging and intimidating.",

                "The pdf notes are useful. The ULA of this course was not helpful during office hours. He asked me a term that is straight from a textbook. Professor office hours are helpful",
                "Strengths: Phenomenal lecture notes",
                "Prof. Aspnes has extensive theory knowledge and writes detailed notes for each class he teaches, including this one! However, I had difficulty keeping up with the pace of the lectures at times, especially when I tried to take notes while following along. My level of engagement with the class was also quite low, considering the only assignments we had were three problem sets.",

                "Yeah, go for it!",
                "I recommend this class if you like algorithms and preferably have some mathematical maturity or exposure to probability. While it is low workload (this semester we only had 3 psets), it is not necessarily a true gut since it is NOT EASY. The second half of the content is analogous to that of an advanced graduate algorithms class and some of the problems are very involved and can be very difficult to come up with a solution to. This is magnified by the fact that office hours with Prof Aspnes and the ULA are largely useless and you are on your own along with any friends in the class, so befriend people or take it with your friends! That makes the class more manageable along with a lot of topics in class  not being covered on psets so you can just not attend class or read the lecture notes half the time. The grading is 100% from problem sets and grading is very prompt (few day turnaround) if Aspnes grades himself. An additional note is that taking this class alongside Stochastic Processes is a great pair since the Martingales and Markov Processes parts overlap but both classes explain it through different lenses so it provides a deeper understanding of the material. For a list of topics covered, see the course typed notes.",
                "It depends. If you're interested in theory and are a diligent self-learner, I would recommend this class. Otherwise, probably not. Your entire grade is based on three psets (there may be a few more assignments if there are TAs), so there's not a whole lot of structure. I would strongly recommend keeping up with the class notes Prof. Aspnes does a good job indicating which sections of the notes correspond to each lecture, and if you really want to understand the material you should read the notes carefully.",
