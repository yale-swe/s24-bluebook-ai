For me it was fulfilling the math requirement for the CS major. I got a more formal and rigorous exploration of graphs and estimations which will hopefully help with future computer science theory courses.",

We then did graph theory: isomorphism, Eulerian circuits, trees, planar graphs, and colorings. We did a few large proofs, such as the five-color theorem and the inclusion\/exclusion formula, which I found particularly cool. In terms of skills and insights, I got experience writing proofs.",

This class encourages a new type of thinking about math than previous calculus classes students may have taken, and its emphasis on proofs invites deeper understanding of discrete mathematics topics.",
                "I fine-tuned my mathematical proof skills and learned the basics of set theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. Topics covered in this class have overlapped somewhat with my computer science curriculum and provide an important foundation for furthering an education in computer science.",

                "I learned foundational concepts about writing proofs, combinatorics, graph theory, and a few other topics. We started by learning how to structure different types of proofs like proofs by contradiction and induction proofs, which was really interesting as I'd always wondered how people actually prove things in mathematics. When we started combinatorics, we learned fundamentals of set notation, useful applications of the binomial coefficient, how to think about and use permutations, and also about different properties of functions (such as surjectivity) that we used throughout the rest of the course. Then we took a couple weeks to discuss estimations: estimates of factorials, stirling's approximation, and big\/little \"o\" notation (but probably not in the same way that you would be taught in a cs class). The last half of the course focused on graph theory: properties of graphs, cycles, bipartite graphs, trees, complete graphs, eulerian graphs, walks, paths, etc... We focused a lot about how the properties of different types of graphs were related to eachother and whether certain graphs could exist given properties we knew about graphs in general. I took this course as a non-math and non-cs student because I thought it would be interesting, and I definitely gained some insights into what the field of math looks like outside of the basic calc and geometry courses we've taken up till college. Not sure if I will apply many\/any of the specific skills I've learned, but I do feel more confident in problem solving and how to use logic to prove things.",
                "Counting problems, Inclusion-Exclusion, lots of graph theory. For those who haven't done any higher-level math before, problem-solving skills and how to write a rigorous proof will probably be the biggest things you learn."

                "So much content is already tough to teach, the professor needs to be able to explain things more clearly.",
                "Can't think of any way that it should be improved.",
                "Lectures were pretty good. Professor Douglas was good at explaining the topics, and the textbook had excellent supplemental proofs. However, teh organization of the course was lackluster. Professor Douglas did not have a set pset scheudle, which was frustrating, releasing them whenever and giving us a week to do them, which made time management difficult. He also did not rally review the content of the pset before releasing them, so the difficulty varied wildly, and he was not always equipped to be able to answer questions immediatly and did not give the ULAs the tools necessary to be able to help us during office hours, leaving them to need to work through the proofs in their entireity on their own. Lectures, while given well, also frequently felt disorganized. There was no clear schedule for the course and it felt like we moved quite slowly which was frustrating. The start of the course also spent about 4 weeks on proof and logic basics as well as set theory. This went a lot slower than was necessary, and did not cover as much as we should have given the time spent on it. Additionally, given the level math course this is, some proof introduction is expected. However, most people had had proof experience, so the introduction shoudl nto have taken two weeks. It was very slow, uninteresting, and should have had more depth. Additionally, given the composition of the class, proof introductions should have been more in the first pset (which it was) and in supplemental lectures and meetings than in the main lecture, which ultimately slowed the course and led to the last few topics moving very quickly. Also, frequently professor Douglas would give a proof several times, or not be well prepared to explain it, wasting valuable time on proving something a few times or nit-picking proofs in a way that was not realy instructual. Finally, most psets were done using book problems, which is fine. However, I would then expect the entire teaching staff to be familiar with them and their solutions. I would have also appreciated practice problems written by the teaching staff, or a better sense of what they would write going into the exam. For the first exam, I had no sense of what type of questions would be asked or what their style would be which made preparing for it quite difficult.",
                "This material I learned in this course was interesting and engaging, I really enjoyed Discrete Math as a subject. Unfortunately Professor Douglas was not a fantastic match for the course, and he made many parts of the learning experience frustrating as he struggled to answer questions or organize the course. Better course organization would have made it much better.",
                "I thought it was a strong course overall. Maybe less time on proofs at the start to leave more time for graph theory.",
                "weaknesses: the textbook is unclear and uses wordy definitions for fairly intuitive concepts, there are barely any lecture notes and feedback from dan, dan's office hours are unhelpful and the lessons are barely structured. \r\nstrengths: interesting ideas in discrete math, but one must seek them out on their own",
                "The strengths came from the problem sets, which were very accurate to the test.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses came from the class not being recorded, and the professor not posting lecture notes. As such, it was difficult to make up missed classes. Also, there was a disconnect between the professor and the teaching assistants, as they often gave different solutions\/advice than the professor.",
                "I think this course's greatest strength is its broad coverage of different topics and emphasis on proving things. Since this is an introductory math course, it makes sense to sample a variety of different, but related, topics so that you can choose the direction you want to continue in when you take higher-level math courses. \r\n\r\nI honestly don't see any significant weaknesses to this course. I think it should continue to be taught the same way it was taught this semester.",
                "Strengths: I liked the pacing of this course, and the mix of shorter and longer proofs in class. I liked the level of difficulty and length of the homework and exams. I thought the lectures were pretty good, especially in the second half of the semester.\r\nWeaknesses: I thought the first 2-3 weeks of the semester were pretty slow; we were just doing basic logic and spending more time than felt necessary on it. I liked lectures more once we got to the textbook content, and I think that could have happened sooner. I also think it would have been nice to be given an example at the beginning of the semester for what would constitute a thorough enough proof, when it comes to grading the homework. I also think it could have been helpful to give more guidance to the ULAs: I was given incorrect advice by a ULA on at least three occasions.",
                "I felt the course was somewhat disorganized. Homeworks were introduced sporadically and there was no document outlining the due dates of assignments.",
                "I actually really like the material. \r\n\r\nProblem setscontent-wise and balance-wiseneed to be improved. Often felt like one question or a few took as long as the rest of the problem set.\r\n\r\nLectures weren't very helpful for my understanding.",
                "The course content was good but it basically just followed a textbook and the professor seemed to become disengaged with the class as it went on.",
                "Strengths: Discrete mathematics is an interesting field and I enjoyed learning about it in MATH 244. The homework assignments are approachable and the textbook is useful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures for this class could have gone faster, and they overlapped a lot with the material in the book.",
                "I believe that the course could be improved by increasing its pace and covering more content. Classes often felt like a simple reiteration of material covered in reading, and the pace at which students could potentially learn was, in my opinion, much faster than the pace at which the course progressed. There are some very interesting topics which I am disappointed could not be covered. This slower pace can be perceived as both a strength and a weakness: while it's a weakness for students with strong math backgrounds who want to learn more, it's a strength for students without those backgrounds who are able to take a course without an intimidating thinking load or workload and fulfill a computer science major requirement without struggling too heavily.",
                "The course followed pretty closely to a really good textbook, so it worked really well. Could have gone faster at the beginning, but otherwise very strong course.",
                "Really liked the different approaches to problems and the problem solving aspects of the course.",
                "Strengths: the course followed the textbook pretty closely, so any confusion in class could probably be resolved by reading the textbook (which was still not fun, but at least helpful). During class, I could also tell Prof Douglas was really interested in the material, so he had a good amount of enthusiasm. Also, our pset problems were pretty helpful in preparing for the exams, and actually helped me to learn some of the concepts we talked about in class, which isn't always the case with math classes. Also, our ULAs and TF were super helpful in connecting the dots for us without entirely giving answers away. Professor Douglas also was super helpful in office hours, and got a lot of us to collaborate in finding a solution to a problem. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Douglas tended to get sidetracked by questions in the first few weeks of the course, which usually made us short for time at the end of class. This would be a bit frustrating since the questions also felt irrelevant to the course a lot of times :\/ This slowly got better throughout the semester, but at the same time I could tell the pace of the course picked up as well, so sometimes I usually had to look at my notes or the text book right after class to actually try and interpret what I had just copied down from the board.",
                "The course is a solid introduction to proof-writingthe first 1-2 weeks are all logic and proof writing, and the material isn't especially hard for a math class (though it is completely different from anything you've probably learned before). The biggest weakness of the class is lectures: most lectures are simply verbatim repetitions of the textbook (with perhaps a slightly differently worded definition or two), and many people don't even show up. I wish the lecture time had more emphasis on both solving practice problems (since we don't get much practice outside of the Psets) and going into the material in more depth beyond what can be learned from reading the textbook."

It is not too much work and the content is interesting and applicable. The same goes for math majors, especially those looking for easy electives with a lot of intersting applications down the line. However, this course can sometimes be hard, and, at present, is not well orgnaized which can be frustrating.",

This is a great course to take if you're interested in applications of math, since the combinatorics and graph theory units are relevant to the fields of probability\/statistics and computer science. Some of the topics are also relevant for internship\/job interviews in quantitative finance or SWE.\r\n\r\nThis course forces you to build strong logical reasoning skills because you have to write rigorous proofs, but it's absolutely worth it. This is a really good gateway to higher-level math courses, but is also just an interesting class even if you don't want to continue studying math. \r\n\r\nPersonally, this course did inspire me to take more math courses, even though I'm not a math major.",
                "Yes, I would. I did math team in high school, and much of this class felt like a more rigorous and advanced extension of math team, which I enjoyed. This was my first proof-based math course, and I thought it was a good introduction, with interesting but not-too-scary proofs. I generally enjoyed the lectures, and I thought Professor Douglas did a good job not getting too bogged down in edge cases, especially in the second half of the semester. I chose to take this course over CPSC 202, and Im glad I did because I enjoyed the mathematical rigor and extra concepts that I wouldnt have gotten in the CPSC 202.",
                "Probably not, until the same professor had taught the material years in a row.",
                "I would recommend it to someone who likes math puzzles and would like to learn graph theory.",
                "I recommend this class to computer science and math majors. The course material may not be too applicable to other majors, but MATH 244 teaches students a new way to think about some math problems.",
                "No this course was awful but a large part of that was this professor",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The topics discussed are genuinely interesting and the workload is manageable. It is usually compared against CPSC 202, and I tend to favor the more theoretical math course over the more applied computer science course.",
                "Absolutely. Great course, great professor, interesting material.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed it and it balanced well with another math class I was taking. I found it fun to work with and enjoyed the different challenges the PSETS gave as sometimes it was like working with a puzzle. Enjoyed the visual aspect of it as well with the graphs in particular.",
                "I probably would. Discrete math is useful to know, particularly for those majoring in math\/CS. I also honestly think it's a good course for people who don't love calculus but want to try a slightly more challenging, and more interesting, QR class for their requirement. I think everyone would benefit from some proof-based class, and the course was much easier than I expected from reading past reviews. Especially if Daniel Douglas is teaching it, the pacing is not ridiculously fast. (You may find the pacing too slow if you are in or considering a math major.) However, feedback on psets is basically nonexistent, so that does make exams a lot more stressful (and means that your proof-writing skills won't become as refined as you may hope)."
