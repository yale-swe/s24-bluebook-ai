                "Strengths: Interesting subject matter, accomodating instructors, helpful office hours, fair grading. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sub-par teaching quality. In class, we covered 10-20% of the content required to understand and complete problem-sets and exams. Even the content that was covered was often incredibly shallow and poorly explained; I never felt adequately equipped with the tools necessary to apply the concepts to problems. The problem sets were unnecessarily difficult, especially in relation to the level of material we were learning in class. I have no doubt that I would have better understood the material had I skipped every class and merely read the course textbook--a fairly abysmal standard for a class that many are paying thousands to take.",
                "This course was very organized and presented very clearly. There were many opportunities to work through homework assignments through in class problem solving sessions which usually rectified any confusion.  The classes were also recorded which really helped to go back and look at the lectures for confusing materials.",
                "I think the exams for this course were very fair and the conceptual level was very reasonable for non-S&DS majors. However, I don't think the way the content was introduced was very engaging at all and I think the difficulty of the problem sets was very off-putting at the beginning and made people very unnecessarily stressed for the exam.",
                "Strengths: MANY MANY extra credit opportunities, kind Professor. Weaknesses: Psets unnecessarily hard, material was taught confusingly despite the best intentions of the professor",
                "The lectures felt long, and it is difficult for students to engage during them.",
                "It was designed alright, but I think the teaching could incorporate more example problems into the lecture instead of just reading the textbook to us.",
                "Maybe this course can be lengthened into a two semester course that covers all material that correspond to Harvard stat 110",
                "Strengths: lectures are generally pretty clear and always recorded, office hours are very helpful, p-sets are challenging but not overly so, grading is very fast, exams are definitely easier than p-sets and mostly check comprehension instead of being designed to kill you, professor is very generous with extra credit \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are pretty much rehashing the textbook and can sometimes be a little dry, but not exceptionally so?",
                "Problem sets were very purposeful questions meant to understand concepts introduced in lectures. Exams were totally fair and actually meant to assess course content. Lecture could be done over Zoom more effectively than in person.",
                "Strengths: The paper was fun to write; grading is not particularly harsh\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class format was kind of a mess",
                "The strengths of this course were Professor Celis and the help available for students. Professor Celis was great - she consistently was responsive to student needs and cared about how students were doing in the class. The problem sessions she hosted were very helpful and she was very helpful walking through problems in office hours. The course could maybe be improved by making the problem sets less difficult - they didn't reflect the difficulty of the exams and at many times they were nearly impossible to figure out on your own, you had to go to office hours. It was a tough class and the material was somewhat boring.",
                "Interesting material and problem set questions are well explained later in class. Lectures can be a bit dry sometimes though.",
                "I wish there were more practice problems that reflected the exams.",
                "Strengths: Clear instructions; Weaknesses: Could have better explanations and reasoning behind why answer is the way it is.",
                "Strengths: understanding professor\r\nWeakness: very difficult content and less desirable teaching style.",
                "This course was a good introduction but could be improved by more concise and effective lecture slides as well as more problem-solving demonstrations in class to build intuition on how to approach problems.",
                "This course was organized well, and we were able to cover a variety of topics. The class was taught well and lectures were divided between covering material and reviewing practice questions, which I found to be helpful.",
                "The information in this course was interesting, the course had a reasonable amount of work, and the students were given ample time and preparation for each assignment and exam.",
                "The course covers the topics it said it would. Only weakness was that pset grading could seem arbitrarily harsh at times but that was made up for with extra credit.",
                "I really enjoyed the in-class problem sessions where we got to work through pset and potential exam problems. There were also lots of opportunities for office hours and connecting with the TAs/professor. I wouldve liked more clarification on what parts of the textbook were relating to our in-class learning since it wasnt always consistent.",
                "Could be a bit more engaging.",
                "The strengths include the organization of the course, general structure, and pace whereas there weren't any weaknesses.",
                "lectures were good and easy to follow, but the problem sets were a lot harder and sometimes detached from the lectures",
                "Problem Sets were interesting but lectures were sometimes a bit dry.",
                "The course covered many useful, practical topics and built a strong foundation for other required courses for the certificate. Also, the writing assignment allowed for students to connect a topic from class to another discipline area, which deepened understanding of that topic. Generally, the work was challenging and the grading of the class was not harsh. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was that there was quite some disconnect between the lectures, the work done on the problem sets, and the exams. The intuition of how to solve various problems must be mastered, for it will be tested on the exam.",
                "I really enjoyed how the PSETs were more difficult than the exams because I think it forced us to develop intuition for when to use certain concepts. However, I wish the PSETs had slightly easier questions and more questions to help continue to improve my ability to apply concepts."

                "Take it if you're trying to get the S&DS certificate. If you are looking for a QR, look elsewhere: there are many easier classes that are more relevant to what you want to learn that count as a QR. While the course is relatively easy, it requires a fair amount of effort to get the concepts, and it is not a class that you can brush off.",
                "Absolutely not. Coming out from this course, I feel like I have nothing to show for the countless stressful hours I devoted to this class. I still do not feel that I have a thorough grasp of the fundamentals of probability theory and regret taking the course.",
                "I would only recommend this course, and any other probability theory course as a matter of fact, to people that require it for their certificate or major. The course material is beyond dry and is very abstract. I wouldn't say it is a difficult course by any means, though the problem sets sometimes felt hard to grasp. I will say that Professor Celis is amazing and very flexible with students. She is readily available to answer questions and to help with any confusion you may have. She does her best to make it an interesting topic of study, but that only goes so far. If you have to take this class, lookout for Professor Celis!",
                "I would only recommend this course as a means to get the S&DS certificate. It's not very hard at all relative to Yale QR courses so it's definitely worth getting through to obtain the certificate. However, the class is quite dry and on its own is certainly not worth your time. Also, if you want to do a deeper dive into S&DS (even if you're only aiming for the certificate), definitely consider S&DS 241.",
                "Only for the certificate or if you're reallyyyy good at probability (which you won't know until you see the pset/test and realize you are not good at probability)",
                "Yes I would. A good introduction to probability without being too difficult!",
                "It depends. This course relies a lot on you teaching yourself, so if you are up for that, go for it. If you have a less strong math background and need more assistance learning, this class may be difficult for you.",
                "Take this course to sharpen your thinking.",
                "Yes, it's a very manageable intro stats course if you don't want to take a 100-level. Very abstract, though, so not great if you want something you can apply (e.g. you don't learn to code in R).",
                "Absolutely. Great intro to probability class with easy exams and totally fair problem sets. Definitely take for the S&DS certificate if possible. Even non-certificate students will benefit from the concepts taught in this class -- goes very well w ECON 117.",
                "For the certificate, yes; no otherwise",
                "I would recommend this class if you are genuinely interested in the material or have to take it as a requirement for your major/S&DS certificate. As someone not from a STEM background, I found the course challenging but ultimately doable.",
                "Yes. It's a great class to take for the stats certificate. The material is straightforward, if a little dull, and Professor Celis explains things pretty well. We also spend a lot of time going over practice problems in class which is really helpful in understanding the material and its applications better.",
                "Yes, if interested in Probability Theory.",

                "Yes if you are pursuing a certificate in S&DS",
                "This course is interesting near the beginning when real-world scenarios and probabilistic fallacies are discussed, but it quickly becomes a cut-and-dry teaching of the contents of a probability theory textbook. To my knowledge, this class was populated mainly with people pursuing the S&DS certificate who took this class because its an easier way to fill a requirement than 242, myself included. If you want a good grade and a resume-boosting certificate, enroll! If youre hoping for an intellectual experience or a wealth of applicable skills, you should go somewhere else.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Although the organization of the course is not the best, it is a welcoming environment for any student to learn the basics of Probability Theory and statistics.",
                "Yes! This class provided a great introduction to many topics within probability, which will be very useful for a lot of other classes.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the information learned about statistics was very valuable and could be applied to many different subject areas.",

                "Yes, especially if you are interested in the S&DS certificate.",
                "Yes, I found probability to be interesting and if you are considering the certificate this is a good option because the tests werent as hard.",

                "Yes, a great alternative to 241if youre not required to take 241 but still want to learn probability (like for the data science certificate)",
                "I would. I think the teacher and format of the class was perfect for the introductory nature of the topic. I thought the objectives were clearly defined and the course had a very linear and consistent progression.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to get an introduction into the world of statistics, especially since it comes in handy for getting the data science certificate.",
                "It is a good introduction to probability, but students that haven't taken a math or statistics course in a while should be warned that it is not a walk in the park.  There are proofs (which you don't need to do on exams, but on a couple psets) and the need to use/understand identities, distributions, etc.\r\n\r\nThe course uses a free online textbook: probabilitybook.net (<--this URL takes you to the book).  The course goes through roughly the first 5 chapters and a little here and there from later chapters.  While you don't need to comprehend all of the topics that the book goes through at that level, you do need to have working knowledge of the major topics.",
                "Yes. Although its not easy, it provides a good understanding for probability.",
                "If earning the certificate, then I would recommend this course, because it is quite comprehensive and builds solid foundation, but it is definitely not easy."
