    "I learned a lot of grammatical rules and vocabulary of the Russian language. It is a very fun and logical language to learn.",
    "russian vocab, most cases of nouns and adjectives, present, past and future verbs in both perfect and imperfect aspect",
    "I learned a lot about speaking, reading, and writing the Russian language, both in block and cursive. I also learned a lot about Russian culture and how unique it is.",
    "I developed reading writing and listening skills. I also got the opportunity to use skills learnt while learning other European languages and apply these to Russian.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength is how much I was able to learn in the span of one semester. A weakness is that I feel that my conversational skills are still lacking. Some of the vocabulary isn't as helpful as early vocabulary for other languages.",
    "The biggest strength was that it had class everyday and regular homework.",
    "The strengths of the course are the routine and consistency of the course. Having the class everyday and having homework everyday helped me more than anything. Also, the professor was excellent. The weakness of the course might be that we had to learn a few concepts on our own because of time, and those concepts I didn't learn very well.",
    "The faculty for the course are very strong. The course has a good syllabus that helps you kearn complex material fast. I really enjoyed the structure and it really helped me to learn Russian well.",
    "More speaking practice during the TF sessions.",
    "strengths\r\n-great teacher\r\n-wonderful TAs\r\n-**many outside activities make this class even greater: Russian lunch table, Russian concerts\r\n-constant assessments keep you working hard\r\n-class is mostly in Russian, letting us practice listening and speaking"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn a challenging language. It is definitely harder than Spanish or French, but it felt more rewarding to learn.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. I can't believe how much I learned in one semester, and it very manageable if you keep up with the work (which usually takes less than an hour daily).",
    "I highly recommend this course to other students. The instructors are very engaging and want the students to learn and do well. The organization of the course is well done; the information builds in a way which allows the students to actually learn and retain vocab and grammar rather than merely memorizing for a test.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student who wanted to learn a challenging foreign language because it is well-organized and there are multiple professors and TA's who can help you when you need assistance. I really didn't think I could learn foreign languages successfully before I took this course but the repetition of the practice and work as well as the help from the staff really helped me and this class ended up being my favorite class this semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "This course is about the same amount of work as other language classes. Professor Titus is a great teacher.",
    "Yes! Best class I may have ever taken. I spent roughly 2-3hrs\/day studying and doing the homework, but enjoyed every minute. Julia makes the classroom an exciting place to come to each day, testing our preparedness and interest in the subject. And there are always really cool people in your class, which is small enough to get to know them. Take Russian!"
