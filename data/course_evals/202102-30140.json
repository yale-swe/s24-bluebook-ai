                "Professor Mayer was an amazing teacher, I learned so much about Asian American pop culture and history.",
                "90% of the coursework for this class was done through readings, so I would say I strengthened my critical reading skills. Being a first-year student, this was an introduction to a class with such a heavy emphasis on readings, and I enjoyed it as much as it was challenging for me. Taking the concepts learned through the readings and applying them to popular culture elements we see in every day life was the most interesting takeaway for me.",
                "A comprehensive understanding.",

                "The strengths were the discussion and power points, the weaknesses were the amount of readings.",
                "This course was incredibly straightforward, which I greatly appreciated. Feedback was clear and it never felt like Najwa was trying to \"trick you\" with her assignments. All assignments until the final were truly for student growth and I appreciated not feeling so worried that my ideas wouldn't be exactly what the professor was looking for, which I think is a common fear in humanities midterms. I felt really supported and genuinely excited to attend class and work on each assignment. It's really hard to find something that could have been improved, other than wishing this was a full semester course!",
                "Strength: structure of the class and the course content, having guest speakers was also really great \r\nWeakness: many of the concepts felt very theoretical and hard to grasp"

                "Yes, definitely!\r\nThis course touches on much fundamental knowledge about media studies and sociology even. But it is also special because it is a cultural studies course, which make everything much more relative and interesting.",
                "Yes! I loved my professor and the type of coursework.",
                "Yes, I would. If you have any interest in learning more about Asian Americans and how they are portrayed in popular culture, don't hesitate to take this class. It covers a wide variety of varying pop culture elements, and most of the readings were engaging and interesting.",
                "Of course.",
                "Absolutely! Especially if you are Asian American and passionate about pop culture, because a lot of this course will hit home for you. It covers topics that most of us are familiar with on a surface level (i.e. representation in the media) but then examines them on a much deeper level, incorporating a really interesting plethora of theoretical texts that I never would have read, let alone heard about, outside of this class. I really like this course's approach of focusing on a specific type of media for each class, as there was always something new to be excited about, while helping us grow in our application of the course's broader themes to the cultural objects. I also think Najwa did an excellent job of including as much of the Asian American diaspora in meaningful ways in the course material as possible, especially given the course's short timeframe, and I really applaud her for that. It did not feel like a completely East-Asian-centric course as I was afraid it might, as she was able to include South, Southeast, West, and mixed Asian American voices in this course, and was really lovely to see both my friends and myself and my experiences with race in the media represented in the readings.",
                "Yes! The class had a lot of fun readings and media content and the topics we discussed were very relevant to our daily lives.",
