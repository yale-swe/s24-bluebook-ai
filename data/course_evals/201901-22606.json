    "I'd never gone to the theater much before this course. Aside from analyzing the text of plays, I had little vocabulary with which to discuss actual plays. Over the course of the semester, we went to the theater every week, sometimes more than once. We saw a range of plays, from Macbeth at the Globe to Top Girls at the Barbican. We discussed all aspects of the plays, from the text, to the lighting, to the staging, to the acting. We wrote responses to several plays, and kept a 'theater journal' to keep track of our reactions to and observations about the performances. This course helped shift the way I move in the world - paying more attention to the way language works, the way people interact with each other, the ways in which people communicate and, often, fail to communicate. It left me with an appetite for even more theater. My classmates and I would often get cheap, day-of tickets to other shows throughout London, in addition to the shows the PMC took us to. An incredible course.",
    "This course was an exploration of current theatre in London. It developed the way I approach watching theatre."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths included the immersive, experiential nature of the course, the ways in which the plays were supplemented by class discussions and video performances, the high level of discourse we cultivated throughout the term, and the plays themselves. Honestly, I wish we'd written more than 2 essays, since by the 2nd essay I really felt myself starting to get somewhere, and I think we had enough time and space to write a little more. I also thought the class presentations were effective ways to get us to interact with the reading - maybe in a future version of this course, each week a student could briefly present the text, like we did a few times this semester."
