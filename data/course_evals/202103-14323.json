                "I became a much stronger writer! Prof. Handler Spitz did an excellent job of challenging me to push outside my intellectual comfort zone and consider alternative perspectives. Her focus on art was also fascinating.",
                "I gained exposure to a many of the greatest works of ancient literature and became better at analyzing those texts.",
                "This class helped me learn to read works of literature in a way that focused both on theme and detail of individual passages. It led me to a greater appreciation for literature and a stronger ability to get through major works.",
                "I developed further reading comprehension skills and the ability to connect themes across history from one classic text to another. I learned that it is okay to have different interpretations of a text than a classmate or even the professor. I learned ambiguity is an acceptable condition of some of the larger questions posed by literature, and accepting ambiguity helps develop critical thinking skills and maturity when confronting the larger world. A pleasant surprise from this course was its exploration of ancient and modern art inspired by the texts we read. From this a small but pleasant amount of art history was learned.",
                "This class not only helped me understand the literature we read, but also to deeply appreciate it and the world around me. I felt that I connected with the works and with my peers. I feel that my outlook on life has changed, and I have more appreciation for literature and the world around me. I also feel that my writing improved in terms of my artistry and ability to convey emotion and beauty even when constructing an analytical argument about a text. In addition, Professor Handler Spitz love of art and art history has made me more interested in taking art history courses and pursuing my passion for visual arts, which I have often neglected in favor of academics. I realized that art and academics truly speak to each other and dont have to be exclusive.",
                "I learned how to analyze texts deeper and also a lot of art context for the historical works we were viewing. I also figured out how to engage in a lot of important discussions.",
                "An overview of some of the most important books I've ever read!",
                "I learned how to read closely and engage these close readings in formal writing and class discussions. I also learned the importance of recognizing and remembering key themes in texts that would enable me to compare these texts to others as I read, and I realized that texts are much more interesting when viewed in a larger context.",
                "This class prompted me to undergo a complete overhaul of my view towards literature -- being able to explore these great works in combination with the artwork they inspired led to a level of immersion that I had rarely felt before in high school. This course made me excited to re-read the works of this semester again and also approach future works in a different manner than I did before.",
                "In taking this course, I learned more about the seminal texts of Western Literature, including the Epics and Greek Tragedies. I learned how to engage in dialogue with other meaningfully, and how to close read. I gained a variety of insights by taking this course, especially on human behavior, and how art can be a vessel for expressing the ambiguities in our everyday lives.",
                "This first term of Directed Studies Literature helped me to develop my close-reading skills in the context of an overarching Western literary tradition. And so it not only allowed me to pay very close attention to specific passages (e.g. a paper examining the stichomythia between Dionysos and Pentheus in the Bacchae, or a passage response on the aesthetic effect of a few lines from Matthew), but this course also helped to establish and augment my understandings of the Western canon as a tradition. As such, it allowed me to read both small and large, which I had never had the opportunity to do in a classroom setting before."

            "comments": [
                "Strength - intellectual stimulation and rigor\r\nWeakness - Professor Handler Spitz is terrible at managing a classroom! She won't let students use the restroom (if you do, she sends you a menacing email!) and gave someone who had to miss a class due to a family emergency a very hard time about it.",
                "I think the fall DS literature curriculum is largely superb - I really enjoyed the vast majority of the texts we read, and even for those that I didn't enjoy as much, I completely understood why we were reading them. It's the expected nature of DS that we're always rushing through these texts, so I wouldn't necessarily call it a weakness, but I will say that the end of the course in particular was very rushed. We might have been better off with 1 or 2 fewer texts at the end. Finally, the lectures were sometimes hit-or-miss: we sometimes had unbelievably amazing lectures, but we also had lectures that didn't feel worth their time. That said, even the bad lectures are more than made up for by section.",
                "Due to the nature of DS, a lot of content is covered in a relatively short amount of time. This unfortunately leads to topics of interest being cut off in favor of moving forward in the curriculum. Professor Handler Spitz is a lovely individual who cares deeply about her students and the content she presents. Her passion for art and literature made everything more interesting and engaging.",
                "The strongest aspect of this course was certainly the breadth of works covered in just a semester. But two corresponding weaknesses directly caused by the breadth was the fast pacing and sometimes disappointing depth. Some of the greatest works of Western literature were given a single week of exploration, and while I understand that moving quickly is essential to getting through the course material, it can feel disappointing when there is a work you especially feel connected with and wish to explore further. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix to this issue without cutting texts from the syllabus, which I feel is a bad idea. If anything, I wish more books could be added while having more time for each of them, which I acknowledge is am impossibility. It is a fast paced, rigorous course in which it easy to fall behind in. But if you commit to staying with the class and engaging with every text, this course is incredibly rewarding.",
                "I adored this course. I think the emphasis on art, psychology, and personal experience was particularly meaningful and will make this class stick with me for a long time.",
                "I loved the opportunity to read so intensely and widely. Just be aware that you'll be spending one class period on books that deserve to be studied for an entire semester!",
                "Professor Handler Spitz was incredibly engaging and devoted to her students, and she helped me grew tremendously in the way that I approach reading, writing, discussion, and engaging with literature. There were times when the pacing of the course felt a bit rushed and I would have liked to spend more time on some of the texts, but that reflects more on the pacing of DS at large.",
                "Strengths- As mentioned, the way the works of literature were intertwined with artwork (paintings, operas, etc.) made it a really engaging course. The professor was amazing and her passion for literature shown through every class, making it exciting for all. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Having students lead the discussions sometimes felt a bit unproductive, but at the same time it did allow students to share with the class a different passage/section that may of not been covered otherwise. Overall, I would urge these to just be more concise in the future is all.",
                "This emphasis on learning about the seminal western texts through reading and discussion is a strength of this course. Being able to read a text, and have a discussion about the many different interpretation everyone has on it, helped enrich the conversation we had.",
                "The strengths of the course were myriad. For me, this DS Literature section had enormous strength in its seminar discussions (a truly wonderful hermeneutic circle, with many differing ideas) and in its assignments (three papers and optional passage responses allowed any particular student to really enter into, and figure out, a particular text for themselves). The nature of any DS section is an extremely fast pace, and one would have liked to have read Dante over the course of a semester; yet this pacing is also a great strength of the course---excitement never waned."

                "No, but only because of Prof. Handler Spitz's inappropriate classroom management. If you can take DS Lit with anyone else, go for it!",
                "I would absolutely recommend DS Literature with Prof. Handler Spitz! I simply can't describe how wonderful she is: she's kind, she offers great feedback on your writing, and perhaps most importantly, she's unbelievably passionate and excited about everything we read. That excitement spills over onto the entire class, and I looked forward to coming to our section every time. Just be prepared for the very high reading load.",
                "Yes, though if only interested in literature, one should not take DS simply for the lit section.",
                "This course is one of three in Directed Studies, so it cannot be recommended without recommending the entire program, which I do on a few conditions. If considering Directed Studies, you have to like reading or at the very least be open to doing a lot of it. Also do not plan to take difficult courses in conjunction with Directed Studies, you will detract from your experiences in that course, this program, and overall. DS will keep a student busy. But if a student is geared towards the humanities or at least has some interest in what the program is offering, I certainly recommend it and this course within it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. As I said before, I feel like it influenced me in deep personal ways and made me love literature even more. I think it will have a distinct and meaningful impact on everyone who takes it.",
                "As a part of DS, it's required, but I'd recommend DS to somebody interested in classics.n",
                "Yes! You'll get exposure to some of the best authors of all time, and will leave with books that'll be with you for life.",
                "I definitely would, granted that I would also be recommending all of DS. I think that this was my favorite of the three DS sections this semester, and when I was struggling or feeling frustrated in my other sections, I knew that I always had this section to look forward to.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, being able to interact with some of the greatest works of literature in a small group with a passionate professor is what education is ultimately about.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Having discussions is a great way to practice conversational and listening skills. I also believe it a great way to reflect in the way you think in comparison to others, and how you can learn from others. Moreover, learning about literature through discussion, and through presentations of art, reinforces the topics we learned,",
                "Yes yes yes. Directed Studies throws you headlong into the Western tradition and is always asking you to keep up---this is incredibly exciting! Moving through these very great poems, plays, etc., one right after another, is an ecstatic experience---the ideas and questions that these texts raise, and their aesthetic splendors alone, are profound and also exhilarating, so deep yet so broad. Even with a specific major plan or intellectual interest, DS is a perfect introduction to any higher education."
