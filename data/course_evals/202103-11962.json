Namely, these topics included fixed point theorems (Banach, Brouwer, Kakutani), contraction mappings and solutions to integral equations, explicit construction of Brownian Motion, almost everywhere convergence of discrete martingales, theorems regarding dimension reduction and intrinsic distance estimation (e.g. JL lemma and Varadhans formula), and Jordan Curves.",
                "Familiarity with various concepts in fields including measure theory, probability theory, and analysis.",
                "In this course, I learned an assortment of advanced topics in analysis, with a consistent focus on the historical background and economic significance of the concepts we covered. Specifically, we spent a lot of time talking about martingales, Brownian motion, Haar functions, and fixed-point theorems. The course often tried to build upon Math 305 and did end up reviewing many of the same concepts through the proofs in class. The work in the course was made up of in-class group presentations, so I gained skills in independent proof-solving and lesson planning, as well as in lecturing and groupwork. Through the lectures and this work, I gained insights about mathematical history, teaching, and its relationship with other fields."

                "Strengths: interesting content. Weaknesses: lecture tends to jump around, sometimes covering topics a few times, and assumes too little prerequisite knowledge.",
                "Lots of fun, and an environment that encourages understanding and enjoyment",
                "This course was very free form in which you can dictate and explore the topics you are interested in. If you plan to take this course, I would highly recommend reaching out to Professor Jones early and often as he is a really amazing guy, you will learn a lot from simply talking with him, and also he will recommend you a number of interesting topics to explore.",
                "This course assigns very little work. You really get out of the course whatever you put into it. This is a strength for some and a weakness for others, depending on how much work students decide to spend in the course. Maybe a bit more structure might be good.",
                "it could be improved by allowing students to focus on areas other than analysis.",
                "The main strengths of this course were the interesting and amusing lectures, the relaxed workload, and the open-ended final project. I really enjoyed listening to the lectures, in particular the humorous historical asides and anecdotes, and the lack of exams or problem sets allowed me to overlook their sometimes confusing nature. It really did feel like a relaxed, open-ended senior seminar, and being able to spend the last few weeks on a project\/topic of your choice reinforced this feeling. On the other hand, the main weaknesses of the course were the unclear course structure and the sometimes repetitive topics. There never was any syllabus, and we often didnt know what was happening with lecture topics, presentation deadlines, etc. In class, the lectures were also confusing at times, and we seemed to circle around several core topics without clear connections. I think it would be great to have even more input and direction from the students, and maybe the first assignment could be getting together to assemble some desired discussion topics for the semester (like we did for the final presentations). For the presentations, there could have been some kind of signup sheet, with date options and clear time slots for gauging the scope of our lectures. Furthermore, we could have spent a bit more time on the final presentations so we did not have to rush them as much in the last few classes."

                "I would recommend this course to any senior (or even super junior) in a math-related major who can use it to either replace a thesis\/project requirement or use it as a low-workload addition to their schedule. It is a very relaxed way to satisfy a senior requirement for many majors, and for the math-related majors in which it does not (e.g. CS & Math), it is still a fun and light course to count towards major electives. I really enjoyed being in a class with lots of my fellow mathy friends from previous classes, and it was even better that we got to work together on all the homework (i.e. the two presentations). It wont be the most rigorous or skill-building course you have taken, but it will be a fun group experience with like-minded students and a very low workload. My one note would be that it may be more interesting\/insightful if you have already taken Math 305 or an equivalent analysis course, as some topics were confusing without that background; but either way its still worth taking!"
