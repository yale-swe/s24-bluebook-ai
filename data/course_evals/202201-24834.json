                "This course was useful primarily for its' subject matter. Non-Christian religious philosophy is a pretty limited field even at Yale, and something that most students know little about. I walked away with a better understanding of the Islamic worldview which will be helpful in future courses I may take in History or Middle Eastern studies.",
                "This course was an excellent introduction to Islamic Studies and the perplexing questions of philosophy and religion, reason and faith, at their intersections.",
                "I learned about the intersections of Islamic & Western thought, as well as how Muslims should conceive of themselves within the broader philosophical tradition.",
                "Deeper understanding of the difference between religion and philosophy, great introduction on basic tenets of Islam and broad scope of history, explored links between Islam and the West in terms of philosophy. Crash course on major religious and philosophical figures in Islam.",
                "I learned how to apply my knowledge of philosophy to a course without any of the characters that I had come to recognize from western philosophy, and it allowed me to see the discipline on a more fundamental, big picture level.",
                "I gained a great foundational knowledge of the threads in Islamic philosophy, as well as a particular understanding of Al-Ghazali.",
                "Learned about main ideas in ethics in islam.",
                "I improved my essay writing and understanding of the vast literature present in Islamic philosophy."

            "comments": [
                "At times, the direct relevance of the course readings to our in-class discussions was somewhat unclear. I was sometimes left with the feeling that I pretty much had to interpret them myself without a lot of input from the professor or other students. However, this course did help me with interpreting texts in translation, and working with philosophical texts in general. I think having more discussion of the readings, like in an online canvas forum between students, would improve the class.",
                "This course was at its strongest in the early units about historical Islamic philosophy, particularly the free and fascinating discussions we had about Neoplatonism and its consequences for Islam, and the works of Al-Kindi as a synthesis of Islamic and Classical Greek Thought. I would have liked to spend more time on Al-Ghazali, who felt like the centerpiece of the course, and really dealt with him as the center of controversy and debate in Islamic thought (incl. reading more of the philosophers he refutes and who attempt to refute him) because of how fascinating he was to everyone in the course.",
                "The class covered a broad amount of Islamic thought & law. Over all, I cant think of any weaknesses. I guess we could have spent less time on Ancient thought and more time discussing the Quran itself.",
                "Strengths: (1) Range of topics. We cover a lot of ground in a short time and the overall plan for the course is pretty broad. Makes for a good ground-level introduction that can lead to more exploration later. (2) Great assignment structure. Really, really liked the alternating weeks of response papers. They were a great way for me to really do a deep-dive on the readings for the week! Would recommend adding another week of the response papers, actually. But I'd like for them to be less formal. The final paper can be an opportunity to work on citations etc, but I think the response papers should be pretty low-key, just aiming to get us to think more deeply about a particular question. (3) Guest speakers were very cool! Think that their topics could maybe have been included in the syllabus. But also maybe ask them to shorten their presentations and pose a couple of questions to the group so that we can discuss and try to tie in themes from the class as a whole.\r\n\r\nImprovements: (1) More focused\/intentional in discussion and lecture. At times discussion and lecture felt a little scattered and it was difficult to suss out the main points\/takeaways. Would have appreciated more explicit emphasis on the key takeaways and the main themes that we needed to focus on for discussion or pull from the readings. (2) Make clearer the links between different weeks. These links were definitely there and we mentioned them eventually in class, but it would have been good to really emphasize how each week bleeds into another and how all of the topics that we're learning interconnect and build on each other. Again, we got this to some extent, but I would make that a priority moving forward. (3) Recommend some kind of packet or document on key terms or baseline knowledge about Islam that we can all read prior to coming to class. Would help to even out the differences in background between each of the students; those who know a lot about philosophy, but not much about Islam and vice versa.",
                "The course was great as an introduction to Islamic Studies, one of the best philosophy classes Ive taken at Yale.",
                "The strenght is small class size and very interesting readings. The weakness I would say it that there is not a lot of discussions about the readings during seminars. While the Professor gave a general overview, he did not cover each reading in detail.",
                "The strengths of this course was the professor's openness to student engagement, and the diversity of thinkers that we explored. The weaknesses were the lectures were sometimes unstructured."

                "I would recommend this course to any student studying religious philosophy from a non-Christian perspective or anyone studying the Middle East. I don't think I would recommend this as a casual course to pick up, most of the students came in fairly knowledgeable about Islam and a newcomer would feel a bit lost.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Islam from a philosophical perspective, or in religion in general from a theological perspective. Even though every reading was inflected through Islam, we discussed so many fascinating questions about God, theodicy, free will, revelation, tradition and reason, etc. that I think any student who is interested in these questions would love this course for the unique perspectives it offers and discusses.",
                "Absolutely! Nowhere else at Yale would you meaningfully be able to put people like Ibn Sina, Al-Ghazali, and Aquinas in communication with one another. It helped me really think about what it means for the West.",
                "Yes, I would. \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of adjustments that could be made to make things go more smoothly\/efficiently and I think it might need to be a little more explicit about who this course is meant for (beginners vs upper level philosophy majors), but the material was fascinating and the intended arc was well-designed. Overall, I think this course could be developed a little further in a later iterations, but it was a strong start! Think there's a lot of potential for this course to be really wonderful in future years, if Professor Kam has the chance to keep testing and tweaking to work out the kinks.",
                "I would definitely - it contained lively discussion and wasn't stuck in its curriculum.",
                "Yes! Professor Kam is very knowledgeable of the subject and a great teacher. He both instills wisdom into you and activates you to engage with the material.",
                "Go through the topics and see if you like them and you like the readings even though they might not be discussed that much, then take it.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want to have a more holistic understanding of the Islamic Golden Age."
