I learned a lot about synthesizing my knowledge across fields and about writing in a philosophical way. Each student in the class brought unique knowledge and insights that made the entire experience extremely valuable and educational.",

                "Strengths: Great discussions, great material--everything about the seminar was good.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class size was probably a little too big. Sometimes I felt that I just had to say something even though it was not particularly relevant to the discussion at hand.",
                "The syllabus is so incredibly engaging  there is a diverse range of media types, so you get to analyze many different things! I also really enjoyed the freedom Professor Grimstad gave us on the papers. It allowed you to explore what you were interested in, rather than confining you to one topic.",
                "Strengths: Really cool readings, very reasonable workload, and the chance to really get engaged in discussions. Lots of feedback on essays. \r\nWeaknesses: If you're not part of the \"main stream\" of discussion, it can feel difficult to feel involved or invested. Essay feedback isn't always helpful for generally improving at writing, focuses more on the specific material discussed in the essay.",
                "I loved the curriculum and teaching style of this class. The professor was extremely engaged and accessible. The only thing that could have made the class even better might have been to establish guidelines for participation during class early in the semester to facilitate a more natural flow of conversation. I also think the class would have benefited by being a little bit smaller, but I did enjoy everything that each student contributed.",
                "I enjoyed the essays and Professor Grimstad provided a lot of good support with the writing process.",
                "the strengths are Grimstad, the readings which were always fantastic - when I usually skip readings for class I'm thankful when the class is over and I don't have to pretend to know whats going on, but I always would regret not doing the readings for thought experiments because the discussion would always be lively and thought-provoking.",
                "I think that the core strength of the course was the material that we read and watched. I found the various books, short stories, essays, and films that we explored to be very fascinating and interrelated. The overall thematic flow of the course also made sense, and I appreciated the freedom we had with the topics of our essays. I would say that one thing that could be improved could be finding a way to make some of the contributions to the discussion more succinct, but overall, the class dynamic was great, and the discussion really illuminated new ideas for me.",
