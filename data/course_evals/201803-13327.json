    "This class was one of the best, and also one of the most unusual, classes I've ever taken at Yale. The first half of the class basically consists of coming into the Beinecke every Tuesday, looking at some random papyri that Hanson has chosen for the day, and then doing some supplemental readings on the outside. Given that the materials chosen do not seem to be arranged in a coherent order, it is surprising how much your skills improve, but they do: by the end you'll find yourself reading things that you could never have deciphered six weeks earlier. Around Thanksgiving there is an incredibly easy take-home midterm. After that, the class is entirely devoted to individual projects. This basically consists of producing a transcript and notes to a hitherto unedited papyrus from the Beinecke's collection, and is an incredibly frustrating yet incredibly rewarding process. It's amazing how, even a month into looking at the same papyrus, you will have breakthroughsand, of course, doing the research will lead you down a lot of weird rabbit holes. Hanson is incredibly kind and dedicated and helps you through the whole process. Would definitely recommend this class."
