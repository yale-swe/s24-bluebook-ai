                "Most of the topics were pretty interesting, and I thought the profesor was good. One thing I did not like was how active the comment section was and found it distracting at times.",
                "strengths\r\n-v interesting material; wide variety of material\r\n-lecture based yet still engaging with videos\/polls\/poppin comment section\r\n-decent amt of guest lecturers\r\n-no studying required\r\nweaknesses\r\n-occasionally lectures were boring, but I think its just bc the topic didn't align with my interests",
                "Strengths: Engaging lectures. Guest lectures were the best part of the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Final was awful. Incredibly confusing and did not test what we were taught in class. Some questions were incredibly vague while others were hyperspecific--overall very difficult to take for no reason. I assume it was put together by TA's per the Ed Discussion--please do better next time. Disappointing and pathetic.",
                "I found the course disappointingly \"soft.\" I think it would be improved by a more conventional structure, including regular textbook readings and tests or quizzes. I think that would have allowed us to get through more material and make it stick. As is, it felt like we were learning party tricks half the time - they might be interesting, but they left me somewhat unimpressed with psychology as a serious discipline.\r\n\r\nI will say that the course instructors were very kind and understanding, and tried to encourage enthusiasm in the subject.",
                "This course was great and it allowed for active learning without all the stress. I personally really love how this course was run and I think I learn best in these type of classes. Although there were no time exams or assessments, I still learned a lot from engaging in class.",
                "Strengths: I thought that Professor Lazzaro was an excellent professor. Her teaching style was effective, clear, and engaging and she was very understanding and reasonable with the expectations for this course. I enjoyed the guest lecturers and given the current pandemic, I believe that this course was taught to the best of its ability.",
                "In general, I found the course to be interesting and the teaching team was incredible accommodating to students' needs which I greatly appreciated. I do think that the course could be improved by providing a deeper dive into certain areas of psychology. It became hard to follow sometimes and especially in studying for the final when a lecture about robots was actually about confirmation bias and attitudes and behaviors. I think the course could be better structured so that it is less all over the place and more topical. Having units more clearly defined as cognitive psychology, behavioral psychology, social psychology, and other areas of specialty in the field would have been very helpful for placing this information that we are learning into context.",
                "It is a fun class and they try to make the subject matter engaging and entertaining. I think a weakness of the course was how it was structured though. Even though arranging each lecture around a question was cool, it made it really hard to mentally separate material into disciplines. I would have preferred to learn more about the history\/origins of psych in the beginning, and then have more specific sections of the class for cognitive psych, or behavioral psych and stuff like that. We could still have lectures based around questions, but that would've really helped me understand psych more broadly and it would've made it a lot easier for me to study. I also think the lectures in general were focused on giving us a lot of examples of specific things, rather than either going deep or broad into the material. I don't think I got a very nuanced understanding of any of the topics, and I also didn't feel like (due to the structure of the class maybe) I got a full understanding of a bunch of different areas of psychology.",
                "This course was very interesting, and the professor was very kind and understanding.",
                "This course covers a wide range of interesting topics with appropriate depth; it is well-balanced. I appreciated the course focus on pursuing our curiosities through scientific inquiry, and it was helpful to discuss studies that exemplified each psychological concept. I also enjoyed the interactive course polls, which made the experience more engaging. \r\n\r\nIn the future, it would be helpful to put fewer words on each slide. While the exams were open-note, some students prefer to take notes anyway to internalize concepts. The ability to summarize information and to isolate key concepts is valuable, but the slides should not be too overpopulated. Images that communicate concepts are often stronger than paragraphs.",
                "The material is easy to grasp and understand, and many of the research studies presented are fun and interesting to learn about. Honestly, the workload is very manageable and I would not really change anything about this course.",
                "This course had incredibly interesting and thought-provoking assignments that kept me engaged with the material despite it being a virtual lecture course.",
                "This class was great! The readings supplemented the lectures, which could seem dense sometimes, greatly and reinforced the major topics. The class was well-organized, and it was very engaging in that all of the phenomenons had applications to other fields or everyday life. The guest lectures were a favorite, as they introduced us to different fields and varieties of psychology and were all incredibly interesting. The one weakness was that assignments were sometimes less clear, but they did get me critically thinking about the material.",
                "I found the lectures really interesting and appreciated that they were both offered live and recorded.",
                "no real weaknesses. strengths: the best online lecture I had this semester! The lectures were incredibly engaging and interesting, keeping me engaged in a really difficult semester.",
                "I liked how fun it was, but maybe it could be a bit more linearly organized? It felt like the topics were all separate though there has to be some relation",
                "Strengths: engaging, creative ways of introducing different topics, a good combination of learning and fun.",
                "The strengths of this course was the teaching team: all TFs and Dr. Lazzaro really made this course an amazing course. Structuring the curriculum to focus on questions in psychology \/ questions people have about their own minds was very effective, and I highly recommend taking this course to delve into a wide variety of psychological topics. The use of EdDiscussion was extremely useful, and the anonymity feature was utilized quite well. I cannot think of any weaknesses: this course was really amazing! The only thing I can think of to improve, though, is possibly the implementation of quizzes. I am all for less work, but quizzes would benefit students when doing the writing assignments as well as doing the little bit of studying to help with the final. Another thing that I highly recommend keeping are the guest lectures: ESPECIALLY Dr. Wendy Suzuki... she is an icon.",
                "It was very manageable. I think it might have helped to have quizzes or some assignment that related more to the lectures to help keep us on track with the material. There were assignments that weren't the most focused on having us study or use lecture material, but I think this made the final exam, which was a takehome exam a bit more difficult. \r\n\r\nThat being said the professor's lectures were good, well explained and easy to understand even though we did span a lot of topics. She really cared about our mental health.",
                "I liked the interactivity of the lectures. We also had cool guest lectures.",
                "I really enjoyed the pace of the course overall. I don't have any recommendations for improvement.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lazzaro is super engaging and committment to creating a class envrionment that facilates student engagement. Also depending on the TA that you have discussion sections can be interesting or a waste of time is what I've heard after speaking to friends in different sections. Weaknesses: lack of clear expectations on grading for the class.--Be wary of the final exam! The work and content of lectures during the semester is very managable and interesting; however, the grading of the class is definitely a point of concern. The final exam counted for 35% of the course grade so to do well you have to do well on the final which was composed of ~20 short answer\/essay based questions that were often times confusing or vague in their wording was really frustrating. The questions were written as if there was usually a very specific psychology principle or phenomenon that was the answer, but to know it you would have to have pretty detailed lecture notes or be willing to rewatch the lecture recording from the entire semester to find it in the case that you didn't remember it. I'm not sure if this disconnect between rigor of the final and prior class assignment is due to the fact that the graduate student TAs\/TFs wrote and graded the exam or what, but I found it really stressful and that overall there was a lack of communcation regarding what to expect for the final exam until it was released. I am grateful that exam was given over a period of time for it to be manageable, but even then there were clarifications made on specific test questions after I submitted my exam so I probably got points deducted for not interpreting the question the same way in which the TA's wrote them. Also, in the final class period\/course overview lecture led by the TA's taking live questions regarding the final, it was quite clear how little some of the TA's actually cared about how students did on the exam when they were laughing at the wording of clarifying questions that students asked.",
                "Lectures were interesting. I liked the guest lecture topics for the most part (except one about evolution).",
                "This was an excellent course. The live virtual lectures were incredibly interesting, and Professor Lazzaro's use of Menti, an online polling website, kept the presentations interactive, creating spaces where students could engage with the material. \r\nI honestly can't think of any weaknesses of the course  it is amazing!",
                "This class had very interesting content that kept me eager for the next class. I feel as though the weekly discussion sections were unnecessary aside from the ability to socialize with fellow classmates.",
                "All of the lecture topics are presented in super engaging ways. There are a lot of genuinely fun aspects of this class to the point that it is almost like watching TV while I am still learning a lot.",
                "I think the class was very good! I would have preferred to see more difficult assignments and less weight on the final.",
                "They were very accommodating and material was interesting",
                "very strong course, well designed and engaging",
                "I think in theory, the discussion sections would be helpful but I found them rather unhelpful and not necessary for this course.",
                "Lectures were greatdefinitely the biggest strength of the course. Sections were extremely chill, perhaps a bit too much so. I would have liked to see more engagement with the concepts from the lectures in the sections. As it was, they werent really practice.",
                "Really solid course and great introduction to Yale classes. The guest lecturers were amazing.",
                "Strength: extremely engaging material and presentation of material \r\nWeakness: the final was the first time we were actually tested on if we understood the material \/ could apply the material. The previous assignments were basically effort grades so even if you explained something wrong you wouldn't know. The final was also pretty long and many of the questions were poorly worded. I don't think the content of the questions were difficult or unfair but sometimes trying to understand what they were asking was time consuming. On another front, the syllabus was useful for about 1-2 weeks. I wish it was updated regularly (and announced that it was updated) to actually match the class and assignments.",
                "Lots of material was covered, but I liked the menti surveys that we did in class. They were engaging and really helped see different psychological phenomena in action. The weekly assignments were also very effective ways to think further on specific topics for the week.",
                "I loved the way the topics were apprehended (in a non-classical, non-textbook approach). Very conducive to students intellectual engagement with the topics studied.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lazzaro is a great lecturer! The lectures were engaging and most importantly she realized when the class as a whole was going through a difficult time. I highly recommend this course as a fifth class or to try out psychology, the course load is light and pairs well with other classes. Also a pre-req for other psychology courses.\r\nWeaknesses: if you are looking for a rigorously intense psych course this may not deliver that level of challenge, but it can help you decide if psych is something you are interested in (or perhaps you need Psych 110 for other courses).",
                "Very general but very informative.",
                "You wont know much about grading until the very end. The final was one of the longest finals Ive taken before and we werent exactly prepared for such a long exam.",
                "Strengths include the TA's, Professor Lazzaro, and the workload. Weaknesses include the discussion sections.",
                "Generally, I thought we covered an impressive variety of topics really deeply in such a short time. Lectures -- by both Prof. Lazzaro and the guests--were fun and engaging. Although the lectures on persuasion and on how we see things were very very cool, and they both deserved a few classes devoted to them, there were topics like dreams, mental disorders and therapy, and morality that I was also curious about.",
                "Perhaps due to the online virtual format, the class was not very engaging. In person perhaps it's different.",
                "I thought that this was quite a well-run and well-taught course! Professor Lazzaro was a great professor, and I liked how she structured each lecture around a central topic\/theme; it made each lecture more engaging, as did the polls and other ways she directly involved students. The weekly homework assignments provided a low-stress way to think about and better understand topics covered in class, and overall it was thoroughly enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: highly engaging lectures with interesting content even for non-Psychology majors and low workload\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "I love how the lecturer and Teaching Fellows clearly went out of their way to make the class fun and interesting, and I really appreciated how the weekly assignments were flexible enough for us to have fun with them and relate them a little to our own lives and experiences. I particularly enjoyed the use of music in both the lectures and sections!",
                "Strengths: Professor Lazzaro was very excited about the content and she made every lecture fun!\r\nWeakness: TA sections did not add much to the course or the content; the content did not align well with the amount\/type of material needed to be covered for outside programs such as the MCAT.",
                "I really liked the course format and how the professor structed each class. It was engaging all of the time and starting the day with a specific question such as \"Do we see the same blue?\" was a lot better than simply stating what we were going to be learning that day.",
                "Lectures were very interesting and well-structured",
                "The course was well-taught and was very interesting. The final exam was a bit concerning as it was worth a large part of our grade, but the take-home format was helpful.",
                "This course had a lot of interesting topics and concepts however sometimes was overwhelming with information.",
                "The materials of this course are super interesting and engaging! The readings are very easy to understand and relevant to the subjects.",
                "Honestly an amazing course. Really interesting and accessible, and the professors and TAs really care about students and their mental health. The only weakness is that most of the grade is decided by the final so I dont know at all why Im getting",
                "I liked the in class polls that helped engage with the class it was a large class but having the discussion section afterwards helped with that.",
                "I thought it was very interesting. Learned a lot and enjoyed it tremendously.",
                "Discussion section was extremely engaging and fun. However, it did not relate to the lecture material (at least not fully). I'm not sure whether I would give up how enjoyable discussion section was though in order to gain cohesivity with lectures. Lectures were dry at times, but the professor clearly tried to make them enjoyable.",
                "Very entertaining lectures. Guest lectures were a nice change. Adjusted well to COVID conditions.",
                "I think the way that this course was structured encouraged people to pay attention less. Lectures were not synchronous if you didn't want it to be and discussion section was only 50 minutes per week. Participation in this was a large chunk of the grade, and there was not much prep that was required. The prep that was required did not mean that you had to look in the lecture either as there were often readings that you could skim to find the information necessary. That prep was the rest of the weight of the course grade besides the final, which was a 2 week take home final. It was a very low stress course, which I appreciated, but I often felt bad because I had no motivation to pay attention.",
                "I liked the breadth of topics that were covered, however, I did not see any benefit of having a section.",
                "Strengths: lectures are very interesting, guest lectures are very intriguing\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "I think the lectures were well designed and engaging. I really enjoyed the guest lectures and I thought the assignments were an interesting way to incorporate the concepts we learned in class.",
                "The live virtual lectures were really engaging. I think this class was well adapted to the COVID-19 circumstances.",
                "A strength is that it was very good as an intro course because it covered a lot of topics to get a general understanding of the field.",
                "Strengths: I think that the biggest strength of PSYC 110 was actually Professor Stephanie Lazzaro! She was so kind and always in a superb mood when starting lectures, and I think that her positive attitude really \"rubbed\" off on her students. I also think that the students were in good hands during discussion section, as the TFs were all (at least to my knowledge) superb psychologists. Finally, the course material was presented in ways that were based on more understanding and less memorization, which really lended to a positive and less-competitive learning environment  one in which knowledge was favored over temporary memorization. Great job, PSYC 110 staff!\r\nWeaknesses: This course didn't really have any major weaknesses, to be honest. The only thing I would mention is that there was a bit of a disconnect between the work required during the semester and the work required for the final. While I only spent, at most, an hour or two (not including lectures and discussion sections) on the course during the semester, the final was by far my most lengthy and tedious! I understand the need to check for understanding, but even cutting down the final from 19 questions to 12-15 would have proven to match the rest of the course. Other than that, I really enjoyed the class. Also, even though the final was lengthy, it was still very interesting and not too boring compared to other final assignments that I completed!",

                "I think for any lecture class, it's the right decision to record the live lectures. It was very helpful to have the ability to miss a week or rewatch confusing sections.",
                "The discussion sections were very organized and helpful.",
                "I found it immensely helpful to have live lectures and discussion sections rather than asynchronous events. Synchronous events are more engaging and promote greater conversation, and I found that the lectures and discussion sections allowed for significant student interaction (both with each other and with the professor). Regarding improvements, I would have liked to see more structure in the discussion sections; the discussion sections often did not adhere to a rigid study or discussion plan, and I often felt that we were not learning new information or solidifying concepts.",
                "Recorded lectures were helpful in allowing students to go back and rewatch parts that they might not have understood completely the first time through.",
                "I thought that recording the lectures was very helpful, and overall the practices were successful.",
                "See above",

                "I enjoyed the learning despite it being over Zoom. Encountered very few technical difficulties and lectures were very engaging nonetheless.",
                "PSYC 110 did everything right with response to the COVID-19 pandemic: classes were better in-person, but if you needed to skip, you could watch the recorded lecture; guest lecturers came from the TFs, professors around Yale, and even outside of Yale (if Wendy Suzuki does not make an appearance in each course, this course will not live up to the accolades I give it); and concepts were easily understood and teaching staff were highly engaged with the course. This course was not as heavy in workload as other courses, which is to say this course responded well to the pandemic conditions (meanwhile, other courses I had maintained the same rigor prior to pandemic conditions, which was detrimental to my learning and performance). The only thing that may improve this course may have been the use of online quizzes to test our knowledge (whether graded or not, they would have been helpful to gauge how the final would go).",
                "Everything geared toward learning in the pandemic was good.",

It was a great way to feel more like a part of the class without the stress of raising your hand in front of 100+ people.",
                "Professor Lazzaro was passionate about the course material and engaged with the students even in a virtual environment.",
                "In the future having a bit of transparency regarding expectations for the final exam would be a great way to improve the course.",
                "I thought the addition of the discussion sections was not necessary at all. I liked my TF but I felt like the sections were kind of pointless.",
                "The virtual lectures were extremely successful. The lecture material was engaging, the discussion sections provided ample opportunity to dig deeper into the material we covered in class, and the workload was very manageable. Also, the use of the Ed Discussion platform made it very easy to interact with the professor and the TA's to ask questions. \r\nMy one suggestion would be to perhaps add some consistent, low-stress quizzes or assignments just to help students drill the material a bit more before the final exam. But, overall, the course was great!",
                "The weekly discussion sections were quite detached socially. There should be more student engagement with less daunting discussions that allow for more fluid yet deep conversation.",

                "The lectures being recorded helped combat zoom fatigue and the lectures were always started with music. Professor Lazzaro never held the class overtime and was aware of the challenges of the semester. Whenever we had a break day she made sure that the week's homework assignment was adjusted accordingly - allowing the break day to be a break day. Many of my friends in this course commented that Psych 110 with Professor Lazzaro was the one class that was actively trying to follow the break day protocols and adapting to student's mental health following the challenges of this semester. In terms of engagement there were polls, visual illusions, and guest lecturers which all made the material engaging.",

                "The discussion section was helpful because participation in it was required. It made me actually pay attention and was ultimately where I developed my understanding the most.

                "Having the recorded lectures was a great tool!",
                "I think the discussion sections were good, in addition, the recorded lecture format was very helpful so that I could watch the lectures at my own pace. This helped my engagement during the lectures. In addition, if watching the lectures lives, there were many opportunities to interact via polls which I though aided my attention to the lecture.",
                "I really appreciated how understanding Professor Lazzaro and the TFs were when it came to student circumstances. The class was wonderful.",
                "The practices succeeded because they had both live and recorded options.",
                "I think that Prof. Lazzaro's introduction into each lecture with some music that matched the theme of the topic at hand was a great way to begin lectures with a smile on my face:) I think that this class was well-adapted to COVID-19, but my only suggestion might be the implementation of a quick, mid-semester feedback response from the teaching fellows. I think that receiving comments on the Gradescope assignments was helpful, but aside from that, there wasn't much feedback on our engagement during discussion sections and effort on assignments. Other than that, I think that this class was amazing and well-carried-out during our (hopefully) last COVID semester!"

                "It was okay but I don't think I would. The professor and TAs were really nice and understanding which was great, but the class in general was just structured in a way that left me unsatisfied after lectures, and I never really felt like I was learning.",
                "Yes, this course was very interesting and the workload was just right.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about (1) other people, (2) his\/her\/themself, (3) psychology, (4) the brain (this course is a great course to take before diving into neuroscience material, though I took neuro courses first), and (5) the fascinating, hidden ways in which we think. The workload is extremely low, and the content is interesting. This is a good course to take alongside a few rigorous courses to even things out.",

                "Yes! It is a great survey of psychology, if that is interesting to you. If you've taken a psychology course before, it may be a bit redundant. The class is very engaging, and I loved having the discussion sections to talk about and engage in the material more.",

                "I highly recommend this course to someone else: this course took a very nice survey around psychology. The teaching team (especially Dr. Lazzaro) were very effective, and Dr. Lazzaro's use of guest lecturers made the class that much better. Like I said before, the structure of the curriculum focusing on questions rather than the topics themselves helped in interest and focus of the students, and made class so much more fun.",

Professor Lazzaro does an excellent job of providing an introduction to the subject and highlighting various subfields of psychology with guest lecturers. People that are curious about the major  or even just curious about the subject  should strongly consider taking this class. The workload is completely manageable, the assignments are engaging, and the class is extremely interesting.",

                "Yes, any student wanting to experience what psychology is all about should definitely take the course. The course touches on the variety of fields that psychology has, and can foster many good discussions and thought about how we interact with the world.",
                "Definitely. This course is about human beings - it is relevant for any major. Excellent introduction to Psychological sciences.",
                "Yes! If you need a fifth class or are remotely interested in psychology Psych 110 is a great fit. It covers a wide array of topics from learning to memory to perception, but I did not feel as if any area was given too little time. If you want to major in psych or want to take courses later on that need psych 110 as a pre-requisite I can say psych 110 paired well with my schedule and the workload was very manageable. Professor Lazzaro was amazing and my TF was also very engaging. Every time we had a break day Professor Lazzaro would ensure we could use it as a break day by adjusting the assignments accordingly as well as checking in on the overall morale of the class.",
                "yes 100% it was a great intro class that still covers info.",
                "Yes, great intro to psychology course that I recommend everyone take. It is simple but you learn a lot more than you would expect and really helps with deciding if you want to major is psychology.",
                "If they want to learn a wide range of psychology topics.",
                "Don't take this class with Professor Lazzaro. This class was a huge letdown from what I heard from classmates who took the class in previous years. Instead of a cohesive overview of human psychology, this class felt more like a list of random fun facts. Some of the things were interesting for sure, but some other lecture content had no place being in an intro psychology class. For example, we spent one lecture learning about the bone structure of human ancestors and monkey sex. Clearly the instructors didn't stop to ask themselves why they were showing a picture of monkeys having sex in an intro psych class because it was asked on the final too. Definitely super disappointed I took the class this semester because of how aimless and pointless it was. I'd take the class with another more experienced professor though because apparently it can actually be good.",
                "Yes, its quite interesting",
                "Absolutely! This course is a fantastic introduction to psychology, and you will learn quite a bit in the class. The workload is extremely minimal, and it was easy to balance this class on top of a packed workload. There are not too many assignments, and the only test was the final which was challenging but completely doable if you had payed attention during the semester. The TA's are awesome, and Professor Lazzaro is a great lecturer. Overall if you're on the fence with this course, just take it! The content is interesting and it shouldn't be overly stressful.",
                "This is very much a survey class, which I found somewhat frustrating, because I did not feel that we delved as deeply into the material as I would have liked. However, if you are looking for a broad introduction to many topics in Psychology and don't mind changing focus each week, then I would recommend the course.",
                "Psych 110 can be fun and valuable for anyone learning about anything. You'll find meaningful connections to your work and your life. The instructors clearly care about the material and allowing a positive experience in the course",
                "Yes!! Super manageable and light course  that gives a great intro to psychology and cognitive concepts. Definitely recommend if your looking to add a fun and insightful course to an otherwise hard schedule.",
                "If you want a social science credit that isn't too much work, then yes. It's also fairly interesting if you'd like to learn more about psychology and human behavior.",
                "YES! Professor Lazzaro is a wonderful lecturer and the content is extremely interesting for students of all majors",
                "Absolutely! Interesting content taught in an accessible and fun way.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is looking for a fun course to be exposed to all the different areas of psychology. If you are looking to learn psych for the MCAT or another outside exam, I don't think that this course covered enough content to prepare you. It would have been nice to know more about grading and section participation as this was never clearly outlined.",
                "Yes!!! It was a really interesting class and I learned a lot. It was not a high workload so it complemented my STEM classes really well.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning more about psychology.",
                "Great class if you want a chill and broad intro to Psyc",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it is very interesting and engaging.",
                "Yes, this course was a great introduction to many topics regarding psychology. Even if this course is not required for your major it was very interesting and you will learn a lot.",
                "Yes! Intro to Psych is a classic course that everyone should take! The material is interesting and the course is a very doable work-load.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in basic psychology.",
                "100%. Fantastic course and AMAZING professors who honestly care about you. I felt so supported and cared for",
                "Yes, I learned a lot of stuff that I found really interesting. I never had a strong interest in psychology but now I would like to take another psychology course in the future.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! It's a prerequisite for the psychology (and possibly other) majors, but, even if you don't need to take it, it's worth it. It's a somewhat low stress class (at least during COVID times) that teaches very interesting material. A win win!",
                "Yes, definitely take this course",
                "Yes definitely, regardless of major",
                "If you are interested in psychology, then yes. It is a good way to get yourself introduced to the concept and gives you a good idea of whether or not you will want to pursue more classes like it afterwards.",
                "It's a classic course that fulfills many requirements, and taking it with Professor Lazzaro was great.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking for a low-workload but highly enjoyable social science credit. The course content was simple yet very engaging and worth learning. Psychology is such an interesting filed and taking a survey class in it will will help you no matter what career path you end up pursuing. I also highly recommend taking this course with Professor Lazzaro. She made the best virtual lectures that I have seen this entire year and she has a friendly, bubbly personality which made class all the more enjoyable.",
                "Yes, this course is very interesting. I am always looking forward to this class.",
                "Yes, I think this was a relatively relaxed course that taught me a lot about psychology and was less stressful than my other classes.",
                "Anyone curious about psychology should take this class! Great introduction",
                "I would recommend this course because it is very informative but interesting and a great introduction to the field of psychology.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It was fairly easy to do well on assignments without going to lecture. This really put the responsibility of learning in the hands of the student, so you could get as much of as little as you wanted out of it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! I think that it is well-organized and sufficiently-taught for STEM and non-STEM students. I know a lot of STEM\/premed students who took it and enjoyed it, as well as humanities students that enjoyed it just as much! I would 100% recommend waiting until Prof. Stephanie Lazzaro teaches it again, as she is just such a ray of sunshine during lectures. This was not overly-challenging, and you don't have to put in much work beyond what is required in order to get a good grade:) Best of luck, and enjoy PSYC 110! I would definitely take it again!"
