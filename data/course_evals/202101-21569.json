Project designs were informed by historical design movements, which greatly helped my own work. Prof. Scott prioritized looking towards successful designs of the past, which improved my own work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the lectures were a bit slow-moving. Found myself watching on 1.25 speed occasionally. Perhaps having fewer lectures per week would be better."
