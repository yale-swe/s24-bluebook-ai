    "I learned so much about writing, from reverse outlining to clear and defendable theses to eloquent transitions and so much more. I also learned a lot about analysis and close reading of the novels we read. Finally, I feel that I got a lot better at writing with intent, and I feel much more confident in my ability to articulate my thoughts and analysis through writing.",
    "I became a better writer undoubtedly.",
    "My writing skills improved as I learned how to create an interesting essay with an arguable and novel thesis.",
    "I learned how to develop a claim, how to format an essay to make it more effective, as well as how to incorporate my own style into my writing.",
    "How to think more critically about texts and their relationship to the wider world around them.",
    "I learned how to better perform close readings, how to better develop a clear claim for a paper, and how to gauge the scope of the paper."

   "comments": [
    "I think the strengths of the course are the classes and the really conversational nature of the seminar. I also think that the one-on-one attention we got for revising and crafting our essays was a huge help. Finally, the curriculum and novel selection was really good, and followed a logical chronological and thematic order.\r\n\r\nClasses can also branch out into quite unrelated topics. We spent a lot of time talking about things like political theory, and the history of literature, and philosophy, in addition to deep analysis and conversations about the text. Sometimes, I found that some outside topics were less engaging than others. But other times, I found those outside topics even more engaging than the novel we were discussing. Of course, the more diverse the array of topics touched on becomes, the less likely it is that all students will remain highly interested and engaged. But I also think the range of outside sources and topics we touched on was a strength of the course. It's impossible to satisfy everyone...",
    "It was fantastic! I really loved the setup where we would discuss things.",
    "The biggest strengths and weakness of this course are the books. Most of the books are phenomenal and allow us to dive deep into their themes and meaning, however I felt that Robinson Crusoe, Wired Love, and Crudo were not very interesting and I didnt get much out of reading them even though they were relevant to the themes of the course.",
    "This course had an excellent professor who was always there to answer questions and help out students.\r\nI don't see any downsides so there is nothing I think needs improving.",
    "Strengths: fun topic and unique way to approach texts; small class size made for great student-teacher interaction. Weaknesses: none"

    "Yes! The books are all really interesting, the intersection between novels and technology is so interesting, and Professor Shechtman knows so much about what we're reading and brings a lot of interesting outside sources and knowledge to help us gain insight. I walked away from every class with a lot of useful insights, and a lot of unresolved thoughts as well. And of course you improve your writing a lot.",
    "Highly! It was phenomenal!",
    "Yes, overall the books are good and class is interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a great way to learn and improve your writing skills as well as challenging the mind intellectually.",
    "Absolutely! It was a very fun way to engage with literature",
    "I would recommend this course to another student looking to expand on their understanding of literary analysis."
