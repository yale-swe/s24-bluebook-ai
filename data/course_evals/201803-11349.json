So far, this has included getting a really good sense of the historiography on my subject (including library skills such as using WorldCat and requesting ILLs), conducting archival research, and distilling large amounts of information into a manageable argument.",

    "Prof Gitlin is the best",

    "Professor Perdue was a great advisor who helped me greatly in the process. He led me throughout my research, willing to discuss topics and eager to recommend new sources of material.",
    "I like how we have had deadlines along the way.",
    "Good structure to keep you on track for your thesis",
    "The History Department should stop giving seniors pointless milestones and leave it up to them to decide how to prepare for their senior thesis. Requirements like writing ten pages (without first requiring an outline) and a source evaluation are honestly somewhat infantilising to students who have already written long papers before and know their work style better than some guidebook. This course caused me a lot of unnecessary stress this semester.",
    "Professor Wrightson is incredible.",
    "Since there is not a seminar component to the history senior thesis, the assignment deadlines throughout the semester kept me on track for the year long project. I think a few email reminders throughout the semester to set up meetings with one's advisor on a semi regular basis would have been useful as I think those meetings were the most helpful part of the course during the fall semester.",
    "The annotated bibliography assignment came up before I felt like I had a really good sense of all the secondary material I was going to be using for my essay (I still don't) and as such it didn't seem that useful to me.",
    "Strengths: It teaches you to stay organized, work hard and conduct thorough research on a very interesting subject."
