                "The weekly lesson aspect of the course was really enjoyable and super helpful, and I would not trade my experience in lessons for the world. I will say that the lectures felt a bit empty at times, and some of the lecture topics weren't that helpful (listing lots of percussion instruments, specific string bowing techniques). A lot of that information could have been conveyed by sending the students the powerpoint ahead of time, and then we would have had more time to do other things in lecture.",
                "strengths: the weekly TA meetings are really helpful for the class assignments and for bouncing off ideas on your personal composition. some of the lectures, especially the ones about the different modes\/scales were pretty helpful. I enjoyed doing the class assignments like the dorian on F and the canon.\r\nweaknesses: this probably can't be changed but sitting in a lecture and paying attention for nearly two whole hours was difficult. I also wished we learned more theory.",
                "Strengths: a lot of liberty with your own composition, which allow creativity to grow. Also was very cool to listen to the works of fellow classmates.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes guest lectures could be a bit disengaging, especially if you were not interested in that particular sector of music.",
                "The weekly lessons are great! Dr. A is really fun! Some of the guests who come to talk to us feel like a distraction from the material",
                "Strengths: really interesting and an amazing opportunity to be creative (which is more rare than one might think), learned so much about how to actually be a composer and what it takes\r\nWeaknesses: can be extremely intimidating if you have never composed before or have relatively less theory knowledge because even though its Comp Seminar I, almost everyone has done some composition already, \r\n\r\nSomething that is both a strength and a weakness is that It is very self motivated and self paced, which I enjoyed but others may not",
                "The lessons are easily the best part of this class. I got extremely specific feedback on timing, formatting, musical ideas, orchestration, etc.\r\n\r\nThe lectures about instruments and music theory sometimes felt a bit slow, although the reference slides were helpful.",
                "Weekly composition lessons are amazing, guest presentations with the School of Music composition students were always super interesting and enjoyable. Lectures on the course material (mainly focused on pandiatonicism, studying different instruments) introduced me to plenty of new compositional tools, but I wish there were more musical examples (or a deeper discussion of those techniques) so that we could see how they could be employed. (For instance, we would be presented with the notes and chords found in the octatonic scale, but wouldn't cover any music that uses it or know what makes it interesting\/useful).",
                "The lessons were great! I think it'd be nice if the discussions on our projects in class were a little more constructive. People don't often know what types of comments and it's not always very helpful. Sometimes it is, though, which makes me think that some structure would help a lot."

If you just casually want to \"compose music\" with no ideas of what that music might look like, maybe not - it takes a lot of independent thought and ideas to actually compose your own piece of music and the class really isn't designed to give you those ideas",
                "Yes, if you already have done a bit of composing and would like to keep working on writing music. Much of the growth I did in this class was independent and self-motivated, so I probably wouldn't recommend MUSI 320 to someone who does not (or will not) choose to compose on her own time.",
                "Yes! Weekly composition lessons were the highlight of my semester, I had an amazing TA who was a great fit for my compositional style and I felt like I came out of every single lesson with thoughtful feedback and a new tidbit of wisdom. Composition exercises were always helpful with figuring out how to employ the material we'd learn in lecture, and the final group project of scoring a movie scene was lots of fun. However, I felt that I had less freedom with the kind of semester-long project I could work on compared to Comp II (project requirements are more strict, and the composition exercises take away time\/energy from working on your main project. Not necessarily a critique, just a difference between Comp I and II). My only gripe is that Dr. A can sometimes be a little blunt in her evaluations (she's not afraid to tell you she thinks your submission is bad). As someone who is still pretty new to composing, hearing too much of it can be a bit discouraging, and made writing more difficult and stressful. If you really care, though, it'll certainly push you.",
                "Yes, if they want to write music! This course forces you to do that, and quite a bit of it. For me, being told to write music is the only way I can do enough of it to really improve, and told I was."
