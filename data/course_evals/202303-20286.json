After all, that's the primary reason why first years take seminarsfor enriching discussions with their peers. Yet, this course was far from that, with the whole class being in lecture format with little engagement. \r\n\r\nThis course (and topic) has so much potential to be taught in an intellectually stimulating way. However, the course falls way short of that. The curriculum needs to be revamped, the format of the course needs to be modified to facilitate engagement from students, and the content needs to be refined.",
                "True to its name, I appreciated the scope addressed with modern technology and public policy. I think this course is a useful foundation to understand technological changes both inside the classroom and out. I think the lecture format was the best way to teach this course, and Professor Prober's handouts and videos were good supplemental material. Sometimes, I would have appreciated more international examples (outside of mainly Europe and China), but I understand the US-specific focus."

                "Overall, I would not recommend the course to studentshere's why: Sure, the course may be compelling to students who see the low workload and need the science credit. However, if you're interested in maximizing the level of intellectual engagement that you derive from your Yale experience, then do not take the course. The course is not engaging (students often fall asleep during class or just look at their phones), and the course content is unnecessarily convoluted relative to the problem sets (the professor encourages students to GOOGLE the answers to problem sets and cite their sources, which is an ineffective way to learn).",
                "Yes. The liked the scope, workload, and Professor's Probers lecture style. For a non-stem major, I felt that I learned things about emerging technologies and public policy that I can take with me later on. I have learned more about Yale environmental policies that I imagined I might, and I appreciated Professor Prober's emphasis on that."
