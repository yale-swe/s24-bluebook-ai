   "comments": [
    "My writing skills improved greatly, and I gained a lot of experience grappling with difficult reading material. When I entered the course, I had a very basic understanding of what \"American exceptionalism\" was. My understanding is nowhere nuanced, complicated, and interesting, all because of this course.",
    "My writing truly improved with this course. I learned to better structure my papers and have a clearer focus for my arguments. This course also helped me develop my reading and overall comprehension skills.",
    "Ability to write argumentatively",
    "Methods to analyze texts on their own terms, precise word choice in research essays",
    "My writing, arguing, and arrangement of a paper has improved significantly. I feel comfortable writing multiple page papers. Also, I have a better understanding of American exceptionalism, its origins, and how it has effected our society and culture.",
    "During this course, I engaged with a variety of questions surrounding the notion of American Exceptionalism. Through analyzing texts by authors such as Tocqueville, Marx, Hartz, Roediger, and Turner, I learned not only how to engage with challenging pieces of writing, but also how to think about different arguments and put the authors in conversation with one another. I also learned about the central components of a well-structured argument, and how I can apply this structure to strengthen my writing.",
    "This course was very interesting. I have never really studied the rise of America especially looking deep at the economy how it functions now and how it functioned earlier.",
    "I learned about the history of the liberal order in the United States, and how it was put into place. I learned about contemporary neoliberalism through readings from various historical and sociological thinkers throughout history and applied them to the American project. Also some things about writing.",
    "This course truly taught me how to properly write a college research paper. It taught me the value of really considering what you want to say in your paper and making sure you know the motive behind what you are writing before you type a word. It also taught me the value of having multiple drafts and having multiples sets of eyes on your paper to make sure it is the best it can be. In high school, I would usually only hand in my first draft, but this course taught me that to ensure a good paper, you need multiple drafts and multiple proofreads. This course also taught me it is okay to scrap an idea and start from scratch if your original idea is not working because more often than not, your second or even third idea will be better. In addition, this course also taught me how to closely read difficult texts and how to consider them so that I truly understand the meaning and what the author was trying to say. I also learned that I really enjoy the subjects we were learning."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course include the amount of reading and writing required of students, as it allows them to be deeply engaged in the material and discussions without being an overwhelming amount.",
    "This course was well-organized and interesting. The readings were engaging and difficult, and this made for fantastic class discussions and writing assignments. The structure to the class made sense, and I don't think there was anything specific that needed to be improved upon.",
    "I enjoyed the format of this course, which was mostly student conversation, but thought that with some of the more difficult readings it was hard for us to have meaningful insight. More structured debates might have helped this.",
    "Weaknesses are clarity early on in course\r\nLots of strengths",
    "I thought the course was well-structured; I wouldn't change it",
    "I think one of the main strengths of this course is the assigned readings. I liked how they touched on a variety of disciplines, such as political science, literature, and economics. I also appreciated that while each reading contributed to our discussion in a distinct and significant way, many of the readings analyzed overlapping questions, which I think enhanced the seminar by allowing us to compare different perspectives on similar themes.",
    "This course was great. I just think Im not totally interested in the topic. The only suggestion I have is that the course description be more clear that most readings and discussions are from and economic perspective.",
    "I would almost go as far to say that this course should be mandatory for all students at this university. The way Prof. McGowan chose and structured the readings and discussions was absolutely phenomenal, and he presented an extremely well-tuned picture of America which facilitated engagement from the class in many ways. This was by far my favorite course that I have taken at this university, and I do hope that it will be brought back in the future, as this is the knowledge that we all need to have. Additionally, the instructor was very effective in providing feedback on students' writing, and generally structured group editing and discussions about writing in ways conducive to our learning. The thinkers and historians that we read could have had a bit more context about who they were\/are, and maybe some of the group editing discussions could have been curated a bit better with regards to helping people find the meaning and direction of their papers, rather than nitpicking over spelling.",
    "A strength of the course was all the reading we had; I believe they really built on top of each other and gave great insight into the question of American exceptionalism. I also really enjoyed the discussions we had, especially when everyone understood the text really well and had something to say so the discussion moved organically. I also enjoyed all the help we received during the writing process. It was nice having someone to read your work and bounce ideas off of, whether it be with a fellow student or the professor. It definitely helped my writing to have workshops and feedback. I think many weaknesses of the course were resolved by the end of the semester; for example, having workshops on google documents rather than paper copies was very helpful. In addition, I think a weakness was that some of the readings, getting to the end of the course, were very redundant. That may simply be a consequence of only reading the introductions to longer works, but it seemed that many were making the same or similar claims. I think it would have been interesting to read more controversial works that talked about topics we were more familiar with as to have more lively conversations."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student because this topic was very interesting and thought provoking. The range of materials we read allowed for thoughtful discussions that were always enjoyable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student -- it was interesting, engaging, and transformative.",
    "I would recommend this course because of the improvements to my writing. Many of the readings were also very interesting and gave me new outlooks on the topics we were studying.",
    "Yes; interesting, targeted subject material with a fair amount of essay-writing involved",
    "Yes! In this course, you have intellectual debates of some of the most obscure topics. The first half of the semester can be rough, but when you make it past Tocqueville, it gets really fun. You are able to relate the difficult, past readings to modern day things. It is really fun.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I really enjoyed the discussions we had in class. I particularly liked that we first looked at American Exceptionalism through a historical and political lens, but then began to examine how American Exceptionalism manifests today. I also appreciated the ability to choose my own topic for the research paper, because it allowed me to conduct further research on the aspect of American Exceptionalism that I found most interesting.",
    "yes but I would be clear that the readings are tricky.",
    "Yes. It is our highest calling as students in an elite institution to understand the nature of America and the racial and economic exploitation that it has engendered over 400 years. This stuff is extremely important, because this course helped all of us understand our identity as Americans (or international students in America) and why all of it matters.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they enjoy political science. As an English class, it truly did improve my writing and my writing habits, while the professor was very good at facilitating readings and was very flexible. I would recommend English 114 in general to any student, just to make sure it is in a topic that you enjoy, or else it will be terrible to read so much on a topic you do not even like."
