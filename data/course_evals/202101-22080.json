The readings were incredibly insightful and the class material is great. Highly recommend, even if you arent a history major.",

I also learned so much about South African history -- I thought this course was specifically going to be focusing on apartheid, but we learned so much more about pre-apartheid era as well as nation-building after apartheid was dismantled. Professor Magaziner is also super engaging and I highly recommend this history course.",
                "I learned a lot about South African history and politics, and definitely improved by reading and writing skills.",
                "This course introduced South African history wonderfullyeach lecture was packed with thought-provoking content, substance, analysis and argumentation. Prof. Magaziner expertly drew out themes central to SA historyIndigeneity, inequality, activism, colonialism, segregationbut also world history. The selection of primary and secondary readings was powerful and some of the best books Ive read this year.",
                "This course covers a history of South Africa, mainly focused on the 19th and 20th centuries. We worked with a variety of primary and secondary courses (one of the paper assignments was a primary source paper) and our readings included works of fictions (e.g. novels), which added an interesting dimension to the course.",
                "I learned about South African history, including some history from as much as a thousand years ago but mostly since the arrival of Europeans (due to preserved writing). Major themes included colonialism, apartheid, land ownership, systems of labor, dispossession, education, and religion.",
                "In addition to learning about the history of South Africa, from indigenous habitation, to colonialism, to mass protest and resilience, I have learned how to become a better history student in this class. Professor Magaziner constantly questioned how we perceive history, as well as the role it plays and the danger it can elicit when it is politicized and manipulated. In South Africa, these questions became particularly pertinent as we studied the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the task of the post-apartheid state to document, confront, and attempt to reverse and learn from the country's legacy of institutional racism. South Africa is a vital country to study, and it presents telling insights for the United States' own battle against systemic racism and historical revisionism.",

                "A History of South Africa was well structured to teach several centuries of South African history in a condensed manner. The post-lecture hot takes were a good way to make students engage with the material of each lecture. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course was that I found several of the readings incredibly difficult to find online. It was difficult to contribute to section a couple weeks because I did not have some of the relevant readings.",

                "Strengths of this course are Professor Magaziner!!",
                "I loved really every aspect of this course. The lectures were engaging, the papers were flexible so that you could really engage with the material you wanted to in the course. The only thing is I wish there was perhaps secondary sources to help reiterate some of the things we had discussed in lecture. Every week we covered a lot of material and the books that we read for section were fascinating but it would have been great to have some text to help ground/remind us of what we had learned.",
                "This was a fabulous class, I can't recommend it enough. Really, really excellent class.",
                "Strengths: incredibly engaging lectures, highly organized structure/syllabus (helpful for planning ahead), great reading selections (complete with required and suggested readings), great TAs, helpful Q&A breaks during lectures, bi-weekly post-lecture hot-takes that reinforce our understanding/analysis of lectures\r\nWeaknesses: I can hardly think of any... this was an all-around wonderful class. Perhaps it would have been helpful to receive more feedback from Prof. Magaziner on our hot-takes and essays.",
                "Strengths: Professor Magaziner is an excellent lecturer. His storytelling ability makes his lectures engaging and a pleasure to listen to/watch. Additionally, I enjoyed the two writing assignments; both assignments gave enough choice to students to choose an area they wanted to explore more. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked the hot takes to be addressed in section more often. I think there were some interesting points that students brought up that would have made excellent discussion material for section.",
                "The lectures were probably the strongest part of the class. Professor Magaziner delivers lectures that are so clear that he might not even need slides, though (unlike some other history professors) he does have slides, mainly for showing visual components to his lectures. His lectures felt like a story, rather than a list of facts, and it was always easy to pay attention. \r\n\r\nI thought the reading was a little uneven week to week, as some weeks there were many readings and others only had a few.",
                "The strengths were Professor Magaziner's lectures and the wonderful teaching team. The support that we received and the nuanced responses that our instructors gave helped us become better history students in the process of navigating South Africa's complex yet critical story. The hot-takes also helped us work through our thoughts directly after lecture, and provided a fascinating discussion forum for us to engage with our classmates. The weaknesses of this course were not a function of the course, but rather, the product of a busy semester: often, our 50-minute discussion sections felt like too short of a time to properly engage with all of our materials!",

The hot-take requirements also pushed me to think more deeply about lectures amid whirlwind of my other zooms.",

Although it was regrettable not to be in the same classroom each week, the lectures transferred well to Zoom.

                "Yes! This is the best History lecture I have taken at Yale, and I am History major. Professor Magaziner goes beyond just discussing events and figures like some History lectures and really dives into the cultural movements and intellectual history that influenced South Africa.",

Each lecture is delivered expertly and framed as a story. In this way, even with the vastness of South African history, this courses nuanced history is coherent. The prof. also centers the voices of African South Africans, from artists and writers to activists. Go for it!",
                "Certainly! South African history deals with some important topics: race, colonialism, war, violence, etc. At the same time, one will also learn about the rich cultural history of South/Southern Africa. Additionally, this course gives students opportunities to explore primary sources in an independent manner an important skill to have as a historian (or anyone, for that matter)",
                "Definitely! This is a very approachable history class that is great even for somebody who isn't a history major. The subject matter is really interesting, and contains details relevant not just to South Africa but also many other places. The lectures are interesting even many weeks in, and the sections are pretty good too. The readings are very relevant; the readings for this class were probably the most interesting readings for any class I've been in. There were only two assignments, and they didn't take too long, so the workload (aside from the reading) was very low.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. South Africa is a complex yet beyond important country about which to learn. Moreover, Professor Magaziner's lectures effectively encapsulated a myriad of interpretations of the country's story. Never before have I encountered a history course that so fervently tried to analyze the past from every perspective while recognizing the limits of its own scope. Every class is, as Professor Magaziner stated on the first day of the course, \"a\" history, and his discussions of historiography in the context of South Africa's story were vital discussions for new and veteran history students alike. This class made me a better student and, I hope, a better critical participant of the world. In my opinion, it is a must-take here at Yale.",
