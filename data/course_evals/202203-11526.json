                "One of the strengths of this course was the order of the curriculum. During the latter units, I found it natural to reference the topics we had discussed in the first unit and the readings we had already done. One way the course stands to be improved is the implementation of tv and music video clips throughout each unit. In the second unit, we discussed \"Pretty Hurts\" by Beyonce, and one of the most interesting comparisons we made in the class, in my opinion, were comparing Beyonce's words (written for and from the perspective of a 2013 woman) to those of Naomi Wolf in \"A Beauty Myth\" (written for and from the perspective of a 1990's woman). More integration like this between the older books and poems we were reading in the later units and the music and media of modern-day culture should be added to the course."

                "Absolutely loved this class, please take it. I found the topics ranging from beauty standards to plastic surgery all to be so interesting. Sophie is a great instructor and super understanding. For your first English course, I think its a great class to start with.",
