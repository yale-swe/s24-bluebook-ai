                "The course was extremely well organized and set up to let us do research and also practice writing reports and presentations. Another strength was having the speakers come in.",
                "Strengths: the small class size really facilitated personalized feedback from\/discussion with peers which was really valuable. Also, each of the \"milestones\", or assignments that we had in some way improved my understanding of my project or improved my skills in talking\/writing about it (although they were a lot of work). I also loved hearing from three (unless I'm forgetting one) people who came to talk with us, they each offered such a unique perspective for us to learn from. And of course my project itself was something I was really interested in and looked forward to working on every week. \r\n\r\nWeakness: can't really think of any...!"

                "YES, if you have a good project and you find a good mentor! I really enjoyed my project so I looked forward to working on it every week, which was important. However, I will say that producing work I was proud of was a BIG time commitment, so I would make sure you're ready for that and have time set aside several times a week to work on the project. Weekly meetings with my mentor were critical in keeping me on track. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the assignments themselves, feedback I got in this class by far exceeds that I've received in any other STEM class, and we received it very soon after the assignment was submitted\/presented which allowed for immediate implementation of the suggested changes. The guidelines and expectations for each milestone were very clear, so I knew exactly what was expected of me and how I could achieve that. Prof Bennett's expectations were high, which pushed me to put forward work I was proud of. She was always happy to review an assignment before the deadline to provide additional feedback."
