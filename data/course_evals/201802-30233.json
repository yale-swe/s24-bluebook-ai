    "Learned about the American political framework.\r\n\r\nLearned how to employ analytical skills with the goal of assessing political phenomenons.\r\n\r\nI learned exactly what I expected to learn",
    "-Better writing techniques for academic research papers, as well as argumentative essays (both for academia and in general)\r\n-Indights into the comparison of foreign governments to the US, in terms of government structure and democratic ideas \r\n-How to work effectively as a research team \r\n-How to identify key ideas in complex and lengthy academic articles",
    "Brief idea of American politics and the framework of the government operation.",
    "The ability to write essays and proposals, the ability to think independently and the skill of presentation.",
    "I learned about American political institutions.",
    "I learnt how american government works. Write essays under a lot of pressure. Exercise my memory with the reading quizzes."

   "comments": [
    "No weaknesses overall.\r\n\r\nThe teacher was always available to give feedback and guidance to the students.\r\n\r\nThe quizzes at the beginning of each class were an excellent incentive to push the students to do the assigned readings.\r\n\r\nClass activities that involved student participation made the class interesting and engaging.",
    "Strength:\r\n-Types of writing assignments \r\n-Good textbook\r\n-Seminar style allowed for everyone to contribute to discussion \r\n-Daily quizzes held students accountable to do the readings \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-Academic articles were too lengthy for an intro class (even though the main idea pertained to the class, most of the articles were hard to read, and I ended up relying on the summaries for a lot of them)\r\n-Group activities didnt really seem to help me have a better grasp on the material, but something similar should be kept for future classes, as 2hrs is a long period of time to have a constant seminar discussion",
    "It contains a lot of contents and we really learned a lot. But in the same time, it was too condensed. And a more organized schedule may help to enhance the class.",
    "The course was very interactive, but I found that some of the readings were very niche and didn't contribute to my overall understanding of political institutions.",
    "I think the reading were to much to manage. Take up many hours to read them and were hard to understand (specially if you had never had a political science class). If you are an international student, it is definitely a challenge."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to \r\nEveryone, regardless of their interest in the subject.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge and analytical skills one could gain from this class are essential for the everyday life of a civically involved citizen.",
    "Yes (in most cases)\r\n-if they are very knowledgeable in politics (for example, 5 on AP Gov test) AND a really good writer, I would hope that the 5 would allow them exemption from this class, as the depth of material is similar to that of an AP class WITH THE EXCEPTION of the writing component of PLSC113, which was very rigorous and did a good job at making me a better writer \r\n-I would recommend this course to any other student besides one who has a deep knowledge of American politics and is a great academic and argumentative writer",
    "Certainly I will recommend to another student. Course is well organized, instructor has a good sense of humor, class discussion is highly engaged. Its awesome.",
    "Definitely yes. The class is very informative and the atmosphere is very good."
