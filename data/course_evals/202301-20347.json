                "Developing skills in translating academic Hebrew, practiced my spoken Hebrew to some extent, and learned more advanced grammatical structures",
                "I learned an immense ton of really helpful academic Hebrew vocabulary, learned how to guess when encountering difficult Hebrew phrases and even sentences, felt a ton more comfortable following someone speaking really fast in Hebrew, and overall just accelerated my grasp of this beautiful language!"

                "This course has a very manageable workload, and the ability to choose the article you translate so it's in your own area of interest is a definite plus. It's important to keep to a regular work schedule, because the work is due twice a week. If you do all the work and put time into learning from previous corrections, you won't have worry, though - this class is very much about getting out what you put in. There were a few events and Hebrew language tables that were mandatory to attend, but there were options if you had direct conflicts.  I do wish there had been more advance notice of some of the events, because it made it hard to plan my week sometimes.",
                "The course requires high engagement, which means you are bound to improve dramatically by the end of the course. The workload can be overwhelming at times.",
                "Excellent course, taught very well by an excellent professor",
                "In all honesty, I found this class -- and especially the translation exercise -- to be absolutely fascinating. It was challenging at first to struggle with an unfamiliar stream of words and try to piece together their meanings from context clues alone. But as I persisted, I found that my patience grew and my reading speed increased considerably. I began to feel much more confident in the connections I was making between different words, and I was amazed at the progress I was making in training my linguistic muscles. As I continued to work on the translation, I found myself appreciating more and more the different ways in which an English translation could capture the essence of a Hebrew text. I spent a lot of time wrestling with the choice of the most concise and most trustworthy translation, trying to strike a balance between staying true to the original meaning and making the text accessible to English speakers. It was a challenging task, but one that I found deeply rewarding. \r\n\r\nOverall, I feel like this class has been incredibly beneficial for my understanding and translation skills. It's given me the opportunity to practice working with challenging elements like context, root, structure, guesswork, and binyanim, and has helped me to develop a better understanding of how to tackle these elements in future translations. Looking forward, I aim to be less reliant on Rav-Milim, learn all the connecting words ( ), and improve my out-loud reading speed. I'm really excited to see how my skills will continue to develop over the course of next year, and I feel confident that this exercise has given me a solid foundation to build on."

You don't have to be a native speaker or heritage speaker of Hebrew, or a Hebrew/Jewish Studies/Torah-Talmud scholar, to get a lot out of the class, and because everyone has their own special project that they are working on it is much easier for the class to meet you at whatever level you're at. You will not get a large amount of practice in Hebrew conversation (although all the classes are conducted in Hebrew, you end up mostly talking about grammar and translation), so if you're wanting to practice your speaking skills this isn't the best class for that. But I really enjoyed it and it definitely strengthened an area of my Hebrew that was a bit weak so I do recommend it!",
