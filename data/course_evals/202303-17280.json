International finance is a fascinating and complex field.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Before every exam, it felt like kind of a surprise what we were going to be tested on. In particular, the final exam that covered lectures 7-13 was almost exclusively on Lecture 7. This made studying in advance somewhat futile. Only after the review session (2 days prior to the exam), could we really study effectively.",
