   "comments": [
    "Knowledge of important political philosophers who have theorized on questions such as the morality of civil disobedience, violence, and revolution.",
    "A thorough understanding of important political actors decision making in relation to their moral frameworks; nominally about political action but mostly as a derivative of ethics and meta ethics",
    "Various justifications for violence in emancipatory struggles and civic duty.",
    "Truly a fantastic class--I learned a great deal both on how to analyze philosophical works but also how to articulate my analysis.",
    "I gained applicable knowledge of the intersection of morality and politics, both in reality and theoretically, throughout time.",
    "Learned a lot about political philosopy",
    "The philosophical and practical implications of costly personal decisions in politics",
    "This was a beautiful mix of a lecture and a seminar which was really helpful in dissecting the texts we read. I feel like I really grew in my understanding of the texts and got really interesting background as well.",
    "I learned sooooo much from this course but that was to be expected since prof Kapustin is a living legend and genius.",
    "This excellent course gave me insight into the really difficult problems that moral theory encounters in the realm of political action by moving through some of the most influential political actors and thinkers of the world. I gained insight into political theory as it relates to the realm of action, which is something that is hard to find in (largely theoretical) moral philosophy courses. \r\n\r\nI also learned that I had a deep interest in political theory and politics, which is something that was revealed to me through the courses unique study of philosophical theory and practical politics in tandem.",
    "Extremely valuable input on readings on political violence and civil disobedience. Excellent lectures that provided close reading to selected passages.",
    "This course was a great insight into the the areas in which morality and politics interact with each other, and the tensions created by their differing ends, as well as the attempts at their reconciliation. This includes the ability think of moral considerations within the framework of political theory, and of political considerations within the framework of moral thinking, as in applied ethics. Personally, one of the insights that I gained after taking this course was that while it is indeed possible to reconcile moral and political aims, such as non-violence and emancipation, but these reconciliations inevitably come at the cost of restrictions on political means."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The seminar is both instructive in providing understanding and context for the readings as well as offering opportunity to discuss them in depth.",
    "Strengths: Everything. The readings and the professor's lectures are truly amazing. \r\nWeakness: That we fall behind schedule, and feel rushed through certain sections.",
    "Some of the readings were really dense, long and difficult. It was often difficult to derive the meanings from the texts. To that end, class discussions were great and the profs explanations were EXTREMELY helpful and made for thought provoking discussions and breakdowns of interesting ideas.",
    "Strengths were by far the professor--Kapustin is incredible and very passionate. The readings on the syllabus were engaging but never overwhelming. No weakness",
    "The class was a very well structured seminar. One weakness may be that it was a relatively large seminar but I dont think that was such a big detriment to the quality of discussions.",
    "Boris is the greatest strength",
    "I really enjoyed the balance between the lecture style parts of classes and the discussion halves. It was a very good balance as it provided a lot of information and background which we were able to use to shape our discussions.",
    "The course is excellent at representing incredible political actors and theorists in an impartial (sometimes reverend) light. This, along with Professor K's incredible insights and moderation, makes this course very good at delivering iridescent insights into the world of politics. The course is great at teaching students about resistance movements throughout history, and in general it is a great course to gain some perspective of the ways in which status quo is maintained, and more importantly, how it is shattered by shrewd politics and underlining philosophical world views. Great course to learn about revolutions, political action driven by strong moral principles, strong political leaders in history and some theory of civil disobedience, violence vs non-violence in politics and so on. \r\n\r\nThe course has no weaknesses as such. The readings are significant but deeply illuminating. Perhaps the course could be improved by giving students additional early assignments that can either be compiled for the final paper, or just to get students thinking about their own narratives for writing the final paper so that they can produce even better papers and absorb material throughout the course more because they are thinking about these papers through the semester.",
    "Strengths: excellent lecturer, good material, good seminar discussions \r\nWeaknesses: we could not complete all the material listed in the syllabus",
    "The readings were exceptionally interesting and helpful in framing different approaches to the question of the tension of morality and politics. There were perhaps too much good material and if possible, more class time could be allocated to covering all of the material."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended, if you are even remotely interested in political philosophy. It is a very practical approach that opens your eyes to the useful, applicable political philosophy of the actors.",
    "Yes, anyone who thinks seriously about the moral basis of political action should be exposed to the ideas discussed in this class",
    "Yes, incredibly interesting look into civil disobedience, political violence, and other \"moral choices\" made by philosophers and practitioners.",
    "Yes, any class with Professor Kapustin will rock your socks off. He is such a thoughtful person whose passion for political philosophy is contagious. He is capable of motivating everyone in the class to thoroughly learn the material, and class discussions are so interesting.",
    "Absolutely with out a doubt--take this class if you want to be intellectually challenged. The work load is not that high and Kapustin is a fair grader.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is curious in the subject as it is a lot of reading.",
    "Yes highly recommend if students are willing to engage with the text",
    "Yes! Must take",
    "Yes it is so wonderful to learn from professor Kapustin",
    "Yes yes yes please take this course! Professor Kapustin is the smartest professor i have encountered on this campus but he lectures in such a relatable way. Absolutely take this class!",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course because Prof. K. is an excellent moderator and lecturer and there is a lot of value to be gained in doing the readings and in attending the classes. This course offers wonderful perpective to anyone interested in learning about politics, political history, or moral philosophy from both philosophical and practical lenses.",
    "Definitely. Professor Kapustin is remarkably knowledgeable but very approachable.",
    "Yes, particularly if the issue of ethical political actions is a compelling question for a student."
