Because of our regular class readings and discussions, I was able to hear the viewpoints of my peers, which helped me develop a better understanding of the reading in ways that I had not considered before. As a result of this better reading, I was able to incorporate my understanding into my writing. As I continued to write, I got more feedback, which helped me improve my writing every subsequent draft.",
                "This was great course to explore non-fiction writing. I became a better writer  throughout the year and enjoyed all of the assignments.",

                "I learned how to develop my own voice and how to do several different categories of creative nonfiction writing. Through the assigned readings, I learned what things to do and what things not to do.",
                "I learned how to become a better writer by using more techniques to enhance my writing and make my story clearer to the reader. I also\r\nLearned to trust myself more in my writing."

            "comments": [
                "A strength of this course is that it makes you write a lot. However, I feel that I could write better essays if I had more time.",
                "The strength was the essays. I really enjoyed writing them and building my voice on the page. I don't have any weaknesses that come to mind.",
                "it's an AMAZING course and I'm telling all my friends to take it. I read in past reviews that many students tought it was their favorite Yale course and I can see why... The class discussions are always very chill and the environment is relaxed so I didn't feel stressed when discussing the readings. The discussions, however, could sometimes be a little deeper and stimulating as sometimes the professor allowed/stimulated very general reflections that weren't always very deep. I love the prompts, and the readings were also great, though sometimes they were all sad readings one after the other. I didn't like the Thanksgiving break reading project... it was pretty useless and not stimulating and added unnecessary work to a much needed break.",
                "This is a great course. I didn't think that I would enjoy it as much as I did, but I really loved seeing everyone's different writing styles and it was incredible improving my writing so quick. Strengths: Pam gives great comments, each unit is supported by lots of essay examples, and the in-class editing/feedback sessions were invaluable. Weaknesses: The only weakness was that there was work assigned over the October and Thanksgiving breaks.",
                "I think a big strength is having the peer review sessions. It gives the writer a chance to see what their classmates think about their topic and what they should keep and what they can improve on. I think one thing that could be changed, and we did this towards the end, is to comment on everyones essay, but only write a response to one persons essay.",

                "Yes. I really enjoyed this course and believe that it has made me a better writer.",
                "Yes, it is a great way to fulfill your writing requirement and become a better writer. Most of the assignments and class discussions are fun and enjoyable.",
                "I keep recommending it to all my friends, a Yale must take! You learn to write creatively about your experience, a personally meaningful place, about someone else, about some cultural artifact and also with humour! The prompts are super fun and they allow for a lot of freedom and growth. I also love that we got feedback for all our essays, and the workshops were always super fun.",
                "Definitely!!! I think that anyone could benefit from this course. This class really gave me new confidence in myself as a more creative writer. Prior to this class, I had only written academic papers or science articles, but this class has made me want to write much more in the future. I'm even thinking of publishing one of my pieces from this semester.",
                "Yes. If you like non fiction and writing about personal experiences, this is a great writing class to take.",
                "Yes definitely! In order to get a lot out of the course, you have to put in the work. But if you are willing to do that, I think it's a great writing credit and introduction to English at Yale. The workshops and professor feedback are very helpful, and you will undoubtedly end the semester with lots of essays you are proud of."
