There's a lot of interaction between each of the thinkers and the course provides an almost complete survey of European philosophy from Descartes onwards. I feel like I have a really strong grasp on how western philosophy has evolved since the enlightenment.",
                "I enjoyed DS Philosophy immensely. I'm considering being a philosophy major now. It encouraged me to think rigorously, read closely, and most importantly, to talk over that which I'm thinking about with other people. I got a very solid cursory knowledge of the vast western canon of philosophy, which is fun. I learned how to write a good philosophy paper (I think), and it was one of those classes that got me thinking about a lot of things a lot."

                "Big fan of the readings, but the discussion sections sometimes strayed away from the assigned author's works. I didn't really mind that, but some might.",
                "Pretty much everything on the syllabus felt essential, except perhaps for Conway and Princess Elisabeth. I did feel that some important philosophers weren't covered though. Having Spinoza, Hegel, Wittgenstein, and Camus on the syllabus would have been great. Bertrand Russell would be good too, but his work might be relatively inaccessible for an introductory class. In general, I think some of the philosophers should have been contextualized better in lecture. We really only discussed Fear and Trembling as a religious work and didn't touch on its existentialist implications. I never really figured out why Leibniz's Monadology is considered anything more than a weird and arbitrary way of understanding the world. I wish Anscombe's impact on virtue ethics had been more fleshed out as well.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings, manageable quantity of reading relative DS lit imo, frequently fosters great seminar conversation, papers are fun to write\r\nWeaknesses: It's tough to grasp all of the ideas on first read, frequently seminar needs more instruction than it gets because the ideas are difficult."
