                "Strengths: Precise lectures, straightforward expectations in the testing responses, light reading assignments, 2 dropped quizzes, amazing peer tutors, no psets!\r\nWeaknesses: Can be overwhelming to orient yourself on how to prepare for the class (ie active recall is much more effective, but you need to hold yourself accountable and not just skim thru slides), creating a research proposal can have more clarity (esp on the latter assignments with methodology and revisions) for those who lack experience writing one/writing a genetics proposal\r\nImprovement:",
                "Lecture slides were overwhelming at times but overall helpful in understanding the course.",
                "This course goes over a lot of content in a short period of time. There are weekly 15 minute quizzes that you need to study for very hard in order to get a good grade. I did not like the way that the class is taught. The slides were very confusing and hard to understand.",
                "This course covered a lot of ground and had the most interesting content in the intro bio sequence thus far. However, the course squandered its potential by favoring quantity over quality. It was astonishing how much guesswork my friends and I had to put in outside of class, just figuring out what happened during lecture. The professor breezed through so much content that the burden was shifted on us in unreasonable ways. I am not suggesting that we should not have to put in work outside of class. Rather, I am suggesting that we were never afforded the baseline knowledge to be able to study the content in a productive manner. \"You should really go over these slides\" became a stale refrain by the end of the course.",
                "The material was very engaging and interesting but one weakness was the difficulty level of the assessments. All of our quizzes had a mean of between 50-70 and that is very low in my opinion.",
                "Strengths: homework assignments inspired independent thinking and helped students learn valuable scientific writing skills \r\nWeaknesses: vast amounts of material covered in lectures",
                "Strengths: the material itself is fascinating. Genetics and development are foundational topics in the study of biology and living systems, and are two areas in particular that I enjoy.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the examinations were difficult, hard to prepare for and overall a negative experience. Many students struggled with their format and how much time went into studying each week for the quizzes. Also, the professor was hard to follow during lecture, so oftentimes I had to teach myself the material outside of class, detracting from time I could be devoting to studying or to other classes.",
                "Classes are boring, hard to keep focus. But everything is reviewed multiple times and am able to understand a lot of topics.",
                "The information and content is pretty interesting. Professor Zhong is quite nice.  I thought the format of testing through the quizzes and tests were poor and didn't actually help me learn the content.",
                "Strengths: content is interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- content not well taught or explained, far too complicated for us to have been teaching ourselves (yet this is what we had to do to succeed)\r\n- quizzes assessed whether you could parse together the exact response they were looking for as opposed to whether you understood the material; questions were worded strangely, grading often came down to one word\r\n- discussion sections were unhelpful in terms of helping us understand important material\r\n- work load was ridiculous considering we are all taking 4 other classes - between teaching myself the content, studying for the quizzes and spending hours on the homework assignments, this class consumed far too much of my time for a 0.5 credit class",
                "While concepts were reiterated in lecture, I found the sequence of the information presented to be confusing.",
                "Weaknesses are many, but they are mainly that the content is clearly not well-organized, the instructor is not a good teacher (although an amazing researcher), and that the structure of the course is demanding in a way that stresses you out with much work but does not really make you learn anything eventually. I genuinely hope that this was taken into consideration in grade curving.",
                "The strengths of this course were Professor Zhong and his slides that were incredibly informative. The \"weakness\" is that the quizzes can be difficult and you don't have enough time to think through the questions.",
                "It's hard to identify many strengths of this course in its structure. The main strength would be that it sealed the deal that I do not want to study MCDB at Yale. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, there are many. I love biology and genetics was my favorite section of AP Biology. Despite the poor previous reviews for the class, I entered hoping to be pleasantly surprised and to learn something new about genetics. Instead, the learning environment was cold, uninviting, and devoid of much feedback on how to improve. When we did poorly as a class on quizzes (16/25 average ranges), the professor suggested we weren't \"understanding his questions correctly\" and were \"overthinking it too much.\" So, I resolved to focus on bigger-picture issues, only to be unpleasantly surprised by incredibly specific questions on the weekly quizzes. I think this course needs to be reworked from the ground up. Fundamentally, an introductory genetics class should spend more than a few slides on Mendelian genetics and punnet squares! We spent more time talking about the probability we would each contract cancer and different types of cancers/tumors than we did on basic genetics principles. Please please look over the slides, there are a number of them that are downright offensive, examples are putting a picture of a naked person to say, this person is phenotypically female or posing the question: \"Obesity: is it genetics or a lack of will\" with pictures of Sumo wrestlers and barely clothed children. What!!?? Beyond that, the professor rarely answered student questions in class and when he did, he never listened to the whole question and steamrolled through what the student was curious about. How and why is this an introductory genetics and development course designed to be taken by students without much biology background? The course focuses so much on specific (and often clinical) examples and topics that the core principles of genetics and development are lost.\r\n\r\n I think a significant improvement can be made in the quality of the discussion sections in this course. Never was our TF observed in section. How can she get feedback on teaching without any observation?\r\n\r\nLastly, this has been my first course at Yale without mid-semester feedback. Not only did the Canvas system not open for mid-semester feedback until the class was almost over, but the professors never mentioned this as something we shoud (or could) do and they never solicited feedback. I think a lack of feedback is a common theme of improvement for this class. Students need more feedback on their classwork, homework, and what to expect on assessments and the professors and TFs need to solicit more (read: ANY) feedback from students to better meet their needs.",
                "I like that the course is research focused. Otherwise I did not enjoy this class. I am not premed, and this class felt like it was not designed or taught for someone like me. I am interested in genetics, particularly plant genetics, but I am not interested in learning the details or causes of human disease as I had to do in this class. I wish we learned more genetic principles and had to memorize less random human knowledge, like the ZPA and AER in developing limb buds. I do not think I will use this knowledge again. This semester I am in an upper level biology class that requires the sequence as a prerequisite, and last year I also took a class like this, and I've found BOTH easier and less confusing than this course. This is an introductory course, so despite what the canvas page says I cannot believe that this is not intended to be a weed out course for premed students. It feels unfair that I and the other non-premed students have to be subject to this when we just want to learn biology.",
                "strengths- the weekly quizzes forced us to study every week rather than cram for the final\r\nweaknesses- the quizzes were weird and some questions made no sense",
                "The quizzes are brutal and lectures are sooo long",
                "This class is way too intense. The lectures are hard to follow and the quizzes are impossible  even if you know all of the biology, they still trick you. Although I learned a lot, the emotional distress felt unnecessary.",
                "This course was extremely fast paced - it seemed as if they were trying to fit a semesters worth of material into just one half semester. At times it was very overwhelming to keep up with. I think this class is better suited for a semester long format, but I understand it isnt feasible as the intent is for one year of intro bio. I think this class would be better if some of the material were cut out or gone less in depth on.",
                "This course has a lot to offer and is actually quite interesting when it begins to make sense. But, without the support of additional enrichment sessions, it was hard to break down that content presented in lecture and to independently draw the connections the professor expected us to make. I would still recommend it to anyone interested in genetics or anyone that is pre-med, as it is a good introductory course to genetics. But it can feel dense at times. The peer tutors and TFs were amazing!",
                "The lectures were often hard to engage with, and a lot of work for me personally was done outside of classes. I did enjoy the research project as a cumulative assignment.",
                "I miss the study guides. I think this is a really hard course to stop having that kind of support for.",
                "The instructors were not clear with students on how to prepare for quizzes and lectures were not the most engaging.",
                "I like the content of the course. I liked the quizzes and the project but I think section could have been taught better since it was more of just quizzes us without explaining the concepts.",
                "The class covers a lot of interesting material, but it is not very well organized and the lectures are confusing. It is a lot of work.",
                "The slides were a little hard to follow conceptually. I wish they were structured such that we can fully study them even after lecture because sometimes i spent too much time trying to decipher what the slides meant instead of asking questions that would further enrich my knowledge (sort of like the enrichment packets). Counterintuitively, the slides were also the courses greatest strength because it provided me with all that i needed to learn for the week in a somewhat digestible way.",
                "Strengths: Designing a proposal was very helpful for people like me who want to go into research. Cons: The lectures had too much content which was very confusing and often underexplaining. Exams and quizzes were too difficult.",
                "its very fast paced and there is a lot of material. I thought that the research assignment was not super helpful, I would prefer PSETS to cement the material.",

                "The final exam couldve been less about the last lecture we learned two days ago",

                "The material was not well organized in slides and the examples were all neurology based.",
                "The teaching style was not inviting. It felt as though learning was to be done without the help of the professor.",

                "Strength: the lecturer is very strong and the difficulty level is very engaging\r\nWeakness: I wish the sections were more engaging and the professor himself offered more office hours",
                "The lecturer is hard to understand, and the lack of video recordings with subtitles makes most of the lectures worthless leaving the student to find other ways to learn the material. The material is interesting, leading to a natural strength of the course.",
                "Strengths included the amount of office hours, enrichment, and peer tutoring offered. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses included the lecture structure as it was hard to stay engaged and it often felt like there was an overwhelming amount information discussed in a lecture.",
                "Strengths include the amount of of knowledge that all of the professors and teaching fellows have. Weaknesses would be that some of the peer tutors didn't know what they were talking about, but one of them did and she was extremely helpful. I think this course could be improved by offering more office hours and maybe even by offering group study sessions once a week. It was also difficult to understand professor Zhong when he wore a mask. He also talks really fast which made it difficult to follow.",
                "It is taught too fast without enough context. The lectures should be recorded and sent out so that they can be listened to multiple times",
                "Lecture slides were overly complicated and the course tried to show more information than was needed. Overall structure of lectures and content could be more cohesive. Better graphics would help too",
                "This class was poorly taught. The lectures were difficult to follow and the discussion section was not useful",
                "The discussion sections and papers were a strength of the course. The course-long project was also interesting as we got to make our own research proposal. A weakness was that the homework (project) was less related to what we were learning in class. Also, the lectures were very fast-paced and confusing. I think it could be more engaging as much of the lecture was a repeat of the textbook we were assigned.",
                "The strength of this course was the ability to drop two quiz grades. The weaknesses included the many different aspects to the class such as the discussion sections which did not relate to the homeworks which did not related to the content covered in lectures. It consistently felt like i was doing so many different things for just this one class.",
                "Strengths: the class covers a significant material and provides a great foundation of genetics information, especially relevant for future courses. The Teaching Staff are willing to help and be of assistance, which I appreciate. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think everyone would benefit from 5-10 minutes longer on the quizzes. Science is a slow, not fast game, and I find that the time crunch is not conducive to being able to properly analyze and respond to the questions asked.",
                "Strengths of the course were that you left the course with a strong foundation on genetics and because you had to study each week for quizzes, you were able to build on knowledge easily.",
                "The strengths of this course were the sections that helped me understand concepts at a greater level. Some weaknesses would be that some topics were brushed up on and specific details were required to be memorized for some of the quizzes.",
                "The slides were well organized and the content on them made logical sense. I felt that the lectures sometimes made this content seem more confusing and difficult than truly is.",

                "Strength was that the professor really tried to be helpful, but a weakness was the way the exams were formatted.",

                "This course provides a solid understanding of development and genetics - emphasis on development. Although interesting, a lot of the material in class is very detailed and not tested on quizzes and exams. Many of the concepts are presented in the context of neural development in different organisms, which makes them challenging to understand in the first place, but they are also not well explained. We were only given 15 minutes for the in-class quizzes, which made them even more stressful for everyone. The weekly HW assignments were valuable, culminating in a research grant proposal and presentation, but generally did not provide much practice with the course material. The TAs and especially the PTs were great.",
                "The content is interesting and a lot of ground is covered in a short time. However, the way the information is tested is extremely stress-inducing. The weekly quizzes are written in such a way that it is difficult to determine what the question is even asking you. I am not saying the quizzes need to be made easier, but they need to be written more clearly. In addition, the homework felt very disconnected from the course and was not discussed in class at all. I feel that the homework should connect to the content we are learning and not feel like an entirely separate class.",
                "I do think that the formatting of lecture is a weakness of the course. It was always so hard to understand the professor when he wore his mask as he lectured. There was also too much information given in one lecture which made it really hard to synthesize all of the information. I think that we should not have quizzes on material that we have just learned two days ago.",
                "The quizzes were difficult to finish on time and there was a lot of material each week. The homework was a good balance of being difficult and not taking too much time.",
                "A massive weakness of this course was the instruction. The lecturer was very difficult to understand and often included excessive information in the slides that he presented each lecture. There was a large discrepancy between the material in lecture and the knowledge that was assessed on quizzes and exams in this course. This issue was so large that I had to teach myself the material for quizzes for the majority of the class. The resources that are offered as helpful tools in this course are simply not as helpful as if the course was better taught and organized. My main issue with Biology 103 was that it sought to assess students' knowledge of minute details rather than central biology concepts that were introduced. This is not how a college course should be taught.",
                "One weakness I noticed was the slides in the class, sometimes they were a little difficult to interpret. \r\nOne strength was that my TA was available whenever I needed and helped a lot along the course.",
                "strengths: challenges you to think deeper/conceptually about material, helpful feedback from TF on homework\r\nweaknesses: too challenging sometimes, lecture often doesn't make sense, lecturer sometimes under-explains, quizzes require high level of critical thinking",
                "Lecturer was more focused on talking about research rather than understanding the tops",
                "Strengths: Prof Loreng and the TFs\r\nWeaknesses: Having the weekly quizzes cover concepts that we'd only learned 2 days before (bc quizzes were every Wed covering topics from Mon and the previous Wed)"

It was extremely challenging, taught in a confusing way, and was overall a stressful experience.

                "If you need to take it for the bio sequence, then take it. Otherwise take a semester long genetics course.",
                "It is informative, but is a lot of work, especially for an intro bio class. It can be very stressful at times due to the weekly quizzes, p-sets, and paper readings.",
                "Absolutely not. Bio103 is the type of course that demoralizes students and persuades them to drop pre-med or biology completely (as friends of mine did this semester). We had to teach ourselves the content, spent hours on every assignment and on studying, and those efforts felt futile when quiz averages were all 65-70. Even if there is a curve for final grading, the stress and unhappiness that this course caused is not worth any grade. It's a shame the course is structured and taught so poorly because I truly love biology and found a lot of the topics quite interesting, yet I could derive no joy or passion for the class when it was a primary reason my fall semester has been quite bad.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student; although I wasn't fond of the professor, the material this course covers is fascinating",
                "I would only recommend taking this course if it is required.",
                "No, I would not, unless you do have to take 103. If so, I would highly recommend taking it with someone other than professor Zhong.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course with any interest in biology because the topics covered in this class are very applicable to the real world.",
                "No no no...if you're going to take BIOL 103, please do yourself a favor and don't take it with Professor Zhong. It will make a big difference. It is crazy to think that this course, with this professor, has consistently received ratings below 3 (and sometimes below 2) and few structural changes have been made. Just read the comments. I feel strongly that introductory classes should inspire students to continue in that field and I leave BIOL 103 inspired to NOT study MCDB. Each element of the class designed to help learning was a hindrance. The homeworks were confusing and I received little to no feedback (even after a one-on-one Zoom with the TF three days before the assignment was due). On the first homework, I only received the points I had been deducted with NOT A WORD of feedback on how I could do better or what the correct answers were. When I asked for clarification, the TF only sent me an itemized list of which questions I was deducted points on but not WHY! They were provided rubrics to grade (we were given the rubrics!) but they didn't provide feedback referencing the rubric...hmm... In discussion section, our TF started each class by stating \"I thought this paper was easy.\" I'm glad they did with their PhD in biology, but us out here really didn't and it's very off-putting to start off in that manner. The quizzes were fiercely timed which seemed to have little pedagogic justification. Finally, the final exam in the course, which we were advised would focus on broader themes in the course, had specific questions about bicoid and other genes that were not broad in scope. To future students: if nothing is changed, you'll be frustrated and sad in this course, you may even cry. It's not worth it, biology is cool and this course makes it sad!",
                "No. I love biology but the sequence continues to make me question that. I came into this semester after an inspiring and wonderful summer of research at Yale, feeling very excited about science and biology and eager to learn. Quickly, because of this course, I've lost that love of learning. I found myself wishing there were less slides and the lectures could just end, so there was less random content I had to sort through. That should NEVER be the case in a Yale class -- the students should want the learning to continue. This class and the atmosphere of it decreased my confidence in my science and biology abilities in ways that have impacts beyond this class, such as to my lab work. I don't know how the final went, but for the quizzes I was above the class average for every one, so this statement is not because I did not put the work necessary into this class, rather it is a testament to the organization and culture of the course. For students who did not come in with a strong bio background, I cannot imagine how difficult this would've been and I hope with all my heart that they have not given up on their dreams because of this negative experience.",
                "no if you can avoid it",
                "I wouldnt, though I know most people do not have a choice. To succeed in this class, you really do need to work hard and understand how Professor Zhong asks his quiz and test questions.",
                "Yes I would, but only if you are willing to put in the time to go through lecture content on your own and to spend time breakdown and actually conceptualizing what is presented in class. Although the weekly quizzes are only 15 mins long, they require quite a bit of preparation, primarily because understanding the fundamental ideas requires lots effort/time. But, once you get the fundamental concepts down, applying them to the questions presented on the quizzes is not difficult.",
                "If required, then yes. I think this course teaches important concepts for students interested in biology/genetics.",
                "Im not sure. I think if you have the time to dedicate to learning and understanding the material, it can be fun. Other than that, no.",

                "Its required, so I guess so. The material really is interesting, but the way the course is run makes it so stessful.",
                "The course itself was very interesting but it just made it difficult that the slides were (sometimes) inefficient for learning outside of lecture. For example, most of my studying was spent going slide by slide trying to understand what the professor meant when it shouldve instead been used to do practice problems, ask  higher level questions, etc.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in biology and/or want to gain a better understanding of developmental biology.",

                "Yes, was a great learning experience, and gained many skills relating to scientific inquiry and presentation building.",
                "Yes because you learn important things about biology and genetics.",
                "Yes! This was one of the modules I found genuinely interesting, would recommend its just a lot of information to try to understand",
                "I wouldnt recommend taking this course unless it is a prereq. With weekly HWs and weekly in-class quizzes, the workload is relatively high. I would highly recommend attending the quiz review sessions led by the PTs and asking them if you have specific questions about slides. Prof. Zhong clearly puts effort into his lectures, but I found that he many times did not explain the material in a clear way or had to completely skip slides due to time, expecting the students to be able to figure things out on their own.",
                "It's a requirement for anyone in the natural sciences, so a recommendation really means nothing. This course is difficult and not fun. I thought I would really enjoy this portion of the bio sequence because I love genetics, but I really dreaded going to lecture and found myself reteaching myself everything later because it was not presented in a way that made it clear to understand during class. Don't take it if you don't have to. Take a genetics or development course instead.",
