    "Got much better at speaking Spanish! Learned a whole lot of conjugations for haber.",
    "I improved my grammar and speaking skills",
    "My level of precision with grammar increased a lot",
    "My Spanish skills in writing, reading, and speaking all improved significantly, and I found myself with a new appreciation for political movements in Latin America.",
    "This class taught a decent amount of Spanish grammar but very little useful vocab. I now know how to conjugate into tenses only used in poetry and how to say ufo but am still probably not going to be able to hold a fluid conversation with someone else in Spanish."

   "comments": [
    "This course is great. I truly love Spanish at Yale. It could be improved by having a less-strict attendance policy. There are students who do work that is of A level (95% and above), but miss class due to either a medical emergency, chronic illness or a death in the family, and their attendance will not be excused for this emergencies. It is sad that students do not always get the grade they deserve because of a strict policy.",
    "Definitely not as good a class as 130 - syllabus was much less organized, vocab not as useful, grammar more obscure, and not as steep of a learning curb. But I still learned a lot.",
    "I would have liked to practice my speaking more",
    "There is lot of random vocab that is of no use and not enough useful vocab",
    "Strengths include the small class size and increased language skills while weaknesses include eurocentrism, lots of busy work, and disproportionately hard tests to the rest of the material.",
    "The course packet was terrible. It was organized in some obscure fashion such that within a class period i would be flipping through it about five to ten times. It was not at all structured in a way that would allow for help while studying. The textbook itself is lacking but the super site practices are helpful in solidifying lessons. The course is also way too heavy on the assignments. I understood everything and did well on the exams but still felt like i was sinking in homework as there were often multiple assignments in one night on top of so many exams, quizzes, and presentations. For a class that meets everyday, it was just too overwhelming. I was more likely to rush through assignments just to finish them (so I could do the work I had for other classes) than I was to actually take the time to understand the material and engage with it on a deeper level."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is both interesting and valuable information and experience.",
    "Yeah, I'd recommend it. Then you get to take L5 Spanish!",
    "I would recommend if they have the time to spend at least an hour on spanish homework every day",
    "Yes. I didnt have to do it but it makes the tenses etc become second nature",
    "Yes, to improve their Spanish; but I would warn them of the amount of work and the at times arbitrary grading.",
    "Unless necessary for a language credit, I would not take this course. Students are better off getting the L4 credit from a study abroad program so they can actually learn how to hold conversations in Spanish with people who aren't also too busy with hours of assignments to try to learn Spanish. The course is much more work than necessary."
