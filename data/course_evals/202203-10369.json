Be ready for Churches, heresies, violence, invaders, conquests, raiding, settlements and intrigue. If you've ever wondered how that state became that state, you'll have a good grasp of how Belgium became Belgium, Islam fragmented into the Shia and Sunni constituencies, the Vikings etc.",

                "Strengths: \r\n1. Professor Freedman is a fabulous and engaging lecturer. Its hard not to like him. You can tell he's taught this course many times and has developed new perspectives on classic interpretations.\r\n2. The TAs were really impressive. They clearly cared extensively about the topics and content. \r\n3. The class is well structured. The progression makes sense. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. There is little info on Canvas when you need it (readings not posted rarely) \r\n2. I thought that the was a bit missing between the lectures and the sections. For the midterm and the finals, I was sort of teaching myself the gaps. I think this is a product of the fact that Professor Freedman is going to talk about what he wants. Sometimes things get lost in the tracks.",
                "The main strength was the breadth of the material, it kept it quite interesting. Weakness that is was often hard to follow what was going on as there were no powerpoints and the material moves fast.",
                "The only weakness I would see is the course's engagement with the Arab world. Although understandable, I feel like the Arab world is given less importance than the Vikings and it should have equal, if not more, importance in the course.",
                "No weaknesses stood out.",
                "Lectures are a bit too spread out and unclear - could be more tightly organized with clearer themes\/messages",
                "There was some disorganization in assignments that was cleared up by the TA's. Strengths are Freedman's enjoyable lectures and my TA's great section. I also think Freedman assigns good readings that give you insight beyond what he can cover in class lectures.",
                "A very solid course. If it aint broke dont fix it.",
                "The best parts of this course are its instructors. The TFs, Kevin Hoffman and Nathanial Hay, and, of course, Professor Freedman, were incredibly helpful, considerate, and knowledgeable. Many of my questions received concise, well-informed answers. Because of their abilities, however, I felt that we were given too much secondary reading. I felt that without these readings, the instructors did not lack in providing context and general analysis. I would have liked to focus on more primary texts, which were, after all, the most interesting things we read this semester.",
                "Good survey course and topics were well taught. However, because it was a survey course, there was a lot of switching between time periods.",
                "Strength: interesting period of history that doesn't always receive enough attention\r\nWeakness: not very well organized, there are no slides to guide lectures so the professor tends to jump around with no clear focus; the readings often assumes a lot of preexisting knowledge and hence can be hard to follow"

                "I would highly recommend this class if you're interested in the topic. I am not sure what the rest of the class' engagement was, but given my area of focus, this class is a gem. Paul Freedman has his reputation for a reason. It's fun to come to class, you want to hear what he has to speak about. I would also recommend this class to non-history\/humanities people, hoping to get a credit or to those that are history majors and need a pre-industrial credit.  Everybody should have this foundational understanding of how and why the world looks the way it does. The workload is very manageable, the feedback is constructing, you'll improve your knowledge and writing. Strong marks!",
                "I am ha history major but this made me realise that this period of history was probably not for me. I would say take it if you have a genuine interest in the material or if you need it for a history requirement. Otherwise it may be a bit frustrating.",

                "A decent preindustrial credit",
                "Yes; it's a very engaging and thought-provoking history of a time period frequently overlooked in most school history curricula. Prof. Friedman is excellent and renowned in his field for good reason.",
                "Yes! I enjoyed the course content and came out of the class feeling that I had a decent grasp on the new material. The assignment load was fair, and nothing we did felt unnecessary or un-useful in my learning.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed this course.",
                "Yes. Very fascinating subject that is not covered enough in general.",

                "Yes I would. It was fun and we learned a lot about the early middle ages which was an interesting time period.",
                "Meh... the lectures were kind of poorly organized, so don't take it unless you are willing to put in a lot of work understanding the period in your own time"
