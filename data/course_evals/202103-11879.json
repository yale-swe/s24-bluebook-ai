                "I learned math! I hadn't taken a challenging math course in a while, so I liked getting back into it with this class. A lot of the topics were ones I had covered years ago in high school but had gotten rusty, but many of the topics were new. Taylor Series were new. Volumes of revolution were review. Areas of sections of polar equations were new.",

                "I feel that I have developed the ability to integrate confidently and to apply my integration techniques to practical applications- such as finding the area between curves or defining the volumes of solids. This course built upon my preexisting Calculus knowledge and allowed me to feel comfortable with the material of \"Calc 2\", to the point where I feel able to take on Multivariable Calculus in the coming semesters.",
                "I learned about the fundamentals of calculus, mainly finding antiderivatives, determining whether series converge or not, and applying those concepts to three dimensional shapes and polar coordinates."

                "The course has many sections that move at different paces, so a few times for midterms, some classes were able to spend time reviewing material while others were still learning the material in the days approaching the midterm. Math 115 is designed to move the same for each section, so some way to ensure that would be helpful.",
                "Super organized course",
                "My instructor was great, course does move quickly though.",
                "Mihai's teaching style was great and really helped me understand the topics. Most review sessions for exams, however, were not very helpful because many moved to slow with too few examples.",
                "Weakness: professor teaching style varied a lot, some professors distributed far more resources such as worksheets.",
                "A weakness of this course is its fast pace and a strength of the course is the professor--Mihai.",
                "Review sessions going over the practice tests would be great. Having practice tests was very good.",
                "it was very well structured - had review sessions you could go to and had practice tests",
                "One strength of this course was its organization. Literally one of the best-organized courses I've ever taken, if not the most. You always know what to expect in terms of homework, exams, etc. The syllabus was comprehensive. The use of Desmos for visualizing concepts was fantastic. PLENTY of opportunities to go to office hours. Weaknesses? hmm. Perhaps the fact that students' experience with the course seemed to vary dramatically depending on which instructor they had.",
                "Mihai was an amazing instructor! He does move a tad fast, so be prepared.",
                "The peer tutoring was very disorganized and not helpful a majority of the time. This course was only good because of Prof. Alboiu. I thought he was a stellar instructor.",
                "Mihai was very good at explaining subject material and provided good notes on the step by step process to solve problems. He was also very available for extra help during office hours. Also, take advantage of peer tutoring. They are a huge help for completing p-sets as well as clarifying any doubts you might have.",
                "I feel like there were some inconsistencies with how material was being taught across sections, which became apparent while studying with others from other sections.",
                "Good course and was challenging, although that was completely expected.",
                "Strengths- the smaller sections sizes (compared to a large lecture) facilitate learning and questions between the instructor and the students as well as between students themselves. I also feel that the textbook is not used as a guide, but more as a supplementary resource, which made the course more hands on and less about just learning from the textbook. The order that the material was taught in also made a lot of sense to me, and having the part of the course that focuses on series being in the middle (and therefore being tested on it for a midterm) was very helpful in seeing where I was struggling.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- there could be more feedback given on both the midterms and the problem sets; many times I would look at a problem set and then be very unsure what I did wrong. With only so much time in the day for office hours, I feel like more explanation could be given without forcing students to ask about these questions during office hours.",
                "Strengths: Plenty of practice to use for exams, instruction matches what is covered on problem sets\r\nWeaknesses: Covers topics quickly"
