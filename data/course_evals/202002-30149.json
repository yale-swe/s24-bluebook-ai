    "I learned a lot of interesting things about physics that I had literally no idea about before. Made me consider taking more STEM classes.",
    "General physics concepts and how they affect real world situations(or as real as movies get). Newtonian physics with a touch of quantum at the end.",
    "I learned the basic principles of physics but also how to think quickly and make accurate conclusions without having to rely on a calculator or a multi-step process to get an answer",
    "The ability of estimation. When I'm watching movie now, I can use my physics knowledge to estimate the hight, the speed, or even the energy, and figure out if the scene is reasonable in physics. I've learned physics before, and finally I can apply my physics knowledge in real life.",
    "Greater understandaning of kinematics, and estimation as a valuable and viable approach to problems.",
    "Understanding of introductory physics topics and the applications of theory to real-life situations.",
    "Guesstimation"

   "comments": [
    "I thought it was very well organized but the homeworks should have been worth a larger portion of the grade.",
    "Most of the learning is from the online videos; class is mostly to review concepts and practice. Works well for motivated students--otherwise relatively easy to fall behind.",
    "Very good material on the Canvas site along with regular and helpful seminars if you have questions. It allowed for very flexible timing.",
    "This course is a great overview of introductory topics, but its name may be slightly misleading. Students should expect a 'typical' physics course. Movies are sometimes used, but they could be incorporated into the course better.",
    "It was a difficult course for those who have no experience with physics. However, after meeting with the TF and Professor, I truly started to understand the concepts.",
    "The lectures were very organized and detailed.",
    "this was a cool class!"

    "I would recommend you take University Physics over Movie Physics. The movie clips are outdated and didn't have much relevance to me. In addition, with all of the problems referring to movie clips, you are required to come up with values from the clip. The guessing got really old, really quickly. I would prefer if we were given values (like the approx speed of a train, length of a car ramp, approx. weights of objects, etc) along with the movie clips.",
    "Yes absolutely, especially a humanities major looking for a fun QR or science credit.",
    "Yes. Great for students who know who physics is but haven't met her yet. Might feel like a repeat 10th date if you've done physics before",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they had the time and were willing to engage in the class. This is not a class a student can breeze by and get a good grade. This course requires constant engagement and effort. If a student is willing to engage in this course then they will thoroughly enjoy it.",
    "Yes. Lots of my classmates think physics is boring, and it is just answering questions. I can recommend this course to them and tell them physics can be something else, something interesting and it's our world.",
    "Absolutely. Anyone who wants to learn the basics of physics or refresh their knowledge will have a great time taking this course.",
    "Yes! Its an engaging and fun science credit! Im so glad I took this course.",
    "Yes. The workload is reasonable and the material is very clearly presented.",
    "yes, it's a cool science course if you have a little bit of a background in physics (and I mean a LITTLE bit, I only took physics in high school but that was enough for me to feel comfortable following along with the course)"
