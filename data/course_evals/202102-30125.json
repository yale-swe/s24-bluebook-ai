                "This was an excellent course for both beginning to learn how to construct a philosophical argument\/write philosophy papers more generally while also exploring very timely and deeply interesting ethical questions. In terms of the more foundational skills, the exercises to break down existing philosophical arguments were very helpful for understanding distinctions between sound vs valid arguments. Further, this course reviewed and discussed the validity of different philosophical perspectives including utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics while applying them to ethical questions surrounding things like autonomous vehicles, genetic enhancement, algorithms, autonomous weapons, and online shaming.",
                "I learned a lot more about how ethical decisions play into every aspect of our lives, and especially new technologies as they emerge. Fundamental concepts that we learned also helped me to more precisely evaluate these ethical considerations and I definitely think I gained a better ability to evaluate these subjective matters with a more open mind.",
                "- basic philosophical principles, ideas, and theories that are applicable to wide range of different moral or ethical arguments and concepts \r\n- skills to critically think about how the use of technology effects our lives and whether or not it is good or bad, moral or immoral\r\n- insights into the moral and ethical concerns that result from almost all forms of technology that we rely on everyday in modern life",
                "I learned frameworks for evaluating certain technologies and how they pertain to our lives. I also learned about specific cases including genetic enhancements, self-driving cars, and autonomous weapons and different arguments about all of these technologies.",
                "Moral and Ethical thinking skills and overall knowledge I will hold onto for the future!",
                "Learned a lot about how to approach philosophy. This came in the form of evaluating the components of arguments, how to disagree with arguments whether it be the premises, conclusion, or some logic in between. We had some very interesting discussions in the breakout sessions that broadened my view on a lot of philosophical topics. I also learned a lot about philosophical ideologies such as utilitarianism and virtues.",
                "I learned a lot about morality, what the value of online friendships are, blame and responsibility, and arguing morals concisely.",

                "So many! This class was my first introduction to ethics and philosophy, so learning the vocabulary and terminology for future discussions was invaluable. Concepts about utilitarianism, consequentialism, a sound vs. valid argument, a descriptive vs. evaluative claim, and logical argument formation. Likewise, as a STEM major, it was interesting to read and learn about the more constructive views about technology. I believe the critical view is necessary and Im really glad I took this class.",
                "I learned how to think critically about my actions and self. Specifically, I learned about ethics in relation to technology and what it means to be moral.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths were definitely the clarity and organization of the course. It was all very thoughtful and easy to follow which enabled us to focus more on the truly difficult and confusing ethical issues being raised instead of wasting time on unclear logistics or course expectations. Additionally, the instructors made themselves available for discussion outside of class with office hours and gave very thoughtful feedback on nearly every assignment, no matter how \"small.\" Of course, this is made easier and is more common in a seminar\/discussion based class; but I felt that more so than other similar classes I've taken, the instructors were generous, constructive, and attentive with their feedback. All of this gave me the feeling that the instructors were invested in my learning and understanding of the material which motivated me, and I believe the other participants, to be even more engaged during class discussions. Another thing that I found helpful was how dynamic the course was. On Zoom, it is easy for it to feel endless and tiring but switching between lectures, group discussions, and smaller breakout rooms made it easier to stay focused for the rather long 3 hour summer session class period.",
                "We always had very lively discussions about interesting topics and I think the breakout rooms helped facilitate that.",
                "Strengths of this course include effective use of breakout rooms, making materials accessible online, and discussing assignments in class to make expectations clear.",
                "strengths: super interesting topics, great facilitated discussion, lots of time for discussion, great feedback on assignments, really interesting and digestable readings \r\nweaknesses: wish it was longer and less condensed, but that is just an overall weakness of summer classes",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. Very interesting\r\n2. Very engaging\r\n3. Lots of interactions with peers \/ classmates\r\n4. Good balance of time with discussion groups, small groups, breaks, and lecture\r\n5. Very good and accessible resources from professor and TFs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. Summer courses are long and it was sometimes hard for me to focus through lecture (even with everything else)",
                "Strengths were group discussions, lecture, and great readings. Only weakness was length of class but it had to be due to the time constraint of this course.",
                "This class was very engaging. It was hard at times because of the length of each class was 3 hours early in the morning, however the time seemed to go by quickly. I really enjoyed the discussions that we would have and the topics were generally very interesting. I think there is not much that can be improved considering the limitations this session.",
                "I think the strength of this class was the in class discussion and it could be improved through a little more focus on the papers and techniques and strategies for writing. Perhaps one or two more larger sections of class to discuss or go over sample writings could have been helpful",
                "I thought the course was incredibly well designed. There are no improvements that come to mind. The lectures were mixed in well with group discussions, both large and small, which allowed for the development and growth of new ideas.",
                "This course has very manageable readings and writing assignments. The classes are also very well-formatted with a mix of discussion, student participation, and lecturing.",
                "N\/A",
                "The class was very clearly structured and the readings were laid out with plenty of time beforehand. The bigger group discussions during class were also well moderated. There were also plenty of resources for writing so that was really helpful. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was the limited variability in group set-ups. I liked the moderated bigger groups more than the smaller unmoderated groups, but it would have been nice to hear the discussions of the other group with Matt as well.",
                "The course was amazing and the only way it could have been improved was if it were in person. Fantastic.",
                "Strengths are that it was well taught weakness was that it went by really fast but it's a summer class."

                "``I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Not only are many of the questions being asked very important for us to consider and understand more generally but it was also a very solid introduction to (or refresher on) how to write and construct ethical\/philosophical arguments.",
                "Yes! This is a great course if you have any interest in technology at all because it touches on some very key issues that will undoubtedly arise as you progress in your studies.",
                "Yes, especially if the student was interesting in philosophy as applied to something involved in our everyday lives, as technology is.",
                "Yes, the topics discussed were incredibly interesting and very important as our society becomes increasingly dependent on technology. It's a great class for those who are maybe not the most interested in philosophy or humanities but need that credit because it takes on a much more modern and applicable approach to our lives. This class wasn't focused so heavily on theories and famous philosophers but really discussing the moral and ethical issues that arise with use of modern tech. However, at the same time you get an introduction to some of the more common philosophical theories that are useful to know.",
                "I definitely would recommend this class to other students. I think it is important as a STEM major to understand how the products they make affect others and the ways to evaluate them well.",
                "Yes, it was very engaging and the topics that we discussed were all very interesting. I think it was really helpful, especially as technology becomes more and more ingrained in our lives",
                "Yes, I would say the course was very interesting, organized and helpful to my learning.",
                "Yes. This is easily one of my favorite courses at Yale so far, the focus of the class is very interesting, the workload is perfect, and I definitely feel like I learned a lot about myself and moral philosophy.",
                "Yes, especially if you haven't taken a philosophy course.",
                "Yes, I found this class to be especially interesting and enjoyable. I thought the workload was very reasonable and all of the class discussions were well organized. I feel as though I was thoroughly engaged by the discussions and enjoyed them.",
                "Absolutely. Any student looking to major in philosophy, or a non-major looking for an easy and engaging humanities credit should take this course.",
                "This is a great course for people interested in philosophy or who want to learn more about technology's role in our lives. The workload is less than most classes I've taken, and the low workload allows you to spend more time actively engaging with the material.",
                "Yes! Especially for any STEM majors, a more critical approach about the power and progress of tech is necessary and this was great exposure\r\nLikewise, philosophy writing is very regimented in a way and it all follows a very logical structure. I think this type of writing is a lot easier than the more traditional story writing, so while this class isnt a writing credit I do think it would be helpful to have philosophical writing as a background skill",
                "I would absolutely.",
