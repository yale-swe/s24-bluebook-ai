                "Taking this course as a first-year helped me transition from writing at the high school level to writing college-level papers. I learned how to fashion a new, nuanced argument about a text and picked up new techniques for how to craft those ideas into an engaging paper. Our class discussions also helped me improve my close-reading skills.",

Occasionally we would cover a lot of material between classes but only spend time on one very small component, and it would have been easier to develop more complex thoughts on the singular component if there wasn't as much content.",
                "This is an excellent course; we read some incredible works of literature, and our class discussions and writing assignments helped me glean more from the texts than I would have if I had simply read them on my own. Professor Ulrich struck the perfect balance between pointing us to interested parts of the text and letting us discuss our own thoughts. She gave us some excellent tips about writing our papers towards the middle of the term and had us workshop a few paragraphs from our essays. Since this was so helpful, I would have appreciate it if this had come at the beginning of the term; it would have helped me improve the quality of my first few essays.",
                "The numerous essays really got me back into shape in terms of writing. In terms of improvement, (this is a personal problem) perhaps a dedicated class to reading deeper? I think reading deeper and finding interesting ideas to talk about was one of my greatest problems in this class."

                "Yes. But only if you are 1) interested in the subject matter and 2) up for a lot of work. There was a lot of writing and the grading was very difficult. Don't take this if you are looking for an easy writing credit. However, if you are interested in the subject matter definitely take it as Professor Ulrich is extremely knowledgable and sheds new light on all the texts. She will also make you a much better writer.",

                "Definitely! You get to discuss some absolutely beautiful works of literature with students who are just as interested in them as you are. I particularly recommend taking this course with Professor Ulrich. She made sure that every single discussion we had was productive and engaging; she'll work with you on your essay topics if you go to her for office hours, and she'll give you plenty of helpful feedback on your writing.",
                "I would if they were interested in poetry. I would warn them of the essays though since, from what I've heard, this class has longer essays compared to other first-year English classes."
