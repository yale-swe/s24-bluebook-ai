   "comments": [
    "how to conduct professional-level scientific research and engage with experts in those fields",
    "I got a really good hands-on, scientific experience in a subject area I may have never touched if I hadn't taken the class, which was really valuable. It also provided me with a good, new perspective for approaching science.",
    "a lot about dinosaur skulls",
    "I learned how to actually conduct research when there isn't a solution set for your question. I learned to segment dinosaur skulls and review literature to do comparative anatomy analysis",
    "I had more practice at professional communication and learned how to manage a self study project with great guidance from professors. I also gained valuable paper writing and presentational skills",
    "I learned so much about hands on research and the operations of the Peabody Museum. It was really cool to get to actually go through the process of writing a scientific paper, something that I've never really gotten to do at length before. I'm really glad I chose this as a science credit because it introduced me to an entirely different aspect of learning how science is actually interpreted in lots of different fields.",
    "This course was a solid introduction to Yale's research environment. I learned to conduct research by collecting data from Yale's biological specimens and analyzing them with Yale's computing resources. The course taught me to be independent in planning out the research and writing research papers in a very friendly manner. I also received a form of evaluation\/feedback of my research through presentations in front of natural history experts."

   "comments": [
    "You get one-on-one mentorship. Even if you aren't a STEM person, this is a really great way to get your QR credit because there is a lot of hands on work and engagement form professors.",
    "It is strong in that it balances hands-on experiences with exposure to different functions within the Peabody. Having more project time towards the beginning of the semester may have been nice. That being said, I really enjoyed being exposed to things within the Peabody through tours and other activities.",
    "it was a great class",
    "I thought the course was really well thought out.",
    "Very well taught and great exposure to a breadth of new topics. Only spot for improvement is clearer communication about meetings once projects were started but not a huge deal since help was always available",
    "I think a huge strength of the class was the fact that we all got to see everyone's final presentations. It made all the work that we were putting in all semester seem worth every step, and it was really cool to see how far everyone had come from when we were first discussing the projects.",
    "I really loved the course in that I got to conduct my research and develop it to an original paper. Professor Skelly, our TF, my research advisor, and the museum staff were all very friendly and tried to help out my research. Plus, I really really enjoyed guest lectures and speed talks; it was super interesting to get to know what people in the field are researching about and how they presented their research was a good guideline to our own research. I can't really think of a weakness of this course."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. If you are looking to do research here at Yale, this is an excellent way to start. Basically, you pick a project to work on and just work on that all semester. Some of the projects included researching dinosaur faces and the origin of the bird beak, creating a new exhibit to go into the renovated Peabody Museum, using artificial intelligence to do label reconstruction for fluid preserved lots.",
    "an incredible experience for a new student at Yale",
    "Definitely! It's a really interesting seminar and gives you access to some really valuable scientific experiences.",
    "absolutely",
    "I definitely would. It's a great way to get started with research. I came into the class not knowing what to expect and just to get a science credit but coming out of it I'm planning on continuing research in the area of study I initially chose.",
    "Yes it was an excellent way to learn about a lot of different fields of science with your own decision on what to spend more time doing. It also gave me a much deeper appreciation for the research happening at yale as well as the amazing resource we students have in the Peabody museum and its faculty",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, especially students who enter Yale pretty dead-set on the fact that they don't really have an interest in any of the STEM fields. This gave me an entirely different perspective.",
    "Yes, definitely. This course is a solid introduction to Yale's research environment. Students get to conduct original research on Yale Peabody Museum's amazing collections and there is so much room for further research even after the class--internship, museum staff, publication, etc. I strongly recommend this course to anyone who is willing to conduct scientific research regardless of the interest in natural history. Plus, Professor Skelly and all the museum staff are amazing people and they try really hard to help our research."
