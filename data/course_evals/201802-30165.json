   "comments": [
    "I learned a ton about the Spanish civil war and Spanish culture during the twentieth century. In Bilbao, we also learned so much about Spanish culturein day-to-day life, as well as Spanish economics and politics.",
    "SPANISH S248 through the Bilbao Study Abroad Program taught us of the Spanish Civil War, life under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, and the transition to democracy after the dictatorship.",
    "I learned a lot about a culture very different from my own, and the history of that culture and how the political atmosphere of Spain today came to be.",
    "Marketed for a better understanding of Spanish Culture and the History of Spain, this course offered far beyond simple cocktail conversation, this course gave essential background into Spain's development into the Modern Nation, and helped develop the skills necessary for a Spanish Study Abroad Experience.",
    "Coming into this class, I knew nothing about  La Guerra Civil, and very little about Spanish history overall. However, leaving this class, I now know SO much about the civil war, the culture, the effects of the war, what caused it and followed it. I was able to form opinions about the things I read and saw, and gained a new appreciation for certain aspects of the Spanish culture that I previously didn't know existed.",
    "I learned about the history of Franco in Spain.",
    "Learned all about the history and politics of Spain from 1930(ish) to present with a larger focus on the Spanish Civil War and the ramifications of this conflict on Spanish culture and politics.",
    "I learned about Spanish history from 1936 to present day, specifically Spanish politics and culture.",
    "This class covers the history of Spain, introducing a little bit of background from before the twentieth century, then covering the Spanish Civil War and the reign of Franco, to the culture and life of Spain's modern society. All aspects of life are covered: politics, fine arts, theater, music, television, cinema, sports, and more. In addition to class discussions of the material, excursions that explore Spanish traditions, art, and life are included in the course.",
    "I learned about the history of Spain, and was able to further develop my cultural awareness and historical knowledge.",
    "I was able to gain significant knowledge on the political, economical, and cultural landscape of Spain throughout the 20th and 21st centuries"

   "comments": [
    "I thought it was great! It moves quickly, but it has to do so to cover so much material in such little time.",
    "The strength of the course is the inherently interesting and curious material that it covers, however I appreciated the films that was assigned as homework. I believe the clarity of the cuaderno readings could have been better.",
    "The strength was the amount of information we covered in a small amount of class time. The weakness was how detail oriented the quizzes were to the point that I would have to study upwards of 5 hours every weekend just on the culture part to do well on a 15 minute quiz.",
    "Strengths: The guest Lectures and activities in the second half of the semester.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the ultural'selections for the first 4-weeks were better than others, for Example: Ay Carmela! offered more cultural insight then Pan's Labyrinth",
    "The class consisted of a 4 hour lecture once a week covering lengthy readings assigned during the week. While a lot of the information is fascinating, it gets repetitive and does not contribute to a thorough understanding of Spanish culture.",
    "The quizzes during L3 could be tough and the majority of us students would study 7+ hours for each one. The compositions were quite easy as they did not require this level of preparation (as long as you can write well in Spanish, you are good to go). Class discussions of material beyond merely regurgitating information from the text provided a great opportunity to practice spoken Spanish.",
    "The course was taught very well and graded fairly. I do not think there are any weaknesses with this course.",
    "This course was extremely important to my understanding of Spain and its culture. The most valuable part for me was the political aspect of the course. I couldn't imagine living in Spain for a month as I did with this program, but without the knowledge of the political system that this course taught me. Even still, I feel that this course was very well-rounded and very beneficial.",
    "The strengths were that the history was taught very well. And the museums helped solidify some of the history. Some of the lectures from the Deusto professors were interesting as well. The course could be improved with more videos about the history.",
    "Strengths were that the topics covered were relevant to our immersion portion which allowed us to interact with the host families better having already learned about the historical aspects of the country"

    "YES! This program is phenomenal.",
    "Yes. It is a lot of memorization but very interesting material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I really enjoyed learning about Spanish history while also improving my Spanish reading and writing skills.",
    "I highly recommend this course; I feel I've learned so much about Spain and its culture, and I think it's important that more students learn more about other countries.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to know more about Spanish culture.",
    "Yes"
