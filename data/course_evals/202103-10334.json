                "This course successfully set my standard for the English department at Yale. Professor McGowan expanded my definition of otherwise \"boring\" (ironic) terms, and developed my taste in art\/literature. I feel much more capable of understanding art criticism and evaluating media, which is a complete switch from my first day of class. I distinctly remember walking in and feeling overwhelmed and incapable of speaking in any discussions on readings, but come the last few weeks, I became more confident and able to express myself within our small group.",

                "From my experience, the title of the course very much attracted stem students into the class with no one trying to show off vocabulary or knowledge, creating a much more positive experience than many English classes my friends are in. The only weakness is the readings can be very hard to understand until the discussion and listening to others interpret what is written. As a result, sometimes discussions can be slow. Maybe some guidelines or questions to think about before reading a piece could be helpful to have and help the students try and understand what to be looking for in the texts.",
                "Strengths were the professor, the small setting (being that there were only seven of us), the trips to view art, and the essays:\r\nProfessor McGowan is brilliant, enough said on that part. \r\nI appreciated the fact that there wasn't a distressing amount of people stuffed into a classroom, it allowed me to relax.\r\nField trips are great for bonding and enabled me to connect the theories reviewed in-class onto real works in my hands.\r\nThe essays taught me what was expected on a university-level, I had never practiced or been as serious about writing as I had ever been this first semester.\r\n\r\nThe major weakness was the reading, there were times where I could not even think to finish reading 30 pages worth of a PDF in two nights.",
                "I really enjoyed the content in this course and I feel like the workload and homework was very reasonable and appropriate. I wish the readings were a bit simpler to understand, but the discussion of the readings during the class made up for it.",

                "Yes, especially if they have an interest in art. I think there is a lot to learn in this class and I found it very interesting.",
