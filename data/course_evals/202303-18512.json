I think it would be better if office hours had a certain theme (discussing lit review, data analysis etc). at least once per week in addition to broader office hours.",
                "Little to no structure or guidance, must be improved.",
                "Strengths of this course include an instillment of discipline and perseverance necessary for completing a project of this magnitude. It also provided me with collaboration skills and increased my adaptability. As for weaknesses, since the EP&E major covers such a broad range of subject matters, it was difficult to zero in on a specific essay topic; however, this is not necessarily a weakness, but perhaps even a strength because it has the potential to help students become better at identifying issues for which they are most passionate to write about. It was admittedly quite challenging to find an advisor who aligned with my research interests, so I recommend actively striving to get to know the Professors in any courses which you think could one day be related to your potential writing topic and being proactive in reaching out to potential advisors early."
