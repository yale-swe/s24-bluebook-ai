                "I learned a lot about the historical foundations for a lot of pre-Enlightenment ideas, from antiquity to the medieval period, and into the scholastic and humanist period. I also got a lot better at reading primary sources documents from the period, especially the more complex ones by classical or classical-enamored (the scholasticist and humanist) authors. So many insights, especially from my own knowledge about the epistemological tradition of the time proceeding the course, and the comparisons between them.",
                "In this summer courses, a learn a number of conceptsskills and insights in time sequence. Each of these has its own meaning during different time period. I would like to start with concepts. One of the most important concept we learn is the definition of Freedom. Before took part in this summer school, I actually don't have a clear understanding on this topic. After I finished the whole course, I understood that the discussion about freedom has to base on historical environment. This especially inspired me when Professor Sakal used this statement in our final exam as a question: Liberty but not Equality. Apart from that, an interesting thing I found in the western intellectual history is that everyone really love to \"claim\" something. From religious perspective to political perspective. From the Conversion of Saul, to the statement of a renaissance female.\r\nAs for skills, I have to say this course has improved my English oral and reading skills a lot. This is the first time I spent so much time with a group of foreign students and discussed a lot of stuffs. Apart from that, Professor Sakal also assigned a lot of reading materials which are quite difficult to me, especially when I was told I need to finish more than 4 reading materials in less than a week.\r\nThat's all, I really studied a lot of stuffs from this course.",
                "general knowledge of history and philosophical ideas. ability to compare philosophical ideas across different time periods. higher level discussion of historical trends. writing about historical events.",
                "I gained deep insights into ancient Greece and Rome and how they shape Western Europe's social and political landscape. Through readings and discussions, I realized much more continuities from classical civilizations.",
                "Learned a general history of Europe from ancient Greece to pre-Enlightenment era. Did a lot of readings and seminar discussions, so learned to read effectively and bring ideas to discussion.",
                "I learned about the connections between Ancient Greek and Roman thinkers and thinkers as recent as the Protestant Reformation. I was intrigued by how Western Intellectual history has built off of what came before it throughout the centuries. I developed the skill of being able to put an idea into the context of the ideas that came before it that influenced its formation.",
                "I learned about the origin of christianity, the rise of Rome and plenty of other stuffs about the western history. I also learnt several aspects to view historical facts and events. Through this course, not only did I gained methods to help me analyze those texts and articles, but also had experience of understanding thoughtful insights from my classmates and my professor. By speaking and discussing with them, I became more and more familiar with the class atmosphere in college and the pace of learning in small groups. That was a completely new area for me.",

                "Strengths: The instructor was absolutely terrific. Readings never felt like just a bulk of nothing, but they were often concise, rich primary sources. Lectures were terrific and complemented the readings, as did the discussions. No weaknesses. The final paper was a challenge, but I ended up writing something really interesting in my opinion.",
                "Interesting course material, thought provoking readings. Lectures were a little too long to stay focused the entire time.",
                "The course is very organized and logical, and the readings are very related to the class lectures and discussions, so they help a lot.",
                "The way the material was laid out and the order that we went through it was very conducive to learning and understanding the intellectual history and tradition of the West. The assignments in the course were appropriate for an online summer course, as we had two in-class exams (midterm and final). It would have been easy for a professor to only assign essays in an online course, so I appreciated the exam component.",
                "This course helped me with a brief concept of the entire western history. The professor had designed lots of class discussions to let us voice our thoughts and learn from each other. We had to coprehend those articles before class and get familiarize with them so that we can save time in class. In short, its a great opportunity to widen our knowledge base and horizons, and a nice occasion for high school students like me to be prepared for college. I don't think there's a apperant weakness for this course. If there has to be one, maybe I will say it has less opportunity to directly talk to our professor for paper work or exam evaluations.",
                "It was difficult to remain engaged during the back-to-back 1 hour lectures. The course focused too much on analyzing primary sources and not enough on the historical significance of the development of new ideas and ways of thinking. It was extremely helpful in understanding the historical context in which ideas emerged."

                "Yes, I enjoyed this course very much.",
                "Definitely.\r\nIt was the first time I read the Bible and other religious readings, and I found the relationships between reason and faith intriguing, and I was amazed by the \"modern aspects\" of classical civilizations and the continuities into the present.",
                "This is a fair course - it wasn't the most exciting/groundbreaking class I've ever taken, but I learned a lot from it, and it's a decent humanities credit. Workload isn't that bad either - reading load is fair, and I didn't find the essay/exams too difficult.",
                "Absolutely. Anyone interested in history, philosophy, or the humanities more broadly should be familiar with the basic framework of Western intellectual history, as it influences so much of the world, and particularly the United States, today. The layout of the material in the course made the concepts digestible and provided plenty of chronological reference points.",
                "Of course. For those who has interest in world history, it is definitely worth trying. It is not that challenging, since most of its articles and exams are just about the level we learnt. Besides, you have lots of opportunities in class to speak and that makes it a great chance to improve speaking skills. It also offers a  chance to write a paper on the topic you feel interest in, which is also perfect.",
                "No, it was difficult to pay attention during the lectures and the readings were mildly interesting. I enjoyed the discussion section, however, because the professor was fun to engage with and I enjoyed hearing my students interpretations of the readings."
