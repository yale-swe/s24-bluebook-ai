                "I learned a little bit about a lot of things. I learned a bit about how to manufacture parts with sheet metal, and with the band saw, drill press, lathe, and mill. I learned a bit about how to design circuit boards. I learned a bit about how to analyze stresses in beams and trusses, a bit about CAD and engineering drawings, and a bit about motors. That's pretty much the theme: you learn a bit about a bunch of things, all things which you'll learn a lot about later in the MENG curriculum if you stick with it.",
                "I learned how to iteratively design a project, use 3D printers, laser cutters, and milling machines.",
                "I learned many useful mechanical skills, such as machining, and theoretical skills such as truss analysis.",
                "I gained a lot of basic engineering knowledge I did not have before including sketching, truss analysis, stress analysis, manufacturing processes, design experience, Arduino coding, honestly I learned a lot and feel prepared for future engineering classes",
                "We gained an introduction into materials science, analyzing stress and trusses, and some coding. In the lab, we also gained an intro to machining with lathes and drills, 3D- printing, soldering, making circuit boards and breadboards, coding, and creating a solid project.",
                "I definitely learned engineering skills such as machining and PCB design. My highlights of the class were with Nicholas Bernardo and Kevin Ryan",
                "Basic engineering skills. A good introduction to some engineering processes",
                "We made a balance beam and I learnt how to use many tools to make this.",
                "I learned about the engineering design process and the skills needed to form an idea and bring it to fruition. I also learned basic engineering and physics concepts that relate to certain design processes.",
                "I definitely was able to get a good idea of what the engineering process looks like.  The project-based nature of the course allowed for iteration and problem-solving, which I think will be helpful for future projects.  Though I wouldn't say I gained a great understanding of every topic, I was able to get a foundation for a wide variety of engineering topics, which I think will set me up well to take future MECHE classes.",
                "This course developed on my pretty strong existing basis of Engineering knowledge. If you're reading this, and the instructor for when you want to take the course isn't Booth, this has no bearing, since the course changes wildly based on the instructor, but I did find that a lot of the things I learned were things that will be covered in later courses in the MENG sequence - statics, GD&T, bolt standards, or things that I don't believe should be covered in a MENG class at all, even though they were cool, like PCB design and PID control.",
                "I learned a broad range of skills, from manufacturing procedures to strength and deformation analysis (introductory level). I learned truss analysis and motor gear analysis\/evaluation. Along with methods to code sensors and other engineering topics.",
                "I learned a lot about problem solving and using resources and collaborating with peers. I also learned a lot about the design process.",
                "I learned a lot of the foundational aspects of Mechanical Engineering in this course. We covered a lot of topics from statics, manufacturing, elements of material science, programming, rapid prototyping, CAD, etc. I was able to build good\/solid foundations in each of these which will help as I progress through taking more Mechanical Engineering related classes.",

            "comments": [
                "Though I know part of the point of the course is to cover lots of material with little depth, this was a bit too far. Sometimes Dr. Booth would speed-talk his way through every type of screw head in 1 minute and then move on, with that never to be seen again. Or he'd spend 2 minutes talking about how molds should be properly designed for lost wax casting. Cool I guess, but kind of a waste of time. Another difficulty is that because there's so much breadth, we hardly do any practice work in class. So, when you sit down with the pset, you realize you have no idea what to do, and the only examples Dr. Booth works through in class are extremely complicated and under-explained. The course should build up this base of knowledge better, starting with simple examples and fully explaining equations, then working up to complex examples. Also, we received negligible feedback on problem sets. For example, no psets were graded until 3 days before the first midterm, at which point Dr. Booth graded all the psets but provided no comments on what went wrong, and no answer key to figure out how you could have done it right!\r\n\r\nThe main lab project is pretty cool though!",
                "Weaknesses include: the course was very unorganized, especially towards the beginning of the semester. A lot of time, we would be working on the lab portion of the course, and we would be given information\/project criteria after we had started building our design.",
                "Strengths: Booth is a very nice professor and wonderful to work with in office hours, super helpful and understanding, we learned a lot in this class, I feel really prepared to take more engineering classes, Weaknesses: I'm sure others will say it but the class was a bit disorganized at times",
                "This course was fantastic in the amount of stuff covered. I leave with my first fully developed engineering project ever, and a new outlook on what I am capable of. At the same time, many parts of this course were very disorganized and\/or unclear exactly what we were supposed to be doing and how it led to the next week. Because of this, some weeks we would have next to nothing, other weeks I was putting hours of time into this class outside of the lectures and lab, which are already a lot of time. Now that I am done with it, I am happy with the course, but during it I was not prepared for a lot of what happened.",
                "Organization of this course was definitely a weakness. However, I felt that this problem improved after spring break.",
                "Lectures were hard to follow",
                "I think that the organization of the course can be tweaked. Some weeks were disproportionally content heavy, and others were quite light (consider the stress analysis week vs the soldering week). Moving topics around, and potentially not dividing the class exactly in half at the spring break might ease the timing problems.",
                "Could be more organised.",
                "I think the course could have benefited from more well-organized lectures, but the lab sections were very helpful and taught me a lot about hands-on machining and engineering work.",
                "I think the main strength of this course lies in the project we worked on for the duration of the semester.  I think going through each step over a long period of time was helpful in understanding, at least fundamentally, what was going on along the way.  However, I think certain aspects of this course could have been more well organized.  The labs and PSETS often covered material not explicitly discussed in lecture, making some of the concepts difficult to grasp at first.",
                "This course could be improved if lectures and labs were more coordinated with one another so that students learned in lecture things that were applicable to the lab of the same or the following week.",
                "Strengths: all the information seems usable and it provided a great foundation for other courses\r\nWeakness: unclear examples and confusing explanations. When we learned a topic it felt incredibly rushed and led to lots of confusion and trouble with the homework. Just do introductory examples, not complicated ones, and build-up to it.",
                "I think it was really cool to be able to work on a project throughout the course and then have it work at the end. I really enjoyed the labs. I also liked that we covered a lot of different topics during lectures, although sometimes they felt very rushed. Perhaps having longer lecture times could be helpful.",
                "This class' biggest strength is that it introduces you to what Mechanical Engineering is like and gives you exposure to a lot of what it will be. As a result, a lot of information is covered and there is a lot of work that needs to be done in the labs. This unfortunately is a weakness for this class. There was just an absurd amount of work at times that needed to be done for problem sets, pre and post-lab assignments, and just time to process and make sense of content. At times it was very overwhelming. Overall, did I learn a lot? Yes, but because I needed to commit so much time to it. To improve, I think the structure just needs to be simplified a little bit. At times, it felt like 4 years of mechanical engineering condensed into a semester. I think I learned the most doing the project, so maybe simplifying the amount of work for Problem Sets would help.",
                "This was a very poorly organized class, but it came together in the end.",
                "Perhaps longer lecture times and having the lab count as half a credit like most other labs at Yale"

                "Depends. If you're set on MENG, then sure. You won't learn anything you don't learn again later, but it's fine. If you're not set on MENG (as I was) and are thinking of taking 185 to see if MENG is for you, this course is probably not right. That's because MENG 185 is not really representative of what the core engineering sequence looks like (all breadth no depth), plus the course is not very well run. I was hoping to come away with a clear sense of whether I liked MENG, but I actually came away knowing that I didn't like 185, but still not sure about MENG!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another person who is interest in learning the basics of engineering.",
                "Yeah absolutely, you learn a lot and make friends in your major. I know so much more about basic engineering concepts than before and I enjoyed making the final project which we worked on throughout the semester. Booth is a bit disorganized at times but overall really nice and helpful. I enjoyed the class",
                "I mean it's required for most people who are taking it, but yes I would. Just be prepared to put in a lot of time outside of class. The work is not really that difficult, but it takes a while to work on the project and find times where you can go into the CEID or work with one of the ULAs or help staff. Leaving the class with a much more complete view of the engineering process.",
                "If you're ABET, this is required. If not, I'd recommend it because it's a great introduction to design and an overview of what mechanical engineering involves.",
                "Yes. Useful skills",
                "For a mechanical engineer, certainly. Its required for the major, and provide a high level overview of the major topics. You wont walk away knowing how to design something well, but youll be aware of what professors to talk to, what internet guides to read, and where to compound your information to start making more complex ideas come true.",
                "I enjoyed the project so I could recommend it for this.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is required to take it for their major (so any mechanical engineer) because what it teaches is useful, only it could be presented in a better way.",
                "I would recommend this course because it gave me a good foundation in engineering generally.  I think if a student doesn't have much background in engineering, this course would be good for establishing some fundamental concepts before taking more advanced courses.  Though it may feel overly difficult in the middle of the semester, if you keep up with the assignments, it will fall into place in the end.",
                "I would if they were also MechE. Taking the course with Dr. Booth allows you to learn a lot about a lot and creates a great foundation. However, I would advise patience and a friendly attitude to make friends in the class or else you'll be very lost.",
                "I would recommend it to anyone that wants a taste of what mechanical engineering might be like.",
                "If you are debating whether to major in Mechanical Engineering or not, I would recommend this class. This class will be a lot of work with a lot of content, but if there is some element of satisfaction related to what you are doing, then you know the major is right for you. However, if you recognize that you are no longer interested in Mechanical Engineering, you might be stuck with a lot of work that may not have much meaning for you. So, in my recommendation, I would say, anticipate it to be very hard but if you are interested in this major, it will be rewarding in the long run.",
                "I think if this were a survey course it would be much more useful, but as it is, I didnt find it particularly helpful nor insightful.",
