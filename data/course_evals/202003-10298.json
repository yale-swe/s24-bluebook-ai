                "I learned a variety of methods to better comprehend societal issues. I don't think I have ever learned more in a class that was more meaningful than in this one. I think what I learned in this course will carry out into all my other courses and life.",
                "I learned so much from this course. The critical frameworks that we explored over the course of the semester fed my engagement with other courses, and ER&M 300 is well organized to facilitate learning and growth over the course of the semester. I grew as a critical thinker, and have become more able to analyze my own position as a student and scholar.",
                "Key terminology and concepts from across the field of critical ethnic studies were central to this course.",
                "I especially learned the importance of connecting class content to conversation that occurs outside of the university, emphasizing the relationship between ethnic studies and lived experiences.",
                "This is one of the most impactful and meta classes I've taken - we're ethnic students studying the history of ethnic studies. It was amazing to learn about how much is at stake with ethnic studies and how important student protests were in the creation and sustaining of the major. We also got to engage with famous ethnic studies theorists.",
                "I developed a keen understanding of ethnic analysis and different modes of relationality.",
                "The course gave us an overview of the relationship between scholarship, organizing, and resistance ranging from student protests in the 1960s to present-day movements like Black Lives Matter and the Standing Rock struggle."

                "Professor Tran and our TF, Patricia, were wonderful leaders of discussion who always opened up the conversation to students for fruitful discussion, but always made sure that we were getting to some of the critical themes relating to the lesson. We also had a great class that was always open to discussing the topics presented throughout the unit. I think broadening the class assignments so that we weren't as focused on citing texts read in class would be a good improvement.",
                "Little to no weaknesses when it came to the content. Professor Tran created a great reading selection. I think the class is too long for the number of people. If it were smaller or if the class was shorter or if there were more break out rooms it would all work better. Bringing in the guest speakers was awesome. I think having smaller assignments throughout the semester would help to gauge our writing because two big assignments were not enough.",
                "This course is overall very strong; the organization of the course helps students become more comfortable with probing their own relationship with the course material. I also appreciated the assignments in this course, as the midterm paper fit well within the broader scope of the course, and the options for the final paper allowed me to really make the course my own. Potentially, the course could be improved by asking for slightly shorter discussion posts\/asking for discussion questions, which may have made the Canvas thread more fruitful or encouraged students to engage with their peers' writing at a deeper level.",
                "Weaknesses: The class size was far too large (2 instructors and 26 students for a seminar setting);This made participation in seminar difficult. Strengths: Professor Tran and Patricia were amazing facilitators and discussion leaders. Their feedback always engaged student work intimately and they were always available for office hours!",
                "I most appreciated the small breakout rooms, especially in a virtual format, because they facilitated less stressful conversation.",
                "I really appreciated all the readings, speaker events, and virtual tours. However, since the readings were all really dense, some more basic analysis, defining key terms and themes would have been helpful!",
                "Everything about this course was well-thought out and I appreciated all the detail!",
                "I believe that while the readings each week were very interesting and engaging, the course itself was a bit scattered.",
                "This class was my most difficult of the semester both because of the content and because of the course's lack of adaptation to a virtual format. The reading load was the heaviest of any of my five classes and did not seem to take into account the pandemic and I was frequently stressed by the expectation that I was supposed to do such a heavy reading load. The instructors don't do a rundown of the readings at the start of class (you just jump into discussion) - so if you have difficulty in understanding the material you will be left behind. The assignments of the course lack structure leading to immense confusion and just more stress. On top of this, you maybe get a 3 minute break during the nearly 2 hour seminar which was exhausting. Because of all of this - I didn't feel like I got a lot from the course (even though it's a requirement of the major) and it was just a hassle to keep up with. I would definitely not recommend taking this course in a virtual format or if you are taking more than 4 classes.",
                "Though some of the readings provided helpful insights into and problematized the university, academia, and normative, Western ideals of knowledge production, our class discussions often fell flat and felt redundant. It would've been nice to have a more engaging class structure and assignments that allowed us to truly think through the texts rather than just busy work.",
                "One main strength of this course is the multi-media content. While we did a lot of reading, we were also assigned to listen to podcasts, and peruse through walking tours or online art gallery exhibits. This was a refreshing change of rhythm compared to my other courses whose homework was often exclusively restricted to hundreds of pages of reading. I found the variety of media to be an effective strategy for tying together larger class themes because they were able to deliver multiple perspectives and arguments that were felt more poignantly as a result of the creative presentation. Another strength was the flexibility for the final. I appreciate the ability to take more agency over the assignment by being able to choose between a traditional research paper, designing a group project, or doing volunteer work. I chose to volunteer as an ESL tutor with Elena's Light, and it was one of the most impactful experiences that I got to reflect on at the end of the semester."

                "It was clear that lots of effort had been put in to adapting conversations with people outside of our class to the virtual format. From our virtual tour of the YUAG to our discussion with the Yale Prison Education Initiative, these conversations were very well-facilitated in the Zoom format.",
                "Professor Tran was understanding of what was going on and adjusted accordingly. I think giving longer extensions on certain work would have been better but it was still more than other courses.",
                "This course was a solid Zoom seminar, I think in large part because most of the students were excited and happy to engage. I think that popcorn style discussions work well, which came through in this setting. The museum visits were also very engaging, so maybe adding a third or even fourth of those opportunities would help increase engagement.",
                "I loved all the virtual events, speakers, and tours that we had in this class. However in a relatively large seminar I would have appreciated more small group discussions to better get to know other students and engage more in depth with class material.",

These facts, combined with the great syllabus and insightful instruction of the professor and the TF would certainly make me recommend the class to another student.",

                "YES! For all my ER&M majors, this course is required, but even if it wasn't, I would strongly recommend it anyway! I found all of the readings to be interesting, and the organization of the syllabus allowed us plenty of room to be critical of arguments we encounter both in the classroom and in our daily lives. We're also asked to attend ER&M events and write about them, and it felt less like work, but rather an opportunity to learn about topics we were interested in, and then connect them to class themes. This course solidified my love for ER&M and pushed me to stay optimistic during this painful year."
