            "comments": [
                "Strengths: very organized course schedule, including frequent office hours\/help sessions. There were many opportunities to ask questions. \r\nWeaknesses: not much room for creativity in assignments, codes must be completed a certain way.",
                "It's a really well-taught course. It seems almost tailor-made for online learning. It was a very fair course, too. The exams were a little annoying in that there was no way to finish on time, but Prof. Bennett was very aware of how the class did and curved them accordingly. Additionally, the last pset and final project were a little annoying and harder to debug because we didn't write the main program. But besides that, it is a fantastic course and I highly recommend taking it if you want a solid introduction to coding.",
                "I cannot suggest any improvements. This was a great course and I love Professor Bennett.",
                "There were plenty of office hours, extra help was offered, and all faculty was quick to respond to emails.",
                "Strengths: INCREDIBLE support and very helpful prof. There are an insane amount of Office hours\/drop-in help sessions with ULAs and TAs to help you work through psets that save you an immense amount of time. I didn't start going to them until about halfway through the semester, but once I did it was life-saving and I couldn't have been happier. Definitely use them earlier as there are at times very nit-picky grading criteria on the psets so office hours are a great way to double-check everything. Also word to the wise--Beth's office hours (just her, no one else) are not as helpful for actually getting the pset done. You can definitely learn concepts from her, but will not make much progress with your code. If you want to get your pset done faster, go to the drop-in help hours with the ULAs: most of the time they are much more laid back and usually code alongside you with the pset solution on their end. If you bother them enough and show that you understand how to do something they usually will tell you how to write your code as the pset solution is. Mileage varied based on the ULA but once you find the laid back ones it's life changing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The exams and some of the pset concepts are really annoying, AND QT IS A HORRIBLE, SPAWN OF DEMONS IDE. I cannot tell you how many times I wanted to drop-kick my laptop out of my window because of this god awful programming environment. If you have a mac, buckle up for a horrible experience. Output files will not be visible, graphing windows will not be formatted properly, and you will have to manually drag ALL of your input files into the terminal. I wasted countless hours debugging my psets trying to find output files and making sure graphs looked right, and it's so frustrating having to run a virtual windows desktop just to debug your code every time you need to change something. \r\n\r\nAlso, the psets with the graphing windows are so ridiculously useless. You're given a mountain of source code to make sure the boomer propriety QT IDE works with the code you have to write, but how is this at all useful for engineers or scientists??? WE WILL NEVER HAVE TO CREATE OUR OWN DAMN GRAPHS USING C OR C++, THAT IS WHAT MATLAB WAS INVENTED FOR!!!! In this vein, the final project (creating a 3d solid object viewer w\/ c++), Pset 9 (game of life graphic viewer) and the C psets with the graphing window seemed like pure sadism on the part of Beth. I would much rather spend more time on matlab or working with C++ OOP concepts that I would actually see in the real world than working with QT's awful interface which I will never use again after this class. Luckily the exams don't focus on the graphing but such a great amount of class time is wasted just because of QT's uselessness",
                "Strengths: Quite honestly, this was an extremely well-designed, well-organized, and well-executed course.  Dr. Bennett's lectures were clear, she was very communicative with students, and never once was I confused about submitting assignments or finding helpful review material.  The numerous office hours were wonderful.  I also really enjoyed the psets because they felt very relevant to actual engineering problems, and although some of them were challenging, they were always doable.  I could see exactly how I was applying the skills we learned in class.\r\nWeaknesses: There were no major weaknesses! I know that this problem may be inevitable, but the only thing I would improve is that with the more difficult assignments, waiting to get help at office hours could take a very long time.",
                "It was very well organized and thought out.",
                "This class was amazing. Beth is a marvel. Everything about this class (slides, psets, lectures, exams) was so well organized and put together in a way that made learning the material in this class feel effortless.",
                "The course really builds from the ground up, and the material covered on the last day of class can be traced all the way back to foundation laid on the first day. The assignments do a great job of building on class material, and the pace of the class didn't seem too fast or slow.",
                "The most well organized course I have ever taken. Dr. Bennett is a great, caring professor and teaches the class so well. You gain a good understanding of C and C++. You also get a good introduction to MATLAB.",
                "The course was taught very well. I appreciated the emphasis on showing code and seeing actual output. Thsi was very helpful when I went to attempt to use skills myself.",
                "The course is very organized and has many extra help session\/office hours to help student get 1 on 1 help if they need it",
                "Professor Bennett's lecture slides were always incredibly well-organized and helpful, both during lectures and when I went back to review them on my own.",
                "Strengths of this class are the online office hours, the TAs, and the amazing Professor Bennett.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bennett -- She is one of the best professors I have had at Yale!! Her lectures were always so clear and made difficult concepts seem simple! She also had several office hours a week, so I never felt like I didn't know where to go if I had a question or confusion. She so clearly cares about each student individually, made sure to get to know everyone's name and at least one detail about their life (she had \"10 minute chats\" with each person in the rather large class to get to know them!). Another big strength of the class is the number of drop in help sessions (on top of Prof Bennett's office hours). There were so many at such variety of times that I could always find at least 3 or 4 a week that worked with my schedule. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only thing I can think of is that Qt can be very annoying with Macs, but I didn't find it to be too big of an issue",
                "Prof. Bennett is the biggest strength; her explanations are clear and thorough, and she's kind and patient. She also made sure to supply plenty of drop-in sessions for help with problem sets. The only potential weakness is that the lectures moved a little bit too slowly for me, but I know that other people requested a slower pace, and this is by no means a serious hindrance.",
                "This course is incredibly well structured and planned out. The resources are great and the structure is perfect for learning. The teaching was very well organized and the problem sets are difficult but are a great learning process.",
                "It is a great course, but the organization of the Canvas site could be much improved.",
                "This course was extremely strong. Dr. Bennet explains the concepts very precisely, and there were plenty of help sessions, so I never felt like I could not grasp the material.",
                "The strengths of the course are in the teaching and the amount of help available to students. Office hours are available almost every day of the week, ensuring that students can get the help they need. The weakness lies in the sheer amount of work given. The psets took me an excessive amount of time while simultaneously having work for other classes. Additionally, I think the lengths of the exams and the corresponding time given did not match up reasonably. I also think that the grading of psets were quite harsh considering some students were coding for the very first time.",
                "The course was very beneficial in terms of allowing you to be adaptable in your coding skills by forcing you to change languages however I felt as if the MatLab portion was extremely short and that I did not gain\/retain much skill in the software. Especially since Matlab is commonly used in many research opportunities for undergraduates and since it is more fundamentally different from C than C++ is, I would have found it beneficial to spend a little more time in that software.",
                "This course is extremely well organized. The flow from learning C first to MATLAB and then C++ allows the course to not feel too overwhelming. The pace of the material is very quick so it could be easy to fall behind but there was a ton of opportunities to get help."

Being able to have lecture notes and sample codes pulled up on my own device during lectures was extremely conducive to my learning. The office hours and help sessions often had long-ish wait times, but the use of a \"help queue\" made it pretty organized and fair.",

                "I think all of the online learning practices in this course were great. I do think that 1 hour and 15 minutes is a long time for a virtual lecture because it is harder to stay engaged online than it is in the classroom, but that is not specific to this course. I also really appreciated the zoom chats to help us have some connection with the professor and our classmates.",
                "This course's live lectures were nice, however, at times they were not too engaging and struggled to keep my attention over the computer.",
                "The lectures were given virtually and the professor utilized screen-sharing and powerpoint features. Additionally, virtual office hours and breakout rooms were used and successful in enabling students to get help.",
                "This course worked great online because the course is taught through PowerPoint and compilers anyways. Additionally, the availability of codes through canvas was extremely beneficial to get extra help. I also really appreciated the use of Ed discussion which allowed students to ask simple questions on their own time without having to go to office hours or other help times.",
                "The lectures on zoom went very smoothly and the office hours as well sometimes had long waits but that was fixed towards the end of the semester and overall it was better than expected.",
                "There was not engagement with other students in the course due to the psets being non-collaborative, and the class time being a lecture, but the course itself was well adapted to the virtual learning environment. For one, code could be easily screenshared, which was a good help during lectures and office hours."

I thought that I was going down that path at the beginning of the semester, but ended up switching majors halfway through rendering this class pretty useless. If you have taken cs50, a lot of the C part of this class is pure review however I did learn a bit of matlab and a lot about C++ object-oriented programming. If you don't have to take this class for a major req, I would highly recommend CPSC 200 as you will learn about python and OOP without having to deal with some of this class's shortcomings. Too much time is wasted graphing with C\/C++ in the GOD AWFUL IDE called QT, which significantly hinders one's ability to actual take away practical skills. Beth is a pretty dry lecturer but is a great watch on 2x speed. I don't know if I would survive tho if I had to attend her lectures in person at a regular pace.",
                "Yes!!! This course is structured, organized, and executed so well.  There are so many office hours, and Dr. Bennett is a very clear lecturer and also genuinely cares about her students.  It was really fun to see some of the end results of our assignments.  This class was challenging in a good way--in a way that reminded me why I love learning.",
                "Yes if they wanted to learn the coding languages taught.",
                "Yes, even if your aren't thinking about engineering, this class is a great introductory computer science course. Though this class is mainly geared towards students with some initial programming experience, it is still possible to do well in this class without any prior knowledge (though you may have to put in more work).",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially ones with limited programming experience. It covers very useful programming languages, and the assignments and projects are great practice. You come out of the course feeling like you've learned a lot.",
                "I would recommend this course. The course reviewed many languages. The applications were very stimulating and made me excited about further possibilities in coding.",
                "Its a good introduction to coding so yes I would. But they do expect you to have a little background on coding",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone looking to learn C or C++ (it touches on Matlab, but we only spent two weeks on it as opposed to six to eight weeks on each of C and C++). The material is presented in a sensible order and at a reasonable pace. I had prior programming experience before taking this course, which probably contributed to why I found it on the easy side, but I believe it would also be very helpful for anyone looking to learn programming for the first time.",
                "Yes",
                "If an engineering student wants to learn how to code, then this would be the perfect class to take. So yes.",
                "YES! Especially if taught by Professor Bennett.",
                "Yes! It's a great introduction to programming for non-CS majors (definitely take this class over courses in the CS department if you're able!), and the instructor cannot be beaten.",
                "Yes, this is the perfect introduction to computer science especially for beginners and quick learners who like the application side.",
                "Yes, this is a good intro course for computer science, but it is fairly high workload.",
                "Definitely! It is well taught and gives you a broad look at the computer science realm.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student who is interested in or has a use for the topic. In coding classes in general it can be easy to get lost, but Dr. Bennett explains the concepts so precisely that I never found that to be the case in her class. The class is very wel organized: the assignments are clear and engaging, the lecture slides are a great resource, there are plentiful opportunities to get help, and I liked that the tests allowed us to use resources like we would be able to in a job scenario.",
                "Yes! This course is a good class to take if you have never worked with code before and need to gain some experience with respect to the realm of engineering.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are pursuing engineering and to students okay with a high-workload class.",
                "Yes. Beth Anne is a wonderful professor and while the course is geared towards students with a small amount of coding background, I found it to be a very beneficial introduction to coding. It is a great place to start if you want to begin learning how to code especially in lower order languages.",
                "Yes! If you want to have a good introduction to coding, this is a good course to learn C and C++. The MATLAB part of the course is brief but allows you to get a decent enough idea of how to use it.",
                "Yes, the class is taught well, and goes over lots of material concerning programming in certain programs, as well as gives general coding problem solving skills. The psets can be long and challenging, but the end results are always interesting and relevant."
