The last 1/3 of the course was an introduction to quantum mechanics, concluding with Bell's theorem.",

                "Professor Harris is a skilled lecturer who deeply understands the material. The textbook aligns well with the material, making it more manageable to learn. The exams sometimes don't align well with the connect being taught, which is frustrating, but its well worth the quality of teaching that professor harris offers.",
                "Better exams, more engaging discussion of the core matter. The quantum excursion was well-motivated and relativity OK but the other parts of semester were taught very meh, the textbook much clearer and more engaging than lectures.",
                "Strengths: getting a broad overview of many topics in E&M (plus quantum mechanics). Professor Harris is a great lecturer, and TA office hours are very helpful if you still don't understand something.\r\nWeaknesses: honestly, the only major weakness is the grading. The midterms/final often don't feel reflective of everything that we learned in the class, typically focusing less on physical principles and more on the types of problems that Professor Harris likes (which typically involve long/messy integrals). In addition, there were occasionally errors in both problem set and midterm grading, which was quite frustrating.",
                "The strength of this course probably lies in the depth of knowledge it presents the students with. The PSETs and lectures more or less force the student to internalize the most important concepts of E&M and QM lest they be left behind, while simultaneously strengthening their problem-solving and mathematical skills.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I feel like the curriculum was a little unbalanced - we spent quite a lot of time on electro- and magnetostatics only to have to rush through to the complete Maxwell's equations in a few short weeks, which left me reeling. Because the same textbook is used for PHYS 430, it was a difficult read and practice problems were hard to find without them being wildly more complicated than anything expected on an exam.",
                "Great TAs, a nice derivation of many topics, a solid buildup of quantum mechanics. \r\nPracticing for exams was a little bit like trying to hit the bullseye while blindfolded. No practice problems were provided.",
                "Professor Harris is an absolutely amazing lecturer and you will learn a lot by taking this class. It goes a bit fast in some parts, which is natural since this is an intensive course."

                "YES!! if you're deeply interested in physics. This is the course for you.",
                "If the student has a strong interest in Physics and is willing to struggle alone, or if they have already completed similar coursework in high school and have a background of competing in Physics competitions I would recommend this class. Otherwise, there are better less stressful options such as PHYS 200.",
                "Overall, I would 100% recommend this class. If you took Physics 260 in the fall, you know what you're getting yourself into261 is almost identical to 260 in both structure and difficulty (if anything, the psets in 261 are easier than those in 260 and get easier as the year goes on). Professor Harris is a great lecturer, and you learn a lot about E&M (and a little bit of QM). Of course, the workload is high, and many problem sets do take 10-15+ hours to complete (in addition to the time that it takes to understand the material). I am not a physics major and am still glad I took this class, but if you want a less intensive class and/or to get a better grade while still learning the same general material, Physics 201 is a great choice to take instead for both physics majors and non-physics majors.",
                "Yes. 261 is well taught and effectively introduces you to E&M and quantum physics.",
                "Yes, but do not take it on a high-workload semester.",
                "Yes, but only if they can accurately gauge their ability to prioritize the class ahead of time - for people going into the class without training beyond the AP Physics C level, it demands a lot of attention.",
                "For those studying fields related to physics, yes. For those who are very good at physics and interested, yes. Otherwise, no.",
                "Yes, but be aware that the grading can be VERY unfair sometimes, and there can be mistakes on the exams/psets solutions, which usually take a lot of time to be fixed.",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend if you have already taken AP Physics C in high school. Even if you have not but still love physics, still consider it. I really enjoyed it and you will learn a lot."
