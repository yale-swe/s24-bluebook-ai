I also strengthened my reading and comprehension skills of Arabic by developing strategies to comprehend various types of Arabic texts, including newspaper articles and travel guides. I also developed my listening skills and my conversational skills in Arabic through classroom settings in which the instructor and the students were expected to speak in Arabic solely for the length of the class.",

                "The professor is absolutely fantastic! Honestly, one of the best professors I have had at Yale and that is not an exaggeration. He truly cares about the students that I have never seen at Yale or ever in my learning experiences as a student. One weakness is that the teaching assistants can be a little slow with grading, but overall great class with very little weaknesses.",
                "This course was great in terms of conducting conversation and allowing practice with speaking and reading, with little to no pressure at all. The homework assignments and additional resources were really helpful. However, I think it could be improved by focusing less on correcting homework and more on teaching/reviewing grammar concepts during class time.",
                "Strengths: Professor Elbousty is extremely knowledgeable about Arabic and very understanding of students' needs. He is an amazing professor, and if you have the opportunity to take a class with him, or talk to him for study abroad, you definitely should!",
                "The main strength is definitely Professor Elbousty. He is the most amazing, kind and understanding professor. The PowerPoints summarizing the units really contributed to my learning as well. \r\nThe main weakness is that language classes are probably much better in person and there's more opportunity for interaction and communication in the language.",
                "Overall, given the constraints of learning a language virtually because of the pandemic, the course was effective in maximizing the growth of our knowledge and usage of the Arabic language. I especially think designating some classes as solely Arabic-speaking days in class was extremely helpful in developing our listening skills as we listened to our classmates speak and developing our speaking skills as we were often forced to formulate Arabic sentences and phrases on the spot. The classes in which we tackled long readings for enriching our knowledge of Arabic as we were able to see how the grammatical concepts that we had learned were put into practice. The readings were also useful in enriching our knowledge of the cultural aspects associated with the Arabic language. I also appreciated how it was emphasized throughout the class that it was possible to construct a sentence with the same meaning in different ways with different grammatical structures, and on a similar note, I appreciated the emphasis on how translation from Arabic to English and vice-versa was not always directly possible. \r\nOverall, I do not think there were not many weaknesses to the class. This course could have benefited from meeting everyday like during non-COVID times, but of course, that is a tough ask with class being over Zoom. With regards to content, I think that the class would have benefited from a greater and more in-depth discussion of morphology, including how to use Arabic morphology and the Arabic root system to deduce meanings of words in the context of readings."

                "For when class returns to in-person instruction, I think that posting prerecorded lectures discussing grammatical content on the weekends would be beneficial in order to focus in-class time on practice and application of grammatical rules and concepts. I also think reducing the number of exercises for homework assignments in the absence of the companion website was actually beneficial and something that may be considered in the long-run. I think that focusing on a fewer number of exercises brought an depth of quality that may have been reduced by a great quantity of exercises, as we would not have been able to discuss each exercise in such depth. The speakers brought into to talk to the sections collectively were a good, enriching break from continuous content review, but they did not make or break the class in any capacity.",

                "Yes! I've now taken both L1 and L2 with Professor Elbousty, and I would highly recommend you take it with him if possible. He is a fantastic teacher, personable, and truly cares about his students. A lot of this was stated in my last review, but I will restate it here. He will even hold extra sessions before tests to make sure everyone who needs a little extra help gets it. The TA for this class was also very helpful and sections were largely focused on things that people had difficulty with, so make sure to use this to your advantage. Make sure you do all the homework as well, as learning a language really requires daily application of it. I took this class as a virtual seminar during the COVID-19 pandemic and still learned a lot of Arabic, despite already knowing how to speak a specific dialect. You will learn how to hold multiple conversations, grammatical structure, reading comprehension, and will be able to write about a number of topics by the end of the class."
