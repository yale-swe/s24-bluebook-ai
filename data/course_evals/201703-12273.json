    "The strengths of this course were that it was intensive and covered a great breadth of material. There were few weaknesses but I think the course should have involved more review of old material throghout.",
    "The class moves much faster than any high school course and having the class in Spanish everyday makes you learn extremely fast.  The process of learning in class and then doing extra activities daily outside of class is really effective as well.",
    "Strength: very thorough foundation of spanish.\r\nweakness: course moves too quickly considering the class if full immersion."

    "Absolutely! This course was a perfect intro level spanis hcrouse.",
    "Obviously if you are taking Spanish, then this class will be required unless you place out.  But the class is actually very good, I do recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course with Professor Lourdes Sab. She is a wonderful instructor who really cared about the development of each student in the course. Through in-class exercises and the occasional hot-seat moment when Professor Sab calls on students at random, the course really helped me develop a confidence with speaking a new language.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if that student understands the time demands of the course outside of the class.",
