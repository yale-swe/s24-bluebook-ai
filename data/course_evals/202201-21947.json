                "Learned about adverse selection, signalling, communication, updating, herding, advising. This class gave me a new way to think about how to interpret the actions of others by applying higher order thinking. Lots of aspects of real life involve signalling and you need to think to interpret them. Greatly improved presentation skills.",

If you plan on taking any game theory class, this class is a great complement to the theoretical framework you will likely study there. It definitely made my foray into game theory a lot more approachable since I was able to see how the concepts I was learning about in class were being utilized by researchers.",
                "The most valuable skill I learned in this class was how to read, understand, analyze, and apply high level economics paper's and literature. I also really feel that I did learn about the economics of information, learning, and communication: exactly what the course is named. I could not speak more highly of this economics seminar and what I learned in it.",

                "The course is very well-designed. Mira has clearly put a lot of thought into constructing the class, and the content is very interesting.",
                "No weaknesses. Mira is a consummate lecturer. She is so kind and very much cares about learning. I would recommend allowing some more input onto which papers should be read based on class interest. Other than that the course ran very well and she definitely allowed us to learn",
                "I think this course is pretty chill and you still learn a lot. The material can be quite difficult sometimes so I'd say listen seriously to the prereqs listed in the syllabus. It can be especially challenging when you have to write long reading responses but don't really know what's happening.",
                "Mira is wonderful. Highly recommend.",
                "Strengths: The weekly evaluations of papers encourage in depth engagement with the papers that form the core of the class. Do not let the mathematical rigor of the papers frighten you. Professor Frick is an amazing guide and mentor. She has a special talent in reducing the most difficult of mathematical concepts to very simple and intuitive explanations. Furthermore, there is very clear feedback throughout the entirety of the course.",
                "I LOVED this course! There are so many strengths of this course, I honestly don't want to spend 5-10 minutes naming all of them. \r\n\r\nThe only comment I would make for improvement would be to provide more direction for the critical assessment. I feel like I was told to be concise in the critical assessment, so I only tried to include things I thought were integral to the paper I choose. However, the things I found to be implied or simply just adding length to the paper were what caused me to do poorly on it. Moreover, I feel as if I was told to not repeat exactly what the paper stated, but in trying to put the paper into my own words I received comments that seemed to indicate my critical evaluation would have been better if I had just restated what the paper had said. \r\n\r\nThat suggestion for improvement being said, I absolutely loved the course, and understand that the critical assessment was supposed to be a difficult assignment. I honestly enjoyed doing it, but think it would have been useful to have a better understanding of what a good critical assessment looks like.",
                "This course is great: the readings were chosen well, student presentation format was nice, lectures were clear. There are no weaknesses that I can think of.",
                "Strengths: Mira is amazing\r\n\r\nThis isn't really a weakness, but I wish Mira could have lectured more. I understood and enjoyed the material much more when it was taught by Mira than when it was presented by other students.",
                "Strengths - the hands on presentations of the papers were very educational, and Mira was an incredible professor\r\nWeaknesses: very easy to disengage on weeks you're not presenting."

            "comments": [
                "Yes! The economic papers are intimidating, but Mira really helps you understand them (especially for the presentations - she really goes through and clearly explains things that you do not understand when you meet with her). It was really an awesome class!",
                "Yes, extremely. Professor Frick is phenomenal.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to anyone with the relevant technical preparations. Mira is very clear about what the actual prerequisites are, and while I can only speak for myself, I think her assessment of what constitutes good additional background knowledge is right: the class isn't a ton of work but I think if I'd taken it before analysis, 351, etc., I would have both fared worse and enjoyed it much less: the class really \"clicks\" when you can see the connections between the models and the real-world concepts they map to. \r\n\r\nIf you do have the prereqs covered, I think it's a great class for a few reasons: (1) you get to explore topics in econ that aren't really covered much in other courses. Most of the theory classes of the major are working with much more general models (like big macro models in 121\/125 or essentially the Arrow-Debreu model in 121\/125\/350. By contrast, a lot of the other upper-level seminars have a more empirical bent. This class is theoretical, but the models are more specific than in the core econ courses, and cover a lot of applications where one might not expect economic forces to be as relevant a priori.  (2) This class is a great opportunity to hone presentation skills. You'll get lots of practice writing papers and taking exams in other courses, but much less exposure to presenting things. \r\n\r\nLastly, I would note that the difficulty rating for this course has been historically low, but I wouldn't take that as a sign one should just take this as an \"easy fifth class\": you could get away with doing not a ton of work (perhaps to the detriment of your grade), but I just don't think one would get much out of the class without putting at least a good amount of effort into their own presentations. In particular,  getting a headstart on the presentations and having a complete draft of slides when you send them to Mira (if she keeps that format) is especially useful because she gives very thorough feedback and catches lots of mistakes.",
                "This was my favorite class I've taken at Yale. The workload was perfect for a spring senior seminar, meaning it didn't take too much time. However, I still was intellectually engaged with the material and thought the whole class was super interesting. Mira is really nice and a great teacher. She is so observant and is really good at nipping mistakes and misunderstandings in the bud. Definitely would say students should take this class.",
                "I would! I would especially recommend it to econ\/math majors or those with a very strong math background. If you don't, I'd say proceed with caution because the concepts can get quite complicated sometimes. Mira tries really hard to make it accessible (and she's great!) but it's hard to write about such math topics sometimes.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. I dare say it may be one of the best Econ seminars you could ever take. No cap",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It requires a lot of engagement with the material and critical thinking. However, for anyone interested in the intersectionality between economics and mathematics through the lens of micro theory and more game theoretical concepts, this is a must-take class.",
                "YES! This course is designed to help students learn and explore interesting topics. Moreover, Professor Frick took the time to realize how heavy the workload of the course was, and was nice enough to reduce our workload through removing one of the critical assessments from the syllabus. This really demonstrated that the course was not meant to overwhelm us (as the presentations did take up an extreme amount of time and the weekly responses took a decent amount of time), demonstrated that Professor Frick cared us about people and as students, and allowed us to focus on learning the material rather than scrambling to complete all of the assignments.",
                "YES! Great class. interesting, chill, low workload. And Mira is so sweet. Its a great senior seminar",
                "Yes, I'd 100% recommend this course. The readings were fascinating, the lectures were clear, and Mira is incredibly knowledgeable. The topics discussed were also highly applicable to a variety of economic (and other) applications.",
                "Yes, do yourself a favor and take this course, especially if you need a Econ 400 class to fulfill major requirements.",
