This course gave me new insight on why major financial phenomena (recessions, inflation, financial crises) occur, how the current macroeconomic system operates (banking system, money creation), and gave me analytical skills that I could apply to hypothetical scenarios on our homework and exams.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths - Professor Amand is an incredibly talented lecturer. One of a kind. The PSETs being for completion also allowed for less stress. Exams were very fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - None, other than the curve (which is the Econ department's fault, not Amands)",
                "I appreciated the small size of this course and the opportunities for students to ask questions  during lecture. I think it saves time and effort to clarify concepts when they are initially explained, rather than being confused for longer as you try to work on problem sets. I also appreciated the office hours held by the professor himself twice a week. Because of the small class size, these office hours were never overly crowded, and I never left with any of my questions unanswered. Similarly I felt that review sessions before exams provided me with adequate time to ask every single one of my questions. I appreciated the Canvas quizzes at the beginning of the semester because I thought they were a great way to review the material as we learned it and make sure we understood everything. I wish that these had continued throughout the semester.",
                "The seminar aspect of this course was undeniably worth the hassle of getting in. This course encourages curiosity with the course material that generates a deeper understanding of the topics we covered. The length of each class and the smaller number of topics makes this class feel well-paced and provided time to digest each concept, especially with reasonably sized problem sets. However, the seminar had a strict curve from the economics department that made the exams extremely important and, as a result, very stressful. Still, the course is worth the work.",
                "Strengths were the curriculum. If you missed class and he was teaching with chalk, you might have problems getting the notes, but the prof was also very approachable and helpful.",
                "The curve is so harsh. I know it is set by the Econ department, so this is not a complaint of the course, but the Econ department.",
                "Professor Amand is great, and the concepts are pretty interesting. I think the weaknesses are the same general weaknesses as other Yale econ classes: the curve is harsh and the class is more model based than I would love. But if those things don't bother you, it's a good intro econ class.",
                "Great all around course. Only weakness was that the office hour times were a little difficult to get to.",
                "The way the professor graded the problem sets made it easier for me to do them without stressing over getting the right answer. I feel like I was able to learn better and get more enjoyment out of the course.",
                "Econ 111 definitely has a personable feel as a result of the smaller class size which I enjoyed.  I wish there was more homework than problem sets.",
                "I like that this seminar focused more on the workings of the financial system and less on models in comparison to the lecture.",
                "Strengths- The teacher is great. The class was engaging so I thought it was better than the lectures. \r\nWeakness- Nothing too big. Maybe getting feedback was a bit slow",
                "The size of this course is one of its virtues. The smaller class size is great. Also, the way the problem sets are assigned for completion was very nice because it made me actually want to try instead of just stressing about being correct. The workload is manageable but I do think it would be beneficial to provide some more study materials to help outside of lecture studying because I had a hard time studying for the midterm and final.",

                "TAKE THIS CLASS. Even if you don't need it for the major, this class was truly one of a kind and professor Amand is honestly one of the best professors I've had at Yale. He teaches the concepts and the seminar format not only allows but encourages questions to deepen understanding. I can confidently say that I know the concepts taught in this class by heart. If you're picking between this and ECON 116, please please please take this if there's room. You won't regret it.",
                "Would recommend. But don't think you're getting a seminar experience; this is a lecture with a smaller audience. Depending on your learning style, you may find that most of your learning needs to happen on your own, through managing p-sets and reading the (optional) textbook. Know your needs before you enroll.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It was well taught, well organized, and had relevant content.",
                "Yes. This course forces students to apply economic concepts on their own as the professor would often ask what we think would be the result of a certain thing happening or what we would do in certain positions (EX how we would solve the 2008 financial crisis as he explained the central bank's policy in this time). This approach, the space to ask questions, and the completion-based problem sets make this course one that encourages learning for the sake of learning even if the exams and curve make some periods harder.",
                "Everyone should take this class. We should all have baseline macro knowledge about the economy, banks, money supply, crypto etc.",
                "Yes if taught by Professor Amand. This is a much better choice than the lecture! Professor Amand uses a lot of real life example to illustrate abstract macro concepts, and his presentation is really well organized. The course facilitates great learning habits, as many things are graded based on effort. Everyone who is interested in Econ should take this.",
                "I think it's a totally good intro econ option. Professor Amand is fantastic. There are benefits to taking 116 over 111 -- the curve is easier and you will have more friends in the class. But don't fret if you have to take 111 for schedule reasons like I did. It is a good class.",
                "YES. so so so much better than the lecture.",
                "Yes, Marnix is an amazing professor.",
                "This class is good if youre looking for an introductory economics class with more direct support from the professor. I personally preferred this seminar class over my lecture class from first semester.",
                "Yes! I would 100% recommend this course to another student. The class size makes the class personable, Professor Amand is amazing and you will learn a lot!",
                "The content was super interesting and helpful!",
                "Yes. I think the basics of macroeconomics are good to understand and this class provides that. The class isn't super difficult and you get to understand and learn how recessions happen. Overall I think macro applies more to real life than micro",
                "Yes! I took the lecture version of micro and found this smaller macro class to be much better suited to my learning style. I found I engaged much more with the material and was much more excited about the class.",
                "Yes, for econ major. Material is basic/broad so probably not well suited to a niche interest, but definitely a good course to provide you with a solid foundation of economic knowledge"
