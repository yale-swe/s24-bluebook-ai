                "Learned about the structure of Ancient Greek and English language. Learned some historical linguistics on top of vocabulary words, declensions, conjugations, etc that one might expect. Read, translated, and discussed the entirety of Platos Apology.",
                "I learned the necessary grammar and vocabulary to read prose in Ancient Greek. By the end of the course, I was able to read Plato's Apology with guidance from dictionaries, peers, and my professor. I also learned more about English grammar in the process.",
                "The obvious one is that I acquired reading knowledge of Attic Greek, as well as basic understanding of different Greek dialects (Koine, Ionic, Doric). At a deeper level, though, I gained a much deeper understanding and appreciation for language in general. I became a much better writer in English, and I started noticing elements of style that never would have registered otherwise. Additionally, I gained a basic knowledge of linguistic\/philological methods, and how various languages deriving from Proto-Indo-European are related.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: interesting language, liked devoting the last few weeks to a single text (Apology), intensive nature allowed us to learn a lot in a short time, Professor was flexible about not preparing for class every day\r\nWeaknesses: 9:25am every day, felt very Euro-centric even for a Classics course, could rely solely on notes instead of truly knowing all the verb endings",
                "Strengths: the course is extremely rewarding, as you are able to read actual Greek prose and drama after a few weeks of the semester; Professor Robinson is fantastic and truly cares about each student's academic success as well as emotional well-being. \r\nWeaknesses: the course moves really quickly, but that's a function of an intensive language class; reviewing basic grammar more often would have helped; it's very grammar-oriented, so be prepared to learn technical terms related to syntax (which I actually think is good, but it can feel overwhelming).",
                "This is such a great course. I loved how quickly we jumped into reading actual Greek texts, reading the Apology really helped to solidify the concepts from the first half of the semester, and all the work I did felt really worthwhile. I really can think of few ways to improve this class, except maybe more chances to review what we already learned as we went through Hansen & Quinn, because I wasn't always sure if I was missing some crucial detail -- but I know that it is hard to set aside time for review in such a fast-paced course!",
                "A huge strength of this course is the pacing. I didn't believe Professor Robinson when he told us at the beginning of the term that we would be able to read New Testament Greek by the middle of the term, but he was absolutely correct. This course will push you in the best possible way. Additionally, the rigor with which Professor Robinson teaches is unparalleled. Everything, even the \"irregularities\" of the language, is explained in terms of systems and paradigms. In other language courses I've taken, irregularities were taught only by rote memory, but for GREK 125, they were explained in formulaic terms that allowed me to parse through irregularities that we hadn't even talked about in class. All of the strengths boil down to Professor Robinson. He is an incredible professor in every way. His passion for Greek is obvious and infectious. He made me excited to contribute in class, and often encouraged the class to offer alternative translations for whatever passage we were reading. Every single person I've talked to who has taken GREK 125 has raved about him, and for good reason.\r\n\r\nI genuinely cannot think of any weaknesses, but I will provide a warning for future students: this course is a lot of work, and you will have to be very self-motivated to stay on top of things.",
                "Phenomenal course. Learned a lot in a relaxed fashion."

                "The conversation in this class frequently revolved around the perfection of western culture (art, language, music even). So I dont think Id recommend this course to another POC for fear that theyd feel uncomfortable, unless theyre already familiar with Classics at Yale. Otherwise, this is a really cool language which would be hard to learn after college. I wouldnt want anyone with a genuine interest in the language to be daunted by the fact that this course is intensive. I was able to manage it without too much difficulty.",
                "Absolutely! This course, I feel, is the best introduction to Greek that you can possibly get. Although I'm sure the traditional L1 and L2 tracks (year-long) are great at solidifying foundations, for people who are a bit restless like myself, it was fantastic that we would get to read authors like Aristotle and Euripides halfway through the semester. It is a lot of work, though, so be prepared to spend at least 2 hours per day reviewing Greek outside of class. I would also recommend learning the Greek alphabet before entering the class (or over break) as this will make the first week or so a bit smoother. Professor Robinson is incredible, and has made what could be a very stressful course fun and inclusive; he understands that students are stressed and genuinely wants to help you. He is also knowledgeable about the content and has an incredible grasp of Greek, so having him as a Professor was a definite plus to my Greek learning.",
                "If you are at all interested in Greek, you should take this class. The workload might seem unmanageable, and it would be with any other professor, but Professor Robinson is very understanding and will help you out if you're struggling. The literature we read is incredible -- the Apology and Medea are (of course) amazing, but even the snippets of poetry that we read in Hansen and Quinn blew my mind. I came in with no knowledge of Greek or Latin, and I really can't overstate how amazing it is to get to the end of the semester and realize that I can read anything I want in Attic Greek. I think this is the best way to learn the language, because you are thrown in headfirst and exposed to it every day. I imagine it is as close to an immersion language class as you can get with an ancient language. Really, take this class. You won't regret it.",
                "I would not recommend this course to every Yale student, but if you are considering the course at all, you should absolutely take it. It will be a lot of work (probably at least 4 hours a day), but it will be absolutely worth it. Knowing Ancient Greek will not only unlock a body of extremely rich culture, it will make you understand what language is at the deepest possible level. This is the best course for that end. Even if you don't end up studying classics, you will improve immensely as a writer and a human being for having taken this course.",
                "Yes, definitely. This is the best class I've taken at Yale."
