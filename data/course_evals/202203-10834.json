The weakness was the course packet. This homework tool is simply out of date. The exercises were largely unhelpful, and the french department should consider changing part of the class. Additionally, there were too many assignments. There seemed to always be a test, quiz, or paper. In addition to the nightly homework (1-1:30 hours), the course was an overwhelming amount of work.",
