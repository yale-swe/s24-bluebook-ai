                "The professor is such an amazing teacher, and he does an awesome job explaining really difficult topics in a way that makes sense to people who may not have a great background in neuroscience. I was rarely ever confused in this course, and I felt extremely prepared for all exams.",
                "This course definitely definitely would benefit from having problem sets. There is so much information to learn that simple post class Canvas worksheets would help students absorb the information much better.",
                "Strenght - the TAs were always there to help answer questions \r\nWeakness - the course structure makes it really difficult to have a good grade without being so heavily dependent on exam grades\r\nHomework or other grade balancers would be great so the exams are not so stressful",
                "I wish there was more engagement throughout the semester and that less of the grade was midterm\/final",
                "The strength is that it goes over the most important researches in the field, which is something almost impossible to do studying on your own. The weakness is that although there's a lot of topics that I would've loved to discuss with others about, we didn't have sections, so we couldn't.",
                "The content gets really interesting, but the lecture style is a little boring so it can be hard to pay attention.",
                "I found the class extremely informative, well thought out, and appropriately difficult. I would've loved to have had some homework assignments throughout the semester to feel better prepared for the kind of material that would be asked on the exam.",
                "I think it is extremely effective to teach the material though experiments, as Professor Chang did this semester.",
                "Strengths: very comprehensive, interesting content, useful content\r\nWeaknesses: cant think of any!",
                "professor chang was SOOO AMAZING! so kind, so understanding and just reasonable! \r\n\r\nhw super manageable, tests VERY fair",
                "While you learn a lot of interesting material in the class, each lecture covers a lot of content, which can be overwhelming come exam time.",
                "Very well thought class. Each exam counts for a big part of the grade",
                "Strengths: Interesting content, relatively easy to follow. The lectures are very understandable and the slides are well-designed for study outside of class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there were quizzes\/checkpoints along the way. They don't have to be graded, but they would provide a good benchmark for understanding at different points throughout the course.",
                "maybe a few more smaller assignments so that the two exams dont count for so much of the grade.",
                "Strength - very low work load, only three assignments (midterm, one paper, and a final). The test questions come directly from the slides, so if you are familiar with the slides, you will be able to do well on the tests. Office hours are available and helpful.\r\nWeakness - none of the readings are required, and there isn't a regular check of knowledge, which means that this class falls to the bottom of your effort and engagement.",
                "Professor Chang is a thorough and engaging lecturer, and the content itself is incredibly fascinating. However, the format of the class is rather repetitive and sometimes overwhelming, in that lecture consists of just reviewing important studies for the entire class period.",
                "strengths: lectures were super interesting\r\n\r\nweakness: no week to week work. you need to pace yourself to keep up with the lectures and adequately prepare for exams",
                "Strengths - very clear lectures with a lot of content\r\nWeaknesses - only work is two exams and a short paper, so there is not much engagement with the material until the exams. I think maybe some weekly homeworks or short quizzes might be helpful to allow yourself to know how well you are understanding the material before the exams",
                "I think the lectures in this course and the tfs were great.",
                "I think the content was interesting but lectures did not feel engaging.",
                "A major strength is that Professor Chang's lectures are pretty interesting and engaging. A weakness is that the midterm and the final were weighted very heavily, so a bulk of the grade for the course relied on these two exams."

                "Absolutely. Even people who aren't neuroscience majors could really thrive in this class, although it definitely is for STEM majors. I think this course is a really good low commitment class to take, that doesn't take up much of you time but is really rewarding.",
                "I would not. The Human Brain prerequisite did not seem to help students much, and students who are non-science majors were definitely at a disadvantage.",
                "Not really, unless required for the major or you do not mind your grade dependent solely on two exams and learning large amounts of material at a time (ex. experiments and lots of concepts)",
                "only if you have to take it or are super interested",
                "This was a great class. It wasn't too memorization heavy and the lectures were fairly engaging. Steve is a great teacher. Definitely worth taking if you want a general overview of brain functioning. PSYC 160 is listed as a prerequisite, but I took the two at the same time and found a lot of overlap in material. 335 focuses more on big picture things and concepts of brain functioning, whereas 160 is much more detail-oriented. The only down side to this course is the lack of feedback on exams. You have to schedule a visit to office hours to see your exams, which is always a pain. Besides that, the only grades are a final paper, the midterm, and the final exam. So you really aren't sure of how you are doing until the midterm, which is always scary. But the exams were both very fair and graded very generously, so don't worry too much about them.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in psychology\/philosophy, this class could be a great introduction to the underlining mechanisms of human behaviors that we can observe.",
                "I think if the lectures were a little more engaging then I would recommend this course.",
                "Yes absolutely!! I think this course provides key insights into the research findings that define foundational theories and facts of cognitive neuroscience.",

                "Yes if you're interested in the topics! I think we learned a lot.",
                "YEP! professor and TAs were so helpful and always available. super fair class --> actually had you learn and apply :)",
                "Definitely yes but need to keep up with lectures",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with a potential interest in neuroscience. This course provides a broad introduction to the field of cognitive neuroscience by introducing a variety of interesting experiments. The various studies we learned about were all very insightful.",
                "While it has a low workload there is a steep learning curve if you have not taken any courses similar to this. This sounds pretty obvious but I say it because it was not something I had considered seriously. All in all though solid class, nice prof",
                "If they are interested in the sciences, this may be a good course to check out!",
                "I would recommend it if you are looking for an interesting science credit with a low workload. It was cool to learn about the features of cognition that I hadn't had the vocabulary to think about before. \r\nI would not recommend it if you are looking for dynamic and engaging lectures. It is difficult to engage with the topics if you aren't really dedicated to the knowledge, because other classes with more required work take precedence.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course, particularly if you are taking it for your major or have a deep interest in neuroscience. It was intellectually challenging, but I really felt like I was learning so much. Professor Chang is a highly knowledgeable lecturer.",
                "yes! i took it as a science credit and although it wasnt a gut, it was super worth it and i learned a lot",
                "Yes! I think there is a lot of important material covered, and you will learn a lot, but I also think it's difficult to prepare for the exams because there's no work beforehand.",
                "Definitely, one of the best options to complete the Systems req for Neuro major.",
                "Best class I have ever taken at Yale, and the best professor to take it with.",
                "Yes, I think this is interesting stuff, even if you are not a neuroscience Major you can still do wel and enjoy the course.",
                "I would if you are very driven to learn the material on your own.",
                "Yes! I don't think it's the easiest possible science credit, but if you're remotely interested in cognitive neuroscience, I would say it's worth taking!",
                "Yes, this course is very manageable if you have the proper expectations. I am not a PSYC or Neuro major, so I have no previous understanding of the brain or its function. However, if you have previous understanding, than this class is very very manageable and quite enjoyable."
