                "The pre-class videos prepared me for the content I was going to learn next class, but the pre-class quizzes were sometimes very difficult. Although I cannot speak for all lecturers/professors, Andrew Yarmola knew the content very well and taught it in a way that was easy to understand. Some psets were long, but they prepared you for the exam very well. The smaller sections were nice (instead of a big lecture).",
                "This course moves very quickly, but there are plenty of lecture notes and resources available to clarify any confusion.",
                "The course videos and pre-class quizzes are very helpful if you do them. You come to class prepared and have a pretty decent understanding of the concepts.",
                "A main strength of the course was how they managed to divide a big enrollment to smaller class sections",
                "The content itself is interesting, and so was Prof. Yarmola's teaching style. I especially enjoyed when the class drew comparisons to real world examples of math in action, such as flux in a physics context. All the guided notes were easy to access. Ximera was a great resource. Prof. Yarmola was great at office hours and always take immense time and effort to make sure his students understood a concept.\r\n\r\nHowever, I thought the locations of TA office hours were not posted clearly. Other classes (such as PHYS 200) would post office hours onto the canvas calendar and send notifications out about office hour times/location changes/etc. I didn't even know there were Mon-Thurs office hours and WLH until late November, because some office hours would be posted in a clear location while the most frequent office hours (the WLH ones) weren't. The finals review sessions were useful and in depth--especially with the slide shows--but the midterm review sessions were usually too slow to be useful. I thought that the practice papers for the final did not reflect the breadth and focus of the content of the actual content--for example, I was suprised at the amount of first trimester content in the final, because the practice finals did not have nearly as much.",
                "I think this course is very well organized and the weekly problem sets are very helpful in understanding the topics. I learned so many things in this course that it felt like I took two courses at once, just because the amount of different topics we covered. However, I think the class instructions and the weekly problem sets did a good job of helping students understand the many topics discussed.",
                "The way this class is graded is extremely difficult. If a student bombs a single exam, they have to fight to pass for the rest of the course. Additionally, PSETs are worth barely any points. A final exam being worth half the grade for a course for mostly first semester first years is a lot.",
                "I think a great strength is that there's a huge support system for students who need additional help with material. I think the instruction is very clear and concise and easy to digest. A weakness would be that the course is very fast paced, and I think it would benefit instructors and students to have extra time to better solidify new concepts.",
                "I think the massive amount of content that is covered throughout the semester discourages students from wanting to gain deeper understandings of the topics they are learning. I also found that the problem sets required more knowledge than was provided in class alone. I found pre-class videos extremely helpful as they allowed me to digest the material in my own time."

You have to have a strong grasp of integrals and how calculus works to be successful in this course. I would say I understood Calc II pretty well, but I still had my fair share of struggles with the sheer amount of content you have to learn in very little time. If you do take this course, talk to other students, including students in other sections. You do not have to do PSETs alone, and honestly, you probably shouldn't. However, multivariable calculus is really interesting, especially Stokes/Greens/Divergence Theorem. If you remember the jump from arithmetic to algebra or algebra to calc I, that's what this class feels like--get help with the foundational skills asap.",
