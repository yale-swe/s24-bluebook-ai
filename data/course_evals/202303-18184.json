I learned about so many cool theories that are actually rooted in and applicable to lived experience, and were really really beautiful. The portfolio assignment was a unique way to find places in my own life where this theory showed up outside of the classroom and helped me ground my learning in reality.",

                "The strengths are the professor's relationship with the works which then allows the students to flourish. However, a weakness is a students commitment to the materials given weekly. Although that is largely a given responsibility for the student, I felt like the material was definitely not regarded on a similar scale of importance once in-class discussion actually began. While I would read the majority of the assigned readings, the 1-2 that I didn't get the chance to touch were the most focused upon. A hierarchy of materials per week would be great! The extra readings are also extremely welcome. Genuinely all of the material covered was just amazing, I wish there was more time to give it all equal love and appreciation.",
                "One of the strengths of the course was the syllabus. I thought the readings and films and other course materials were genuinely interesting, accessible and enjoyable to work through. Prof. Vargas is also a huuugee strength! They are sooooo knowledgable about queer/trans Latinx life, and bring so much to this class. They also care so deeply not only about students' learning, but also about our overall wellbeing. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses. This course was really meaningful and transformational for me!",
                "Strengths: Insightful readings, supportive professor, good learning environment \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very dense readings at times and easy to lose focus of them at times due to the high page numbers.",
                "Strengths include the inclusion of all our voices and experiences to the class discussions and the timeliness of the topics we discussed to the issues that queer trans latinx communities face now."

                "A million times yes! The works read and seen were all incredibly impressionable. Even while writing this I can distinctly remember scenes from a variety of films and experiences described throughout texts. I can also see myself rereading a lot of the novels that were assigned for this course. It was all relatable, and did make me tear up...quite often. You become emotionally attached to a lot of the material, something that--at least for me--is not often found in Yale's courses.",
                "YES. This is such a wonderful, wonderful class! I felt like I was really submerged in the field of Latnix queer/trans studies through a variety of engaging materials. Class discussions are interesting, and the assignments are meaningful, but not too much. Also, Prof. Vargas is so so awesome!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it focuses on underrepresented communities engagingly and creatively, especially with our final project being a portfolio of materials rather than a traditional essay. It is a new experience that challenges you to approach the material innovatively.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Professor Vargas curated a wonderful learning environment that made me excited to do the readings and go to class."
