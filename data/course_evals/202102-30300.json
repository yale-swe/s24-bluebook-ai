                "This class exposed me to true discussion. In school I participate in Socratic seminars, but it is a lot more structured\/guided than the discussions we had in YSS. I feel that the less structured discussions were still extremely productive (if not more), and there was more of an opportunity to learn from my peers. The required readings were thought-provoking and inspired me to research some topics (such as academic freedom and political correctness) further; this class made me realize my passion for First Amendment law and debate.",
                "I developed knowledge on the First Amendment in the United States, the history behind it, the specifics of it, the different interpretations it may have, and how it is involved in many situations which are important to our nation's democracy. I developed knowledge about the 'fighting words' doctrine, free speech at universities, true threats, free speech involved in flag burning, and more. I have also gained some insight in how specific laws or legal principles work.",
                "I learned about how Supreme Court jurisprudence has protected the First Amendment throughout history and how attached Americans are to this right. I learned to see Supreme Court cases in a different light and how to agree and argue with different points of view.",
                "From taking this course, I learned not only how to advance my legal analysis, but I learned how to engage in discussion on ethical principles of legal thought and critically analyzing texts from a neutral perspective. From reading opinion articles to watching documentaries, I felt as if the course allowed me to gain a deeper insight into the many nuanced details of the first amendment and its ethical obligations on free speech. Not only were I able to further develop the skillsets and knowledge that I already knew, the discussion with like-minded students and students with differing opinions helped assist me in obtaining a more complete narrative of the subject. I felt as if my skills in relation to writing analytical essays improved, as the daily homework and discussions provoked me to think more about issues that I hadn't previously considered to begin with.",
                "In this course I learned to read legal texts and got used to some of the English legal vocabulary. I also improved my skills in discussing with others. Furthermore, I developed insights in regards to understanding precedents, the American legal system, especially in connection to the special protection of free speech under the First Amendment, and working with Supreme Court decisions and comparing the free speech protection from other countries with the ones in the American legal system in our mid term and final exam.",
                "Knowledge of the First Amendment, including Supreme Court precedent and legal standards, as well as ethical questions surrounding free speech.",
                "I learned a lot about the first amendment and the laws around it, as well as landmark cases and ethical theories governing the United States. My critical writing skills improved throughout the course."

            "comments": [
                "The only weakness I can identify is that our discussions were too short! 3 hour classes might have been more appreciated because we had so much to say and discuss. I loved this class and wouldnt recommend any other change.",
                "strengths:\r\n- Very interesting in the cases we study and the documentarys we watch\r\n- The conversation is led by the students and everyone gets a chance to express their opinion\r\n- Assignments are mostly free of instructions, you can right about what you find interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- A lot of material to read and analyse in a short time (not really something that can be improved)",
                "I believe the strengths of this course are that the heavy homework load and the inquisitive questioning really provokes the student to engage in deep thought and personal reflection with their own personal principles. It engages the students' personal biases and attempts to shed light on potential different routes of thinking. I also think that another strength with the course was its transparency on what was expected on assignments, and the guiding discussions that were shared prior to class starting. One thing that I did consider a weakness of the course was how heavily regulated the class discussion was at times. Being in a virtual format made it difficult without doubt to engage in seamless conversation, but the discussion style really revolved around the instructor calling on people with their hands raised. I would have thought that if the virtual format was going to be continued, that it would adopt something similar to a round-table or harkness table discussion, where any student that wished to contribute would just unmute and speak up, instead of having to stick to a long order of speakers. I recounted that at times, the order\/line for speakers became too long to the extent where even the students and the instructor would forget who was supposed to speak next. And at other times, the thought or contributions that a student might have had to input may have lost its relevance to the conversation.",
                "I liked about the course that the texts we had to read were interesting to discuss. The class was challenging but in a positive way and the reading responses always kept me thinking about certain issues which I really enjoyed. Class discussion was also always interesting and the questions our instructor asked were encouraging our discussions. The mid-term and final questions were also well-chosen and I liked especially the question for our final exam because the case of Charlie Hebdo which we wrote about is a case that was in the news all around the world. Even though the course was focused on the First Amendment of the American constitution, I really liked that the final exam introduced an international insight on the issue of free speech. The course overall was multifaceted and the content we learned was well-organized into the five weeks we had. \r\nThe only thing that I could think about to improve would be to minimize the assigned material within the weeks in which we write our final and mid term exam. For example, I had one week in which I completed the material we had assigned relatively fast and the week of our final exam had a lot of assigned material. However, I am not sure if it is possible to actually distribute the material differently because it was with regard to the content well organized. If distributing the amount of assigned work before class differently would mess up the overall organization of the course, I would not like the different distribution and would leave the course as it is without suggesting anything that could be improved.",
                "I think the strengths are the professor and the continual discussion of cases. I think that it could be improved by bringing in more guest speakers."

                "Absolutely. Discussion was always productive, robust, and lively. I often leave class feeling fulfilled, mentally stimulated, and eager to do more research. It is an amazing class, and being surrounded by others who are just as excited to learn and consider different points of view also adds a lot to the quality of the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I believe they will benefit from learning about the First Amendment and the ethics of many situations that have taken place in the United States which are related to the First Amendment. I also believe it is important for students to understand the First Amendment in order to allow democracy to thrive.",
                "I would recommend this to someone who is trying to get an overall perspective on the right to Free speech.",
                "I would without a doubt recommend this course to another student. The course material and the questions we answered provoked a lot of thought, and I felt as if my personal ethics and perception on free speech and its ethics underwent a lot of change during the ten classes I took. I would be wary to tell other students to expect a heavy course load during this time, but I would still recommend the course to anyone with a remote interest in the legal and ethical elements of free speech law.",
                "I personally would definitely recommend the course to another student because the course was extremely interesting to me. I had the chance to learn a lot of new things and develop skills regarding the discussion with others and the understanding of complicated legal documents. Even though the course was not just a law course, I think that the course is very interesting for people that think about studying law, as I do. I always looked forward to participating in class. The course really challenged me because it was the first time I had a course in connection to the legal field. However, the challenge always felt good and exciting and was not overwhelming or discouraging. This is why, I would strongly recommend the course to another student that is willing to actively participate in class and is motivated to prepare a lot of work for class especially when this student is interested in the legal field.",
                "Yes! Professor Goodrow is a great professor and I feel like I can make much smarter arguments about the First Amendment than I could make before.",
                "I would defiantly recommend this course to another student because of the thought provoking questions I left the class with."
