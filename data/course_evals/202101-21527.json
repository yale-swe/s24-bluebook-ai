                "The strengths of this course lie in its resources: the TAs, the peer tutors, the professor, and the preceptor. The textbook is also excellent in guiding our learning. However, the slides given before lecture could contain more key information.",
                "Good class I like the professor!",
                "I had to take this course as a prerequisite for MCDB, so I did not always find the material super engaging. But much of the material was fascinating and I did learn some new problem solving skills and approaches. The main weaknesses of the course are the fault of the pandemicwe can't see the cool in-person demonstrations and we had to do our assignments through Canvas and Sapling (the latter a truly godawful platform)",
                "A little bit hard to follow when the professor didn't follow the textbook. I found we skipped over a lot of material in lectures which was okay when we were following the textbook, but challenging otherwise",
                "Strengths: Discussion sections were extremely helpful to more fully understand the content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like the subject matter was a little disorganized and I was unsure what was going to be a concept I needed to study and what was just a very convoluted example.",
                "The textbook did more of the teaching than lecture, for sometimes the lecture was not really adding to my knowledge of chemistry.",
                "It was great having so many resources for this course. (However, it was a little overwhelming at the beginning of the semester trying to keep track of all of the peer tutors and TFs and everything, but I guess that's a good problem.) Sapling was fabulous and I'm glad there was at least some opportunity for partial credit on exams (as opposed to the GenChem I). I also love that we could drop our lowest midterm. It took some stress off.",
                "The strengths of this course was the depth of the topics covered in lecture, as well as the manner in which and clarity with which the topics were covered in lecture and reviewed in discussion sections, as well as the optional midterm review sessions. The problem sets and reading questions on Sapling helped students practice the concepts and calculations covered in lecture, while the midterms were fairly administered. A possible weakness of this course was the way in which some of the more complicated topics were taught, such as in the introduction to organic chemistry unit.",
                "more focus on test-type questions in lecture would help. I love hearing about real life applications, but it usually makes me feel like I understand the content and don't need to study more. When I get to the test it turns out I don't understand the content ):  Sapling was the most helpful part of the course for me, along with Hannah's website",
                "I don't have any suggestions for improvement. I appreciated the accessibility of the TFs and the fact that lectures were both offered live and as recorded videos.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- covered the necessary general chemistry requirements\r\n- exams and grading was fair\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- lectures were not very helpful",
                "Lectures were very boring. Parr got off topic a lot and went overtime by 5-10 minutes everyday. Making the lectures more interesting would help, although I understand it is tough to do so over Zoom.",
                "I liked the overall structure of the course, but sometimes lectures seemed unfocused and scattered. The course would really benefit from some reorganization.",
                "The course is fine. It is the second gen-chem class and as such consists of a hodgepodge of topics. While the middle units flow together nicely (kinetics->equilibrium->acid/base->thermodynamics), other parts of the class feel a little more thrown together. Additionally, it was sometimes unclear what information and skills were expected of us and what were not.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Parr is an excellent lecturer. He was extremely enthusiastic, and this made the lectures very engaging. The PSETs were designed well, and I feel like they really helped learn the concepts well. The sapling feedback was extremely thorough, and I really appreciated the explanations. Likewise, the lecture slides were also designed well, so it was easy to follow along.\r\n \r\nWeakness: None. While I could nitpick small things, I think any flaws were inevitable with the pandemic. Overall, I thought the class was structured very well.",
                "Im not sure what the course could to improve. It was very well set up and seems fairly optimized for the times.",
                "lectures were hard to follow if it was your first time seeing the material, tests were very difficult, time zones made it hard to go to office hours. however, making the psets optional was a great relief in the second half of the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Parr's attitude--sometimes positive and humorous. Hannah and her willingness to explain concepts in a tidy manner. Most TFs in the way they were available. PEER TUTORS! All very kind people with very great intentions of supporting you, if you ask the right questions.\r\nWeaknesses: there are simply too many for me. The lectures, very fast-paced and not well organized, were difficult to follow most of the time (which is a lot considering the sheer number of lectures one must have gone to), and overall not engaging. Communication before lecture regarding class materials was scarce and unhelpful. The connection of material between the problem sets, lectures, and discussion sections felt fragmented and incoherent. All of these unorganized and unbalanced parts of the course inevitably led to unsure expectations for students. The expectations for learning were never set at any point in the semester, so students were only given vague statements about midterms and the final in a way that was not helpful for organizing their thoughts. Whether they succeeded or not was based solely on their ability to synthesize the material themselves without any guiding support from the instructors. The formulation of midterms was also not conducive to learning nor proper studying. They almost felt like an assessment of one's understanding of the fringes of the material rather than the core of it.\r\nOverall, I do not think it is acceptable to conduct a course, especially a Yale course, in the way this one was conducted. This did not meet my expectations, especially during a virtual year. I expected more support from the instructors in their organization of the course.",
                "The course was well-structured and the topics were interesting and succinctly covered. Sometimes the lectures would go off on tangents and it was hard to know what material we were responsible for on the tests. The tests were clear and not made to trick you which was really helpful. They tested if you knew the material in a way that made me inspired to study and not dread the exams.",
                "STOP creating midterms with questions that are dependent on getting the previous questions right? It's not a true assessment of what concepts a student is good with and which ones they are not!. Like if i'm better a different concept but I got the previous question wrong then there is no chance of assessing what i'm good at and not. Which means I can't get credit for what I actually know. Very frustrating. One of the biggest frustrations were the peer tutors. It was like pulling tooth and nail to get them to use the white board during zoom meetings for examples. And the worst part is that several times when we had questions, peer tutors literally said \"I'm sorry but this was so long ago for me, I don't know,\" \"Yeah there are so many K constants I can't remember what this one means,\" and so many other trash statements. it's like......WHAT?! WHY ARE YOU HERE! It's absolutely frustrating when you have to wait for these sessions, time it with other study sessions you may need for other classes, only to get a \"sorry\" or lazy teaching. Like looking at a student ask a question, literally asking for an example for a concept, and the tutors just verbalize in the most abstract way....LIKE USE THE WHITE BOARD!! \r\n\r\nAs far as mid-term testing, I said it for CHEM1 as well. If you're going to use Sapling for practice, then you should be gearing discussion sections and midterms with similar style questions. If the midterm is going to be created by you then we should not be using sapling if these questions aren't yours. Because the wording between the professors and sapling has so many opportunities to look completely foreign from each other. And it's disheartening to study all these ways the question can be asked on sapling just to take the mid-term and can't really decipher professor-created questions. And the instructions for the midterm should be on a screen before we press \"take quiz\" because I don't want to waste time reading the instructions and guide for taking the quiz and time is running out. What's worse is, I can't raise my hand to get immediate clarification on a question or the look of a question with different symbols or abbreviations from sapling. I would have to email and wait for a response for clarification......during a timed test! does that even sound right. So if anything, these mid terms should be live zoomed with the ability to raise your hand and the professor or proctor can take you into a break-out room to clarify if needed. But the biggest factor for me is I feel that the professor and study sessions and homework should have all been created by the professor and not used sapling. Just to get used to how he words them or how he wants us to understand concepts. Because these professors have too much leeway and it often translates to seriously abstract questions that are kind of undesired in a general chem class. Not everyone is here because they want to be. So it would have been nice to keep the fact that this is an introductory class in mind when creating questions. Basically consistency",
                "I taught the material to myself using the textbook. The lectures were not always clear and were hard to take notes from and get all of the information",
                "This course was good at providing options for accessing lectures for people who weren't able to access the lectures or needed to revisit them later. However, for Gen Chem II, there need to be more mechanisms in place for students who haven't had a strong background in science before coming to Yale. An option similar to the Enrichment section provided for Gen Chem I would be so so helpful, especially considering the teaching style of the class (which isn't accessible for many people). In the intro bio sequence, enrichment sections are provided for both semesters, so I don't see why the same can't be offered for chem. It's a much more low-stakes way to engage with the concepts than in section (which can be super intimidating). \r\n\r\nAnother place for improvement in this class is the structure of exams. I'm sure it was difficult adapting this class to a remote format, and so thank you for all the hard work you did in making it happen! But the sheer number of all-or-nothing multiple choice questions on all of our midterms and our final exam this semester made test results incredibly frustrating. for many questions, I felt like I had a good understanding of the question and what it was asking, but because of silly mistakes picked the wrong answer and received no credit. To make matters worse, many of these all-or-nothing questions were set up as what felt like \"trick\" questions, deliberately leading students to pick the wrong answer. if these had been questions where we were provided a place to explain our work, that would be fair, but the all-or-nothing nature of these questions is harsh on people who understand the material but, in the pressure of exam-taking, select the wrong answer because the question is presented misleadingly. This issue could be solved by providing more questions with room for explanation, or just not giving us trick questions??",
                "The course was very well structured and the professor made the lectures easy to understand. I absolutely loved his enthusiasm for chemistry!!",
                "The lectures were not useful in learning and more so confused me than anything else. I felt the course doesnt do enough to help students fully grasp contents and TAs are overall not incredibly helpful because discussion sections are not structured in a conducive manner. Essentially, the course is built diy style, do-your-own-learning.",
                "Provided a lot of information, but just like any intro course, lecture is impersonal",

                "strenghts - Dr. Lant is amazing in explaing, she is truly one of a kind and I wish she had her own class too \r\nweaknesses - lack of prep prep for the xma; lack of actual psets (not on sapling)",
                "This course was not good online. One, it was incredibly difficult to be engaged when the lectures posted do not even include a little box of the professor speaking. The lectures were incredibly ineffective for visual learners. I thought information was not explained well and it was not clear how subjects connected to each other. The professor would also write notes for a good chunk of the lecture and it was incredibly hard to understand his writing. The course's strengths were that the professor was understanding of the difficulty of a zoom semester and therefore accommodating with deadlines and assignments.",
                "The lectures do a good job at explaining the chemistry concepts. However, I feel that much of the PSETs and midterms were geared towards math. While the math is certainly important, most of my preparations for midterms and exams just felt like a math review where I needed to memorize the types of math questions I may be asked.",
                "Strengths: Tests were straightforward and the format was fairly easy on Canvas. Hannah Lant's website was a lifesaver! It gave study guides and practice questions that were helpful for the exams. \r\nWeaknesses: The reading questions were a bit much and I usually forgot to do them. In addition, I never knew what my calculated grade was since the homework questions were on a different platform than the exams.",
                "Strengths: Great content and I felt like I gained a solid chemistry foundation.\r\nWeakness: The online midterms and finals had multiple choice questions sometimes worth 6 points each with no way to show your work. It could have been a questions requiring some sort of math or application of topics but you had zero way to get partial credit for your process. This made it VERY hard to do well on the exams even if you knew most of the topics because one small mistake that led to the wrong answer could mean losing 10% of the exam points (-6 on a 60 pt exam).",
                "The instruction was often extremely fast paced, not allowing students to absorb the information. I would recommend that the instructor attempts to slow down.",
                "Strengths of this course include the professor, TA's, and access to additional resources. Weaknesses include lecture notes and discussion sections.",
                "Add more review problems for exams, as well as record review sessions in case students are not able to attend.",
                "The content of this course often feels irrelevant, which makes it difficult to interact with.",
                "Professor Parr's lectures were very clear; he always provided practice examples and scenarios to reinforce our understanding of major concepts. I additionally appreciated the resources provided to us, including office hours, discussion section worksheets, etc.",
                "strengths: well organized, very clear expectations and material\r\nweakness: clarity on grading",
                "I thought the grading system of the class was a big strength. Our PSETs became optional later in the semester and our lowest midterm grade was dropped. Other Sapling activities also became optional.",
                "The course was good in that the instructor was very engaging and the class was well organized, but some of the material was a bit abstract or hard to understand virtually when describing something in three dimensions.",
                "Boring online lectures were not as good as fall",
                "Needs more organizatio",
                "There was much less structure than in CHEM 161, and less clarity on the boundaries of the content. The discussion section was not very useful. The strength were the practice questions for the midterms, they were pretty similar to the actual ones on the exams.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were recorded, which was nice because you could work at your own pace. Professor Parr was always available to answer questions and was very flexible and understanding.\r\nWeaknesses: You had to teach yourself most of the content that was tested on the exams, except for some units at the end that were explicitly taught in lecture. However, these were not in the textbook, so you had to look for other resources to learn them.",
                "The strengths of this course were that Professor Parr as well as TA's and peer tutors were really committed to your learning of the material. Additionally, Professor Parr was one of my only STEM teachers that respected Break Day guidelines and was really empathetic and flexible with how crazy this semester was for everybody. A big weakness was that lecture often strayed from what was required to know for the exams.",
                "I think Sapling was a good resource to help us learn. Having practice exams was helpful too. It would have been nice to have a practice final.",
                "I think the strength is the way the psets are done, I really like the way that we can keep retrying until we get it correct because it helped my learning a lot. Also, I think the class was fairly generous in terms of assessments, being able to drop one midterm exam really helped me. I think the course could be improved by being a little more organized especially towards the end of the semester. I often felt like it was just a lot of information at a time and having a more structured way to learn stuff like organic naming would've been helpful",
                "I feel as though there was no clear outline of what we were learning, a syllabus with a clear outline would have helped. The textbook did not match what we were learning in class, so I felt really lost at times.",
                "I liked this course because the way it was structured allowed for your level of engagement to be higher or lower based on your level of understanding of the material. I think that lecture could have been improved by including some more example problems that related to the tests instead of content that wasn't necessarily covered on the test.",
                "It was kinda disorganized and I didnt really understand the content that well with the online format.",
                "The course isnt as engaging as it could be but the professor is very understanding.",
                "The material is engaging, and I thought that everyone involved with teaching in this course did a good job making the material interesting and applicable to real life scenarios. Logistically, I have no complaints as professors were quite accessible, flexible, and consistent. However, lectures were sometimes challenging to follow, partly due to Zoom. If the lectures spent more time going over basic concepts rather than complex problems and applications, I think students would have an easier time following the material. Also, I think it would be extremely beneficial if this course provided a practice final exam and review sessions for the final exam for students.",
                "Although the low amount of work load helped students focus on learning the topics out of interest rather than for grade, the course materials were not explained well. In the end students ended up using outside resources to explain concepts. Frankly if the professor literally had lectures where he went over sample questions from Sapling to explain how some concepts could be used, it wouldve been far more helpful.",
                "I would say that the organization of the lectures was a strength given that Dr. Parr would always start his class by summarizing the material from the previous meeting as well as making connections to previous units. I found it difficult at times to make connections between the material presented in the slides of a given lecture, but Dr. Parr made sure to work through example problems to supplement the slides, which I have found helpful in understanding the material. I have no suggestions for improvement.",
                "A weakness would probably be the material itself. Chemistry is not the best, but general chemistry II is even less exciting. I would often question what the point of everything was."

I didn't like how some exam questions required us to type out our work instead of just uploading it like some of the other questions, because it is hard to type chemistry problems. I liked how they used Canvas calendar to book office hours slots!",
                "The live virtual lecture lecture was successful. The availability of recorded lectures were also successful, both for people watching them in different time zones, and as possible review for exams. The Sapling software for completing problem sets was helpful and straightforward to use. The discussion sections could have been more successful, as some TFs had trouble adapting to the virtual format while still engaging students in discussion.",
                "I thought the lectures and the sections both succeeded.",

                "I think all the practices--virtual, synchronous (or, if desired, recorded) lectures, discussion sections, and review sessions--were very successful. The course material is very application based, but the course was structure well to succeed at these types of questions.",
                "In person lectures would not vastly improve the course experience, but it would surely make it more engaging.",

                "Like I said, have peer tutors that actually know the subject so they are not telling you \"sorry, can't help with this\" and have them use the WHITE BOARD when explaining concepts and giving examples. \r\n\r\nHave live exams with a proctor available to answer and clarify questions immediately. Very important during a timed test that you can't raise your hand.",
                "Lectures were a bit hard to follow",

                "The lectures were not good for virtual engagement. There was no invitation to productively interact with the lecture material as it was being introduced. I felt the class wouldve benefited from being centered around pre-recorded lectures that couldve been more streamlined.",
                "I honestly don't know what could be improved but having the lectures recorded was incredible for if you missed something during live lecture. I think that should be continued even after in person learning resumes.",
                "Any changes in the course that were geared to learning in the pandemic succeeded. It was easy to get help when needed and the learning environment was still very postitive.",
                "i think that the course did very well in terms of the pandemic.",
                "The virtual learning setting did not succeed at all in this subject. It made it incredibly difficult to learn and made me lose interest in chemistry. Online lectures where I could not even see the professor speak but could only hear his voice made it so hard to stay engaged. Videos of the professor trying to show 3d models of molecules were not effective even though he tried. This class desperately needed an Ed discussion page but did not have one.",
                "The online exams should have had more opportunities to show work for partial credit.",
                "The virtual review sessions were excellent resources, and should be continued in coming years as virtual attendance makes these types of resources much more accessible. Recorded lectures are also incredible helpful for flexibility, as well as learning the material. I strongly encourage professors who are able to continue recording lectures for their students.",
                "Add more review problems for exams.",

                "Recorded lectures worked well for me, since I had a class at the same time as chemistry. Something like Ed discussion where students could ask questions would have been nice.",
                "I think overall the course adapted well to the covid pandemic. I will say that the asking questions in the chat feature could sometimes be distracting, but I do see how it was helpful as well.",
                "The discussion section was helpful because the review problems that we did during this time with aid from the TA's really helped my understanding. The virtual lecture is harder to learn from, but definitely the best course of action for the pandemic.",
                "The lecture wasnt that conducive to learning because it didnt have a great structure.",
                "The study groups taught by the TAs simply arent easily taught online. They did the best they could but it is hard to engage students and teach online.",
                "I appreciate how Hannah and Dr. Parr understood that with the covid pandemic, virtual work can be overwhelming. By allowing most psets and reading questions to be optional, it helped make the class more manageable in an online environment.",
                "Recorded lectures were great. It would have been nice if problem sets and reading questions were on Canvas rather than Sapling, especially for convenience sake.",
                "I have found that the coordination between slides, the written-out examples, and the tangible models Dr. Parr used was very successful in helping me learn during the pandemic. In my opinion, participation in the discussion sections and the pre-lecture quizzes is what ultimately allowed me to master the material. My suggestion for improvement mainly revolves around the last two units about organic chemistry. I would have liked to have seen (more) implementation of tangible models (or 3-D models through online software) as I thought that the 2-D visuals on the slides were pretty limiting and made the lectures difficult to follow at times."

In addition to being an excellent introductory level general chemistry class, it was also enjoyable to attend, and the topics were covered in an interesting way.

I took 163 the semester before and i leanr much more there, maybe if this course wasn't only it would have been better. it's not like i did not like the course, i just think that i didn't learn much and the lack of psets and homework that actually make you learn things did not help that. i think no one really takes this course \"for fun.\" it is not a bad course, but i don't think that you actually learn a lot of chemistry. the professors are really nice though.",

Maybe this course is better in-person, but it was not a good online class at all. It was quite poorly organized. It desperately needed an Ed discussion page. The lectures were not engaging at all and you could only hear the professor and not even see him speak on the recorded lectures, which made it very ineffective for visual learners. I reached out to both Dr. Parr and Dr. Lant with specific requests and I never got emails back from both of them. I thought the material in lecture was not explained too well. In order to learn the material, I really had to depend on teaching myself and based on other people's experiences in the class, I think this was a widespread trend.

Professor Parr is a good lecturer as well as a great person; he was flexible and adaptable in the face of a uniquely challenging semester and was the most responsive professor I had this semester. If you are taking this course with Parr, you may not enjoy it but you should do well if you keep up with the work.
