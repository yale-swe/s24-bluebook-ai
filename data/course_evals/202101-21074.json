Professor Pascutti is very engaging, caring, and charismatic, which makes this course a very unique one in all the economics courses I've taken at Yale. Another strength of the course is the material covered. I think the material is very relevant, especially for people going into finance. One weakness of this course is that it's sometimes a bit disorganized where quiz and test dates aren't decided until a few weeks before the quiz or test.",
