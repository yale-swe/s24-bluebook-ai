I think the biggest strength is this course is the community it provided me to be able to confidently express myself in Chinese to peers outside of my family and improve my Chinese speaking skills."

                "Strengths: I thought this course taught me so much Chinese, especially coming in as a heritage speaker. I never learned to read or write at home, and taking this course allowed me to do so. You will also learn pinyin which is a very vital skill.",

                "I would recommend this course if you are truly interested in writing Chinese characters and if you have the time in your schedule. This course truly makes you dedicate a chunk of your time per day to learn. There are daily quizzes which requires you to study every night. You must learn a new lesson every two days which requires you to be on top of your other classes. The class is very fast paced. If you don't have this time, I recommend you take the non-heritage track.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The professors are extremely caring, and each class is engaging and entertaining. I had a difficult time expressing myself when I first entered the class, but now I can engage in full conversations with my parents and send texts in Chinese."
