   "comments": [
    "How to think about the concept of who is an American and what is classic American literature, and overall, who belongs? Also, a refresher on how to write papers with secondary and primary sources.",
    "Survey of some of the greatest texts in American Literature. Over the course of the semester, I improved my ability to close read a text, engage with secondary sources, and work with manuscript archives.",
    "I learned much about American Literature, the complications of the term American Literature, how to better transition in essays, and how to push my arguments further.",
    "This course taught me many of the great works of the American canon. The course, which spans from 1800s to present-day literature, gave me insight into how writers throughout American history have grappled with the nation's most important ideals and most pressing problems. In addition books you might expect to see in an American literature class (e.g. Moby-Dick), I also got the chance to read many pieces from women writers and authors of color, which was a pleasant surprise.",
    "Analytical skills, knowledge about American literature",
    "I was able to read a number of really interesting books and write some good essays.",
    "I learned to broaden my understanding of the subjectivities of the genre American Literature. I learned to craft an argument that is concise, clear, and creative.",
    "It would be impossible to describe all the knowledge skills and insights  I developed by taking this course  especially the insights part. I was challenged by all the close reading and paralleling components of the assignments. I was engaged by the professor and my classmates questions each day. I was challenged by the texts, and developed\/enhanced by breadth of knowledge on american lit.",
    "I think I learned how to be a better thinker from this class. We read a wide variety of texts that ranged various styles (poetry, essay, novel, etc) and time periods (pre-Civil War to 2019), and I think this diversity in the reading list helped strengthen my critical analysis skills, as each text was able to inform the others and our conversations often compared authors\/poets and their styles. I think my writing skills also improved, especially in regards to clarity and concision. This course also inspired me to think more deeply about the term \"American\" and what it has meant for a genre, an author, and a reader, and what it may evolve to mean in the future.",
    "We read a wide range of literature and explored why a piece of writing is labeled as \"American.\" I feel much more comfortable talking about canonized authors such as Whitman and Dickinson after taking this course, and feel more confident in classroom English discussions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved the selection of literature we read and how diverse it was! I think the class discussions were very lively and I liked writing the weekly discussion posts.",
    "Strengths: great novels, excellent Professor, not too much work, grading that was aimed toward improving in the future\r\nWeaknesses: No major complaints about this course. I really loved it all around.",
    "The readings are amazing (especially There There) and Professor Hickey is absolutely fantastic. The three papers are very reasonable, and the weekly blog posts arent bad at all. Its a bit of a shame that Moby Dick takes up so much time on the syllabus, preventing us from reading several other works, but I also understand its place in the canon and why we read it.",
    "One of the main strengths of the course was Professor Hickey. Not only was her analysis incredibly thoughtfulin class, she frequently pointed out things I never would have noticed on my ownshe was also very welcoming. I felt like I could speak freely with her and would always get an honest, helpful response. Another strength of the course is its syllabus. For the most part, I thought the readings on the syllabus came from many viewpoints. Yes, we had to read Walt Whitman, but we also got to read Toni Morrison and Flannery O'Connor. My only criticism would be that I think we went through Song of Solomon a bit fast. I would have liked to spend one or two more classes with the book.",
    "The strengths are the books\/literature that Professor Hickey got to choose. The biggest weakness is how long we had to spend on Moby Dick.",
    "I appreciated that the books we read were written by a diverse set of writers, but it seemed like the professor really didn't want to teach some of the books on the syllabus, so maybe she should have more control over what she teaches?",
    "The strength of this course is certainly the syllabus. I dont think there were any weaknesses.",
    "I loved the set-up of this class and our conversations were so interesting. I also thought that the assignments were reasonable and were very flexible.",
    "Strengths: diversity of texts, prof engagement, student engagement, beinecke engagement, creativity of assignments \r\nWeaknesses: not on the professor at all, though the class was not very diverse which made it difficult sometimes to have honest\/complex discussions",
    "I think one strength of the course is the diversity of the texts we read. Prof Hickey makes an effort to include a variety of voices which I, and I believe the rest of my classmates, very much appreciated. I also like that the discussion during class tends to flow according to what the students find most interesting about the text. One related weakness, however, is that sometimes I found our conversations would get stuck in a rut, from which we were unable to come out of, but Prof Hickey did a good job shifting our attention to a new interesting point whenever this would happen.",
    "I think Professor Hickey did a great job leading discussions and picking assigned reading, as well as collaborating literature with its time period. I always looked forward to class and felt that Prof Hickey created a comfortable and engaging classroom environment. I thought the only weakness was that the workload was inconsistent, as some classes we would have 5 pages of poetry to read, and other times 120 pages of a novel."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who like to read and analyze literature, because it definitely strengthens your close reading and analysis skills.",
    "Absolutely, especially if you're lucky enough to take it with Professor Hickey. Professor Hickey invests so much in each of her students. I met with her several times throughout the semester, which was a highlight of the class for me.",
    "I absolutely would, especially with Professor Hickey!!! You learn a lot, and its a lot of fun!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The works of literature I read enriched my understanding of the American canon and has helped me come closer to making a decision about whether I want to major in English or not. I also loved getting the opportunity to learn from Professor Hickey.",
    "Yes, it was a great mix of books, poems, short stories, and essays, there weren't too many assignments, and the discussions were all very engaging.",
    "Yes! Definitely. Also the best Eng prereq with the best prof.",
    "I would recommend this class. The books and discussions are really interesting, and the workload isn't that bad.",
    "Yes! I loved this class so much. Its a great look into American literature, which was shockingly so interesting and diverse. I learned so much about American culture through the literature we read and I thoroughly enjoyed each book on the syllabus.",
    "Absolutely. Important to have this exposure to american lit.",
    "I would and I actually already have! Prof Hickey is really nice to be with in the classroom, and the students who choose to take this class are all very engaged and all want to be there and discuss literature, which is refreshing. It's really nice to have a book club, of sorts, where you are with a group of people, all dedicated to engaging with the text. It is a community that you would be hard-pressed to find outside of an English class like this one. This class also gives you the opportunity to sit back and appreciate how thoughtful and intelligent your classmates are, which is pretty inspiring. I loved that we were encouraged to learn from each other.",
    "I have recommended this course to many of my friends, most of whom aren't English majors, because I think Prof Hickey made the material very digestible and approachable, and the reading was diverse and interesting.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in a survey course of American literature. Professor Hickey is incredibly engaging, knowledgeable, and vibrant and her selections for the syllabus are amazing."
