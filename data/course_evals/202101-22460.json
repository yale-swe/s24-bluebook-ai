                "I got better at polishing translations, and I was also able to learn more spoken Yiddish and grammar.",

            "comments": [
                "This course has mostly strengths. It provides a ton of practice and feedback on how to translate a wide variety of Yiddish texts, which I know feel an intermediate confidence in doing. It is engaging and Prof. Price is very accommodating and dedicated to his students. It's one weakness I felt was a lack of Yiddish \"teaching\". Josh will answer any questions and will do in-depth corrections of all of our translations, but the course does not necessarily give instruction on how to properly translate. Thus I found myself repeatedly making the same mistakes in my translations.",
                "The students could guide what materials we covered in class, which was a big strength. The projects and assignments were fun and also allowed room for creativity. The instructor is also highly knowledgeable and hardworking and was able to guide us to anything we found interesting. The only way the class could be improved is if there were more of it!",
                "Strengths: the readings were extremely diverse, both in terms of the backgrounds of the authors and the type of material we read (essays, articles, short stories, poetry). The homework assignments and presentations were a great way to ensure that we truly understood what we were reading, to develop the flexibility of word association in the language, and to make sure that we were really *learning* about Yiddish culture and not just reading an assortment of texts.\r\nWeaknesses: I think that the readings could have been longer. Usually it would only take me 2-3 hours to translate something, which I would read first over the weekend., and I think it would be good if there were some way to incentivize students reading and translating more. Also, I did notice that for some students, their translation skills didn't really improve throughout the course. The course isn't really designed to teach students literary translation, as obviously the main focus is and should be teaching the language. But it might be interesting to have a \"peer editing\" component so students could improve each other's writing, rather than simply making sure that the translations are \"accurate\" by reading them aloud in class."

                "Prof Price did the best that was possible during COVID, and used breakout rooms and screen shares.",
                "We could form different breakout groups to cover different paths (reading vs. speaking) which helped us customize our experience to our interests. There was also liberal screen sharing, which was fun. It would have been helpful for the university to provide reliable wifi to the participants, because people cut out sometimes, which is difficult to deal with in a language course.",
                "I think the course worked well with Covid over Zoom. We didn't exactly take advantage of the special functions of online learning (I think it would have been cool, for example, to take advantage of Google docs collaboration in some way, though I'm not sure how), but I don't think it really would have been necessary."
