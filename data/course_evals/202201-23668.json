                "I improved all elements of my German (speaking, writing, reading, listening). It was also really useful to learn about German-speaking countries and cities to improve my cultural awareness.",

                "Improved knowledge of grammar, sentence structures and Vocabulary.",

                "I learnt about Germany and got Better in grammar and vocabulary.",
                "Great course for improving language skills, especially speaking. Honestly I went in completely insecure in my speaking and came out with a lot more confidence\/fluency.",
                "I learned and reviewed many different grammatical constructions, vocab, and cultural traditions in Germany. While I have seen much of the concepts before, this class allowed me to understand them at a deeper level and with more context."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths\r\n- great, reliable structure with 2 weeks per chapter (you cover a city, a new cultural\/political concept, grammar etc.)\r\n- the varied nature of assignments (speaking tests, answering literary questions, essays)\r\n- you develop a very strong grammar background essential for speaking German more fluently\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- only one book was assigned for the semester\r\n- there is a huge amount of assignments so it can be difficult to keep on top of things",
                "The structure of the German levels at Yale are a big strength. Regular tests, modules divided by city and clear grammar sections help to give us manageable chunks of language to learn through the semester. I would say that the structure of Scherbenpark (the novel we read through the semester) could be improved. If we're going to read the entire novel, it needs to be better spaced out through the term. We ended up reading a lot in the last two weeks and it felt a bit rushed.",
                "The course in general was very boring. I did not find the novel we read useful at all. Further, Stationen is probably the worst language book that I've used in my entire life. Please switch to something that can also be used for the Goethe Zertifikat.\r\nI also wish there had been more opportunities to practice grammar\/writing in a systematic manner.",
                "Small class makes it easy build communities and feel comfortable speaking the language.",
                "More time spent with the grammar sections so that we actually learn them properly.",
                "Class can be pretty easy and fun if you do your work regularly. However, some of the class discussions were boring and often time I didnt have any desire to participate.",
                "This course was very similar in structure to GMAN 130, which I thought was also structured relatively well. Overall, I enjoyed the in-class discussions, and I thought that the material contributed well to my knowledge of German. There was one class where the class was split into two groups for a discussion -- I really enjoyed it, and I think it would have been fun to have more of those discussions in class."
