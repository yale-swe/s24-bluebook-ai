I learned how to engage in a small class setting, engage with my classmates in discussion, and learn from my classmates.",

                "I'd definitely recommend this course for all majors! It gives great insight into what you actually deeply care about in life and a great class to give perspective on your Yale education.",
                "Yes! It's a fantastic course to take to start off your Yale career, and it really does help you reflect on who you are and what you want in life.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for an interesting, engaging, first-year seminar with a great, relatable professor! A lot of reading but all interesting and relevant to class discussion but possible to skim and still be able to participate.",
                "Absolutely, without a doubt. The lessons from this course (especially the last few weeks) will stick with me through life. This was a way to learn about other's values, ask what is a flourishing life, and discuss with my peers. The final paper was to write about what we want from our lives and from Yale, and read and discuss these with our classmates. It taught me a lot and definitely framed my time at Yale.",
                "Yes!!!!! This is both a really interesting and very important class to take that forces you to do the deep reflection that many students at Yale dont do but is so important. With my final essay I developed a working philosophy of life that I believe will stick with me (and, of course, be gradually changed) throughout my whole life. In addition, I got to dive deep into some really interesting philosophical\/religious texts from a variety of times, places, and perspectives. They dont tie together into any kind of cohesive message about the flourishing life, but they are all interesting and worth being exposed to for their own sake. I got to have really interesting discussions that were often very personal and relevant to our experiences at Yale.\r\n\r\nAnd Matt what to say. In several of the texts for this class, theres the idea that a teacher should be not merely a source of knowledge but a mentor, a healer, a flourishing person her\/himself whose life you want to learn from. Matt is that person. Just like Confucius or Jesus or bell hooks. Matt is someone you simply want to be around because you can learn so much by simply listening to him talk about his life. He even lets you schedule office hours with him to just take a walk and talk about life, which is an incredible opportunity! He is also very respectful of everyone's differing opinionsthere are no wrong ideas.\r\n\r\nJust so youre aware, the workload is not nothing40-80 pages per week plus 3 not-super-straightforward papers. But I think its telling that although I spent far more time on this course than any of my others, thats because I truly felt it interesting and important enough to actually thoroughly read and take notes on (most of) each of the readings and really put genuine effort into the papers.\r\n\r\nIf you are lucky enough to get into this class, get as much out of it as you can. Really read all the texts thoroughly instead of skimming (as Chu Hsi, a thinker from medieval China we read from, will tell you). Schedule in-person office hours and talk with him about your life or his life or anything else (not just about your papers). You wont regret it!"
