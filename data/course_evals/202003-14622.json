I didn't really understand much at all until I did the homework. And that was the weakness: I really did not understand anything until I went to office hours and did the homework. Also, I wish the course had followed a textbook.",

                "The course covers very interesting material and it is presented in an engaging format. The assignments are challenging and take a good amount of time to complete. However, since special relativity is challenging and counter-intuitive at times, I think the higher difficulty and length of the assignments is key and, in fact, beneficial to truly cementing one's understanding of the material. Furthermore, the nature of special relativity and its awesome consequences makes the assignments feel engaging and rewarding, especially when you arrive at a solution. Professor Skiba is also a wonderful lecturer and strives to make each class engaging by posing thoughtful questions and delving into the beauty of the theory. He is also incredibly helpful as he provides well-structured and comprehensive answers whenever students have questions."

This course is fairly challenging as special relativity is inherently challenging itself. However, if the right amount of time is dedicated, it is more than manageable. You will gain great insight learning from Professor Skiba that truly makes the course worth taking."
