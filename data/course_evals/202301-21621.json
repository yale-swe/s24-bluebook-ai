                "It was an overview of case law surrounding education in the United States.",

I come out of the course with a deeper understanding of how law intricately shapes the experiences of diverse students at diverse types of educational institutions. I familiarized myself with legal jargon, and also developed a language to write and talk about the law.",

                "Strengths: Judge Garfinkel\r\nWeaknesses: None. Take the class. Do it. Now.",
                "The material was fascinating. I think more guided construction would have been beneficial.",
                "This course is a great course for people interested in law as you learn a lot about landmark cases for public education and smaller cases that set precedents. Also the flexibility in topics for the writing assignments allows you to write about the topics in education law that are most interesting to you. The student-led discussion were also a great learning opportunity.",
                "Strengths: Judge Garfinkel! He just has so much knowledge and makes the seminar experience so fun and engaging. Weaknesses: the student-led class facilitation was a little wonky in the beginning of the semester (but really turned out well in the end), I think some more guidance on these discussion facilitations could've been helpful",
                "Strengths - Professor Garfinkel is absolutely amazing. Best Professor Ive had at Yale! Weaknesses - maybe more options for different types of participation (small group discussion)",
                "Strengths - Judge Garfinkel as an instructor and mentor, the opportunity to co-lead one of the classes and more deeply engage with the material of your choice, flexibility in choosing your topic(s) for the writing assignment(s), balanced reading load\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes presentations from other students did not allow enough time for classroom discussion, but this got better as the course went on and the class dynamics were most established",
                "Although I was nervous about it, I enjoyed that the class was led by students every week. As the course went on, our student leaders figured out how to make the classes more engaging and thoughtful. I liked that the class was not just lecturing from the professor, but involved really interesting discussions about my peers' personal experiences and how they related to certain cases.",
                "Strengths: \r\n - the readings are absolutely fascinating, and every studentregardless of their exposure to the lawhas a way of relating to it\r\n - I also enjoyed that seminars were student-led\r\n - Judge Garfinkel is an excellent, compelling lecturer. He also readily made himself available for student queries.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n - it was hard to follow the exact reading assignments for each week, since there wasn't a streamlined document containing this information. Rather, some information was on the syllabus, while Canvas announcements introduced new readings and emphasized particular readings. I suggest that the syllabus at the beginning of the year most of this information, along with the page numbers for the different additions.\r\n - The class seems to be split between students who are very familiar with the law and students who are less familiar with it, and we can see this dichotomy unfold in class discussion. I wish there was some way to make the class environment a bit more comfortable for the latter group. For instance, I would have appreciated a more thorough introduction to reading and writing about the law.",
                "I think the course was very interesting and you chose very good topics. You let me get away with writing essentially nothing for this course, which I don't think was a good idea. As a result, I think it would be better to have people write essays at specific times with specific page requirements. This would also let you give specific prompts for these essays, which would have helped me a lot. Often, I found the opinions really interesting but I wasn't sure what questions would make good paper topics and having prompts would have solved this problem. I see where you were going by having students lead discussion, but I think often times it meant that we spent a lot of time on questions like \"what is the holding\" and didn't get to the meat of the discussion for a while. As a result, I think it would be better if you led discussion. Maybe having 2 students read other court cases on the subject and give a 5 minute presentation on those each week would serve a similar purpose?",
                "strengths are that you can choose how to divide up the essay page count over the semester or just have one longer final. Also discussion leading lets you go a little deeper into analyzing the cases being studied for that week.",
                "One of the major strengths of this course is the emphasis on reading relevant case law. Being directly exposed to the cases that were shaping the field of education law was incredibly helpful. That being said, it would have been perhaps instructive to read more full cases, rather than only the portions included in the text, but overall I found the textbook to be very illuminating."

                "Absolutely! Judge Garfinkel is simply fantastic. I've taken two classes with him now, and he every week he facilitates the best seminar environment I've been a part of at Yale. The cases we cover in this course are fascinating as well. I took a particular interest to the curriculum control/book banning week, but every week came with a new series of interesting readings and issues to consider. If you have the chance, take this class. You won't regret it.",
                "Definitely! Especially if you are interested in law/the legal field or education, and also equity in education. It is a great overview of the laws that affect public education and how they are generally applied.",
                "Absolutely. Great class if you're interested in the law, education, policy making, or really just the current state of young people in America.",
                "Yes! This course is a great way to get exposed to the law behind education and to understand why education is the way it is today. This is great for people that want to help improve educational problems today",
                "Absolutely! Judge Garfinkel is amazing. The content is incredibly relevant and interesting. Topics rarely if ever had an easy or clear legal answers, which made discussions incredibly exciting",
