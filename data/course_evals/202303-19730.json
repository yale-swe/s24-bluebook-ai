            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Some of the curator visits were cool.\r\nWeakness: The instructors had a very strict grading system for all assignments and an even stricter grading system that was very biased towards their likes for presentations and discussions. I was consistently penalized for trying to make jokes or encourage informal discussions that somewhat related to the topics during presentations or discussions. I was penalized on a major presentation assignment because the text on my slides was \"not scholarly enough.\" I was also penalized for going over time for my presentation when as soon as my presentation ended, the class ended with 15 minutes to spare... A lot of the invited curators struggle to find things to talk about related to \"color\" in which they waffle about their objects for a long time. Color is not only emphasized in the course but often it is the only topic that you are allowed to converse about with the instructors shutting down all other conversations even adjacently related to how form impacts the color of a painting\/object.",
                "Strengths are we got to go to museums and do a range of activities. Weaknesses were sometimes the visits weren't very engaging or interactive. The canvas page was also pretty confusing with assignments and readings.",
                "Strengths: learn about art history, visit special collections and libraries, and get access to certain resources as a first year\r\nWeaknesses: may be a bit different from what you wanted out of an \"art\" course, there's less hands-on activities than expected and it's mostly based on readings and discussions for learning",
                "The biggest strength of this course is its visits to special collections, all of which are really interesting. I wish that the course overall had a bit more cohesion, though, as I felt we jumped around a bit in regards to color (this is probably just because there are so many topics and hard to make them all entirely relate). I also found grading\/feedback a bit harsh in the beginning, though eventually got the hang of it (which I think has also made me a better writer and observer).",

                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student.\r\nThis course was okay during the curator visits (they were pretty cool). \r\nHowever, the grading of this course and how the instructors enforce their idea of what this course should be limits productive discussions and conversations.\r\nThere was only one track of possible conversation, and everything had to revolve around color. This law was enforced with an iron fist by the instructors. If you do not want to talk about color ONLY, look elsewhere for a class.\r\nThis class's workload was crazy with the time you have to cater (and guess) towards what the instructors wanted on their assignments (believe me, they will penalize you).\r\nAlso, the final assignment is either a 10-page research paper pretty much ONLY about color or a creative project with a 5-page reflective essay about color.",
                "I would if they were interested in art but I could see how someone not interested in art wouldn't find it interesting.",
                "Yes simply because of the familiarity you get with the special collections. You get to see so many beautiful pieces, and also feel comfortable visiting special collections on their own. Great course for that alone (though all the material is also super interesting).",
