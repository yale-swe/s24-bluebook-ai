                "I learned a lot of really useful vocabulary and grammar related to different social issues. After the course (and probably with a lot more review), I would feel comfortable engaging in a conversation about issues in the news in a more nuanced way. I especially appreciated learning the small differences in tone and usage of certain words that initially seem like synonyms. Overall, the course has improved my reading and writing skills immensely... although my speaking fluency has declined a little with the movement to only 3 class meetings a week.",

                "Strengths: very comprehensive vocabulary and grammar, although it did feel like I was drinking out of a water hose and I would frequently fall behind in learning new words. The sheer exposure to different vocabulary and topics was very useful though and mildly entertaining when I would recognize more words from class when watching Chinese tv shows! Weaknesses: this is mostly due to the course design and I'm not sure if it could be changed, but I felt like I was less engaged with class because I would only need to speak maybe 2 or 3 times per session due to the number of students. Sometimes this was actually nice as it took the pressure off on days when I was less familiar with the new vocabulary, however it could be interesting if the class sometimes incorporated \"lesson leaders\" for a given topic and have them moderate a discussion? Though that may also be way too much work for third year students with a lot more on their plates...",
                "This was a great course! It was incredibly organized, Zhan Laoshi was great at encouraging class engagement, and there was a strong emphasis on learning all the vocab and grammar thoroughly. Overall, the class environment was very fun and productive.",
                "Strengths: Professor Chan was a delight, full of energy during every class and very available for office hours. She spoke really fast which improved my listening comprehension. Zoom Chinese class wasn't ideal but it was what we got.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the textbook. I didn't like the textbook's format (no easy-to-use table of contents, no way to listen to the readings), sometimes there were misprints (with tones, or mixing up simplified and traditional characters), and the material was sometimes a bit weird or dated. Also, 4:30 MWF class is simply not the move -- though I liked my professor a lot, that was a low-energy time of day (especially Friday at 4:30).",
                "The only weakness is that it is difficult to practice talking with the zoom classes, but overall a very engaging class.",
                "The course was well taught and formatted for online learning, and even though it was a language class, I still felt engaged and able to practice the language.",
                "Don't think there's any way to improve much--the class seemed pretty efficient as is.",
                "Chan Laoshi's teaching was exceptional. She was friendly, thorough, and made the class engaging every day. I sometimes wished we had more time for each class because we would have to run late or speed up to cover all the material."

                "I think the course overall was nicely formatted for COVID-19 circumstances, although I think that enabling the chat function so you could message more than just the teacher could have been a helpful tool. Perhaps it could have been used to engage more students to respond to questions or provide thoughts while other students spoke, instead of just waiting for your 2-3 times to speak per class. I also think it can be useful to see what clarification questions other students may be asking, and a helpful hint from a classmate through direct message is always nice in a foreign language class.",

                "I'd recommend that Chinese teachers ask all students to stay unmuted the whole class period. It's really annoying when a teacher has to interrupt people saying \"you're muted, you're muted\" because it interrupts the flow of class. Also, I'd like to have more opportunities to do short on-paper writing assignments so I don't totally forget how to write characters.",
                "Homework format was very successful, but class discussions were difficult to maintain in whole-class zoom format.",

From there, this class will provide many useful vocabularies that will take their Chinese to the next level. If you have a fairly heavy schedule and are not as comfortable, I'm not sure if I would recommend taking it if you are GPA conscious because there are many homework assignments of varying difficulties. Some weeks I would be scoring 90% and up... and others were straight 70% rates just because the content of listening comprehension or class texts were much more difficult.",

Non-native Chinese speakers often seem to plateau at a high level and this course did a great job helping push through that challenge."
