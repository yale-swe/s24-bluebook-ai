I also learned about the specific choices that composers make when writing up the music for their song to achieve their intended tone for the song!",

                "Professor Z was so much fun to have in class, but I wish her lectures about music history were more cohesive and put together. She was a bit scattered in her lecturing, and some slides or supplementary material to her lectures would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: Prof Z does a great job at teaching the musical and cultural history behind love songs and she's an amazing professor. The small class size also allows for the students to get to know each other closely (my class actually ended up being fairly connected with each other outside of class!), and allow for engaging discussions. You also get to listen to music as homework and some of the songs slap. Also you don't need to know any music knowledge to do well in the course!! (I came in knowing nothing about sheet music or musical terms and Prof Z taught us what we needed to know to do the assignments and be able to engage in class).\r\nWeaknesses: the amount of songs we had to listen to per class increased substantially in the later half of the semester once we moved to the American parlor song stage; I personally didn't mind the increase in workload, but I'm thinking that maybe other students did.",
                "Strengths: provides a strong introduction to a series of major musical movements in Western artistic history. There were so many spaces for creative interpretation and discussion. Professor Zayaruznaya and our TA Emily led insightful conversations, debates and lectures combined with active listening. A series of fascinating readings, which were indispensable to the class. For improvements, perhaps Prof Z could have asked us to post a short comment and question we had about each set of readings into a Canvas blog prior to class. Sometimes I digested our readings a bit passively, and this feature may have helped. Also, it could further prime the discussion and get us thinking critically about the texts before we enter class."

                "This was a fun class because I loved my classmates and the professor, but the actual content did get pretty boring at times. The bulk of the music we learn about is French or German, and that kind of took the enjoyment out of listening to the music because we had to keep track of the translation. Fun class, but content was boring",
                "YESS! This class is amazing, you learn so much about the history and culture of love songs in interesting ways you never thought about before. The class has also taught me to listen more closely to the music and lyrics behind a song rather than just letting them wash over me. It was also my favorite class this semester because the small seminar discussion format allowed me to engage with the material and get to know my fellow classmates and the professor. The workload isn't bad and the professor is great. You don't need to have any background in music to enjoy the class!",
                "Sure. It is a great introduction to the college seminar format and dives into a topic always ripe for critique, debate, and discussionalthough many of our classes leaned more heavily on the lecture style. Also provides a great overview of several musical periods! This courses workload is very manageable. If you love music, wish to expand your horizons in the field of music (not theory--we dont really cover that here), and would like a less demanding course to balance out other more taxing ones, go for it! Prof Z is a wonderful professor and is great at leading discussions and lectures."
