I was a huge fan of the way the course was taught always considering the big picture, and that we could use the techniques in various contextual settings rather than only understand the theory or nitty-gritty behind the actual useful tools.",

                "Strengths: helpful professor and office hours of professor and TAs\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of overall resources by course director, only one practice exam, ambiguous grading policy",
                "Brett is a great lecturer; he makes math fun and explains concepts in a neat way; the project was definitely a cool experience (though it was stressful to complete in the moment, the end product was very rewarding); the psets are all very doable and straightforward; my only complaint would be the lack of practice material for exams",
                "Strengths: Knowledgeable instructors, fairly available office hours, manageable content\r\nWeaknesses: The class is typically full of people who already have a decent grasp of the content, which makes it more difficult for someone coming in who hasn't worked with linear algebra concepts before",
                "A strength of the course was the final project - I learned a lot doing that. The quality of the peer tutors was also a strength. A weakness was that I wish we had been able to have more of a taste of the proofs even if it wasn't as thorough as 225.",

Unless you're a math major or enjoy proofs, I would strongly recommend 222 over 225, especially if you are any kind of engineering major. The psets for 222 were incredibly easy, so if you would like to challenge yourself then 225 might be a better option.",

I would suggest watching MIT's video lectures ahead of time, or just learning the content online entirely if you don't need the class as a prerequisite for anything.",
