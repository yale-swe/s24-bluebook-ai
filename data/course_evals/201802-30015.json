    "I was able to really learn a lot about the way that genes influence development and therefore what leads to the evolution of different traits. I was able to understand the concepts in a way that I had previously not been able to with biology courses prior to this point, in high school.",
    "I learned so much about genetics and evolution.",
    "I learned how to structure and write scientific proposals. Also the class helped me hone the skill of reading primary scientific literature.",
    "I gained a deep understanding of basic developmental biology, genetics, evolution, and ecology. I got to apply all of the knowledge and skills I had accumulated from past biology classes. Concrete skills I developed include being able to understand Mendelian genetics\/pedigree analysis and being able to understand and construct phylogenetic trees. Additionally, I became familiar with the process to write a research proposal.",
    "I gained a working knowledge of cellular activities, but more specifically the underlying genetic processes of inheritance and day to day cellular processes. In the second half of the course, I learned about biological theory on the larger scale, specifically the historical, social and scientific origins of evolution as well as a better working knowledge of how all life interrelates in a genetic and ecological sense. I don't have enough space to represent how much I truly felt like I learned in this class",
    "I learned how to do researches related to gene functions and other knowledge of molecular biology and evolution."

   "comments": [
    "strengths were that it was a small class, and the work wad evenly distributed throughout the entire five weeks making everything very manageable. A weakness would be that it was hard to remain engaged for the entire hour and fourty five minutes however it is understandable that this is the necessary length to cover all the material.",
    "I really liked the quizzes that were given every other day because it forced me to learn the material. I thought that the class was very well organized.",
    "This is perhaps the inevitable nature of summer courses but I felt like the class did not go in-depth into many of the topics and various topics seemed very disconnected from one another.",
    "The strengths of the course were the instructors- Professors Lin and Near. They made the subject matter fascinating and the class very enjoyable. There are no significant weaknesses.",
    "The only way I could see this course being improved was by providing homework that tested for competency in another way besides writing papers.",
    "I think the quizzes arranged really help us to understand the course. And the homework is very helpful in our future study. And I think the course is really good.",
    "The course was very well organized and also very engaging."

    "If you can take this course over the summer, PLEASE do! You'll be doing yourself an enormous favor. All of my friends who took the Biology sequence over the semester (on or off track) were extremely jealous whenever I told them about how this course was going. The difference of being in a class of 15-20 versus 200+ can't be overstated. Plus, Professor Lin and near are just amazing and so good at explaining everything and care so deeply about every single student.",
    "Yes, definitely. It was great to have this information relayed in such a small class setting with clear and concise teachers. With the biology courses during the semester it is often intimidating to ask questions when confused, and easy to get distracted as there is little to know individual attention being paid to you. It was also nice that there were quizzes that covered the material for every two lectures rather than huge tests because this made sure that I was understanding the material as we went rather than being confused the entire time and not even realizing it until it was time for the test. Additionally the teachers were super accommodating and easy to reach at all times, they really wanted to help the students understand the material. Overall great class",
    "Yes, great class with great professors.",
    "I would recommend this course to practically any STEM student, as it deals with basic concepts about life and life processes.",
    "Absolutely, it was the best intro-sequence experience I've had at Yale. If it was within my power I would make this model the norm for all intro-sciences",
    "Yes, the course is very helpful if you want to learn something in biology and biological researches.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it was extremely interesting and fun to learn."
