                "I learned a lot about the scholarship on skin studies, beauty standards, and socio-historical problematizations of Chinese skin in particular. I thought that it was a fascinating course that allowed for a lot of free-flowing discussion in class and Quincy did a great job directing the course to allow new ideas to arise and build upon each other.",
                "I learned about a lot of different works of art dealing with skin and its portrayal by Chinese and Chinese-American artists. I really enjoyed this course because there aren't that many History of Art courses that deal with contemporary Chinese art.",
                "I learned how to conduct a visual analysis on contemporary art, apply philosophical concepts like \"abject\" to concrete artworks, and engage in thoughtful dialogue with my classmates.",
                "Honestly not a lot. I found the syllabus to be pretty all over the place and we were talking about really obscure art and artists. I still don't really know all that much about what major \"skin problems\" are or how skin (as opposed to the body in general) relate to gender, etc. I think several topics could be taken off the syllabus (most notably a deeply uncomfortable seminar on Robert Yang), and that the class could benefit from pedagogical instruction re how to lead a fruitful and engaging seminar. I didn't find the material all that compelling, nor (more importantly) convincing: a lot of the bigger ideas we talked about seemed like a stretch when applied to individual artworks. Most everyone I knew in the class was pretty confused as to what was going on.",
                "discuss topics surrounding beauty standards, cosmetics, the power of touch, etc.",
                "I learned a lot from the readings in the first half of the semester. Readings from week 1-6 were full of new ideas about the haptic gaze, Chinese myths on skin, and cinematic and artistic references that were very interesting to me. Some of the introduced works and artists, such as Robert Yang, were also interesting."

                "Strengths: Quincy is a great lecturer and is really passionate (and knowledgeable) about his subject matter like no other. The topics were very interesting and covered in a multifaceted manner.\r\nWeaknesses: It felt like we could've delved deeper into some of the topics. I would've loved to learn more about the ways in media and mythology that skin problems were depicted, much like our first classes on Huapi. Sometimes the in-class discussions would trickle down, and I wish there were a way to keep the conversations going. Maybe some sort of prompt at the beginning or debate-style class?",
                "Quincy is a very thoughtful instructor who gives the perfect amount of materials each week to prepare the class for a thoughtful and specific discussion. The workload is VERY manageable which really allows students to come to class having read\/etc. Usually work is less than 18 pgs of reading for class + looking at short videos or images of the artwork were discussing. This was much more engaging to me than the usual 60+ pages of reading for art history seminars.\r\n\r\nThe class covers contemporary Chinese \/ Asian-American art focused on representations of skin. A lot of the work we looked at was provocative, exciting\/fresh, technology and materials-forward and overall it was a really cool hyper-contemporary list of artists that is not a common offering in Yale art history department. Some students seemed to struggle with how provocative some of the works were. Dont enroll if youre gonna complain about artworks that push boundaries. Take the class if youre interested in the subject or want to develop skills for speaking about contemporary art. Great workload, kind and receptive Professor, overall fantastic class.",
                "I like how every module for this course usually coupled a particular artist with some kind of art historical theory. This deepened both my engagement and understanding of the artist's work and its message. I also like how we focused on only one or two artists each week, allowing us to really delve deep into this artist's oeuvre. The one weakness, which I think improved towards the end of the semester, were the class discussions at times. For people who aren't well-versed in theory or just art history more generally, I think really guiding students or initiating the discussion for them would help students feel more inclined to engage.",
                "I think one of the main strengths was the absolutely fascinating and intriguing artworks chosen for discussion as well as the classroom atmosphere\/dynamics that allowed me to feel comfortable participating in class discussion.",
                "Strengths: non-canonical take on Chinese art. The viewing session at the art gallery was very thought provoking. \r\nWeaknesses: WAY too much time spent in lecture during seminars; also it seemed Prof. Ngan was really gunning for us to arrive at abstract, complex conclusions whilst overlooking the basic\/core messages of the artworks we were looking at. I noted this above, but the section on Robert Yang was super uncomfortable and I wish we were given more of a heads up re the explicit and hypersexualized nature of the artwork (if it can even be considered art). Paper guidelines changed a week before the deadline and Canvas page was disorganized. It was unclear what was required vs recommended reading - way too long of \"session guides.\" Also, we never actually talked about our readings and Prof. Ngan would introduce new, dense passages on a Powerpoint during seminars which were hard to digest and discuss. On the whole, think this course could benefit from a serious and thorough pedagogical primer as well as a revamping of the validity\/premise of the course in the first place. Bit of a bummer, as I was really looking forward to the class :(",
                "very well structured discussions every week with insightful readings.",
                "The readings in the first half of the semester were very insightful and rewarding, and I felt that what I learned from them could be applied to my studies elsewhere. However, later on, the readings began to lose their initial depth and breadth of insight as they narrowed down on specific Chinese\/Chinese diasporic artists that Professor Ngan selected for us to look at. Owing to their narrow focus on the given artist, these writings felt less expansive and therefore it was difficult to apply any insights gained from them to anything else. Since we were already also asked to look at the artists' works before class, I think the readings would have been more generative if the professor had continued to assign more general writings on critical theory and contrasted them with the artists' portfolios to allow students to draw their own comparisons."

The professor seemed overwhelmed and lost as to what the class was even supposed to be and I really didn't look forward to going. I wish we could have actually LOOKED at artworks and readings more instead of just zooming through dense secondary analyses of theory. I was never sure if this was a lecture or seminar and there wasn't much engagement from the class. Also, Prof always seemed preoccupied\/distracted\/wasn't super clear in communicating what was expected of us intellectually. I really wish I didn't take this class.",
