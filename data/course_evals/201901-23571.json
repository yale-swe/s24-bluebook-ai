    "how to read ridiculously confusing texts, how to better participate in class",
    "I gained argumentative skills that I previously did not have, and learned to be very clear in my writing. I also got better at making my way through difficult texts.",
    "So much. I learned to think through philosophical concepts rigorously and incisively. I learned the actual content of different philosophers' systems and ideas, so much so that I see them everywhere I go and read now. I truly loved this classit was my favorite part of DS.",
    "Philosophic knowledge. Ability to argue and understand points rationally.",
    "I've definitely learned to interpret and present philosophical ideas with clarity, something that I would otherwise have been unable to do had I not taken this course! Taking philosophy has dramatically altered my world view, and has definitely helped me to hone my critical thinking skills. I really enjoy relating the ideas we read about to the real world  and this semester's readings have been very enjoyable since they discuss everything from the self to ideas about reason to morality.",
    "Connected ancient and modern philosophy.",
    "I learned further how to develop a convincing philosophical argument, how to analyze and evaluate a moral system, how to read very jargon-y text without getting too intimidated.",
    "Philosophy analysis, paper writing, philosophical close reading",
    "From this course, I developed an understanding of the philosophical works that have informed the Western Canon. I also honed my writing skills, particularly with regards to writing philosophy papers."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "cutting authors like hegel that are impossible to understand or making those classes more summary based",
    "This course often had way too much reading with philosophy, if you dont have time to adequately understand the argument, discussion is difficult. But the course was a great overview.",
    "The lectures were consistently incredibly, and Professor Russell was absolutely incredible. Please put Philosophy lectures on Mondays though so we know what's going on.",
    "Strengths: great professors, great lectures, great books\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were on Friday and they were hard to listen to after finishing papers at 4am the night before",
    "I really liked how my professor would write the main points that we were to cover on the blackboard before class started - it helped to give a clear roadmap to what I should focus on and also helped when it came time for exam revision. The student-prepared starters were also excellent in beginning the discussion and even though handouts were optional, it was great to get a handout with a reconstruction of the argument. Even if an interpretation wasn't perfect, actually going through and clarifying parts of the text definitely helped my understanding.",
    "I think the readings this term were incredible, and I was really able to get a broad sweep of ideas and how they developed with the times. Each time we read a new philosopher, I was forced to abandon all preconceived notions and really think about the variety of new perspectives that each successive author we read brought to the table (my concepts of morality changed endlessly). I think this really shows the excellent curation of the canon! As is always the case with DS though, it sometimes felt as though we had way too little time to really learn about a philosopher in depth, but I understand that it's a necessary trade-off.",
    "Strengths: this course will guide you through some of the biggest philosophers since Descartes, works which are very difficult to do on your own. If you are interested in philosophy, it's a great start. Also-- Professor Russell is a fantastic teacher, and it is a shame that she will not be at Yale next year. She is super smart, kind, relatable, and funny. \r\nWeaknesses: That said, it is often a really frustrating course, especially because the texts are so lofty and full of jargon and complex systems that to endeavor to cover them in one or two classes often felt like a bit of a joke. Your ability to go in depth, to actually understand fully why someone believes what they believe, how their beliefs might operate in the real world, etc. is severely hindered by the speed and sheer volume of the course. There are two solutions to this; either assign less reading so we can actually cover and understand the full breadth of what we are reading (risking leaving things out, not getting a good picture of the philosopher...) or give us more time on some of the more complex philosophers like Hegel and Kant (which might mean reducing volume in other parts). I also think it is a big mistake to have one class, respectively, on each of the two female philosophers, Murdoch and DeBeauvoir. \r\n\r\nThat said, I think this was a good introductory course to philosophy, which will challenge you and bring you to think of things in a different light.",
    "I felt that the course was overall very strong. I would have appreciated more guidance in the larger concepts of some of the texts, particularly the more challenging ones like Kant and Hegel. I found that the difficulty of the texts made the class very challenging, and I would have appreciated more of a breakdown of the concepts. However, I felt that Professor Russell worked very hard to make these concepts accessible and understandable. I would have liked some of the lectures to be more engaging.",
    "Overall, I thought this course was wonderful. However, I do wish that we got to read sample philosophy essays in class so that we know what standards of writing we are held to and know where to improve on our own essays."

   "comments": [
    "yes",
    "I would, but would want to have an honest conversation about the students reasons for taking it.",
    "Yes!! Such a rewarding experience. It will train your brain to read difficult texts and sense places to press in philosophers' thought systems, which applies to any kind of study of thought.",
    "Of course. Teaches you valuable skills and exposes you to amazing books. Take this course if you are ready for a challenge.",
    "Yes, definitely - I learned so much about philosophy, writing, argumentation and discussion. It was a fantastic semester. However, I did find that in some parts of the course I think we moved too fast through philosophers that really needed more time to be properly dealt with - such as Hegel and Kant.",
    "I certainly would! DS is an excellent foundation-builder and it's taken me a whole year to realise its benefits, but looking back it has helped me to grow so much as a thinker and a writer and a reader, and as a human being who relates with the rest of the world.",
    "Yes! Philosophy is a very important subject and this course offers a very broad understanding of major philosophical ideas of the past several hundred years. I think any Yale student would benefit from this course.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in getting an overview of philosophical works in the Western Canon."
