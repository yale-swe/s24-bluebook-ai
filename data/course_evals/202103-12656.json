                "This class truly taught me to see the world through a different lens. I feel much more introspective about my own life, yet at the same time I feel at peace with existence in general. This course taught me to step outside of my own life and the constraints of society in order to assess my values and connections. I also appreciate how we interpreted materials from authors with very different viewpoints, as it demonstrated that each person has a unique perspective.",
                "This course facilitated deep reflection surrounding fundamental questions: what is an education for? What is the life worth living, to me? What would it mean for me to flourish? Through engaging with various thinkers' philosophies on education, I found I was able to extract ideas and create a philosophy that makes sense for my own life. This course encouraged introspectionthinking about what exactly I came to Yale seeking, how I got here in the first place, and whether I'd do it differently if I could. It helped me to identify my role in modern educational systemshow and where I can enact change. It taught me how I want to engage in in-class discussions  it helped me become a more active listener and intentional participator.",
                "I was caused to reflect about the nature of my college education, but I was kind of going to do that anyways because the beginning of college kind of naturally spurs that type of reflection.",
                "I learned to actually think about what kind of life I want to live, what kind of college experience/education I want to have during my years at Yale, and how that education will help me reach the type of life I want to live.",
                "Got used to talking in a seminar and received a lot of feedback on my writing. Professor Croasmun offers questions to think about as you read the text which definitely helps when reading complex writing so you know what to focus on and get a gist of the text.",

                "Strengths: the material is extremely interesting and really makes you think, Matt is an incredible professor, the seminar style is really conducive to the concepts covered in the course, the assignments are genuinely interesting, the class discussions are really interesting and insightful Weaknesses: the papers can be a little difficult at first if you've never written in a more philosophical style but Matt's feedback is really helpful in developing this skill",
                "I think the topics covered in this class are really important, but the way that dialogue during discussion was facilitated could have been better. There was a lot of teacher to student (and back to teacher) discussion, yet for some reason very little dialogue from student to student.",
                "One strength of this course was the inclusive and welcoming nature of the class. I always felt comfortable with speaking, and I really respected how each person brought something very different to the table each class. I loved how we read each other's final papers in the same manner that we read course materials, as it emphasized further the validity of each person's perspective. One weakness (and honestly this didn't bother me at all) is that we only really interpreted texts rather than engaging with other mediums as well.",
                "Strengths: Encourages introspection and intentional participation, feels very student-driven, guided by open-ended discussion questions, promotes conversation amongst peers, very cool that it's like a \"constant field trip\" because we're analyzing education from within an actual classroom\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wonder whether the course would've benefited from some more tangible, present-day examples of educational philosophies at work. Maybe, for example, we could've facilitated some sort of simulation of what a Confucian education would look like, or a Wollstonecraft education, etc.",
                "This course is poorly structured, but perhaps that reflects the vague, unstructured nature of the title education and the life worth living. Class discussions quickly became monotonous and repetitive, and the whole thing felt like it was a desperate attempt to imitate the feel of a dead poets society type class but without the substance. This course could be improved by radically altering the texts read to try and generate some genuine intellectual depth and complexity and even start pushing the boundaries a little instead of asking possibly interesting questions but quickly receding to intellectual comfort zones.  \r\nAlso, often the discussion would be shifted to a discussion of race/gender in education, which would be fine for an Ed studies class about race or gender in education, but didnt really fit here and just further obfuscated the point of the discussion.",
                "The class is super easy to follow along to. Some of the readings can be confusing if they're an older text, but they're not bad. We also get a lot of feedback on our writings and the weekly self reflections help a lot to have you reflect on what you gathered in the class. The class offers the opportunity to foster really strong relationships with your classmates since the class is very personal to what Your Life With Living is.",
                "The strength is in Prof. Croasmun's teaching pedagogy sincere, thoughtful, inclusive, yet understanding and flexible.\r\nThe weakness arrives later in the term, when the class loses a bit of the structure that guided class discussions.",
                "Texts are largely interesting and relevant to the course. Professor Matt is a wonderful guide through the content of the course and in-class exercises and discussions were interesting and helpful, especially towards the end of the course. I would recommend that for the final essay there is some structure/set-up during class  for future students workshop their ideas/vision of a life worth living before first drafting.",

                "1000% I would recommend this course to anyone. This course will make you think about yourself and the world as a whole. The readings really resonated with me and we were able to read a wide variety of authors that really contributed to my personal vision of education and life in general. The readings, discussions, and papers are all extremely engaging and Matt is an incredible professor. This is probably one of the best First-Year Seminar available, I would wholeheartedly recommend it.",
                "Yes - I think it is a really valuable class to take as a first-year. It is pretty relaxed and laid-back, and the material covered is generally pretty interesting.",
                "Absolutely! I can't stress enough how impactful this course was in my life. I feel like I have the skillset and mindset to carry out a more intentional life, especially during my time at Yale. Education does not feel like a means to an end anymore; rather, it feels like a valuable opportunity for growth along a continuous journey of flourishing.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think every first-year student would benefit from this course, which aims to help you answer (or, at least, ponder) the fundamental questions: what is an education for? What is the life worth living, to me? What does it mean for me to flourish? I witnessed many peers' beliefs about themselves and \"the flourishing life\" change as they engaged in class discussions. This course did not feel like added pressure; rather, it felt like a true breath of fresh airan opportunity to reflect, explore various philosophies on education and the life worth living, and share/glean insights with/from peers.",
                "No. This is a bad course. Even worse is because its a first year seminar, most of the people in it are too eager to buy into the course to actually try and steer it against the tide of the courses structure and into a more interesting direction. But If you want to raise some interesting questions and then do absolutely nothing with them, all the while feeling like youre doing important intellectual work, then this could be the right place for you.",
                "Yes! It was really helpful to define what I want to get out of my years at Yale, especially as a first-year. I also loved reading texts from various different authors books that I probably would have continued to put off reading otherwise.",
                "Yes! Such an amazing First-Year Seminar to start off college with that really changed the way I was approaching my college education in general. Many of my peers have also noted that this class changed their thought process from the beginning of the year to now because of all the discussions and readings. Very insightful and reflective class to take- there's not many classes like this.",
                "Yes this class is a wonderful way to start your Yale career. Matt challenges you to struggle with texts, engage with the ideas and your peers, and there is little emphasis on grades.",
                "Yes! Take this course! Matt is a great professor."
