                "More documentaries. And I think the \"unit\" style of the class (a unit on the Vietnam War, a unit on the Holocaust, etc) hindered it more than anything. There are great historical documentaries that would have been more interesting that don't fall into those categories.",
                "The films selected for the syllabus were great, and I truly enjoyed watching most of them. The readings were very informative as well. Professor Musser is very informed and good at dissecting interesting questions and facilitating a comfortable seminar environment, but sometimes classes would feel a bit disorganized. It might help to have some guiding discussion questions for each class.",
                "Most of the films were very interesting and you can tell that Professor Musser knows the material extremely well. He added a personal knowledge of some of the films or filmmakers that made the class very special. The discussions I think were weak in this course, despite Professor Musser's best attempts to get people talking, because people didn't have much incentive to engage. Perhaps a weekly discussion post, even if just a few sentences or questions that the film rose, would be helpful or guiding questions we should think about when viewing the films.",
                "More emphasis on readings, perhaps weekly discussion posts could fix this. Strengths are the documentaries themselves and Prof. Musser's knowledge of the history of the field."

                "I would recommend this class to a history or American Studies major with an interest in film, but it really isn't a typical film class.",
                "If you're at all interested in history and\/or film, this class offers a new perspective that I found to be very exciting and engaging. It's not too much work, and it's nice to have a class that's focused on watching films as opposed to copious amounts of reading. I would highly recommend it!",
                "If you have an interest in film production or film, this class is very interesting because Professor Musser knows a lot about the industry and a lot of the discussion revolves around the timeline of films being made. If you are interested in the class because you want to learn more about history, the films will surely teach you a lot but the discussion, at least in our class, did not center so much around the historical content.",
