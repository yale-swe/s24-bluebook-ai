                "This course helped me develop my analytical skills of literary texts, especially texts written before the contemporary period. I learned to build arguments within the text and minimize external bias in my writing.",
                "I developed the ability to write in various academic styles including artifact description, broadcast, and traditional literary analysis of historical texts. A main focus of the course was avoiding presentism, which was a new concept for me. I also attended three external lectures of my choice which helped to broaden the scope of the course, seeing how literary analysis or artifact analysis can apply to other fields.",
                "I learned about travel narratives\/accounts and their various styles, content, and meanings. I also got better at writing in different styles, editing more critically, deciphering more difficult texts, and using specific evidence to back up my arguments.",
                "This course introduces you to texts that you most likely would have otherwise never come into contact with. That being said, it introduces you to an entirely new genre of literature. The genre of travel narratives requires that you analyze the text in a unique and challenging way. This challenge definitely made me better at literary analysis and taught me how to separate the author from the text itself. This class also helps you improve your writing style, specifically on how to weave an argument throughout your paper and have your claims build upon themselves. You also use many secondary and primary sources, and through this course, you learn how to find and properly use such texts.",
                "This was one of the best courses I've ever taken. I learned lots of fascinating tidbits about life and travel in the past. I also gained a surprising amount of insight into flaws in my writing and how best to improve.",
                "Learned about reasons for traveling, different travelers from a variety of cultures, and contrasted them with one another. During humanities labs, we learned how to write better by workshopping each others papers and having many speakers come in."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: intensive introduction to academic writing; the collections visits are great opportunities for first-year students to get acquainted with Yale's resources and research\r\nWeakness: expectations for major assignments can be unclear, and we sometimes get different guidelines from the course instructors and the organizers of the \"Six Pretty Good Ideas\" Friday workshop",
                "Strengths: Great texts, amazing professor, fun assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The point of reading such texts felt like an exercise, given how tedious, dry, or technical travel accounts can be.",
                "I felt as if we were given 50% of the instructions we needed to complete the assignments.",
                "Strengths: variety in writing assignments, feedback and focus on improving writing technique and argumentation, brilliant insights from both Professor Toorawa (Dr. T) and Victoria (Dr. B, our TA) on the text and on writing in general, holding students accountable for making good arguments in class (and helping us build solid arguments from texts)\r\n\r\nDoesn't have an option to evaluate Victoria, but she was excellent! Really helpful feedback, great class discussions that discussed all aspects of the text, and generally super nice and easy to talk to\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes spending lots of class doing things unrelated to readings, which decreased incentive to read the texts fully; sometimes unrelated Friday sessions (together with all of the Six Pretty Good Ideas suite)",
                "The discussion in this class was very engaging and flowed extremely easily. The speaker we had come in to talk about her experiences traveling was a great way to incorporate the idea of modern travel. The trips on Friday to different Yale collections were fantastic and I was shown so much I definitely would not have otherwise seen. The professor and TA are always willing to meet with you and provide constructive feedback which helped my writing improve. This class was also assigned a peer tutor from the writing center who was so helpful in crafting the midterm and final papers. \r\n\r\nAt times I felt like this course lacked some organization, but I think that was due to this course being taught for the first time. It especially seemed like a challenge to make this course align with what was being taught in the Friday writing lab. I think this course could be improved if the readings were shorter. Since the readings are so long, we had so much information in our heads coming into each class. The writing in this course really focused on the literary techniques used by the authors and if the readings were shorter, I feel like we would have been better able to discuss the nitty-gritty components of the texts that our papers were meant to be about.",
                "The instructors, both Dr. T and Dr. Baena, as well as the writing lab leaders Dr. Figlerowicz and Dr. Ramachandran, were always energetic and ready to answer any question and give genuinely insightful advice. The readings, most of which were to do with Medieval travel writing, never failed to capture my interest. One particular highlight were the collections visits. Getting to page through ancient manuscripts was probably one of the coolest experiences of my life thus far.\r\n\r\nWhile the class was well-structured in terms of content, I would have preferred if assignment grades had been posted regularly throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: a good diversity of texts, field trips to Beinecke where we got to interact with rare books directly \r\nWeaknesses: not much time spent on discussion, slightly unstructured class time, 3 hours on Friday sometimes not the most helpful"

                "I would recommend this course to people who want to take a Humanities course without being put off by lofty reading. Most of the texts we read for this class are equally entertaining and informative, and I learned a lot about European and Middle Eastern history from the travel narratives. This course (and Six Pretty Good Ideas in general) is a wonderful opportunity to learn about Yale's humanities research and collections. You will also get to interact with various artifacts from the Beineke in person!",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if this student knew they were interested in travel accounts. Do not expect to read as many epic tales of adventure as descriptions of the distance between buildings in furlongs. Your writing will definitely improve, however.",
                "If you're interested in comparative literature, history, travel, and improving and challenging your writing, I would take it! It was nice to take as a first year seminar as well - a good intro to Yale humanities courses.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in Arabic literature. I also think this course is a great introduction to what it is like to study humanities. If a student is looking for a unique class that will improve their writing, this would be a great option. However, I do think students should keep in mind that this is unlike normal freshman seminars where the professor does all the teaching and grading. The class was taught through equal collaboration between the professor and TF (which I personally felt helped further discussion about the texts) and the TF was the one who graded our assignments.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Dr. T and Dr. Baena are amazing instructors and make the class very fun to take. The readings are all very interesting and are for the most part books I probably would not have read had I not taken this class. You gain a real insight into life in the past and what modern humans are able and unable to understand about life in the past.",
                "Yes, helpful to learn more about studying humanities at Yale and to be introduced to important travelers."
