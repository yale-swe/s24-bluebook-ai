There are many people who have very lenient PIs and who are able to put in less than 10 hours a week with the guarantee that they will still get an A. By contrast, there are PIs who ask you to come in more than 10 hours a week, but then will still be very harsh with the grading. It's really unfortunate, because it means that your entire experience and grade is determined by your PI, rather than there being any semblance of a standardized metric to reach. I highly recommend that the course create a rubric for grading in the spring semester, because as it stands, the system is highly unfair, and the grades will not reflect the work that students have put in. There must be greater standardization in the MCDB thesis process.",

                "Course is very independent, there are no meeting times or much interaction with course professors. I would suggest having a good relationship with the research mentor you planning on working with (as well as your PI)",
