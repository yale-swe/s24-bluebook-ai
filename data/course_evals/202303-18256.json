                "Strength: this is a typical math class and you will be very comfortable with its organization after taking a few math classes. Weakness: 9am is brutal, but I can't be motivated to watch lectures otherwise.",
                "The course content gets fairly harder in the second half of the semester, so just be prepared for that and make sure not to slack off.",
                "Strengths: The lectures slides are well-organized and there is a review session at the start of each lecture so it's easy to absorb course material. The office hours by TAs are very helpful with the weekly problem sets\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like the second half of this course (after the midterm) covered way more material than the first half and more time could be dedicated to the last few topics. Also having this class be a 9am is rough especially with the sheer amount of theoretical information contained in each lecture",
                "The strength of the course is it provided a robust overview of probabilities. There were two main weaknesses of the course. First, I think the pace picked up a little too much towards the end, and the final was significantly more difficult than the midterm. Second, I think there could be more practice questions aside from the pset, because the lectures were mostly just on the theoretical concepts.",
                "This course is not taught in an understandable way, most of the things I learned were just because I searched and learned them using the textbook or other online resources. The problem sets' difficulty doesn't match the level of the classroom topics. Not enough examples were discussed for the concepts covered in the class. The final exam was 1- so specifically focused on some parts (e.g., uniform distributions repeated many times whereas some others like exponential distributions were missing) 2- hard compared to the level of theory covered in class.",
                "Strengths: detailed lecture slides; clear, simple course requirements\r\nWeaknesses: lack of well-timed office hours throughout the week. Each TF\/ULA only held 1 hour of office hours a week - much less than each is allotted for.",
                "so boring",
                "1. Offer more chances to gain bonus can push us to work harder. \r\n2. TFs often cannot answer our questions, involving class materials and homework. When the TA hours end, some just go away and leave us feeling confused.",
                "The theory is addressed clearly. Maybe providing more intuition and invoking idea can be helpful to improve the course.",
                "Strengths: fair amount of office hours, very interesting course content\r\nWeaknesses: difference between class examples and pset problems was very high. Would prefer longer psets with maybe one or two more digestible questions (that can be applied directly from class to practice the formulas and concepts), than shorter, more difficult psets",
                "Strengths: felt like I learned a good amount \r\nWeaknesses: easy to fall behind, lack of examples in class, lectures were not engaging, not much support to prepare for final exam (didnt feel prepared)",
                "Strengths - the content itself (isolated from the way it is taught in this course) is interesting, which gives the staff something that should be good to work with\r\nWeaknesses - Poorly taught. So poorly taught that nobody showed up to the 500+ lecture class except to take exams. Made content that was originally so interesting to me so bleak and hard to learn. Many students watched the Harvard adjacent course recorded on YouTube 10 years ago to understand the material. There was an extreme lack of helpful feedback from professor and TAs, and on some occasions, even discriminatory behavior from teaching staff. Exam difficulty was extremely unpredictable -- the rigor of the practice exams given was nowhere close to the rigor of the final exam.",
                "I think this course could benefit from more problems which practice the skills. On the exam, we often have to do things that we've only practiced a few times, so it would be better if we got a few easy problems to get used to computations. But overall the class does a good job of teaching probability and demonstrating why it is important.",
                "it will be nice if this is not the required course of my master program, I have learnt these knowledge for three times before master years ago",
                "The course is well taught, but I think since the assumption is that a student has taken Math 120 already, Yihong skips over some important steps while solving a problem, so the slides are sometimes hard to follow. The psets are very fun, and the teaching staff is overall very helpful.",
                "Lectures weren't super engaging, if course wasn't taught at 9am on science hill I think a lot more people would have showed up to class. Concepts were important and useful however",
                "It was hard to judge how important a given lecture was for the overall course (e.g. Buffon's needle or MGF) but very interesting material. Psets sometimes were incredibly difficult, requiring \"facts\" that were very hard to derive.",

                "great course",
                "A strength of the course are the lectures. Even though almost no one attends them at 9am, the slides are extremely well-made and present the content in a very comprehensive way. Also, the problem sets often included interesting applications that were enjoyable to derive. Even though the class is called Probability Theory, there is not actually very much emphasis on the theory, which could be seen as a strength or weakness. One weakness was that the exams did not reflect the lectures or problem sets very well.",
                "It is a very thorough course which does make it a bit fast-paced. Maybe adding more discussion hours would help to digest the material.",
                "The weekly session reviews did not focus on examples, just definitions from the course.",
                "I think the last few weeks of the course moved very quickly and I could have used more practice on these topics through PSETS problems for example. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this course and found the office hours very helpful.",
                "The lectures are at 9 am. There was no way I was going, it should be a better time slot.",
                "Strengths: Good lecture notes, PSETs are straightforward and somewhat helpful; Weaknesses: Very early in the morning, lectures are basically reading off the slides.",
                "Strengths: the teacher is very good at answering questions and the course forces you to understand concepts really well. Also, the teaching assistants were very helpful. I worshipped them in terms of the class. Weaknesses: the lectures would be much more effective IF the teacher moved a lot more slowly. His understanding was obviously there, it was just that he assumed a lot more understanding from students that they had. Additionally, the teacher did not seem very passionate about the material frankly. At times it seemed like he didnt want to teach and that he was rather instructed to teach students certain material. Other weakness\/red flag: the textbook was more helpful than the lecture and the lecture was way too early (p am) to properly absorb this complicated material.",

                "Best professor",
                "Strengths: The content was pretty interesting, especially the examples (ie poker). Lectures are recorded (but be careful not to make the same fateful mistake of falling behind as I did). The midterm is doable. The class is much easier if you do a better job at staying on top of it than I did and not assuming you'll be fine if you do well on the midterm.\r\nWeaknesses: The final. Worth 40% of your grade and with only one midterm that everyone does pretty well on, the final basically decides your grade. It is way more difficult than the midterm and only includes material on the second half of the class (the harder part) despite the instructors telling wrongly telling us that it would cover all content. The lectures are also not presented well and the often cause confusion.",
                "I liked the pacing of lectures and i felt the homework assignments helped with improving my understanding. However the second half of the class moved significantly faster than the first",
                "Strengths: probability theory is a fascinating subject (in my opinion). The course is decently well-organized, and the textbook in particular is super well-written and very helpful if you need help understanding the material. Professor Wu also posts the lecture slides, which are nearly as clear and well-organized as the textbook is, so it's another great resource to have. Finally, exams are pretty fair, and Professor Wu posts the midterms\/finals from the past few years of the class as practice, so you always know exactly what to expect in terms of difficulty\/general content areas of the exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's a 9 am class with a mediocre lecturerthat should probably tell you enough. A few weeks into the course, maybe 10% of the class bothered to show up to lectures, especially since they are all recorded. This can be a strength if you are very good at self-studying, but it also makes it very easy to have very low engagement with the course beyond skimming the lecture notes\/textbook and doing the problem sets (which is what happened for me and most of my friends). Also, the first half of the course is incredibly easy compared to the second half of the course, so be prepared for a pretty drastic ramp-up in difficulty a couple weeks after the midtermI would strongly recommend that future versions of this course go through the first half more quickly so that there is more time to really learn the more difficult (and more interesting) material from the second half.",
                "Strengths: The course is recorded and all lecture slides are posted. TFs and instructors are very responsive on Ed Discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Many of the problem sets were quite hard and it seemed for some of them that you would never get the answer unless you had assistance from a TF for some ingenious solution. The final was also extremely difficult compared to the rest of the course and practice exams!",

                "This is a good course. You learn what you need to learn, and the assignments are fair. The lectures are recorded which is nice, but it does mean that you can fall behind pretty easily, so certainly do your best to stay on top of the content.",
                "Difficulty of homework is suitable for learning",
                "The lecture is a bit hard to follow",
                "The lectures are very vague. I think there should be more student engagement.",
                "TA's are good. Instruction is a bit monotonous. PSETS are pretty hard.",
                "Strengths: It'll fulfil a major requirement and provide a very good foundation for anything statistical\/probabilistic. Also helps with calculus\/problem solving. Having a good ULA (as I did) or a good TA will be so helpful, since there was always a problem on the pset I would get stuck on, but there are so many office hours it's easy to get support. Having a good textbook to refer to really helps clarify things.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The psets can be very tricky (but they're only 5 questions and not horribly long). Prof Wu mostly reads from his (quite detailed\/clear) slides, and doesn't really give much insight on top of that (regarding intuition or why we use a particular piece of math). He also assumes quite a bit of calculus knowledge, and often skips steps in his derivations that make it harder to follow.",
                "Strengths - very good lectures, lecture slides, homework not too long, recorded lectures",
                "The exam is really hard and always go beyond my expectation.",
                "I believe that there was a disconnect between the lectures and the psets in that often times I would not know where to even start. Often I would feel uncertain which concepts could or couldn't be applied to the psets because of my lack of understanding of the criteria. Also I found that having no previous background in a proof based course, which was not required as you only have to take math 120 concurrently with 241, led to a lot of difficulty. I believe that requiring or at least encouraging proof experience is important for future classes. Additionally, linear algebra, which was not required for the course, was present with practically 0 outside aid. I also felt that often times the peer tutors assumed that we understood more than we did, including these linear algebra concepts.",
                "This course is great in terms of challenging yet do-able problems sets that helped me learn a lot. It does not focus much on how to do integrals since calculus is assumed.",
                "Topics introduced clearly for the most part. Ideas communicated effectively, but felt I wasnt as comfortable with problem solving techniques as I would have liked to be by the end. I wish more time was spent on the process and methods of solving problems generally.",
                "contents are clear and simple.",
                "This is all-rounded and cover almost everything about probability theory.",
                "The class is very well formatted, each class and the slides are very clear.",
                "Strengths: Yihongs teaching. Clear and straightforward.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: PSets do not prepare you well for the final exam.",
                "The course contains most of the probability knowledge, which is very helpful.",
                "Slides are well-written. Assignments and exams are way harder than class examples.",
                "This course is the foundational gateway to many higher-level courses in probability and statistics, and Professor Wus effective teaching is the great highlight of the course.",
                "This was a strong course teaching essential and fundamental aspects of probability. The course could be strengthened by focusing more on the application to experimental techniques in physics, economics, and data analysis. The course could also be improved by rewarding students for attending class in-person.",
                "Strength: the problems are solid and challenging. Good for developing the skills needed to solve these types of problems consistently. Good amount of exposure to unique scenarios to apply the learnings in this class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: boring. The lectures are early in the morning so the motivation to go is already low. The lectures feel slow and uninteresting for non-trivial amounts of time. The material of the course ramps up quickly after the first midterm, but the pacing remains the same, which felt jarring and I felt unprepared and surprised when we reached the hardest concepts.",
                "The material in the course was interesting, and I appreciated the fact that slides were posted\/lectures were recorded. That said, a lot of the lectures felt like a weird mix between theory and application; there were certain points in lecture at which I wished that either proofs were explained in greater detail or that more applications\/real-world problems were worked out. I also didn't end up finding a ULA that I really liked\/learned well from, but I think if I went to more sessions, perhaps this would not have been the case. (NOTE: Another weakness was perhaps that the course was at 9:00 a.m. at Kline; if there would be any way to make the course later or closer to more of the dorms, the student experience (at least for me) would be greatly improved.)",
                "The professor mostly just read off of the slides in the lectures, which were also really early in the morning and recorded, which made the class hard to engage with.",
                "Course expectations were clear and problem sets were thoughtfully designed. At most lectures, though, attendance was quite low (they were held in Marsh @9am and recorded). Perhaps course logistics could be changed to improve lecture engagement.",
                "The course content is interesting and it is very well organized.",
                "Strengths: The flow of topics was very good, as each class built on the previous ones in clear ways. Prof. Wu was a strength, making the class engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 9am lectures on Science Hill. Also, only offered once a year.",
                "The homework assignments were very consistent, and the layout of the course was very clear. Had some interesting probability\/statistical questions in both problem sets and tests.",
                "tests are very fair. grading is less fair but it needs to be like that tbh",
                "The course's content provided a solid understanding of the core of probability theory, and included a wide variety of applications. Many of the office hours for the course were also very informative and helpful for exams\/assignments. \r\nAlthough the lectures were informative, they were not very engaging, and there was at times a clear gap between the material given in lecture and the material assessed through problem sets and exams. Integrating more practice problems and active opportunities for engagement into lecture would improve the course.",
                "It was all around a good course, the teacher is great and the testing centered around the problems given in class.",
                "The undergradaute TAs cannot commit to attending a standard office hour.",
                "The lectures and office hours are very helpful.",
                "This course covers a wide variety of topics in probability theory, which makes it a good introduction for students interested in the field. I do not have any weaknesses of the course in mind."

                "Yes. I think the level of mathematical rigor is just right for me. I gained a much deeper insight about how probability works and walked away feeling confident about approaching probability problems, while I'm sure if I took 238 instead I'll still be stuck in the mist of tools and unable to comprehend the underlying principles. Definitely take it and love it if you like math.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to another student because Yihong is a great professor, and the content is very interesting and fundamental. Do note that the course content rapidly accelerates after the midterm, though. The second half of the course is much more difficult although that comes with more interesting content that builds upon skills from the first half.",
                "It is pretty much a required class for most stats majors. I think it is a fair class in terms of difficulty as long as you pay attention to the lectures and go to office hours for help. This class is heavily focused on theory rather than applications.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interests in S&DS and have a strong mathematical background.",
                "No, you can simply pass online courses with a much broader range of topics, better explanations, and without torturing students.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in statistics\/data science\/related fields. This course teaches the fundamentals necessary for studying these fields. Just be wary that the exams are quite difficult, and getting an A isn't easy.",
                "its kinda hard",
                "Yes. It's an excellent introduction to understanding how the world works",
                "Probably. Good introduction to the math required for S&DS, and very interesting concepts",
                "If needed for the major. Not a super engaging or fun\/enjoyable course but teaches important concepts",
                "Yes. If you like computational math, this class will be a perfect fit.",
                "NO, unless you have done competition math in high school or already understand these concepts, this course is taught in a way that makes it harder for you to learn.",
                "Many students have to take this for their major, but anyone interested in getting an introduction to a more abstract way of thinking about probability should take the course.",
                "Yes, the examples are very good for improving our understanding",
                "Yes, very interesting and applicable.",
                "Good introduction to a lot of key concepts in probability, decent intro course if you're leaning quant, although Stochastic might be more optimal if you already know semi-basic probability stuff",
                "This course is one of the more difficult classes you will take, but it's very satisfying if you like problem solving with some fun applications. Helpful if you're doing those kinds of interviews or are just interested in probability. However, it does get significantly more difficult post-midterm and the psets get increasingly difficult. There's maybe 1 or 2 questions in each pset that are more proof-based and difficult to derive the answer.",
                "Do not take it if you can",
                "Yes! You learn so much fundamentals that it's useful in both theory and application. The gradual development of the workload is very adaptive and a good pace.",
                "I would because this is required for further advanced classes.",
                "Yes, this is the perfect course for the person with some mathematical background to begin the probability and statistics journey",
                "yes, the instructor is the best mathematical statistician in his generation",
                "Yes if you have a remotely math-adjacent background you should be fine. It's a fair class with relatively short psets. It's not necessarily the most riveting all the time but it's also not bad at all. Recorded lectures are a huge plus.",
                "This is a great probability course that will teach you how to approach statistics and probability problems. This course goes much more in-depth than its counterpart, S&DS 238, but also required a stronger foundation in mathematics. If you are more interested in the mathematics side of stats, this is the course for you; if you are more interested in the applications, 238 may be a better choice. One piece of advice: Make sure to prepare for the exams and use the practice resources to guide your studying. The exams rely on a strong understanding of the concepts, not the procedures, which is not emphasized in the lectures or homeworks very much.",
                "I would warn them that it was challenging material and fast-paced, but I would recommend it because I learned a lot",
                "If you already have an interest in mathematics, this course is engaging.",
                "I would. I found the PSETS interesting and the workload was a good balance.",

                "Yes. It is very difficult but it help you think if you put in the work. Be prepared to figure out a lot of things yourself.",
                "I would recommend to other statistics students since it's an intro level probability course",
                "I would recommend it, the course is interesting. There are some proofs if you like that (I do: almost everything we use is proven!) But it's not necessary to understand that for the course. Highly recommend.",
                "Yes. Intro to probability",
                "Cautiously yes. The course is quite interesting but requires preparedness. Maybe I would suggest not taking it if it's your first semester of college like I did.",
                "Yes, i believe the course is a good introductory course (for me at least)",
                "Overall, yes. This course gives a pretty good summary of many different topics in probability theory, which is a really beautiful (and important) subject and worth learning for both Math\/S&DS majors and really for all Yale students. The textbook is fantastic, and Professor Wu's lecture notes are also pretty good and well-organized. However, this is a 9 am class, and Professor Wu is not a super engaging lecturerso don't expect super amazing lectures (if you're in the 20% of the class who actually wake up before 9 am). This makes it very easy to have low engagement with the course, and most people will have to do at least a little bit of work on their own time to fully understand the material and get the most of out of the class.",
                "Only if it's required. Not a very interesting class",
                "This is a hard core class recommended for statistics students.",

                "Yes. Very good foundation course for probability",
                "Yes, the course is well designed, the instructor is helpful, and the slides are easy to understand. I learned a lot.",
                "If you have any interest in probability (and at least a bit of background in stats), take this course. It's pretty fun, and you learn the basics of probability theory well. Be forewarned: the beginning of the course will feel like a cakewalk, but the last 3-4 problem sets get seriously difficult. Be prepared as the content ramps up after the midterm in a big way.",
                "The first half of this course is interesting enough to take just for fun, but the second half is probably beyond what non-stat\/math majors would ever want to know. If this is one option for a major or certificate I think it's worth taking.",
                "I would only if you want to have a systematic review of probability theory",
                "If you plan to take a probability course, I suggest 241 over 240 because it counts for the S&DS major if you ever decide to pursue it. The course was difficult and office hours are crucial for the PSets nearly every week",
                "I would recommend it because it's useful. But I think the course structure should be more friendly to students.",
                "Some HWs and final exam felt harder than anything wed learned in class, which was annoying. Overall decent class.",
                "Unless they really like hard math, no. It isn't the most exciting probability class and it's pretty hard. However, I understand its necessity.",
                "Yes if you need it as a major requirement or are ready for a challenge.",
                "If they are not required to take, not recommend.",

                "Definitely for those who have have rather strong background in calculus and are interested in learning about probability theory.",
                "I recommend if you want to develop your intuitions and problem solving techniques for both discrete and continuous probability problems.",
                "Yes, it is a very useful course for future studies.",
                "Yes, because its challenging",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, I will.  It is a good introductory course",
                "I would recommend this course if you have time to devote to careful study of the lectures and textbooks. Office hours unfortunately are just answer-reveals without much academic inquiry. The professor seems always in a rush to be somewhere else. The material is interesting, but please take your time with it or youll feel lost come the Midterm.",
                "Definitely  any mathematically inclined student would benefit from taking this class, which teaches you to think about the world in terms of probability distributions rather than just considering the expected value of an event.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in the quantitative tools used to analyze probability and has some background in single-variable calculus. I would not recommend the course to students in engineering or sciences who already have a basic fluency in the tools of statistical analysis.",
                "I would recommend it for the concepts it covers alone. Understanding statistics and probability opens one's eyes to the world (especially in today's data-oriented climate) in a way that is beneficial to anyone. I do not think the course is taught interestingly, however. But it covers the important material well and I learned a lot from this class.",
                "This lectures were definitely not my favorite, and I often wondered whether the 20min walk to KT for a 9:00 a.m. class was worth it. That said, the content can be cool, and if you are into probability, I'm sure you'd enjoy the class! (DISCLAIMER: Probability isn't my favorite, though I like it okay!)",
                "I think the topics were interesting but this class felt like a bit of a waste of a credit because I didn't find the lectures particularly engaging.",
                "No but most people do not have a choice.",
                "Most students take the course to fill a requirement. Regardless, I would definitely recommend the course! You get introduced to many important probabilistic problem-solving techniques which will be useful in almost any quantitative field.",
                "I found this course very interesting and relevant and for a math class it is fairly accessible.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students.",
                "Yes, especially you like competition Math.",
                "Absolutely. I think if you are interested in a mathematical foundation for statistical concepts, this is absolutely the right option to take. If you aren't, however, I would look into the alternative stats course which is more application-focused (I believe 238?), as this one is definitely a math-focused course.",
                "sure, if you don't really understand stats or have a deep experience of doing high school competition math, this will be a very helpful course on that front",
                "Yes as both a major requirement, or interest course.",
                "I would mainly recommend this course to students who plan to take higher level S&DS classes and\/or students for whom the course is required for their major. Although it covers many topics central to understanding probability theory and the professor is both passionate about the subject and approachable, the concepts can be difficult to understand and the lectures could be more engaging.",
                "Yes, if a student would like to learn more about probability and is already comfortable with probability, then they should take this course. A prior introduction to probability should already be complete.",
                "Yes, I would. The puzzles are challenging and interesting to think about.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in probability theory.",
                "Yes highly recommend! The course can seem challenging at first but you can do it! (Also if you are planning to take the class, a super helpful tip is to do the problems in the textbook\/look at their solutions if you don't understand something or don't know how to the homework problems!)"
