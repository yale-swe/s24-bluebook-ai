Magaziner is one of the best lecturers I have ever had - he is a natural storyteller and makes the course like a narrative while keeping it intellectual and informative. We looked at a mix of primary sources as well as reading interesting autobiographies and novels which gives you a look at the period from many different angles. The workload is significant but not challenging if you keep on top of the readings and there is room to experiment with the essays and do creative versions of you ask in advance!",

                "This course was amazing! Lectures were riveting, reading assignments were very carefully curated to supplement lecture material without being repetitive, and the workload was super manageable for a history course. Prof. Magaziner can answer any questions about South Africa, no matter how much they depart from the course material. He's obviously passionate and very knowledgeable about the subject matter, and he makes it easy to see why you should care about this stuff too. No notes!!",
                "Professor Magaziner is very eloquent and gives beautifully spoken lectures. That being said, he is sometimes very hard to follow because he isn't guided by dates so I would randomly be in lecture confused on the timeline.",
                "Magaziner is a good and engaging lecturer",
                "I felt that the structure was a little nebulous sometimes",
                "Strengths: \r\n- incredibly engaging professor\r\n-great spread of material across time not focusing too much/little on any period \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- perhaps a few too many primary sources for the first few weeks which meant it was more difficult to get into each",
                "Professor Magaziner is incredible. And the readings were incredible.",
                "Strengths: engaging material and lectures weaknesses; overwhelming at time s",
                "This course had a lot of strengths. Professor Magaziner is probably the most knowledgable and passionate professor i have had at yale, and for my TA, the same. The course was fluid, making great flashbacks to relevant points in history which contributed to a very comprehensive, yet not overwhelming history of South Africa. I think the course could be improved by slightly fewer book readings because it seemed a little too much to read as the semester progressed.",
                "Strength: lectures were engaging, I appreciated the novels as reading for section, we are taught to look at history critically, appreciated the papers as our assignments where we could reflect on the themes of the class rather than a fact-based exam (because memorizing dates/people etc is not what this class is about). Weaknesses: way too many readings for a lecture class and I struggled to do them all.",
                "Fascinating content that finds perfect expression in a great lecturer, Daniel Magaziner. The lectures are intense and move incredibly fast but the content is fascinating and presented extremely well. A major strength in my experience was also my TF, Brad Brockman. He made discussion sections fun and engaging and, as a South African himself, brings invaluable expertise to the field of South African study. The assigned reading can be very heavy at times. It is manageable because not all of it needs to be read to be able to understand the course in a given week, but, especially in the last few weeks of class when final papers and projects are coming up, there is a tremendous amount of reading required. My one other piece of advice would be about canvas organization and text accessibility, sometimes the layout of the Files/Modules page made it confusing to find the materials we were expected to read for section every week.",
                "Strengths: lecture is super interesting and Professor Magaziner is amazing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not like how this course was structured. Quite honestly, having only two papers, no exams, and sort of random homework readings made it easy for students to completely disengage from the class. You probably could have skipped every lecture and done well in the class if you attended section regularly. I think this is unfortunate given how great the lectures and the class material are.",
                "The lectures were phenomenal and the readings were mostly very good. The lectures were so immersive in their storytelling that sometimes it felt like we needed a step back to provide the exposition though at times.",
                "I think that the lectures could have been better organized -- signposting might have helped.",
                "The course moved at a rapid-fire pace so that it was difficult to digest information or even to take good notes. If the course had moved a little slower and taken its time with key events I think I would have retained a lot more.",
                "The lectures for this course were enthralling - Professor Magaziner is incredible. The discussion section was also surprisingly rewarding; I learned a lot from the thoughts of the TA and my classmates.",
                "The lectures are extremely rich and in-depth. Professor Magaziner is very accessible and charismatic. His feedback during office hours allowed me to strengthen my writing. I also appreciated the heterogeneity of primary and secondary scholarship, including music, academic journals, novels, and manifestos.",
                "Prof magaziner is really smart and an interesting lecturer, I like that he told a history of south africa as a story but at times it was hard to grasp onto concrete events so it would have been helpful to have more dates, etc. The readings were interesting but having to read an entire book a week often for a lecture meant that we had to cram to get our discussion posts in so it would have been nice to have a lighter reading load",
                "The professor was amazing. The content was so interesting. I absolutely loved it!",
                "Strenths:\r\nVarious materials for learning (primary and secondary sources - books, newspapers, videos, movies, music, art, etc)\r\nEngaging lecture slides\r\nExcellent TFs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nToo much information to try and learn in one semester but the task is a large ask but was delivered upon well!",
                "Strengths: Magaziner is an amazing lecturer, the readings are interesting, and the workload is not too difficult but is fulfilling\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes too much reading",
                "Really engaging lecture! However, the weekly reading load is very high.",
                "strength: lectures were very interesting. the themes that the professor focused on were highly engaging. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: more secondary source material to balance out the novels we had to read. sometimes i couldn't read the books because they were too long.",
                "lots of strengths. professor really cares. TAs super accesible. lectures could be a little more linear (jumped around a lot), but overall it wasnt a huge problem",
                "The lectures were hard to keep up with because they did not have much structure, and there was very little writing on the slides. This made it hard to follow as names and terms were said in a language I was very unfamiliar with. That being said, the lectures were extremely well thought out.",
                "The strengths are that Prof. Magaziner's lectures are incredibly engaging (his four lectures during the last two weeks of the semester were some of the best lectures I've attended in the history department). A weakness is that the syllabus often assigns full novels to read in one week this is too much to complete in a single week, and certainly too much to discuss in depth during a 50 minute section. I think assigning a shorter and more manageable reading load each week would allow students to better engage with the readings in more depth, and thus create better, more pointed discussions during section. This is also a small thing, but the syllabus was often confusing to read and understand I think the literal syllabus document could be neatened/better organized."

Watching Prof Magaziner give a lecture is like watching a tedtalk or listening to one of those historians on TV or something, he has such a good flow. Going to lecture was one of the highlights of my week, every week. And since the workload isn't bad, there's absolutely no reason not to take this course even if you aren't a history major.",

                "Yes - I definitely learnt a huge amount",
                "Definitely! Apartheid is a period in history which is talked about a lot but difficult to understand without guidance, and without learning about the previous 200 years and how it came to be. Furthermore, the course has incredibly interesting links to the Cold War, slave trade and other interesting periods and events in global history. This class is a must take in the history department and for general knowledge",

                "Yes!! South African history is so interesting, even if you've never been/have no connection. There's some quote out there that's like \"South Africa is where world history converges\" and I think that's so true! The projects of colonialism, imperialism, and slavery intersect in South Africa in way that bears for everywhere else in the world",
                "DEFINITELY. Even if you aren't particularly interested in South African history but want to take a history class, take this one. I threw it in on a whim as an extra history class and it ended up being my favorite of the semester. The content is absolutely fascinating and Professor Magaziner is one of the best lecturers I have ever had. Plus only two assignments all year, both very doable. Highly recommend!",
                "I would recommend this course because Professor Magaziner is great and the material is fascinating. We only had two papers, which I guess could be a blessing or a curse depending on how you look at it.",

                "Yes! The content is a fantastic, and Magaziner lectures like a spoken word poet. That combination made me want to attend lecture every day.",
                "Great for history majors but otherwise difficult to engage with",
                "Absolutely. I cannot encourage other students to take this course enough. Professor Magaziner was very accommodating when I enrolled in the course during the last few days of shopping period, and he helped fit me into a section. This class taught me a lot about South Africa, but it also reframed how I viewed race relations in America and the the struggle for independence in colonial Africa.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it provides a critical, multidimensional survey of South African history. The lectures are extremely rich and in-depth. I also appreciated the heterogeneity of primary and secondary scholarship, including music, academic journals, novels, and manifestos.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! This history is so important for people to learn because much of it is still very relevant today.",
                "I would very much recommend this course to a fellow student who is looking to improve themselves and their historical background of the world.",
                "1000% yes. South African history is fascinating, and Magaziner is the best lecturer Ive had at Yale. The course was easy to follow, yet there was a great amount of information and I feel like I learned so much.",
                "If you're a history major I would definitely recommend this course to you! The lecture is really engaging, and you will be immersed in the material. However, if you are not a history major and just looking to take this class because it interests you, I would consider thinking about the workload, which is pretty hefty per week. If you're okay with dedicating a five-six extra hours a week to readings and discussion responses then take it!",
                "yes, because this course alllows you to learn about how Black South Africans resisted apartheid through collective struggle and the spectrum of voices and different philosophies that determined how the struggle was fought.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is very interesting all around. At times, the material can be emotionally heavy.",
