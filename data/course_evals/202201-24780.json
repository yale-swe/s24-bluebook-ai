                "I learned a ton about primate conservation, conservation power structures, and global warming threats in general.",
                "I learned a great deal about the current state of primate conservation efforts. I learned about the issues facing primate populations including commodity chain resource extraction, global climate change, and hunting. I also gained a general knowledge about the different primate species and the ecosystems they exist in. Another aspect of the course was discussing the power structures involved in primate conservation, from corporation bribery to the colonialist structure of conservation research efforts which have led to the silencing of many natives' voices. The class was fascinating and did an impressive job of teaching me so much about a topic I had very little previous knowledge in.",
                "Learned so much about conservation, but also about the interplay between biology, history, and human development issues. I feel like I now have a better, more holistic understanding of the challenges facing the world's primates, and also a better understanding of how to approach them.",

                "David Watts is a great lecturer and his knowledge is apparent and astounding. In all honesty, I did not take this class very seriously as I was mainly taking it to obtain a social science credit with as little resistance as possible. Nonetheless, I felt like I learned a good bit about primates and have since shared a lot of these things I have learned about with friends outside of the course. \r\n\r\nI do, however, wish that there would be a couple more in class conversations or debates. The last class of the semester was mainly structured around arguing about different issues we had learned about. I felt very engaged in the topics at hand and enjoyed hearing my classmates smart opinions on the topics. Additionally, this sort of debate gave Professor Watts the opportunity to interject with pieces of information that we may have otherwise not covered had it not been for the web of topics brought up in the discussion",
                "The strength is the content since it is such an important topic. The weakness is the level of engagement required for this class.",
                "Professor was so knowledgable and engaging and loved primates. Was so great to be able to learn from him. Also loved the way how you could choose which readings to respond to.",
                "The breadth of the material was really great. I also enjoyed the in class discussions. The use of videos was really helpful and there was a good balance between both the realities of the damage being done to the environment and also ways that people are making a positive impact. The assignments were also very flexible which made them more engaging.",
                "The content was all really interesting. I enjoyed that Professor Watts focused so much on highlighting individual stories and storytellers. Section was also really strong, and the assignments were engaging without being overwhelming. A weakness is that the lectures were a little disorganized and it didn't seem like there were clear units.",
                "The structure of this course was fantastic! The assignments were spaced well throughout the semester and were very doable, even at the busiest times. Professor Watts was also a strength of the course! He was very understanding and flexible with assignments and was genuinely most interested in engaging students in the material. The syllabus was really cool because it included a variety of sources including podcasts, articles, videos, textbooks, and full-length films. The material was super interesting and I honestly don't have a lot of feedback for improvement other than maybe have clearer guidelines for some assignments and communicate deadline information.",
                "One huge strength is Prof Watts himselfI'll rant more about how great he is in the prof review section, but his lectures were really, really cool. I also think the readings were quite interesting, and they covered everything from scientific papers to memos to essays to excerpts from books. I honestly wouldn't change a thing.",
                "course felt a little unorganized",
                "Strengths: Lots of interesting topics and videos assigned to watch.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not as much class engagement, would benefit from having more open discussions.",
                "Strengths: pretty easy grading, professor really cared about the class and material\r\nWeaknesses: 75 minute lectures got pretty boring and we also had section on top of them which I didn't know about until the first day of class",
                "Strengths: Assignments were laid out beforehand on the syllabus so you were aware of how many assignments there were/when they were due (which made it nice for scheduling purposes). Assignments were particularly difficult and felt appropriate for course material. Grading was super nice and didn't stress about grades for this class and felt like I genuinely learned something. Professor and TA were super flexible with making section times and section always felt applicable to class or related topics. \r\nWeaknesses: None really but I also think this class would seem repetitive if you aren't super into anthropology or if you take his other class. Sometimes they overlap and while I enjoyed this, others may not. TA was super knowledgable and always took extra care to make section accessible.",
                "Strengths: the passion that Professor Watts exuded made the lectures extremely interesting. He was always able to tie in his expertise and field experience into the course material. We watched many fascinating video clips and films. Composing video responses and critiques to research papers helped me truly understand and appreciate the material. Weaknesses: there could be more active participation incorporated into the classes."

                "Absolutely! You get to look at pictures of monkeys all class and watch really cool videos! Its super laid back, fun, and easy to engage with.",
                "Yes! In fact, I've recommend this course to every friend who's got the time. It's not a do nothing gut class, but the \"interesting content to work\" ratio is off the charts. Exactly the kind of random, unfamiliar, fascinating class I came to Yale hoping to find.",
                "Yes, I think it was an extremely interesting course and very different from any other typical course at Yale.",
                "If you are looking for a gut, then this is a good class. The assignments did not take too long and they were spread out throughout the semester pretty well. There was maybe two weeks were I had more than one assignment due. As long as you attend the sections and participate you'll be fine.\r\nIf this class is for your major, then it is also good. The professor really cares about the material and will engage with you.",

                "Yes!! Super interesting course and you dram from many different disciplines to get a nuanced understanding of primate conservation.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the threats that face primate survival. The knowledge gained from this course are also readily applicable to other species. Additionally, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in the conflict that exists between primate survival and the socioeconomic promotion of the populations that live near primates."
