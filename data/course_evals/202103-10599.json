                "Too boring",
                "Strengths: good way to get your feet wet with ear training, really chill professor (if Nate is teaching), low out-of-class workload and graded leniently with fair exams/midterms\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures sometimes felt repetitive and slow (but your experience would likely depend on your prior knowledge/training, and the class isnt supposed to be intense, so I dont know if I would change it), not too many theory concepts taught (but thats also probably not the purpose of the class)",
                "Strengths: Consistent practice of skills meant that exam expectations were very clearly laid out, and the lectures themselves were supplemented with lots of examples to help with ear training\r\nWeaknesses: The course itself didn't seem to have much structure; instead, every lecture seemed stand alone rather than building",
                "The course is meant to develop skills (not necessarily learn content) but there is not enough practice/repetition in order to get that much stronger over the course of the semester.",
                "Definitely felt at times like I was walking into class for an hour of sight-singing practice every day without much of a long-term goal or direction in mind. That said, if your goal is improving at sight-singing, this class does the job (provided you make an effort to do so).",
                "The strengths were that it was taught by doing rather than reading. However, one weakness was that there was no text to reference.",
                "strengths: minimal workload, lots of opportunities to practice skills in section and in class, supportive and welcoming environment, student participation and input encouraged, Class was usually fun and a nice break from more \"serious\" classes\r\n\r\nweakness: as discussed below, feedback on performance was lacking. also, having 30-minute sections on separate days from when class took place meant lots of walking for just a 30 minute music theory discussion section. I think having the sections before and after each music theory class could fix this issue.",
                "This course was very good for improving skills with repetitions and building nuance onto existing understanding, but it does not teach much concrete knowledge. This is a skills-based course. As such, depending on a student's baseline skill level, they may get more or less out of this course.",
                "The course does a good job of providing practice for improving aural skills. The theoretical portion of the class was not covered in depth unless a student asked during section, and perhaps it would be helpful to go over more theory during class.",
                "The course I would say is very accessible and really teaches you the basics of sight-singing and how to dictate the music. Depending on your background, the class is really what you make out of it.",
                "This class is a great chilled out class to take to satisfy a humanities credit. Professor Adam is a very interesting lecturer and sections were very engaging.",

Keep in mind that with discussion section it will end up meeting 3x per week (2 lectures and a short section), but the workload is very low. If you are either extremely experienced with ear training or have no experience at all, this might not be the best fit content-wise. But other than those extremes, I think the course was a great fit for a wide range of people.",
                "Yes-I would recommend this course to any student with a weak music theory background, especially if they've played an instrument and can read treble and bass clef comfortably but never had any formal music theory instruction",
                "Perfect choice for co-req for lessons for credit.",
                "It's an easy credit/theory class to take on the side if you're doing lessons for credit. My only warning is that you definitely feel that you are perpetually behind the sizable portion of the class with perfect pitch, but I wouldn't worry too much about this.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes! I would highly recommend to anyone (especially musicians) wanting to learn solfege and improve their relative pitch.",
                "Yes, this is a great course to take, especially if you were looking for a music theory class to take with lessons for credit. However, while the workload is light, this course is very skills-based. Therefore, you should consider if you are confident in your ability to develop dictation and sight-singing skills before deciding to take this class. There will be lots of support and practice along the way to help you develop these skills, but I think it takes more work for some people compared to others.",
                "Yes, this was a fun and interesting course that students at many musical skill levels can enjoy.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, with the caveat that it requires pretty extensive prior knowledge and the ability to sing in tune (tone is unimportant).",
                "Yes, I learned to sight-sing and overall improved my musicianship and composition.",
                "This is a wonderful and laid-back class that helps you relax a few times a week. I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who needs a class that is enjoyable but doesn't give the sort of workload other classes on their schedule will.",
                "Yes, if sharpening of aural skills is something of high importance to your musical skills, I would recommend the course"
