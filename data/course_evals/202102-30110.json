They were a bit dry and the prof was a bit rambly, but overall they were decently interesting and understandable. It might just be that the lectures just throw a lot of information at you and then there are long student presentations about research papers that come after and it's just a lot to focus through.",
                "Very informative and entertaining! The pacing was fast but doable, the lecture content was great. I liked the lectures on special topics (Covid and cancer...). The clear feedback on everyone's presentation was definitely a plus. My only issue was that I wish I had been able to see what questions I got wrong on the test, but maybe we're not allowed to see them because questions are reused or something. That's really the only weakness I can think of though!",
                "Prof. Wolenski is the strength.",
                "Strengths of the course include the detailed lectures. The opportunity to give and listen to student job talks is also a strength. Weaknesses include the design of the exams. The course could be improved by making the exams short answer instead of multiple choice and if the papers for the job talk were provided as study materials prior to the talk (could also help with studying for job talk questions on the exam).",
                "The course is just information. I do wish there was more than one lab technique lecture. Saying \"guys there's going to be a low stakes problem tomorrow morning on today's lecture so make sure you review it again before tomorrow\" could have really prolonged how long this knowledge lasts in our brain."

                "Definitely! This course is much more engaging and fun than the intro bio sequence, and goes into a lot more detail with fascinating relevant examples.  Nightly reading can seem a bit overbearing, but all the material is very fascinating. The two presentations throughout the semester let you do a lot of deep research on whatever topic interests you... What can I say? I just thought it was fun!",
                "Yes. Professor Wolenski is an amazing lecturer and having him in a small, seminar-like setting makes it 100% worth it. For such a notoriously dense course, covering all the material of Cell Bio in 5 weeks is difficult, but the class did so without feeling too overwhelming.",
                "I would recommend this course, because you learn many essential concepts in cell biology and it is well taught.",
