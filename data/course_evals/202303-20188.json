                "Strengths: The class was very focused on giving us the tools to succeed in the film industry as screenwriters. The combination of tools for screenwriting and tips for navigating the industry that we were taught was really helpful. Hearing from many professional screenwriters (including Prof Dewan!) about their own experiences in the field was so valuable and eye-opening. The fact that we were able to come up with our original feature-length film ideas, write out full scene-by-scene outlines, and write a quarter out fully was really incredible but also challenging. Weaknesses: it would have been great to have more classtime! It felt like there was so much we were being taught and we didn't necessarily have enough time for all of it."
