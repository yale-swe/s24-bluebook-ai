                "I gained knowledge about taking an alternate point of view in explaining how evolution has impacted human society and biology today.",
                "This course was fantastic! I'm a non-STEM major that historically has not enjoyed much science, but this course was so incredible. I would highly recommend to anyone; the course smoothly engages anthropology and the sciences with social sciences and history. The focus on life history theory was really interesting, and is certainly something I'll take forward with me. This course provides such a comprehensive, but digestible, understanding of so many topics that I hadn't been familiar with in scientific contexts. The scientific readings, while sometimes daunting, were also super interesting. Professor Bribiescas is also an incredible lecturer and made the course highly engaging.",

This class was also a great introduction to the diversity and similarity of humans as a species, as we discussed many different types of populations while also comparing human evolution to that of other animals.",
                "This was the best science course I have taken at Yale. I learned so much about what makes humans unique and our evolutionary history. I was especially intrigued by how much reproduction and reproductive efforts factor into our overall life history cycle. I also learned a lot about how to read journal articles effectively and how scientific fields of study develop over time. Professor Bribiescas is an excellent and passionate instructor.",

                "strengths: great professor, great lectures, organized\r\nweaknesses: the TAs, varying difficulty of psets to exams, no grading curve",
                "This course was not very well structured, and I feel like it was difficult to remain engaged in the content.",
                "For a science gut, this course is a lot of time and somewhat challenging. It is not facilitated well to be accessible and often included triggering content with no sensitivity towards students' needs. However, the Professor does know a lot and taught a lot of important and interesting things.",
                "Strengths: low workload (3 in-class midterms, weekly problem sets based on readings), progressively more lenient grading, interesting topic, good lecturer in Prof. Bribiescas. You literally discuss the answers to the PSets in section. Weaknesses: sometimes the lectures felt a little dry, not super high class engagement, lots of people just taking it for a science credit.",
                "Strengths: The professor is kind, the topics are mostly relevant to our lives \r\nWeaknesses: 75 minutes were too long for this lecture, 50 would have been better for me to digest the content",
                "Content is very interesting! Exams I felt like exams were graded harshly.",
                "Bribiescas is a great lecturer, the problem sets are easy and the TFs are very nice. Grade cutoffs are pretty high, but the content is very interesting and manageable.",
                "Strengths: good lectures, interesting material, reasonable workload, interesting articles\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture notes are not very useful",
                "The teacher is so passionate and cute but it is pretty boring",
                "Strengths: set up well for non-STEM student learning i think, but Still requires effort. TAs are a strength",
                "I really regret taking most of the lectures online, and I really don't think the option should be available. Prof. Briebiescas is a great lecturer, super passionate about the material, and the content is about humans! Barring a real accessibility issue, I think it should be in-person lectures only.",
                "I thought the midterm exams did fairly evaluate our knowledge of the content. I think it would have been fun to have a final paper or midterm paper to engage deeply with a subject/idea from the course. This class poses larger questions that couldn't have been answered during a short exam.",
                "This course could be improved by making better-annotated versions of the slides.",
                "The lectures were highly engaging, the information was really interesting (even for non-STEM majors!), and the problem sets were manageable. I think there could have been a little bit more support before the midterms to help review the content because there is a lot!",
                "Strengths: the topic is interesting. Weakness: the professor was not very accommodating and it seemed that rather to actually try to test our knowledge on the exams, questions were placed on topics that were not very central to the focus of the lectures or even the class as a whole.",
                "Professor Bribiescas was a great lecturer and clearly outstanding in his field. So, while the lectures were engaging, the parts of the course run by the teaching fellows were incredibly lackluster and disorganized. To improve, I would encourage Professor Bribiescas to try to select better TFs when administering his course in the future.",
                "the tests were pretty hard and the problem sets weren't as hard.",
                "The course is good, but the content isnt taught in a manner thats very engaging. The lectures are often boring and the information we need to know is not very clear most of the time. More structure and obvious marks of what we need to know and what we dont need to know would be helpful in the lectures.",
                "Strengths: interesting content",
                "Strengths \r\n-Material is very interesting and it is well taught \r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n-Exams sometimes focus on very specific things",
                "Strengths: excellent lectures and great content. Super interesting. \r\n\r\nWeakness: lots of content on exams",
                "I think that having 3 midterms as almost the entire makeup of our grades was intense and I wish the course gave a little more guidance for the exams which were challenging and covered a lot of topics. I thought the lectures were engaging and the material was fascinating.",
                "-Engaging content\r\n-Prof. Briebiescas is a warm person and an extremely engaging lecturer\r\n-Course is well structured\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-None! This was a fantastic course",
                "One strength is that the course material is set up very well, in that each topic expands on the previous week's topic in a precise manner. \r\n\r\nA couple of weaknesses of the course include the toughness of the midterm exams, and the little guidance or preparation that the course instructors and TFs provide.",
                "This course is an interesting, fairly low course load science credit. It's not really a gut, but it's not a huge course load, especially if you actually show up to class. Rick is an engaging lecturer, even if it's sometimes hard to tell which concepts are really important in his lectures.",
                "Strengths: very interesting lectures and subject material, discussion sections are very useful for understanding readings and problem sets. Weaknesses: it's not always clear what parts of the lecture content will be assessed; there's a lot of anatomy and other technical material covered about various bodily systems that was not tested at all and didn't feel very relevant to the rest of the course.",
                "This course has clearly been well-refined over the years and thus has very few weaknesses. The teaching fellows are knowledgeable and helpful, Professor Bribiescas is passionate, engaging, and knows what he is talking about, the pacing is perfect, the flow of the course is logical, etc. The only really problem was the recorded lecture quality because it was difficult to study because the slides don't have a lot of info on them, but this was fixed during the semester and honestly wasn't that big a deal anyway because we had our notes. Overall an excellent course.",
                "I think a midterm should be able to be dropped and there should be a final",
                "The strengths of this course revolved around Professor Bribiescas who is unbelievably passionate, knowledgable, and a wonderful lecturer on this topic. He is outstanding.",
                "Strengths: lectures were engaging\r\nWeakness: the exams tested for very specific questions/concepts",
                "Strengths: Clear, engaging, great lecturer, accessible TFs, manageable homework & clear PSETS, overall not the guttiest science ever but clear & approachable for anyone interested in the topic or who just wants a science credit that is manageable but you will actually learn something\r\nWeaknesses: the 3 test grading system was stressful without a curve or extra credit. The exams were a bit difficult & less flexible via grading than expected. I wish there was more flexibility/options to boost grades.",
                "Strength: course content was dense with examples and there were many opportunities to ask questions for clarity. Weakness: it is a long lecture, so even if it's interesting it can be easy to zone out by the end."

                "I would not recommend this course to another student because I feel as though the class had a heavy workload that was not made easier by attending the lecture. If someone is looking for a class where the entire course is readings that are irrelevant to the lectures, this may be a good class.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you have Vicky as your TA. There are easier science guts out there that do not involve fighting with administration about your wellbeing or about fair grading.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this for someone looking for an easier science credit. The material is generally pretty interesting and easy to conceptualize. The workload is super manageable and grading gets more lenient as the semester progresses. In section you go over the answers to the PSets and there is no work to do after the last week of classes. Professor Bribiescas is a good lecturer and tries his best to make the class interesting.",
                "Sure, for a science credit. The course content was relatively interesting.",
                "Yes! It is very accessible to non-stem majors and you learn a lot!",
                "Yes! This is a great science credit. The content is super interesting and the lectures are very engaging. The exams are very fair and there is a lot of support for the problem sets. I would definitely recommend this class.",
                "It is an interesting course, so if you have a strong background in science, I would definitely recommend it. However, if that is not the case, I would warn that the lecture notes are not the most helpful, and there is a bit of a learning curve.",
                "Yes!!! Very much so",
                "Yes but only because there are not many other science credits that are manageable",
                "Yes, be ready to memorize the content but I did really enjoy the course. Non-painful science credit",
                "Yes! This was a great introductory course in anthropology.",
                "Yes as it is an interesting course that provides engaging material applicable to many other areas of research.",
                "I would highly highly recommend! I don't take many science classes as a history major, but this one was accessible and interesting. Professor Bribiescas is also very knowledgeable, is an exceptional lecturer, and intentionally takes an interdisciplinary approach. The midterms can get tricky sometimes because there is a lot of content to work with, but I found it to be fairly reasonable. This was a lovely class, and a lot of the stuff I learned will stick with me!",
                "Very difficult and at the end I felt that my takeaways as a student were minimal because the entire semester felt like an uphill battle to gauge the material.",
                "I would probably recommend that other students avoid this course. This is disappointing because I really enjoyed Prof. Bribiescas and his teaching, but the disorganization of the TF team really left me feeling unfulfilled and upset with the course as a whole. When I tried to dive deeper into the material in our small-group sections, almost none of my questions were answered by my TF. I understand that they, too, are students, but it's difficult to feel like I am engaging with a course and getting a lot out of it when even very simple questions were met with non-answers.",
                "Only if you like this kind of stuff.",
                "If youre looking for a science gut, Im sure there are better choices, but this is not a bad one.",
                "Yes, good science credit for humanities majors",
                "I love this class and would highly recommend it to any peer.",
                "Absolutely! Great way to use your science credit on a very interesting topic",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student, unless they are taking it Cr/D. The exams were a bit challenging and I felt misguided without having a study guide provided.",
                "Sure, especially if they're in a humanities-adjacent field and looking for a science credit that will teach them a few things without being overbearing in terms of workload.",
                "Yes, this is a very interesting science credit that teaches a lot about human nature without being overly technical or difficult to understand.",
                "Please do not take this course for a science gut. The content gets much more difficult after the first unit exam. There is a significant amount of content to learn and the test questions are sometimes only distantly related to the material covered in class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Lectures are engaging and well-formatted. The content is genuinely intriguing. The professor and teaching fellows are great. And if you just pay attention and go to section, you will succeed.",
                "Yes but a practice test should be provided so they know what to expect from the get go",
                "I would if you want to gain an understanding of life history and biological anthropology",
                "Yes absolutely",
                "Yes! It is not the easiest gut science ever but it is interesting, engaging, and definitely manageable if you study for exams. Concepts tend to be broad and require no math/super specific terminology so anyone is able to approach the class on even feet. Again the tests/grading is not easiest ever, but as a humanities student this was a good science credit to take.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in biology on a broader scale than the cellular level, it's a really cool class. If you're not interested in the content though, it's a lot to memorize, and you can't just guess on the exams so you'll have to put in the hours studying."
