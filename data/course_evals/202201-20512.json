My goodness how to put it all in words.\r\n\r\nThe obvious, first, then:\r\n\r\nI'd known nothing about ML coming in, and I feel like I'm not a reasonably educated consumer of it, and I'm not scared of running my own. I also gained a lot of confidence in my ability TO code something difficult. I hadn't had such challenging coding problems before, so the practice of working through step-by-step in the homework was invaluable.\r\n\r\nI'd come in with an economics background but had never learned formally the Rubin causal model; I've found it extremely helpful as a jumping point when critiquing research in my field. Similarly, permutation inference as a tool was very helpful to learn.\r\n\r\nI hadn't used PSM before (economists are pretty skeptical of it, I think largely because most economics studies lack the identifying assumptions to make it a valid tool for inference), but I can see the merits and a lot of other fields use it commonly, so I was happy to have learned it.\r\n\r\nI also came in without having met one of the requirements (the last time I'd used R was 2012...), but was familiar with Matlab and Stata so thought I'd be able to handle it. The first homework was rough, but that really helped the learning curve.\r\n\r\nSo in terms of skills: a wonderful incentive to learn me a coding language that many people with whom I'm interested in collaborating use.\r\n\r\nIn terms of insights, I feel like this course really brought together a lot of what I'd learned before in a vague way, and made it concrete in my mind. I now feel like a lot of the tools that get tossed around in economics seminars are ones I actually possess and can use fairly confidently (e.g. code-your-own bootstrap).",

                "The causal inference portion of this course is excellent: Jas is a leading researcher in the field and his knowledge of the material is incredibly deep and nuanced. This is why you come to Yale! \r\n\r\nThat being said, I think there needs to be some serious reflection on the teaching in this course. The course is very fast-paced and difficult material-wise, but it often feels as if you have little or no support. For example, although Jas holds weekly one-on-one office hours, you will feel belittled and put down by his answers, no matter how hard you try to understand the material. There were definitely many times throughout the semester where Jas' responses made me feel stupid and humiliated to the point that I questioned whether or not I was cut out to be in the course [and even the major]. Jas even bragged about how many students dropped the course numerous times throughout the courseit was as if he was rooting for us to fail.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I would highly recommend anyone considering taking this course to have a solid group of friends with whom they can work on the homework assignments.",
                "Strengths: Cover the important topics about causal inference and ML\r\n\r\nWeakness: The class focuses more on examples and doesn't offer many clear explanations about the theory, which puts a significant amount of pressure on after-class self-learning. Also the slides are a little hard to follow.",

                "Strengths: the course comprehensively covers the foundation of causal inference before moving into machine learning methods that estimate causal effects.\r\nWeaknesses: The psets were worded somewhat ambiguously, though that may have been purposeful in order to help us learn. More office hours per week would have been useful as well.",

                "An in-person course would have been helpful",
                "While the material is interesting in theory, the class overall is quite badly taught. The attitudes of the lecturer and graduate teaching staff were actively hostile towards questions and often made students feel belittled for not knowing material that wasnt well taught in the first place. Lectures were disorganized and didnt cover content necessary to complete problem sets that often had typos and lacked clarity. Jas clearly prefers having students who have high levels of understanding in his class but has no tolerance for any variation in skill level. Also, different office hours sessions would give different answers to the same questions frequently, emphasizing the lack of clarity in teaching. I would stay clear from this course, as it rushes both the causal inference and machine learning portions, leading to not really knowing how to do either well, unless you have a background in both. The problem sets and exams reflected a level of material that far surpassed what was taught in class, and it felt like we had no resources or support to bridge this gap. Additionally, lots of course material is directly related to Jas own research, meaning there are no external resources to consult.",
                "It's hard.",

                "Strengths: Reasonable amount of work that all facilitated learning. Pset weren't busy work and helped learn the material. Professor was very open to questions and very responsive to questions over Ed Discussion. Great balance of theory and application for the two halves of the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was all online; we've moved on from online classes",
                "Strengths: it really forces us to learn independently as we struggle with all those homeworks, but Jas's lectures complement the readings nicely and pull out the important aspects.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought this course was nigh perfect. I've been describing it as \"killing me sweetly.\" The homework does take a long time, but it's clear from the outset that it's going to require a lot of effort, and I think students can figure it out and self-select.",
                "I liked how the instructors facilitated setting up homework groups",
                "Too difficult",
                "The material in the course is really useful, but it would be really helpful if the professor could give more concrete examples in his lecture in stead of talking only about conceptual things.",
                "Very bad course. Don't take. Unclear structure. Unclear homework. Unclear teaching.",
                "strengths great solid intro and theoretical, applied, and computational at the same time. weakness: it was a lot because of that, wish it was a little less intense.",
                "Jas is a very effective lecturer, and explains things well and clearly by and large. The homework assignments are certainly engaging and challenging, and the study groups were really helpful in tacking the problem sets.\r\n\r\nI think the course could spend much more time right at the beginning of the course giving an overview of what causal inference and machine learning are, what they're used for, etc, before diving into the details. I definitely met the prereqs for the course but had never learned what causal inference was before, and only knew machine learning from news articles and Youtube videos, so a little framing of the big picture would have been helpful.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of pre-reqs, Jas has a tendency to respond negatively when someone asks a question about material covered in prerequisite courses. This could be greatly improved upon. Nobody remembers 100% of what has been covered in pre-requisite courses, so replying to straightforward student questions about pre-requisite content with statements like \"that's something you should know from the pre-requisites, so if you don't you should consider whether you're ready for this course\" (a paraphrase from one of the first few lectures) is damaging. It discourages students from asking questions, for fear that they too will feel belittled for something they may have learned and forgot. It directly discourages students from learning because Jas goes out of his way to avoid refreshing our memories on those topics (the student asking the question is almost certainly not the only one who forgot about some material from some semesters or years ago). And it also just sets a negative tone between Jas as the students. Jas can and should respond with a brief explanation refreshing our memories and leave it at that. Once he's told us once in the first lecture what the pre-reqs are and that we should make sure we meet them, there's no need to re-state them every time someone asks a question about content that may be covered in a previous class.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think the course could be improved by spending much more time in lecture talking about how to actually implement some of the machine learning algorithms in R. Even just having a list of R libraries and functions that are commonly used to implement them in the slides, although it would also be helpful to dig in a little more depth on what arguments to pass to the most-common functions. The multivariate stats class taught by Jonathan Reuning-Scherer here does this exceptionally well, for instance. This would help greatly decrease the amount of time that we spend on the problem sets, since often the first half of it is just googling around or reading the class forum just to figure out what R package we should be reading the documentation for in the first place. It would also really help us actually learn best practices for implementation of machine learning, rather than just the concepts of how these things are implemented.",
                "Material is very well presented (slide decks are great). Homeworks were laborious but effective--my difficulty with them is probably related to my pre-requisites being a little stale (old). Grading was generous and material was very well presented.",
                "This course is awesome. Causal inference is a relatively new subject, and sometimes I was so confused during the process of learning. However, TAs are very helpful, most problems could be solved.",
