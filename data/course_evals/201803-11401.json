    "This course teaches students how to become independent in their studies and time a management. The entirety of the project rests upon you own shoulders and you have to take responsibility in order to make sure you complete the thesis on time and that it is written well.",
    "The workshops were productive and fun.  Getting feedback from fellow art history majors provided new insights and hearing about other theses was enjoyable.",
    "There were 2 workshops and a colloquium. The workshops were a nice though; not sure how helpful they were (or how much help one can really get in short amounts of time). The workshops were most helpful insofar as they forced us to get certain things done (write a proposal by this date; write an intro by this date).",
    "I thought that the deadlines were very helpful in keeping me on track for the senior essay deadline--especially the full draft due before Thanksgiving. That kept me from doing all of the work at the last minute, and made the editing process much more productive and enjoyable, which I really appreciated."
