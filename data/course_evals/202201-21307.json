                "The course is pleasurable and easy. The explanations are interesting, but I found the analyses to be kind of superficial and basic. Also, there's a discussion section that is not advertised but it's not mandatory to go. The papers are fun and creative but the grading is not consistent among the professor and the TA.",
                "I really dislike that this class had a midterm exam. It did not really feel conducive to learning at all. The reading list is good. The other thing I disliked was that there was like a surprise section that met at a really inconvenient time. It wasnt mentioned until add/drop was over, and that felt kind of deceptive.",
                "The class does not need 5 separate assignments. 3 small papers, midterm exam, final paper.",
                "Strengths: gives a great overview of Spanish literature and literary movements, Professor Valis is a wonderful and kind professor, very reasonable amount of reading assigned for each class and fairly easy writing assignments\r\nWeaknesses: really hard to stay engaged and to pay attention during class, class structure was very repetitive, intimidating to participate/not always encouraged and welcomed to make mistakes when speaking due to the large number of native Spanish speakers in the class dominating the discussion, the class moves incredibly quickly through each text so it's hard to get a really deep analysis of each one",
                "Strengths: interesting and manageable readings, pretty light workload, professor is very engaged\r\nWeaknesses: think class is a little too big  weird intermediary between seminar and lecture makes it easier to zone out. Some lack of clarity about assignments",
                "This course does an excellent job of covering a lot of ground without ever overwhelming the students. The readings were universally excellent and the class was well set up to facilitate discussion.",
                "Strengths: The readings are relatively short (can definitely be completed during the time allowed), which gives you time to more deeply analyze the texts. This seminar also works good in both small and big groups.",
                "strengths: great professor, interesting readings\r\nweaknesses: the class was a little too big to be a seminar but too small to really be a lecture so it felt really awkward to participate sometimes",
                "The professor is very knowledgeable on the subject, but the class is not very engaging.",
                "The class could get a bit dull at times.",
                "This course moved through a lot of literature and we were able to discuss many different eras and authors. Professor Valis is very passionate about the material and brings that enthusiasm to the class.",
                "Strength: Professor Valis. Professor Valis is an incredible professor: super kind, always available to her students, and infinitely knowledgeable about the course material. She has so many insights to share with students about the class. The literature is also incredibly interesting and beautiful. We read so many thought-provoking and moving stories, poems, and plays that I would not have discovered nor appreciated otherwise. The poetry has especially stuck with me since the class ended. Weaknesses: There is little guidance in terms of developing writing skills in Spanish during the class. Although this is not the class's focus, I would have appreciated spending even a little bit of time on this topic, given that the final is an extensive analytical paper. I would have loved to have attended the section for this class, but it was unfortunately during the middle of the day when I had another class scheduled. I would have preferred if the section were scheduled for a time when more students (including myself) could have been available.",

                "the evaluation of this course really depends on your level of comfort and fluency with spanish. if you are not fluent, it's probably a very challenging course but if you feel totally fine speaking in spanish about literature and writing about it, it's an easy course and you learn about spanish literary authors and spanish identity formation. I would not take it if you expect a very stimulating and eye-opening course.",
                "yes. fun way to learn about spain's literature, the professor knows a lot, and assignments are fun to do. probably would not recommend for literature students, as it is more of an intro course or global idea of literature.",
                "Probably not. Professor Valis is absolutely wonderful, but I didn't find the course to be that engaging. It is structured as a strange lecture-seminar, where Professor Valis will talk about a text and give background on it, and then ask a couple questions to the class for discussion but still kind of be lecturing. I found it pretty difficult and intimidating to participate because the class was majority fluent and native Spanish-speakers who dominated the discussion, so I would really only recommend this course if you are fluent in Spanish or are very, very confident in your speaking abilities. Most of the readings are also difficult and time-consuming if you really try to take the time and understand and analyze them on your own before class. I started the semester with a high-level of engagement during class and with the readings but quickly found that my energy and time was going to waste because I was unable to participate in class despite my desire to, so I stopped giving the readings much energy. The only nice thing about the course is that the midterm was straight-forward, and the short writing assignments were very easy. The final 8-paged paper was absolutely brutal, though",
                "Not really  this class convinced me to drop the Spanish certificate because its not super interesting. Wish I had been more engaged but most students are clearly zoning out during discussions so it ends up being a seminar discussion among the same 5-10 people. Some sessions at the beginning of the semester provided very interesting historical and political context but by the end it felt a little less nuanced.",
                "I would unreservedly recommend this course to another student. It is an excellent course that is excellently taught.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. The readings are interesting and the essay prompts are actually fun to write out.",
                "yes! fun, interesting, and very manageable. i loved hearing what prof valis had to say about the texts we were reading.",
                "If you like literature and you are fluent in Spanish, then I highly recommend this class. However, if you're like me, and 18th century literature doesn't really appeal to you, then I would not recommend this class for a language credit.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in the material.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in Spanish literature and are willing to participate in class, because that makes it so much more fun.",
