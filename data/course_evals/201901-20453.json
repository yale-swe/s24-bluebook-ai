    "I learned how to approach capitalism, not as an economic system or political ideology, but as a nuanced, varied, lived experience by everyday people. I certainly did not learn what capitalism \"is\" or come to a consensus on how capitalism should be reformed or abolished, but I learned to become comfortable with that lack of definitive understanding. I also learned how to apply methods of anthropology to an ethnographic project related to capitalism.",
    "This was my first anthropology course, so I learned a lot about an entirely new discipline. Taking an anthropological approach to capitalism is super interesting as it allows you to examine larger power structures and the lived experiences of people affected.",
    "This class makes you analyze and critique capitalism as it manifests in your everyday life, as well as in the lives of the people in the ethnographies you read. It makes you think about capitalism not as a cohesive force, but as a network or series of complex relationships and connections.",
    "Understanding of literature around capitalism and socialism. What an ethnography is, its uses. Different important ethnographies.",
    "Learned a new way of analyzing social structure that engages with the narrative-shaping power of capital C Capitalism.",
    "I referred to this course as a lifestyle course on the last day. I think this course provided me with a nice vocabulary to talk about capitalism and also a vocabulary that pinpoints the way that we specifically talk about capitalism. It also taught me to critique the happenings I excuse because they, seemingly, fall under the \"everyday.\"",
    "I learned how to read and analyze ethnographies and the beginnings of conducting my own ethnographical research. I also learned a lot about how people think about capitalism and the many ways in which people try to define it, and how anthropology can be used to understand it better.",
    "I think capitalism has become more unwieldy in its definition since taking this course. I struggled with the distinction between defining capitalism so that we de-naturalise it yet also not defining to take away from its power. But the idea of making capitalism more complex is a good takeaway from this class! \r\n\r\nThe ethnographies we read were fantastic and important, and the topics we covered were broad. This was the first class in which I have done an ethnography project and I am glad about how meticulous we were on the methodology - although I had qualms about the project itself and problems this posed for the New Haven-Yale relationship."

   "comments": [
    "This course is truly excellent. A major strength is Professor Rogers's skill in facilitating seminar discussion. This was definitely the best seminar experience I've had at Yale, where I felt able to contribute and there was just the right amount of guidance of the conversation. The readings were also really interesting and applicable to work far beyond the scope of the class.",
    "The biggest strength is that the readings are always fair and manageable. Professor Rogers, at various points during the course, claimed that his class should \"only take 1\/4th or 1\/5th of your total time\", which made for manageable (though perhaps not always easy) readings. As a sophomore seminar, expectations were maybe a bit different, though certainly still high. I can't think of any weaknesses for the course.",
    "Harsh grading, not a lot of consistent feedback. Great conversation and debate in class, learned a lot from classmates.",
    "Great overview of perspectives and thought. Would have loved to see more critical race\/gender theory incorporated, especially about the rise of racial capitalism. Also more on commons would have been nice. Very lovely course.",
    "This course wasn't what I expected but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Maybe more texts touching on socialism\/\/alternatives to capitalism.",
    "This course did an incredible job of encouraging discussion and critical thinking, voicing opinions and accurately interpreting anthropologists' arguments. I felt very well prepared for the final project by way of everything we had read and talked about throughout the semester. There is a very fair amount of work, all of which felt relevant and I found interesting.",
    "Strengths: Prof Rogers is a wonderful person and instructor. We covered a lot of material of varying natures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes class discussion was too broad and I felt like people were contributing for the sake of it. would have liked a little more \"technical\", maybe even market-logic pieces to challenge us humanities majors."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was thought-provoking, interesting, and not an overly burdensome workload.",
    "Yes! A sophomore seminar is really a great opportunity to learn and exchange ideas with people on your level. With something like the anthropology of capitalism, no one really comes in an expert, and learning and grasping ideas together is a growth experience. You will get the most out of it if you really engage with the reading; it can be a lot, but it will be worth it. DJR is an incredible instructor and does a good job balancing directing discussion and letting it flow. Ending the semester with an ethnography of one's own is a lot of fun, and it teaches you to pay attention to the significance of features of the community in which you live in a new way. Overall, truly a strong learning experience.",
    "Yes! The readings are all super interesting and will change how you think about the world. The group project at the end allows you to apply all the theory you've been learning in an exciting way and doing it with a group is a gratifying experience.",
    "Yes. This course really provides some good tools with which to think about \"capitalism\", something that every Yale student should engage with before graduation. Take this class.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student, even if they've never been exposed to anthropology as a discipline. Few people in the seminar had been, but they didn't seem to be significantly better off in the course than those who hadn't been. This is an especially good course for people considering going into finance\/consulting, as it makes you cognizant of capitalism's influence over everyone's lives.",
    "Yes? Depends on whether you're willing to do all the readings and all the work. Class is heavy on discussion.",
    "Yes! Take it alongside more conceptual\/abstract social science. Great pairing.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Rogers is amazing, intelligent, and presents the information in a way that encourages real discussion.",
    "I would recommend this course to other sophomores. It's a very rare opportunity, I think! Seminars can be very stressful and it's very comforting knowing that everyone else in this class is [probably] relatively new to seminar culture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all Yale students. It forces you to think more about how we talk about capitalism and the ways in which we are all involved in various aspects of capitalism but how it cannot be boiled down to just one clear definition. It also is a great introduction to the field of anthropology in general and a good mix of scholarly articles and ethnographies.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to understand capitalism's nature in relation to human experiences. It is interesting, the work is not too intense and Prof Rogers is warm."
